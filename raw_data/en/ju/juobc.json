It is able to generate an enormous variety of cells andmolecules capable of specifically recognizing and eliminat-ing an apparently limitless variety of foreign invaders. Thesecells and molecules act together in a dynamic network whosecomplexity rivals that of the nervous system. Functionally, an immune response can be divided into two related activities\u2014recognition and response. Immunerecognition is remarkable for its specificity. The immunesystem is able to recognize subtle chemical differences thatdistinguish one foreign pathogen from another. Further-more, the system is able to discriminate between foreignmolecules and the body's own cells and proteins. Once a for-eign organism has been recognized, the immune systemrecruits a variety of cells and molecules to mount an appro-priate response, called an effector response, to eliminate or neutralize the organism. In this way the system is able toconvert the initial recognition event into a variety of effectorresponses, each uniquely suited for eliminating a particulartype of pathogen. Later exposure to the same foreign organ-ism induces a memory response, characterized by a more rapid and heightened immune reaction that serves to elimi-nate the pathogen and prevent disease. This chapter introduces the study of immunology from an historical perspective and presents a broad overview ofthe cells and molecules that compose the immune system,along with the mechanisms they use to protect the bodyagainst foreign invaders. Evidence for the presence of verysimple immune systems in certain invertebrate organismsthen gives an evolutionary perspective on the mammalianimmune system, which is the major subject of this book. El-ements of the primitive immune system persist in verte-brates as innate immunity along with a more highly evolved system of specific responses termed adaptive immunity . These two systems work in concert to provide a high degreeof protection for vertebrate species. Finally, in some circum-stances, the immune system fails to act as protector becauseof some deficiency in its components; at other times, it be-comes an aggressor and turns its awesome powers against itsown host. In this introductory chapter, our description ofimmunity is simplified to reveal the essential structures andfunction of the immune system. Substantive discussions, ex-perimental approaches, and in-depth definitions are left tothe chapters that follow.Like the later chapters covering basic topics in immu- nology, this one includes a section called \"Clinical Focus\"that describes human disease and its relation to immunity.These sections investigate the causes, consequences, or treat-ments of diseases rooted in impaired or hyperactive immunefunction. Historical Perspective The discipline of immunology grew out of the observationthat individuals who had recovered from certain infectiousdiseases were thereafter protected from the disease. TheLatin term immunis, meaning \"exempt,\" is the source of the English word immunity, meaning the state of protectionfrom infectious disease. Perhaps the earliest written reference to the phenomenon of immunity can be traced back to Thucydides, the great his-torian of the Peloponnesian War. In describing a plague inAthens, he wrote in 430 BCthat only those who had recov- ered from the plague could nurse the sick because theywould not contract the disease a second time. Although earlysocieties recognized the phenomenon of immunity, almost8536d_ch01_001-023 8/1/02 4:25 PM Page 1 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW: Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:two thousand years passed before the concept was success- fully converted into medically effective practice. The first recorded attempts to induce immunity deliber- ately were performed by the Chinese and Turks in the fif- teenth century. Various reports suggest that the dried crusts derived from smallpox pustules were either inhaled into thenostrils or inserted into small cuts in the skin (a technique called variolation). In 1718, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British ambassador to Constantinople, observed the positive effects of variolation on the native population and had the technique performed on her own children. The method was significantly improved by the English physicianEdward Jenner, in 1798. Intrigued by the fact that milkmaidswho had contracted the mild disease cowpox were subse-quently immune to smallpox, which is a disfiguring and of- ten fatal disease, Jenner reasoned that introducing fluid froma cowpox pustule into people (i.e., inoculating them) mightprotect them from smallpox. T o test this idea, he inoculatedan eight-year-old boy with fluid from a cowpox pustule andlater intentionally infected the child with smallpox. As pre-dicted, the child did not develop smallpox. Jenner's technique of inoculating with cowpox to protect against smallpox spread quickly throughout Europe. How- ever, for many reasons, including a lack of obvious disease targets and knowledge of their causes, it was nearly a hun- dred years before this technique was applied to other dis- eases. As so often happens in science, serendipity incombination with astute observation led to the next majoradvance in immunology, the induction of immunity tocholera. Louis Pasteur had succeeded in growing the bac- terium thought to cause fowl cholera in culture and then had shown that chickens injected with the cultured bacterium de- veloped cholera. After returning from a summer vacation, he injected some chickens with an old culture. The chickens be-came ill, but, to Pasteur's surprise, they recovered. Pasteur then grew a fresh culture of the bacterium with the intention of injecting it into some fresh chickens. But, as the story goes,his supply of chickens was limited, and therefore he used thepreviously injected chickens. Again to his surprise, the chick-ens were completely protected from the disease. Pasteur hypothesized and proved that aging had weakened the viru-lence of the pathogen and that such an attenuated strainmight be administered to protect against the disease. Hecalled this attenuated strain a vaccine (from the Latin vacca , meaning \"cow\"), in honor of Jenner's work with cowpoxinoculation. Pasteur extended these findings to other diseases, demon- strating that it was possible to attenuate, or weaken, a pathogen and administer the attenuated strain as a vaccine.In a now classic experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort in 1881, Pas-teur first vaccinated one group of sheep with heat-attenuatedanthrax bacillus (Bacillus anthracis); he then challenged thevaccinated sheep and some unvaccinated sheep with a viru-lent culture of the bacillus. All the vaccinated sheep lived, andall the unvaccinated animals died. These experimentsmarked the beginnings of the discipline of immunology. In1885, Pasteur administered his first vaccine to a human, a young boy who had been bitten repeatedly by a rabid dog(Figure 1-1). The boy, Joseph Meister, was inoculated with aseries of attenuated rabies virus preparations. He lived andlater became a custodian at the Pasteur Institute. Early Studies Revealed Humoral and Cellular Components of the Immune System Although Pasteur proved that vaccination worked, he did not understand how. The experimental work of Emil vonBehring and Shibasaburo Kitasato in 1890 gave the first in- sights into the mechanism of immunity, earning von Behring the Nobel prize in medicine in 1901 (Table 1-1). Von Behringand Kitasato demonstrated that serum (the liquid, noncellu- lar component of coagulated blood) from animals previouslyimmunized to diphtheria could transfer the immune state to unimmunized animals. In search of the protective agent, var-ious researchers during the next decade demonstrated thatan active component from immune serum could neutralizetoxins, precipitate toxins, and agglutinate (clump) bacteria.In each case, the active agent was named for the activity it ex-hibited: antitoxin, precipitin, and agglutinin, respectively.2 PART I Introduction FIGURE 1-1Wood engraving of Louis Pasteur watching Joseph Meister receive the rabies vaccine.

The active moleculesin the immunoglobulin fraction are called antibodies. Be- cause immunity was mediated by antibodies contained inbody fluids (known at the time as humors), it was called hu-moral immunity. In 1883, even before the discovery that a serum compo- nent could transfer immunity, Elie Metchnikoff demon-strated that cells also contribute to the immune state of ananimal. He observed that certain white blood cells, which hetermed phagocytes, were able to ingest (phagocytose) mi- croorganisms and other foreign material. Noting that thesephagocytic cells were more active in animals that had beenimmunized, Metchnikoff hypothesized that cells, rather thanserum components, were the major effector of immunity.The active phagocytic cells identified by Metchnikoff werelikely blood monocytes and neutrophils (see Chapter 2).In due course, a controversy developed between those who held to the concept of humoral immunity and thosewho agreed with Metchnikoff's concept of cell-mediated im- munity. It was later shown that both are correct\u2014immunity requires both cellular and humoral responses. It was difficultto study the activities of immune cells before the develop-ment of modern tissue culture techniques, whereas studieswith serum took advantage of the ready availability of bloodand established biochemical techniques. Because of thesetechnical problems, information about cellular immunitylagged behind findings that concerned humoral immunity. In a key experiment in the 1940s, Merrill Chase succeeded in transferring immunity against the tuberculosis organismby transferring white blood cells between guinea pigs. Thisdemonstration helped to rekindle interest in cellular immu-nity. With the emergence of improved cell culture techniquesin the 1950s, the lymphocyte was identified as the cell re- sponsible for both cellular and humoral immunity. Soonthereafter, experiments with chickens pioneered by BruceGlick at Mississippi State University indicated that there wereOverview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 3 TABLE 1-1Nobel Prizes for immunologic research Year Recipient Country Research 1901 Emil von Behring Germany Serum antitoxins 1905 Robert Koch Germany Cellular immunity to tuberculosis 1908 Elie Metchnikoff Russia Role of phagocytosis (Metchnikoff) and Paul Ehrlich Germany antitoxins (Ehrlich) in immunity 1913 Charles Richet France Anaphylaxis 1919 Jules Border Belgium Complement-mediated bacteriolysis 1930 Karl Landsteiner United States Discovery of human blood groups 1951 Max Theiler South Africa Development of yellow fever vaccine 1957 Daniel Bovet Switzerland Antihistamines 1960 F.

The controversyabout the roles of humoral and cellular immunity was re-solved when the two systems were shown to be intertwined,and that both systems were necessary for the immuneresponse. Early Theories Attempted to Explain the Specificity of the Antibody-Antigen Interaction One of the greatest enigmas facing early immunologists was the specificity of the antibody molecule for foreign material,or antigen (the general term for a substance that binds with a specific antibody). Around 1900, Jules Bordet at the PasteurInstitute expanded the concept of immunity by demonstrat-ing specific immune reactivity to nonpathogenic substances,such as red blood cells from other species. Serum from an an-imal inoculated previously with material that did not causeinfection would react with this material in a specific manner,and this reactivity could be passed to other animals by trans-ferring serum from the first. The work of Karl Landsteinerand those who followed him showed that injecting an animalwith almost any organic chemical could induce productionof antibodies that would bind specifically to the chemical.These studies demonstrated that antibodies have a capacityfor an almost unlimited range of reactivity, including re-sponses to compounds that had only recently been synthe-sized in the laboratory and had not previously existed innature. In addition, it was shown that molecules differing inthe smallest detail could be distinguished by their reactivitywith different antibodies. Two major theories were proposedto account for this specificity: the selective theory and the in - structional theory. The earliest conception of the selective theory dates to Paul Ehrlich in 1900. In an attempt to explain the origin of serumantibody, Ehrlich proposed that cells in the blood expressed avariety of receptors, which he called \"side-chain receptors,\"that could react with infectious agents and inactivate them.Borrowing a concept used by Emil Fischer in 1894 to explainthe interaction between an enzyme and its substrate, Ehrlichproposed that binding of the receptor to an infectious agentwas like the fit between a lock and key. Ehrlich suggested thatinteraction between an infectious agent and a cell-boundreceptor would induce the cell to produce and release morereceptors with the same specificity. According to Ehrlich'stheory, the specificity of the receptor was determined beforeits exposure to antigen, and the antigen selected the appro-priate receptor. Ultimately all aspects of Ehrlich's theorywould be proven correct with the minor exception that the\"receptor\" exists as both a soluble antibody molecule and as acell-bound receptor; it is the soluble form that is secretedrather than the bound form released.In the 1930s and 1940s, the selective theory was chal- lenged by various instructional theories, in which antigen played a central role in determining the specificity of the an-tibody molecule. According to the instructional theories, aparticular antigen would serve as a template around whichantibody would fold. The antibody molecule would therebyassume a configuration complementary to that of the antigentemplate. This concept was first postulated by FriedrichBreinl and Felix Haurowitz about 1930 and redefined in the1940s in terms of protein folding by Linus Pauling. The in-structional theories were formally disproved in the 1960s, bywhich time information was emerging about the structure ofDNA, RNA, and protein that would offer new insights intothe vexing problem of how an individual could make anti-bodies against almost anything. In the 1950s, selective theories resurfaced as a result of new experimental data and, through the insights of NielsJerne, David Talmadge, and F. Macfarlane Burnet, were re-fined into a theory that came to be known as the clonal- selection theory. According to this theory, an individual lymphocyte expresses membrane receptors that are specificfor a distinct antigen. This unique receptor specificity is de-termined before the lymphocyte is exposed to the antigen.Binding of antigen to its specific receptor activates the cell,causing it to proliferate into a clone of cells that have thesame immunologic specificity as the parent cell. The clonal-selection theory has been further refined and is now acceptedas the underlying paradigm of modern immunology. The Immune System Includes Innate and Adaptive Components Immunity\u2014the state of protection from infectious disease \u2014has both a less specific and more specific component. Theless specific component, innate immunity, provides the first line of defense against infection. Most components of innateimmunity are present before the onset of infection and con-stitute a set of disease-resistance mechanisms that are notspecific to a particular pathogen but that include cellular andmolecular components that recognize classes of moleculespeculiar to frequently encountered pathogens. Phagocyticcells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, barriers such asskin, and a variety of antimicrobial compounds synthesizedby the host all play important roles in innate immunity. Incontrast to the broad reactivity of the innate immune sys-tem, which is uniform in all members of a species, the spe-cific component, adaptive immunity, does not come into play until there is an antigenic challenge to the organism.Adaptive immunity responds to the challenge with a high de-gree of specificity as well as the remarkable property of\"memory.\" Typically, there is an adaptive immune responseagainst an antigen within five or six days after the initial ex - posure to that antigen. Exposure to the same antigen sometime in the future results in a memory response: the immuneresponse to the second challenge occurs more quickly than4 PART I Introduction8536d_ch01_001-023 8/1/02 4:25 PM Page 4 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW: Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:the first, is stronger, and is often more effective in neutraliz- ing and clearing the pathogen. The major agents of adaptiveimmunity are lymphocytes and the antibodies and othermolecules they produce. Because adaptive immune responses require some time to marshal, innate immunity provides the first line of defenseduring the critical period just after the host's exposure to apathogen. In general, most of the microorganisms encoun-tered by a healthy individual are readily cleared within a fewdays by defense mechanisms of the innate immune systembefore they activate the adaptive immune system. Innate Immunity Innate immunity can be seen to comprise four types of de-fensive barriers: anatomic, physiologic, phagocytic, and in-flammatory (Table 1-2). The Skin and the Mucosal Surfaces Provide Protective Barriers Against Infection Physical and anatomic barriers that tend to prevent the entry of pathogens are an organism's first line of defense against in-fection. The skin and the surface of mucous membranes areincluded in this category because they are effective barriers t o the entry of most microorganisms. The skin consists of twodistinct layers: a thinner outer layer\u2014the epidermis \u2014and a thicker layer\u2014the dermis. The epidermis contains several layers of tightly packed epithelial cells. The outer epidermallayer consists of dead cells and is filled with a waterproofingprotein called keratin. The dermis, which is composed ofconnective tissue, contains blood vessels, hair follicles, seba-ceous glands, and sweat glands. The sebaceous glands are as-sociated with the hair follicles and produce an oily secretioncalled sebum. Sebum consists of lactic acid and fatty acids, which maintain the pH of the skin between 3 and 5; this pHinhibits the growth of most microorganisms. A few bacteriathat metabolize sebum live as commensals on the skin andsometimes cause a severe form of acne. One acne drug,isotretinoin (Accutane), is a vitamin A derivative that pre-vents the formation of sebum. Breaks in the skin resulting from scratches, wounds, or abrasion are obvious routes of infection. The skin may alsobe penetrated by biting insects (e.g., mosquitoes, mites, ticks,fleas, and sandflies); if these harbor pathogenic organisms,they can introduce the pathogen into the body as they feed.The protozoan that causes malaria, for example, is depositedin humans by mosquitoes when they take a blood meal. Sim-ilarly, bubonic plague is spread by the bite of fleas, and Lymedisease is spread by the bite of ticks. The conjunctivae and the alimentary, respiratory, and urogenital tracts are lined by mucous membranes, not by thedry, protective skin that covers the exterior of the body. TheseOverview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 5 TABLE 1-2Summary of nonspecific host defenses Type Mechanism Anatomic barriers Skin Mechanical barrier retards entry of microbes. Acidic environment (pH 3-5) retards growth of microbes. Mucous membranes Normal flora compete with microbes for attachme nt sites and nutrients. Mucus entraps foreign microorganisms.Cilia propel microorganisms out of body. Physiologic barriers Temperature Normal body temperature inhibits growth of some path ogens. Fever response inhibits growth of some pathogens. Low pH Acidity of stomach contents kills most ingested microorga nisms. Chemical mediators Lysozyme cleaves bacterial cell wall. Interferon induces antiviral state in uninfected cells.Complement lyses microorganisms or facilitates phagocytosis.Toll-like receptors recognize microbial molecules, signal cell to secrete immunostimulatory cytokines. Collectins disrupt cell wall of pathogen. Phagocytic/endocytic barriers Various cells internalize (endocytose) and break down foreign m acromolecules. Specialized cells (blood monocytes, neutrophils, tissue macroph ages) internalize (phagocytose), kill, and digest whole microorganisms. Inflammatory barriers Tissue damage and infection induce leakage of vascular fluid, c ontaining serum proteins with antibacterial activity, and influx of phagocytic cells into the affected area.8536d_ch01_001-023 8/1/02 4:25 PM Page 5 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW: Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:membranes consist of an outer epithelial layer and an under- lying layer of connective tissue. Although many pathogensenter the body by binding to and penetrating mucous mem-branes, a number of nonspecific defense mechanisms tend toprevent this entry. For example, saliva, tears, and mucous se-cretions act to wash away potential invaders and also containantibacterial or antiviral substances. The viscous fluid calledmucus, which is secreted by epithelial cells of mucous mem-branes, entraps foreign microorganisms. In the lower respi-ratory tract, the mucous membrane is covered by cilia, mucus-entrappedmicroorganisms from these tracts. In addition, nonpatho-genic organisms tend to colonize the epithelial cells of mu-cosal surfaces. These normal flora generally outcompete pathogens for attachment sites on the epithelial cell surfaceand for necessary nutrients. Some organisms have evolved ways of escaping these de- fense mechanisms and thus are able to invade the bodythrough mucous membranes. For example, influenza virus(the agent that causes flu) has a surface molecule that enablesit to attach firmly to cells in mucous membranes of the respi-ratory tract, preventing the virus from being swept out by theciliated epithelial cells. Similarly, the organism that causesgonorrhea has surface projections that allow it to bind to ep-ithelial cells in the mucous membrane of the urogenital tract.Adherence of bacteria to mucous membranes is due to between hairlike protrusions on bacterium, calledfimbriae or pili, and certain glycoproteins or glycolipids that are expressed only by epithelial cells of the mucous mem-brane of particular tissues (Figure 1-2). For this reason, sometissues are susceptible to bacterial invasion, whereas others are not. Physiologic Barriers to Infection Include General Conditions and Specific Molecules The physiologic barriers that contribute to innate immu- nity include temperature, pH, and various soluble and cell-associated molecules. Many species are not susceptible to cer-tain diseases simply because their normal body temperatureinhibits growth of the pathogens. Chickens, for example,have innate immunity to anthrax because their high bodytemperature inhibits the growth of the bacteria. Gastric acid-ity is an innate physiologic barrier to infection because veryfew ingested microorganisms can survive the low pH of thestomach contents. One reason newborns are susceptible tosome diseases that do not afflict adults is that their stomachcontents are less acid than those of adults. A variety of soluble factors contribute to innate immu- nity, among them the soluble proteins lysozyme, a hydrolytic enzyme found in mucous secretions and in tears, is able to cleave the peptido-glycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. Interferon comprises a group of proteins produced by virus-infected cells. Amongthe many functions of the interferons is the ability to bind tonearby cells and induce a generalized antiviral state. Comple- ment, examined in detail in Chapter 13, is a group of serum proteins that circulate in an inactive state. A variety of spe-cific and nonspecific immunologic mechanisms can convertthe inactive forms of complement proteins into an activestate with the ability to damage the membranes of patho-genic organisms, either destroying the pathogens or facilitat-ing their clearance. Complement may function as an effectorsystem that is triggered by binding of antibodies to certaincell surfaces, or it may be activated by reactions betweencomplement molecules and certain components of microbialcell walls. Reactions between complement molecules or frag-ments of complement molecules and cellular receptors trig-ger activation of cells of the innate or adaptive immunesystems. Recent studies on collectins indicate that these sur- factant proteins may kill certain bacteria directly by disrupt-ing their lipid membranes or, alternatively, by aggregating thebacteria to enhance their susceptibility to phagocytosis. Many of the molecules involved in innate immunity have the property of pattern recognition, the ability to recognize a given class of molecules. Because there are certain types of mol-ecules that are unique to microbes and never found in multi-cellular organisms, the ability to immediately recognize andcombat invaders displaying such molecules is a strong featureof innate immunity. Molecules with pattern recognition abilitymay be soluble, like lysozyme and the complement compo-nents described above, or they may be cell-associated receptors.Among the class of receptors designated the toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR2 recognizes the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found on Gram-negative bacteria. It has long been recognized that6 PART I Introduction FIGURE 1-2Electron micrograph of rod-shaped Escherichia coli bacteria adhering to surface of epithelial cells of the urinary tract. [From N. Sharon and H. Lis, 1993,Sci. Am. 268(1):85; photograph courtesy of K.

The mechanism for this response is via a TLR onmacrophages that recognizes LPS and elicits a variety of mole-cules in the inflammatory response upon exposure. When theTLR is exposed to the LPS upon local invasion by a Gram-neg-ative bacterium, the contained response results in eliminationof the bacterial challenge. Cells That Ingest and Destroy Pathogens Make Up a Phagocytic Barrier to Infection Another important innate defense mechanism is the inges- tion of extracellular particulate material by phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is one type of endocytosis, the general term for the uptake by a cell of material from its environment. Inphagocytosis, a cell's plasma membrane expands around theparticulate material, which may include whole pathogenicmicroorganisms, to form large vesicles called phagosomes (Figure 1-3). Most phagocytosis is conducted by specializedcells, such as blood monocytes, neutrophils, and tissuemacrophages (see Chapter 2). Most cell types are capable ofother forms of endocytosis, such as receptor-mediated endo- cytosis, in which extracellular molecules are internalized after binding by specific cellular receptors, and pinocytosis, the process by which cells take up fluid from the surroundingmedium along with any molecules contained in it. Inflammation Represents a Complex Sequence of Events That Stimulates Immune Responses Tissue damage caused by a wound or by an invading patho- genic microorganism induces a complex sequence of eventscollectively known as the inflammatory response. As de- scribed above, a molecular component of a microbe, such asLPS, may trigger an inflammatory response via interactionwith cell surface receptors. The end result of inflammationmay be the marshalling of a specific immune response to theinvasion or clearance of the invader by components of theinnate immune system. Many of the classic features of theinflammatory response were described as early as 1600 BC,i n Egyptian papyrus writings. In the first century AD, the Roman physician Celsus described the \"four cardinal signs Overview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 7 FIGURE 1-3(a) Electronmicrograph of macrophage (pink) attack- ing Escherichia coli (green).

In the second century AD,a n - other physician, Galen, added a fifth sign: functio laesa (loss of function). The cardinal signs of inflammation reflect thethree major events of an inflammatory response (Figure 1-4): 1.Vasodilation \u2014an increase in the diameter of blood vessels\u2014of nearby capillaries occurs as the vessels thatcarry blood away from the affected area constrict,resulting in engorgement of the capillary network. Theengorged capillaries are responsible for tissue redness(erythema ) and an increase in tissue temperature.8536d_ch01_007 9/5/02 11:47 Page 7 mac46 mac46:385_reb:2. An increase in capillary permeability facilitates an influx of fluid and cells from the engorged capillaries into thetissue. The fluid that accumulates (exudate) has a much higher protein content than fluid normally released fromthe vasculature. Accumulation of exudate contributes totissue swelling (edema) . 3.Influx of phagocytes from the capillaries into the tissues is facilitated by the increased permeability of the capil-laries. The emigration of phagocytes is a multistepprocess that includes adherence of the cells to theendothelial wall of the blood vessels (margination) , followed by their emigration between the capillary-endothelial cells into the tissue (diapedesis orextrava- sation) , and, finally, their migration through the tissue to the site of the invasion (chemotaxis) . As phagocytic cells accumulate at the site and begin to phagocytose bacteria,they release lytic enzymes, which can damage nearbyhealthy cells. The accumulation of dead cells, digestedmaterial, and fluid forms a substance called pus. The events in the inflammatory response are initiated by a complex series of events involving a variety of chemical me-diators whose interactions are only partly understood. Someof these mediators are derived from invading microorgan-isms, some are released from damaged cells in response to tis- sue injury, some are generated by several plasma enzyme sys-tems, and some are products of various white blood cellsparticipating in the inflammatory response. Among the chemical mediators released in response to tis- sue damage are various serum proteins called acute-phase proteins. The concentrations of these proteins increase dra- matically in tissue-damaging infections. C-reactive protein isa major acute-phase protein produced by the liver in re-sponse to tissue damage. Its name derives from its pattern-recognition activity: C-reactive protein binds to theC-polysaccharide cell-wall component found on a variety ofbacteria and fungi. This binding activates the complementsystem, resulting in increased clearance of the pathogen ei-ther by complement-mediated lysis or by a complement-mediated increase in phagocytosis. One of the principal mediators of the inflammatory re- sponse is histamine, a chemical released by a variety of cells in response to tissue injury. Histamine binds to receptors onnearby capillaries and venules, causing vasodilation and in-creased permeability. Another important group of inflam-matory mediators, small peptides called kinins, are normally present in blood plasma in an inactive form. Tissue injury ac-tivates these peptides, which then cause vasodilation and in-8 PART I Introduction Tissue damage causes release of vasoactive and chemotactic factorsthat trigger a local increase in bloodflow and capillary permeability Permeable capillaries allow aninflux of fluid (exudate) and cellsPhagocytes and antibacterialexudate destroy bacteria migrate 21 Exudate(complement, antibody,C-reactive protein) CapillaryMargination ExtravasationTissue damage Bacteria FIGURE 1-4Major events in the inflammatory response. A bacte- rial infection causes tissue damage with release of various vas oactive and chemotactic factors. These factors induce increased blood f low to the area, increased capillary permeability, and an influx of whiteblood cells, including phagocytes and lymphocytes, from the blo od into the tissues. The serum proteins contained in the exudate h ave antibacterial properties, and the phagocytes begin to engulf th e bac- teria, as illustrated in Figure 1-3.8536d_ch01_001-023 8/1/02 4:25 PM Page 8 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW: Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:creased capillaries. A particular kinin, called bradykinin, also stimulates pain receptors in the skin. Thiseffect probably serves a protective role, because pain nor-mally causes an individual to protect the injured area. Vasodilation and the increase in capillary permeability in an injured tissue also enable enzymes of the blood-clottingsystem to enter the tissue. These enzymes activate an enzymecascade that results in the deposition of insoluble strands offibrin, which is the main component of a blood clot. The fib- rin strands wall off the injured area from the rest of the bodyand serve to prevent the spread of infection. Once the inflammatory response has subsided and most of the debris has been cleared away by phagocytic cells, tissuerepair and regeneration of new tissue begins. Capillariesgrow into the fibrin of a blood clot. New connective tissuecells, called fibroblasts, replace the fibrin as the clot dissolv es. As fibroblasts and capillaries accumulate, scar tissue forms.The inflammatory response is described in more detail inChapter 15. Adaptive Immunity Adaptive immunity is capable of recognizing and selectivelyeliminating specific foreign microorganisms and molecules(i.e., foreign antigens). Unlike innate immune responses,adaptive immune responses are not the same in all membersof a species but are reactions to specific antigenic challenges.Adaptive immunity displays four characteristic attributes: IAntigenic specificity IDiversity IImmunologic memory ISelf/nonself recognition The antigenic specificity of the immune system permits it to distinguish subtle differences among antigens. Antibodiescan distinguish between two protein molecules that differ inonly a single amino acid. The immune system is capable ofgenerating tremendous diversity in its recognition molecules, allowing it to recognize billions of unique structures on for-eign antigens. Once the immune system has recognized andresponded to an antigen, it exhibits immunologic memory; that is, a second encounter with the same antigen induces aheightened state of immune reactivity. Because of this at-tribute, the immune system can confer life-long immunity tomany infectious agents after an initial encounter. Finally, theimmune system normally responds only to foreign antigens,indicating that it is capable of self/nonself recognition. The ability of the immune system to distinguish self from nonselfand respond only to nonself molecules is essential, for, as de-scribed below, the outcome of an inappropriate response toself molecules can be fatal. Adaptive immunity is not independent of innate immu- nity. The phagocytic cells crucial to nonspecific immune re-sponses are intimately involved in activating the specific im- mune response. Conversely, various soluble factors producedby a specific immune response have been shown to augmentthe activity of these phagocytic cells. As an inflammatory re-sponse develops, for example, soluble mediators are pro-duced that attract cells of the immune system. The immuneresponse will, in turn, serve to regulate the intensity of the in-flammatory response. Through the carefully regulated inter-play of adaptive and innate immunity, the two systems worktogether to eliminate a foreign invader. The Adaptive Immune System Requires Cooperation Between Lymphocytes andAntigen-Presenting Cells An effective immune response involves two major groups of cells: T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. Lympho- cytes are one of many types of white blood cells produced inthe bone marrow by the process of hematopoiesis (see Chap-ter 2). Lymphocytes leave the bone marrow, circulate in theblood and lymphatic systems, and reside in various lym-phoid organs. Because they produce and display antigen-binding cell-surface receptors, lymphocytes mediate thedefining immunologic attributes of specificity, and self/nonself recognition. The two major popu-lations of lymphocytes\u2014 B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lym- phocytes (T cells) \u2014are described briefly here and in greater detail in later chapters. B LYMPHOCYTES B lymphocytes mature within the bone marrow; when theyleave it, each expresses a unique antigen-binding receptor onits membrane (Figure 1-5a). This antigen-binding or B-cellreceptor is a membrane-bound antibody molecule. Anti- bodies are glycoproteins that consist of two identical heavypolypeptide chains and two identical light polypeptidechains. Each heavy chain is joined with a light chain by disul-fide bonds, and additional disulfide bonds hold the two pairstogether. The amino-terminal ends of the pairs of heavy andlight chains form a cleft within which antigen binds. When anaive B cell (one that has not previously encountered anti-gen) first encounters the antigen that matches its membrane-bound antibody, the binding of the antigen to the antibodycauses the cell to divide rapidly; its progeny differentiate int o memory B cells and effector B cells called plasma cells. Memory B cells have a longer life span than naive cells, andthey express the same membrane-bound antibody as theirparent B cell. Plasma cells produce the antibody in a formthat can be secreted and have little or no membrane-boundantibody. Although plasma cells live for only a few days, theysecrete enormous amounts of antibody during this time.It has been estimated that a single plasma cell can secretemore than 2000 molecules of antibody per second. Secretedantibodies are the major effector molecules of humoral immunity.Overview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 98536d_ch01_001-023 8/1/02 4:25 PM Page 9 mac79 Mac al. / Immunology 5e:T LYMPHOCYTES T lymphocytes also arise in the bone marrow. Unlike B cells, which mature within the bone marrow, T cells migrate to thethymus gland to mature. During its maturation within thethymus, the T cell comes to express a unique antigen-bindingmolecule, called the T-cell receptor, on its membrane. Unlike membrane-bound antibodies on B cells, which can recognizeantigen alone, T-cell receptors can recognize only antigenthat is bound to cell-membrane proteins called major histo- compatibility complex (MHC) molecules. MHC molecules that function in this recognition event, which is termed \"anti-gen presentation,\" are polymorphic (genetically diverse) gly-coproteins found on cell membranes (see Chapter 7). Thereare two major types of MHC molecules: Class I MHC mole-cules, which are expressed by nearly all nucleated cells of ver-tebrate species, consist of a heavy chain linked to a smallinvariant protein called /H9252 2-microglobulin. Class II MHC molecules, which consist of an alpha and a beta glycoproteinchain, are expressed only by antigen-presenting cells. When anaive T cell encounters antigen combined with a MHC mol-ecule on a cell, the T cell proliferates and differentiates intomemory T cells and various effector T cells. There are two well-defined subpopulations of T cells: T helper (T H)and T cytotoxic (T C) cells. Although a third type of T cell, called a T suppressor (T S) cell, has been postulated, recent evidence suggests that it may not be distinct from T H and T Csubpopulations. T helper and T cytotoxic cells can be distinguished from one another by the presence of eitherCD4 or CD8 membrane glycoproteins on their surfaces (Fig- ure 1-5b,c). T cells displaying CD4 generally function as T H cells, whereas those displaying CD8 generally function as T C cells (see Chapter 2). After a T Hcell recognizes and interacts with an anti- gen-MHC class II molecule complex, the cell is activated\u2014itbecomes an effector cell that secretes various growth factorsknown collectively as cytokines. The secreted cytokines playan important role in activating B cells, T Ccells, macrophages, and various other cells that participate in the immune re-sponse. Differences in the pattern of cytokines produced byactivated T Hcells result in different types of immune response. Under the influence of T H-derived cytokines, a T Ccell that recognizes an antigen-MHC class I molecule complexproliferates and differentiates into an effector cell called a cy- totoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). In contrast to the T Ccell, the CTL generally does not secrete many cytokines and insteadexhibits cell-killing or cytotoxic activity. The CTL has a vitalfunction in monitoring the cells of the body and eliminatingany that display antigen, such as virus-infected cells, tumorcells, and cells of a foreign tissue graft. Cells that display for - eign antigen complexed with a class I MHC molecule arecalled altered self-cells ; these are targets of CTLs. ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS Activation of both the humoral and cell-mediated branches of the immune system requires cytokines produced by T H cells. It is essential that activation of T Hcells themselves be carefully regulated, because an inappropriate T-cell responseto self-components can have fatal autoimmune conse-quences. T o ensure carefully regulated activation of T Hcells, they can recognize only antigen that is displayed togetherwith class MHC II molecules on the surface of antigen-pre-senting cells (APCs). These specialized cells, which includemacrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, are distin-guished by two properties: (1) they express class II MHCmolecules on their membranes, and (2) they are able to deliver a co-stimulatory signal that is necessary for T H-cell activation. Antigen-presenting cells first internalize antigen, either by phagocytosis or by endocytosis, and then display a part ofthat antigen on their membrane bound to a class II MHCmolecule. The T Hcell recognizes and interacts with the 10 PART I Introduction (a) B cell Antigen- bindingreceptor(antibody)(b) TH cell (c) TC cell CD4 TCR CD8TCR FIGURE 1-5Distinctive membrane molecules on lymphocytes.

An additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the antigen-present-ing cell, leading to activation of the T Hcell. Humoral Immunity But Not Cellular Immunity Is Transferredwith Antibody As mentioned earlier, immune responses can be divided into humoral and cell-mediated responses. Humoral immunityrefers to immunity that can be conferred upon a nonimmuneindividual by administration of serum antibodies from animmune individual. In contrast, cell-mediated immunity canbe transferred only by administration of T cells from an im-mune individual. The humoral branch of the immune system is at work in the interaction of B cells with antigen and their subsequentproliferation and differentiation into antibody-secretingplasma cells (Figure 1-7). Antibody functions as the effectorof the humoral response by binding to antigen and neutraliz-ing it or facilitating its elimination. When an antigen iscoated with antibody, it can be eliminated in several ways.For example, antibody can cross-link several antigens, form-ing clusters that are more readily ingested by phagocytic cells . Binding of antibody to antigen on a microorganism can alsoactivate the complement system, resulting in lysis of the for-eign organism. Antibody can also neutralize toxins or viralparticles by coating them, which prevents them from bindingto host cells. Effector T cells generated in response to antigen are re- sponsible for cell-mediated immunity (see Figure 1-7). Bothactivated lymphocytes cell-mediated immune reactions. Cy-tokines secreted by T Hcells can activate various phagocytic cells, enabling them to phagocytose and kill microorganismsmore effectively. This type of cell-mediated immune re-sponse is especially important in ridding the host of bacteriaand protozoa contained by infected host cells. CTLs partici-pate in cell-mediated immune reactions by killing alteredself-cells; they play an important role in the killing of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Antigen Is Recognized Differently by B and T Lymphocytes Antigens, which are generally very large and complex, are not recognized in their entirety by lymphocytes. Instead, both Band T lymphocytes recognize discrete sites on the antigencalled antigenic determinants, orepitopes. Epitopes are the immunologically active regions on a complex antigen, the re-gions that actually bind to B-cell or T-cell receptors. Although B cells can recognize an epitope alone, T cells can recognize an epitope only when it is associated with anMHC molecule on the surface of a self-cell (either an anti-gen-presenting cell or an altered self-cell). Each branch of theimmune system is therefore uniquely suited to recognizeantigen in a different milieu. The humoral branch (B cells)recognizes an enormous variety of epitopes: those displayedon the surfaces of bacteria or viral particles, as well as thosedisplayed on soluble proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccha-rides, or lipopolysaccharides that have been released from in-vading pathogens. The cell-mediated branch (T cells)recognizes protein epitopes displayed MHCmolecules on self-cells, including altered self-cells such asvirus-infected self-cells and cancerous cells. Thus, four related but distinct cell-membrane molecules are responsible for antigen recognition by the immune system: IMembrane-bound antibodies on B cells IT-cell receptors IClass I MHC molecules IClass II MHC molecules Each of these molecules plays a unique role in antigen recog- nition, ensuring that the immune system can recognize andrespond to the different types of antigen that it encounters. B and T Lymphocytes Utilize Similar Mechanisms To Generate Diversity in Antigen Receptors The antigenic specificity of each B cell is determined by the membrane-bound antigen-binding receptor (i.e., antibody)expressed by the cell. As a B cell matures in the bone marrow,its specificity is created by random rearrangements of a seriesOverview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 11 FIGURE 1-6Electron micrograph of an antigen-presenting macro- phage ( right) associating with a T lymphocyte.

As a result of this process, each mature B cell pos-sesses a single functional gene encoding the antibody heavychain and a single functional gene encoding the antibodylight chain; the cell therefore synthesizes and displays anti-body with one specificity on its membrane. All antibodymolecules on a given B lymphocyte have identical specificity,giving each B lymphocyte, and the clone of daughter cells towhich it gives rise, a distinct specificity for a single epitope on an antigen. The mature B lymphocyte is therefore said to beantigenically committed. The random gene rearrangements during B-cell matura- tion in the bone marrow ofdifferent antigenic specificities. The resulting B-cell popula-tion, which consists of individual B cells each expressing aunique antibody, is estimated to exhibit collectively morethan 10 10different antigenic specificities. The enormous di- versity in the mature B-cell population is later reduced by aselection process in the bone marrow that eliminates any Bcells with membrane-bound antibody that recognizes self-components. The selection process helps to ensure that self-reactive antibodies (auto-antibodies) are not produced. The attributes of specificity and diversity also characterize the antigen-binding T-cell receptor (TCR) on T cells. As in B-cell maturation, the process of T-cell maturation includesrandom rearrangements of a series of gene segments that en-code the cell's antigen-binding receptor (see Chapter 9). EachT lymphocyte cell expresses about 10 5receptors, and all of the receptors on the cell and its clonal progeny have identicalspecificity for antigen. The random rearrangement of theTCR genes is capable of generating on the order of 10 9 unique antigenic specificities. This enormous potential di- versity is later diminished through a selection process in thethymus that eliminates any T cell with self-reactive receptorsand ensures that only T cells with receptors capable of recog-nizing antigen associated with MHC molecules will be ableto mature (see Chapter 10). The Major Histocompatibility Molecules Bind Antigenic Peptides The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large ge- netic complex with multiple loci. The MHC loci encode twomajor classes of membrane-bound glycoproteins: class I and class II MHC molecules. As noted above, T Hcells generally recognize antigen combined with class II molecules, whereasT Ccells generally recognize antigen combined with class I molecules (Figure 1-8). MHC molecules function as antigen-recognition mole- cules, but they do not possess the fine specificity for antigencharacteristic of antibodies and T-cell receptors. Rather, eachMHC molecule can bind to a spectrum of antigenic peptides derived from the intracellular degradation of antigen mole-cules. In both class I and class II MHC molecules the distalregions (farthest from the membrane) of different alleles dis-play wide variation in their amino acid sequences. Thesevariable regions form a cleft within which the antigenic pep-tide sits and is presented to T lymphocytes (see Figure 1-8).Different allelic forms of the genes encoding class I and classOverview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 13 Antigen-presenting cellTH cell TH cell Virus-infected cellTC receptor CD4 FIGURE 1-8The role of MHC molecules in antigen recognition by T cells.

Thus the ability to presen t an antigen to T lymphocytes is influenced by the particularset of alleles that an individual inherits. Complex Antigens Are Degraded (Processed) and Displayed (Presented) with MHCMolecules on the Cell Surface In order for a foreign protein antigen to be recognized by a T cell, it must be degraded into small antigenic peptides thatform complexes with class I or class II MHC molecules. Thisconversion of proteins into MHC-associated peptide frag-ments is called antigen processing and presentation. Whether a particular antigen will be processed and presented togetherwith class I MHC or class II MHC molecules appears to bedetermined by the route that the antigen takes to enter a cell(Figure 1-9). Exogenous antigen is produced outside of the host cell and enters the cell by endocytosis or phagocytosis. Antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, fragmentswithin the endocytic processing pathway. Experiments sug-gest that class II MHC molecules are expressed within the en-docytic processing pathway and that peptides produced bydegradation of antigen in this pathway bind to the cleftwithin the class II MHC molecules. The MHC moleculesbearing the peptide are then exported to the cell surface.Since expression of class II MHC molecules is limited to anti- gen-presenting cells, presentation of exogenous peptide-class II MHC complexes is limited to these cells. T cells dis-playing CD4 recognize antigen combined with class II MHCmolecules and thus are said to be class II MHC restricted. These cells generally function as T helper cells. Endogenous antigen is produced within the host cell it- self. Two common examples are viral proteins synthesizedwithin virus-infected host cells and unique proteins synthe-sized by cancerous cells. Endogenous antigens are degradedinto peptide fragments bind moleculeswithin the endoplasmic reticulum. The peptide-class I MHCcomplex is then transported to the cell membrane. Since allnucleated cells express class I MHC molecules, all cells pro-ducing endogenous antigen use this route to process the anti-gen. T cells displaying CD8 recognize antigen associated withclass I MHC molecules and thus are said to be class I MHC re- stricted. These cytotoxic T cells attack and kill cells displaying the antigen-MHC class I complexes for which their receptorsare specific.

As noted above, the speci- ficity of each T and B lymphocyte is determined before itscontact with antigen by random gene rearrangements duringmaturation in the thymus or bone marrow. The role of antigen becomes critical when it interacts with and activates mature, antigenically committed T and B lym-phocytes, bringing about expansion of the population ofcells with a given antigenic specificity. In this process ofclonal selection, an antigen binds to a particular T or B cell and stimulates it to divide repeatedly into a clone of cells wit h the same antigenic specificity as the original parent cell (Fig - ure 1-10). Clonal selection provides a framework for understanding the specificity and self/nonself recognition that is character-istic of adaptive immunity. Specificity is shown because only lymphocytes whose receptors are specific for a given epitopeon an antigen will be clonally expanded and thus mobilizedfor an immune response. Self/nonself discrimination is ac-complished by the elimination, during development, of lym-phocytes bearing self-reactive receptors or by the functionalsuppression of these cells in adults. Immunologic memory also is a consequence of clonal se- lection. During clonal selection, the number of lymphocytesspecific for a given antigen is greatly amplified. Moreover,many of these lymphocytes, referred to as memory cells, ap-pear to have a longer life span than the naive lymphocytesfrom which they arise. The initial encounter of a naive im-munocompetent lymphocyte with an antigen induces a Overview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 15 FIGURE 1-10Maturation and clonal selection of B lymphocytes. Maturation, which occurs in the absence of antigen, produces an ti- genically committed B cells, each of which expresses antibody w ith a single antigenic specificity (indicated by 1, 2, 3, and 4). Clonal selec- tion occurs when an antigen binds to a B cell whose membrane-bound antibody molecules are specific for epitopes on that anti gen.

The plasma cells secrete antibody reactive with t he acti- vating antigen. Similar processes take place in the T-lymphocyt e population, resulting in clones of memory T cells and effector T cells; the latter include activated T Hcells, cytokines, and cy- totoxic T et al. / Immunology 5e:primary response; a later contact of the host with antigen will induce a more rapid and heightened secondary re- sponse. The amplified population of memory cells accounts for the rapidity and intensity that distinguishes a secondaryresponse from the primary response. In the humoral branch of the immune system, antigen in- duces the clonal proliferation of B lymphocytes into anti-body-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells. As seen in Figure 1-11a, the primary response has a lag of approxi-mately 5-7 days before antibody levels start to rise. This lag i s the time required for activation of naive B cells by antigenand T Hcells and for the subsequent proliferation and differ- entiation of the activated B cells into plasma cells. Antibodylevels peak in the primary response at about day 14 and thenbegin to drop off as the plasma cells begin to die. In the secondary response, the lag is much shorter (only 1-2 days),antibody levels are much higher, and they are sustained formuch longer. The secondary response reflects the activity of the clonally expanded population of memory B cells.These memory cells respond to the antigen more rapidlythan naive B cells; in addition, because there are many more memory cells than there were naive B cells for the primary response, more plasma cells are generated in thesecondary response, and antibody levels are consequently100- to 1000-fold higher. In the cell-mediated branch of the immune system, the recognition of an antigen-MHC complex by a specific ma-ture T lymphocyte induces clonal proliferation into variousT cells with effector functions (T Hcells and CTLs) and into memory T cells. The cell-mediated response to a skin graft isillustrated in Figure 1-11b by a hypothetical transplantationexperiment. When skin from strain C mice is grafted ontostrain A mice, a primary response develops and all the graftsare rejected in about 10-14 days. If these same mice are againgrafted with strain C skin, it is rejected much more vigor-ously and rapidly than the first grafts. However, if animalspreviously engrafted with strain C skin are next given skinfrom an unrelated strain, strain B, the response to strain B istypical of the primary response and is rejected in 10-14 days.That is, graft rejection is a specific immune response. Thesame mice that showed a secondary response to graft C willshow a primary response to graft B. The increased speed ofrejection of graft C reflects the presence of a clonally ex-panded population of memory T Hand T Ccells specific for the antigens of the foreign graft. This expanded memorypopulation generates more effector cells, resulting in fastergraft rejection. The Innate and Adaptive Immune Systems Collaborate, Increasing the Efficiency ofImmune Responsiveness It is important to appreciate that adaptive and innate immu- nity do not operate independently\u2014they function as a highlyinteractive and cooperative system, producing a combinedresponse more effective than either branch could produce byitself. Certain immune components play important roles inboth types of immunity. An example of cooperation is seen in the encounter between macrophages and microbes. Interactions betweenreceptors on macrophages and microbial components gen-erate soluble proteins that stimulate and direct adaptive im-mune responses, facilitating the participation of the adap-16 PART I Introduction Strain C graftrepeatedStrain B graftAntigen ASerum levelAntigen A+ Antigen B anti-Bresponse 6 01 4 Time, days(a) 14 0Percentage of mice rejecting graftStrain C graft 4 Time, days(b) 01 220406080100 81 6 401 2 81 6 FIGURE 1-11Differences in the primary and secondary response to injected antigen (humoral response) and to a skin graft (cel l-me- diated response) reflect the phenomenon of immunologic memory.

Stimulated macrophages also secrete cytokines that can direct adaptive immune responses against particular intra-cellular pathogens. Just as important, the adaptive immune system produces signals and components that stimulate and increase the ef-fectiveness of innate responses. Some T cells, when they en-counter appropriately presented antigen, synthesize andsecrete cytokines that increase the ability of macrophages tokill the microbes they have ingested. Also, antibodies pro-duced against an invader bind to the pathogen, marking it asa target for attack by complement and serving as a potent ac-tivator of the attack. A major difference between adaptive and innate immu- nity is the rapidity of the innate immune response, which uti-lizes a pre-existing but limited repertoire of respondingcomponents. Adaptive immunity compensates for its sloweronset by its ability to recognize a much wider repertoire offoreign substances, and also by its ability to improve during aresponse, whereas innate immunity remains constant. It mayalso be noted that secondary adaptive responses are consid-erably faster than primary responses. Principle characteris-tics of the innate and adaptive immune systems arecompared in Table 1-3. With overlapping roles, the two sys-tems together form a highly effective barrier to infection. Comparative Immunity The field of immunology is concerned mostly with how in-nate and adaptive mechanisms collaborate to protect verte-brates from infection. Although many cellular and molecularactors have important roles, antibodies and lymphocytes areconsidered to be the principal players. Y et despite theirprominence in vertebrate immune systems, it would be amistake to conclude that these extraordinary molecules andversatile cells are essential for immunity. In fact, a deter-mined search for antibodies, T cells, and B cells in organismsof the nonvertebrate phyla has failed to find them. The inte-rior spaces of organisms as diverse as fruit flies, cockroaches,and plants do not contain unchecked microbial populations,however, which implies that some sort of immunity exists in most, possibly all, multicellular organisms, including thosewith no components of adaptive immunity. Insects and plants provide particularly clear and dramatic examples of innate immunity that is not based on lympho-cytes. The invasion of the interior body cavity of the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster, by bacteria or molds triggers the synthesis of small peptides that have strong antibacterial orantifungal activity. The effectiveness of these antimicrobialpeptides is demonstrated by the fate of mutants that are un-able to produce them. For example, a fungal infection over-whelms a mutant fruit fly that is unable to trigger thesynthesis of drosomycin, an antifungal peptide (Figure 1-12). Further evidence for immunity in the fruit fly is givenby the recent findings that cell receptors recognizing variousclasses of microbial molecules (the toll-like receptors) werefirst found in Drosophila. Plants respond to infection by producing a wide variety of antimicrobial proteins and peptides, as well as smallOverview of the Immune System CHAPTER 1 17 TABLE 1-3Comparison of adaptive and innate immunity Innate Adaptive Response time Hours Days Specificity Limited and Highly diverse, improves fixed during the course of immune response Response to Identical to Much more rapid than repeat primary primary responseinfection response FIGURE 1-12Severe fungal infection in a fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) with a disabling mutation in a signal-transduction pathway required for the synthesis of the antifungal peptide dr o- somycin.

Among these agents are enzymes that digest microbial cellwalls, peptides and a protein that damages microbial mem-branes, and the small organic molecules phytoalexins. Theimportance of the phytoalexins is shown by the fact that mu-tations that alter their biosynthetic pathways result in loss o f resistance to many plant pathogens. In some cases, the re-sponse of plants to pathogens goes beyond this chemical as-sault to include an architectural response, in which the plantisolates cells in the infected area by strengthening the walls of surrounding cells. Table 1-4 compares the capabilities of im-mune systems in a wide range of multicellular organisms,both animals and plants. Immune Dysfunction and Its Consequences The above overview of innate and adaptive immunity depicts a multicomponent interactive system that protects the hostfrom infectious diseases and from cancer. This overviewwould not be complete without mentioning that the immunesystem can function improperly. Sometimes the immune sys-tem fails to protect the host adequately or misdirects its ac-tivities to cause discomfort, debilitating disease, or evendeath. There are several common manifestations of immunedysfunction: IAllergy and asthma IGraft rejection and graft-versus-host disease IAutoimmune disease IImmunodeficiency Allergy and asthma are results of inappropriate immune re- sponses, often to common antigens such as plant pollen,food, or animal dander. The possibility that certain sub-stances increased sensitivity rather than protection was rec-ognized in about 1902 by Charles Richet, who attempted toimmunize dogs against the toxins of a type of jellyfish,Physalia. He and his colleague Paul Portier observed that dogs exposed to sublethal doses of the toxin reacted almostinstantly, and fatally, to subsequent challenge with minuteamounts of the toxin. Richet concluded that a successful im-munization or vaccination results in phylaxis, or protection, and that an opposite result may occur\u2014 anaphylaxis \u2014in which exposure to antigen can result in a potentially lethalsensitivity to the antigen if the exposure is repeated. Richetreceived the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his discovery of the ana-phylactic response. Fortunately, most allergic reactions in humans are not rapidly fatal. A specific allergic or anaphylactic response usu-ally involves one antibody type, called IgE. Binding of IgE toits specific antigen (allergen) releases substances that causeirritation and inflammation. When an allergic individual isexposed to an allergen, symptoms may include sneezing,wheezing, and difficulty in breathing (asthma); dermatitis or skin eruptions (hives); and, in more extreme cases, strangu-lation due to blockage of airways by inflammation. A signifi-cant fraction of our health resources is expended to care forthose suffering from allergy and asthma. The frequency ofallergy and asthma in the United States place these com-plaints among the most common reasons for a visit to thedoctor's office or to the hospital emergency room (see Clini-cal Focus). When the immune system encounters foreign cells or tis- sue, it responds strongly to rid the host of the invaders. How-ever, in some cases, the transplantation of cells or an organfrom another individual, although viewed by the immunesystem as a foreign invasion, may be the only possible treat-ment for disease. For example, it is estimated that more than60,000 persons in the United States alone could benefit froma kidney transplant. Because the immune system will attackand reject any transplanted organ that it does not recognizeas self, it is a serious barrier to this potentially life-savingtreatment. An additional danger in transplantation is thatany transplanted cells with immune function may view thenew host as nonself and react against it. This reaction, whichis termed graft-versus-host disease, can be fatal. The rejec-tion reaction and graft-versus-host disease can be suppressedby drugs, but this type of treatment suppresses all immunefunction, so that the host is no longer protected by its im-mune system and becomes susceptible to infectious diseases.Transplantation studies have played a major role in the de-velopment of immunology. A Nobel prize was awarded toKarl Landsteiner, in 1930, for the discovery of human bloodgroups, a finding that allowed blood transfusions to be car-ried out safely. In 1980, G. Snell, J. Dausset, and B. Benacerrafwere recognized for discovery of the major histocompatibil-ity complex, and, in 1991, E. D. Thomas and J. Murray wereawarded Nobel Prizes for advances in transplantation immu-nity. T o enable a foreign organ to be accepted without sup-pressing immunity to all antigens remains a challenge forimmunologists today. In certain individuals, the immune system malfunctions by losing its sense of self and nonself, which permits an im-mune attack upon the host. This condition, autoimmunity, can cause a number of chronic debilitating diseases. Thesymptoms of autoimmunity differ depending on whichtissues and organs are under attack. For example, multiplesclerosis is due to an autoimmune attack on the brain andcentral nervous system, Crohn's disease is an attack on thetissues in the gut, and rheumatoid arthritis is an attack onjoints of the arms and legs. The genetic and environmentalfactors that trigger and sustain autoimmune disease are veryactive areas of immunologic research, as is the search for im-proved treatments. If any of the many components of innate or specific im- munity is defective because of genetic abnormality, or if anyimmune function is lost because of damage by chemical,physical, or biological agents, the host suffers from immu- nodeficiency.

Approximately 15 million persons in the United States suf-fer from asthma, and it causes about5000 deaths per year. In the past twenty years, the prevalence of asthma in theWestern World has doubled.* Data on the frequency of care sought for the most common medical com-plaints in the United States show thatasthma and allergy together resulted inmore than 28million visits to the doctor in 1995 . The importance of allergy as a public health problem is underscored bythe fact that the annual number of doctorvisits for hypertension, routine medicalexaminations, or normal pregnancy, areeach fewer than the number of visits forallergic conditions. In fact, the mostcommon reason for a visit to a hospitalemergency room is an asthma attack, ac-counting for one third of all visits. In ad-dition to those treated in the ER, therewere about 160,000hospitalizations for asthma in the past year, with an averagestay of 3to 4days. Although all ages and races are af- fected, deaths from asthma are 3.5times more common among African-Americanchildren. The reasons for the increases innumber of asthma cases and for thehigher death rate in African-American chil-dren remain unknown, although someclues may have been uncovered by recentCLINICAL FOCUS (continued) Allergy and Asthma as Serious Public Health Problems Sequence of events leading to an allergic response.

An increasingly serious health prob- lem is food allergy, especially to peanutsand tree nuts (almonds, cashews, andwalnuts). Approximately 3million Americans are allergic to these foodsand they are the leading causes of fataland near-fatal food allergic (anaphylac-tic) reactions. While avoidance of thesefoods can prevent harmful conse-quences, the ubiquitous use of peanutprotein and other nut products in a vari-ety of foods makes this very difficult forthe allergic individual. At least 50% of se- rious reactions are caused by accidentalexposures to peanuts, tree nuts, or theirproducts. This has led to controversialmovements to ban peanuts fromschools and airplanes. Anaphylaxis generally occurs within an hour of ingesting the food allergenand the most effective treatment is injec-tion of the drug epinephrine. Thoseprone to anaphylactic attacks often carryinjectable epinephrine to be used in caseof exposure. In addition to the suffering and anxi- ety caused by inappropriate immune re-sponses or allergies to environmentalantigens, there is a staggering cost interms of lost work time for those affectedand for caregivers. These costs well justifythe extensive efforts by basic and clinicalimmunologists and allergists to relievethe suffering caused by these disorders. Hughes, D. A., and C. Mills. 2001 .

A common type of immunodeficiency in North America is a selectiveimmunodeficiency in which only one type of immunoglob-ulin, IgA, is lacking; the symptoms may be minor or even gounnoticed. In contrast, a rarer immunodeficiency called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which affects both B and T cells, if untreated, results in death from infec-tion at an early age.

In AIDS, T helper cells are infected and destroyed by HIV , causing acollapse of the immune system. It is estimated that 35 millionpersons worldwide suffer from this disease, which is usuallyfatal within 8 to 10 years after infection. Although certaintreatments can prolong the life of AIDS patients, there is noknown cure for this disease. This chapter has been a brief introduction to the immune system, and it has given a thumbnail sketch of how this com-plex system functions to protect the host from disease. Thefollowing chapters will concern the structure and function ofthe individual cells, organs, and molecules that make up thissystem. They will describe our current understanding of howthe components of immunity interact and the experimentsthat allowed discovery of these mechanisms. Specific areas ofapplied immunology, such as immunity to infectious dis-eases, cancer, and current vaccination practices are the subjectmatter of later chapters. Finally, to complete the descriptionof the immune system in all of its activities, a chapter ad-dresses each of the major types of immune dysfunction. SUMMARY IImmunity is the state of protection against foreign organ-isms or substances (antigens). Vertebrates have two typesof immunity, innate and adaptive. IInnate immunity is not specific to any one pathogen butrather constitutes a first line of defense, which includesanatomic, physiologic, endocytic and phagocytic, and in-flammatory barriers. IInnate and adaptive immunity operate in cooperative andinterdependent ways. The activation of innate immune re-sponses produces signals that stimulate and direct subse-quent adaptive immune responses. IAdaptive immune responses exhibit four immunologic at-tributes: specificity, diversity, memory, and self/nonselfrecognition. IThe high degree of specificity in adaptive immunity arisesfrom the activities of molecules (antibodies and T-cellreceptors) that recognize and bind specific antigens. IAntibodies recognize and interact directly with antigen. T-cell receptors recognize only antigen that is combined witheither class I or class II major histocompatibility complex(MHC) molecules. IThe two major subpopulations of T lymphocytes theCD4 /H11001T helper (T H) cells and CD8/H11001T cytotoxic (T C) cells. THcells secrete cytokines that regulate immune response upon recognizing antigen combined with class II MHC. T C cells recognize antigen combined with class I MHC andgive rise to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), antigenic complexed with class II MHC molecules are then displayedon the cell surface. IEndogenous (intracellular) antigens (e.g., viral and tumorproteins produced in altered self-cells) are degraded in thecytoplasm and then displayed with class I MHC moleculeson the cell surface. IThe immune system produces both humoral and cell-me-diated responses. The humoral response is best suited forelimination of re-sponse, for elimination of endogenous antigens. IWhile an adaptive immune system is found only in verte-brates, innate immunity has been demonstrated in organ-isms as different as insects, earthworms, and higher plants. IDysfunctions of the immune system include commonmaladies such as allergy or asthma. Loss of immune func-tion leaves the host susceptible to infection; in autoimmu-nity, the immune system attacks host cells or tissues, References Akira, S., K. Takeda, and T. Kaisho. 2001.

These stem cells are few, normallyfewer than one HSC per 5 /H1100310 4cells in the bone marrow. The study of hematopoietic stem cells is difficult both be- cause of their scarcity and because they are hard to grow invitro. As a result, little is known about how their proliferationand differentiation are regulated. By virtue of their capacityfor self-renewal, hematopoietic stem cells are maintained atstable levels throughout adult life; however, when there is anincreased demand for hematopoiesis, HSCs display an enor-mous proliferative capacity. This can be demonstrated inmice whose hematopoietic systems have been completely de-stroyed by a lethal dose of x-rays (950 rads; one rad repre-sents the absorption by an irradiated target of an amount ofradiation corresponding to 100 ergs/gram of target). Such ir-radiated mice will die within 10 days unless they are infusedwith normal bone-marrow cells from a syngeneic (geneticallyidentical) mouse. Although a normal mouse has 3 /H1100310 8 bone-marrow cells, infusion of only 104-105bone-marrow cells (i.e., 0.01%-0.1% of the normal amount) from a donoris sufficient to completely restore the hematopoietic system, chapter 2 IHematopoiesis ICells of the Immune System IOrgans of the Immune System ISystemic Function of the Immune System ILymphoid Cells and Organs\u2014Evolutionary ComparisonsCells and Organs of the Immune System T organs and tissues that are found throughout thebody. These organs can be classified functionally into two main groups. The primary lymphoid organs provide appropriate microenvironments for the development andmaturation of lymphocytes. The secondary lymphoid organs trap antigen from defined tissues or vascular spaces and aresites where mature lymphocytes can interact effectively withthat antigen. Blood vessels and lymphatic systems connectthese organs, uniting them into a functional whole. Carried within the blood and lymph and populating the lymphoid organs are various white blood cells, or leuko- cytes, that participate in the immune response. Of these cells, only the lymphocytes possess the attributes of diversity,specificity, memory, and self/nonself recognition, the hall-marks of an adaptive immune response. All the other cellsplay accessory roles in adaptive immunity, serving to activatelymphocytes, to increase the effectiveness of antigen clear-ance by phagocytosis, or to secrete various immune-effectormolecules. Some leukocytes, especially T lymphocytes, se-crete various protein molecules called cytokines. These mol-ecules act as immunoregulatory hormones and playimportant roles in the regulation of immune responses. Thischapter describes the formation of blood cells, the propertiesof the various immune-system cells, and the functions of thelymphoid organs. Hematopoiesis All blood cells arise from a type of cell called the hematopoi- etic stem cell (HSC). Stem cells are cells that can differentiate into other cell types; they are self-renewing\u2014they maintaintheir population level by cell division. In humans,hematopoiesis, the formation and development of red and white blood cells, begins in the embryonic yolk sac during thefirst weeks of development. Here, yolk-sac stem cells differen-tiate into primitive erythroid cells that contain embryonichemoglobin. In the third month of gestation, hematopoieticstem cells migrate from the yolk sac to the fetal liver and the n to the spleen; these two organs have major roles inhematopoiesis from the third to the seventh months of gesta-tion. After that, the differentiation of HSCs in the bone mar-row becomes the major factor in hematopoiesis, and by birththere is little or no hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen. It is remarkable that every functionally specialized, ma- ture blood cell is derived from the same type of stem cell.

Early in hematopoiesis, a multipotent stem cell differenti- ates along one of two pathways, giving rise to either a com-mon lymphoid progenitor cell or a common myeloidprogenitor cell (Figure 2-1). The types and amounts of growth factors in the microenvironment of a particular stemcell or progenitor cell control its differentiation. During thedevelopment of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages, stem cells differentiate into progenitor cells, which have lost the TH helper cell TC cytotoxic T cellNatural killer to lymphoid and myeloid progenitors. All l ym- phoid cells descend from lymphoid progenitor cells and all cell sof the myeloid lineage arise from myeloid progenitors. Note tha t some dendritic cells come from lymphoid progenitors, othersfrom myeloid precursors. 4:02 PM 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:26 PART I Introduction capacity for self-renewal and are committed to a particular cel l lineage. Common lymphoid progenitor cells give rise to B, T,and NK (natural killer) cells and some dendritic cells. Myeloidstem cells generate progenitors of red blood cells (erythro-cytes), many of the various white blood cells (neutrophils,eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells),and platelets. Progenitor commitment depends on the acquisi-tion of responsiveness to particular growth factors and cy- tokines. When the appropriate factors and cytokines are present, progenitor cells proliferate and differentiate into thecorresponding cell type, either a mature erythrocyte, a partic-ular type of leukocyte, or a platelet-generating cell (themegakaryocyte). Red and white blood cells pass into bone-marrow channels, from which they enter the circulation. In bone marrow, hematopoietic cells grow and mature on a meshwork of stromal cells, which are nonhematopoietic cells that support the growth and differentiation of hema-topoietic cells. Stromal cells include fat cells, endothelial cel ls, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Stromal cells influence the dif-ferentiation of hematopoietic stem cells by providing ahematopoietic-inducing microenvironment (HIM) con- sisting of a cellular matrix and factors that promote growthand differentiation. Many of these hematopoietic growth factors are soluble agents that arrive at their target cells bydiffusion, others are membrane-bound molecules on thesurface of stromal cells that require cell-to-cell contact be-tween the responding cells and the stromal cells. During in-fection, hematopoiesis is stimulated by the production ofhematopoietic growth factors by activated macrophages andT cells. Hematopoiesis Can Be Studied In Vitro Cell-culture systems that can support the growth and differ-entiation of lymphoid and myeloid stem cells have made itpossible to identify many hematopoietic growth factors. In these in vitro systems, bone-marrow stromal cells are cul-tured to form a layer of cells that adhere to a petri dish;freshly isolated bone-marrow hematopoietic cells placed onthis layer will grow, divide, and produce large visible colonies(Figure 2-2). If the cells have been cultured in semisolid agar,their progeny will be immobilized and can be analyzed forcell types. Colonies that contain stem cells can be replated toproduce mixed colonies that contain different cell types, in-cluding progenitor cells of different cell lineages. In contrast,progenitor cells, while capable of division, cannot be replatedand produce lineage-restricted colonies. Various growth factors are required for the survival, pro- liferation, differentiation, and maturation of hematopoieticcells in culture. These growth factors, the hematopoietic cytokines, are identified by their ability to stimulate the for-mation of hematopoietic cell colonies in bone-marrow cultures. Among the cytokines detected in this way of acidic glycoproteins, the colony-stimulating fac- tors (CSFs), named for their ability to induce the formation of distinct hematopoietic cell lines. Another importanthematopoietic cytokine detected by this method was the gly-coprotein erythropoietin (EPO). Produced by the kidney, this cytokine induces the terminal development of erythro-cytes and regulates the production of red blood cells. Fur-ther studies showed that the ability of a given cytokine tosignal growth and differentiation is dependent upon thepresence of a receptor for that cytokine on the surface of thetarget cell\u2014commitment of a progenitor cell to a particulardifferentiation pathway is associated with the expression ofmembrane receptors that are specific for particular cy-tokines. Many cytokines and their receptors have since beenshown to play essential roles in hematopoiesis. This topic isexplored much more fully in the chapter on cytokines(Chapter 11).

The proteins speci-fied by these genes are critical components of regulatorynetworks that direct the differentiation of the stem cell andits descendants. Much of what we know about the depen-dence of hematopoiesis on a particular gene comes fromstudies of mice in which a gene has been inactivated or\"knocked out\" by targeted disruption, which blocks the pro-duction of the protein that it encodes (see Targeted Disrup-tion of Genes, in Chapter 23). If mice fail to produce red cellsor particular white blood cells when a gene is knocked out,we conclude that the protein specified by the gene is neces-sary for development of those cells. Knockout technology isone of the most powerful tools available for determining theroles of particular genes in a broad range of processes and ithas made important contributions to the identification ofmany genes that regulate hematopoiesis. Although much remains to be done, targeted disruption and other approaches have identified a number of transcrip-tion factors (Table 2-1) that play important roles inhematopoiesis. Some of these transcription factors affectmany different hematopoietic lineages, and others affect onlya single lineage, such as the developmental pathway that leadsto lymphocytes. One transcription factor that affects multi-ple lineages is GATA-2, a member of a family of transcriptionfactors that recognize the tetranucleotide sequence GATA, anucleotide motif in target genes. A functional GATA-2 gene, which specifies this transcription factor, is essential for thedevelopment of the lymphoid, erythroid, and myeloid lin-eages. As might be expected, animals in which this gene isdisrupted die during embryonic development. In contrast toGATA-2, another transcription factor, Ikaros, is required only for the development of cells of the lymphoid lineage. Al-though Ikaros knockout mice do not produce significantnumbers of B, T, and NK cells, their production of erythro- cytes, granulocytes, and other cells of the myeloid lineage isunimpaired. Ikaros knockout mice survive embryonic devel-opment, but they are severely compromised immunologi-cally and die of infections at an early age. Hematopoietic Homeostasis Involves Many Factors Hematopoiesis is a continuous process that generally main- tains a steady state in which the production of mature bloodcells equals their loss (principally from aging). The averageerythrocyte has a life span of 120 days before it is phagocytose d and digested by macrophages in the spleen. The various whiteblood cells have life spans ranging from a few days, for neu-trophils, to as long as 20-30 years for some T lymphocytes. T omaintain steady-state levels, the average human being mustproduce an estimated 3.7 /H1100310 11white blood cells per day. Hematopoiesis is regulated by complex mechanisms that affect all of the individual cell types. These regulatory mech-anisms ensure steady-state levels of the various blood cells,yet they have enough built-in flexibility so that production ofblood cells can rapidly increase tenfold to twentyfold in re-sponse to hemorrhage or infection. Steady-state regulation ofhematopoiesis is accomplished in various ways, which in-clude: IControl of the levels and types of cytokines produced stromal cells IThe production of cytokines with hematopoietic activityby other cell types, such as activated T cells andmacrophages IThe regulation of the expression of receptors forhematopoietically active cytokines in stem cells andprogenitor cells IThe removal of some cells by the controlled induction ofcell death A failure in one or a combination of these regulatory mecha- nisms can have serious consequences. For example, abnormal-ities in the expression of hematopoietic cytokines or theirreceptors could lead to unregulated cellular proliferation andmay contribute to the development of some leukemias. Ulti-mately, the number of cells in any hematopoietic lineage is setby a balance between the number of cells removed by cell deathand the number that arise from division and differentiation.Any one or a combination of regulatory factors can affect ratesof cell reproduction and differentiation. These factors can alsodetermine whether a hematopoietic cell is induced to die. Programmed Cell Death Is an Essential Homeostatic Mechanism Programmed cell death, an induced and ordered process in which the cell actively participates in bringing about its owndemise, is a critical factor in the homeostatic regulation of TABLE 2-1Some transcription factors essential for hematopoietic lineages Factor Dependent B cells into plasma cells)8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 27 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:28 PART I Introduction many types of cell populations, including those of the hematopoietic system. Cells undergoing programmed cell death often exhibit distinctive morphologic changes, collectively referred to as apoptosis (Figures 2-3, 2-4). These changes include a pronounced decrease in cell volume, modification of the cy-toskeleton that results in membrane blebbing, a condensa-tion of the chromatin, and degradation of the DNA intosmaller fragments. Following these morphologic changes, anapoptotic cell sheds organelles. Macrophages quickly phago-cytose apoptotic bodies and cells in the advanced stages ofapoptosis. This ensures that their intracellular contents, in-cluding proteolytic and other lytic enzymes, cationic pro-teins, and oxidizing molecules are not released into thesurrounding tissue. In this way, apoptosis does not induce alocal inflammatory response. Apoptosis differs markedlyfrom necrosis, the changes associated with cell death arising from injury. In necrosis the injured cell swells and bursts, re-leasing its contents and possibly triggering a damaging in- flammatory response. Each of the leukocytes produced by hematopoiesis has a characteristic life span and then dies by programmed celldeath. In the adult human, for example, there are about5/H1100310 10neutrophils in the circulation. These cells have a life span of only a few days before programmed cell deathis initiated. This death, along with constant neutrophilproduction, maintains a stable number of these cells. Ifprogrammed cell death fails to occur, a leukemic state maydevelop. Programmed cell death also plays a role in main-taining proper numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells.For example, apoptosis. Beyondhematopoiesis, apoptosis is important in such immuno-logical processes as tolerance and the killing of target cellsby cytotoxic T cells or natural killer cells. Details of themechanisms underlying apoptosis are emerging; Chapter13 describes them mitochondriaMild intracellularcontents 2-3Comparison morphologic changes that occur in apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis, which results in the program med cell death of hematopoietic cells, does not induce a local infl amma-tory response. In contrast, necrosis, the process that leads to death of injured cells, results in release of the cells' contents, wh ich may in- duce a local inflammatory response.

Some of theproteins specified by these genes induce apoptosis, othersare critical during apoptosis, and still others inhibit apop-tosis. For example, apoptosis can be induced in thymocytesby radiation, but only if the protein p53 is present; manycell deaths are induced by signals from Fas, a molecule pre-sent on the surface of many cells; and proteases known ascaspases take part in a cascade of reactions that lead toapoptosis. On the other hand, members of the bcl-2 (B-celllymphoma 2) family of genes, bcl-2 and bcl-X Lencode pro- tein products that inhibit apoptosis. Interestingly, the firstmember of this gene family, bcl-2, was found in studies that were concerned not with cell death but with the uncon-trolled proliferation of B cells in a type of cancer known asB-lymphoma. In this case, the bcl-2 gene was at the break- point of a chromosomal translocation in a human B-celllymphoma. The translocation moved the gene into the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, resulting in tran-scriptional activation of the bcl-2 gene and overproduction of the encoded Bcl-2 protein by the lymphoma cells. Theresulting high levels of Bcl-2 are thought to help transformlymphoid cells into cancerous lymphoma cells by inhibit-ing the signals that would normally induce apoptotic celldeath. Bcl-2 levels have been found to play an important role in regulating the normal life span of various hematopoietic celllineages, including lymphocytes. A normal adult has about 5 L of blood with about 2000 lymphocytes/mm 3for a total of about 1010lymphocytes. During acute infection, the lym- phocyte count increases 4- to 15-fold, giving a total lympho-cyte count of 40-50 /H1100310 9. Because the immune system cannot sustain such a massive increase in cell numbers for anextended period, the system needs a means to eliminate un-needed activated lymphocytes once the antigenic threat haspassed. Activated lymphocytes have been found to expresslower levels of Bcl-2 and therefore are more susceptible to theinduction of apoptotic death than are naive lymphocytes or (a) (c)(b) (d) FIGURE 2-4Apoptosis.

However, if the lymphocytes continue to be activated by antigen, then the signals received during activa-tion block the apoptotic signal. As antigen levels subside, sodoes activation of the block and the lymphocytes begin to dieby apoptosis (Figure 2-5).Hematopoietic Stem Cells Can Be Enriched I. L. Weissman and colleagues developed a novel way of en-riching the concentration of mouse hematopoietic stem cells,which normally constitute less than 0.05% of all bone-marrow cells in mice. Their approach relied on the use of an-tibodies specific for molecules known as differentiation antigens, which are expressed only by particular cell types. They exposed bone-marrow samples to antibodies that hadbeen labeled with a fluorescent compound and were specificfor the differentiation antigens expressed on the surface ofmature red and white blood cells (Figure 2-6). The labeled cellswere then removed by flow cytometry with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (see Chapter 6).After each sorting, the re main- ing cells were assayed to determine the number needed of hematopoiesis in a lethally x-irradiated mouse.As the pluripotent stem cells were becoming relatively morenumerous in the remaining population, fewer and fewer cells were needed to restore hematopoiesis in this system.Because stem cells do not express differentiation antigens TABLE 2-2Genes that regulate apoptosis Gene Function Role in L (several Promotes different ones) fas Induces apoptosis Initiates FIGURE 2-5Regulation of activated B-cell numbers by apoptosis.

T o further enrich the pluripotent stem cells, the re-maining cells were incubated with various antibodies raisedagainst cells likely to be in the early stages of hematopoiesis.One of these antibodies recognized a differentiation antigencalled stem-cell antigen 1 (Sca-1). Treatment with this anti-body aided capture of undifferentiated stem cells and yieldeda preparation so enriched in pluripotent stem cells that analiquot containing only 30-100 cells routinely restoredhematopoiesis in a lethally x-irradiated mouse, whereasmore than 10 4nonenriched bone-marrow cells were needed for restoration. Using a variation of this approach, H.Nakauchi and his colleagues have devised procedures that al-low them to show that, in 1 out of 5 lethally irradiated mice,a single hematopoietic cell can give rise to both myeloid andlymphoid lineages (Table 2-3). It has been found that CD34, a marker found on about 1% of hematopoietic cells, while not actually unique to stemcells, is found on a small population of cells that containsstem cells. By exploiting the association of this marker withstem cell populations, it has become possible to routinely en-rich preparations of human stem cells.

A major tool in studies to identify and characterize the human hematopoietic stem cell is the use of SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice as in vivo assay systems for the presence and function of HSCs. SCID mice do nothave B and T lymphocytes and are unable to mount adaptiveimmune responses such as those that act in the normal rejec-tion of foreign cells, tissues, and organs. Consequently, theseanimals do not reject transplanted human cell populationscontaining HSCs or tissues such as thymus and bone mar-row. It is necessary to use immunodeficient mice as surrogateor alternative hosts in human stem-cell research becausethere is no human equivalent of the irradiated mouse. SCIDmice implanted with fragments of human thymus and bonemarrow support the differentiation of human hematopoieticstem cells into mature hematopoietic cells. Different subpop-ulations of CD34 /H11001human bone-marrow cells are injected into these SCID-human mice, and the development of vari-ous lineages of human cells in the bone-marrow fragment issubsequently assessed. In the absence of human growth fac-tors, only low numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progeni-tors develop. However, when appropriate cytokines such aserythropoietin and others are administered along withCD34 /H11001cells, progenitor and mature cells of the myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid lineages develop. This system hasenabled the study of subpopulations of CD34 /H11001cells and the effect of human growth factors on the differentiation of var-ious hematopoietic lineages. Cells of the Immune System Lymphocytes are the central cells of the immune system, re-sponsible for adaptive immunity and the immunologic at-tributes of diversity, specificity, memory, and self/nonselfrecognition. The other types of white blood cells play impor-tant roles, engulfing and destroying microorganisms, pre- senting antigens, and cytokines. body's white bloodcells and 99% of the cells in the lymph (Table 2-4). There areapproximately 10 11(range depending on body size and age: ~1010-1012) lymphocytes in the human body. These lym- phocytes continually circulate in the blood and lymph andare capable of migrating into the tissue spaces and lymphoidorgans, thereby integrating the immune system to a high degree. The lymphocytes can be broadly subdivided into three populations\u2014B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells\u2014on thebasis of function and cell-membrane components. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are large, granular lymphocytes that do not express the set of surface markers typical of B or T cells.Resting B and T lymphocytes are small, motile, nonphago-cytic cells, which cannot be distinguished morphologically. Band T lymphocytes that have not interacted with antigen\u2014referred to as naive, or unprimed\u2014are resting cells in the G 0 phase of the cell cycle. Known as small lymphocytes, these cells are only about 6 /H9262m in diameter; their cytoplasm forms a barely discernible rim around the nucleus. Small lympho-cytes have densely packed chromatin, few mitochondria, anda reticulum and Golgi The naive lymphocyte is generally thought to have ashort life span. Interaction of small lymphocytes with anti-gen, in the presence of certain cytokines discussed later, in-duces these cells to enter the cell cycle by progressing from G 0 into G 1and subsequently into S, G 2, and M (Figure 2-7a). As they progress through the cell cycle, lymphocytes enlargeinto 15 /H9262m-diameter blast cells, called lymphoblasts; these cells have a higher cytoplasm:nucleus ratio and more or-ganellar complexity than small lymphocytes (Figure 2-7b). Lymphoblasts proliferate and eventually differentiate into effector cells or into memory cells. Effector cells function in various ways to eliminate antigen. These cells have short life TABLE 2-3Reconstitution of hematopoeisis by HSCs Number of Number of mice HSCs reconstituted (%) 19 of 41(21.9%) 25 of 21(23.8%) 59 of 17(52.9%) 10 10 of 11(90.9%) 20 4 of 4(100%) SOURCE: Adapted from M.

Strikingly, these ES cells can be induced to generate many dif-ferent types of cells. Mouse ES cells havebeen shown to give rise to muscle cells,nerve cells, liver cells, pancreatic cells, and,of course, hematopoietic cells. Recent advances have made it possible to grow lines of human pluripotent cells.This is a development of considerable im-portance to the understanding of humandevelopment, and it has great therapeuticpotential. In vitro studies of the factors thatdetermine or influence the development ofhuman pluripotent stem cells along one de-velopmental path as opposed to anotherwill provide considerable insight into thefactors that affect the differentiation of cellsinto specialized types. There is also great in-terest in exploring the use of pluripotentstem cells to generate cells and tissues that could be used to replace diseased or dam-aged ones. Success in this endeavor wouldbe a major advance because transplanta-tion medicine now depends totally upon do-nated organs and tissues. Unfortunately,the need far exceeds the number of dona-tions and is increasing. Success in derivingpractical quantities of cells, tissues, and or-gans from pluripotent stem cells would pro-vide skin replacement for burn patients,heart muscle cells for those with chronicheart disease, pancreatic islet cells for pa-tients with diabetes, and neurons for use inParkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. The transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is an important ther-apy for patients whose hematopoieticsystems must be replaced. It has threemajor applications: 1. Providing a functional immune system to individuals with agenetically determinedimmunodeficiency, such as severe Stem-cell transplanta- tion holds great promise for the regener-ation of diseased, damaged, or defectivetissue. Hematopoietic stem cells are al-ready used to restore hematopoieticcells, and their use is described in theclinic below. However, rapid advances instem-cell research have raised the possi-bility that other stem-cell types, too, maysoon be routinely employed for replace-ment of other cells and tissues. Twoproperties of stem cells underlie theirutility and promise. They have the capac-ity to give rise to more differentiatedcells, and they are self-renewing, becauseeach division of a stem cell creates atleast one stem cell. If stem cells are clas-sified according to their descent and de-velopmental potential, four levels ofstem cells can be recognized: totipotent,pluripotent, multipotent, and unipotent. Totipotent cells can give rise to an en- tire organism. A fertilized egg, the zygote,is a totipotent cell. In humans the initial di-visions of the zygote and its descendantsproduce cells that are also totipotent. Infact, identical twins, each with its own pla-centa, develop when totipotent cells sepa-rate and develop into genetically identicalfetuses. Pluripotent stem cells arise fromtotipotent cells and can give rise to mostbut not all of the cell types necessary for fe-tal development. For example, humanpluripotent stem cells can give rise to all ofthe cells of the body but cannot generate aplacenta. Further differentiation of pluripo-tent stem cells leads to the formation ofmultipotent and unipotent stem cells.Multipotent stem cells can give rise to onlya limited number of cell types, and unipo-tent cells to a single cell type. Pluripotentcells, called embryonic stem cells, or sim-ply ES cells, can be isolated from early em-bryos, and for many years it has beenpossible to grow mouse ES cells as cellCLINICAL FOCUS Stem Cells\u2014Clinical Uses and Potential Bone marrow Nerve cells Heart muscle cellsHuman pluripotent stem cells Pancreatic islet cells Human pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into a variety o f different cell types, some of which are shown here.

Currently, thisprocedure is used to allow cancer patientsto donate cells before undergoing chemo-therapy and radiation treatments and thento reconstitute their hematopoietic systemfrom their own stem cells. Hematopoieticstem cells are found in cell populations thatdisplay distinctive surface antigens. One ofthese antigens is CD 34, which is present on only a small percentage (~ 1%) of the cells in adult bone marrow. An antibody specificfor CD 34is used to select cells displaying this antigen, producing a population en-riched in CD 34 /H11001stem cells. Various ver- sions of this selection procedure have beenused to enrich populations of stem cellsfrom a variety of sources. Transplantation of stem cell popula- tions may be autologous (the recipient is also the donor), syngeneic (the donor is genetically identical, i.e., an identical twinof the recipient), or allogeneic (the donor and recipient are not genetically identical).In any transplantation procedure, geneticdifferences between donor and recipientcan lead to immune-based rejection reac-tions. Aside from host rejection of trans-planted tissue (host versus graft),lymphocytes in the graft can attack the re-cipient's tissues, thereby causing graft- versus-host disease (GVHD), a life- threatening affliction. In order to suppressrejection reactions, powerful immunosup-pressive drugs must be used. Unfortu-nately, these drugs have serious sideeffects, and immunosuppression in-creases the patient's risk of infection andfurther growth of tumors. Consequently,HSC transplantation has fewest complica-tions when there is genetic identity be-tween donor and recipient. At one time, bone-marrow transplanta- tion was the only way to restore thehematopoietic system. However, the essen-tial element of bone-marrow transplanta-tion is really stem-cell transplantation.Fortunately, significant numbers of stemcells can be obtained from other tissues,such as peripheral blood and umbilical-cordblood (\"cord blood\"). These alternativesources of HSCs are attractive because thedonor does not have to undergo anesthesia and the subsequent highly invasive proce-dure that extracts bone marrow. Many in thetransplantation community believe that pe-ripheral blood will replace marrow as themajor source of hematopoietic stem cellsfor many applications. To obtain HSC-en-riched preparations from peripheral blood,agents are used to induce increased num-bers of circulating HSCs, and then the HSC-containing fraction is separated from theplasma and red blood cells in a processcalled leukopheresis. If necessary, furtherpurification can be done to remove T cellsand to enrich the CD 34 /H11001population. Umbilical cord blood already contains a significant number of hematopoietic stemcells. Furthermore, it is obtained from pla-cental tissue (the \"afterbirth\") which is nor-mally discarded. Consequently, umbilicalcord blood has become an attractivesource of cells for HSC transplantation. Al-though HSCs from cord blood fail to en-graft somewhat more often than do cellsfrom peripheral blood, grafts of cord bloodcells produce GVHD less frequently thando marrow grafts, probably because cordblood has fewer mature T cells. Beyond its current applications in can- cer treatment, many researchers feel thatautologous stem-cell transplantation willbe useful for gene therapy, the introductionof a normal gene to correct a disordercaused by a defective gene. Rapid ad-vances in genetic engineering may soonmake gene therapy a realistic treatment forgenetic disorders of blood cells, andhematopoietic stem cells are attractive ve-hicles for such an approach. The therapywould entail removing a sample ofhematopoietic stem cells from a patient,inserting a functional gene to compensatefor the defective one, and then reinjectingthe engineered stem cells into the donor.The advantage of using stem cells in genetherapy is that they are self renewing. Con-sequently, at least in theory, patients wouldhave to receive only a single injection of en-gineered stem cells. In contrast, gene ther-apy with engineered mature lymphocytesor other blood cells would require periodicinjections because these cells are not ca-pable of self renewal.combined immunodeficiency (SCID). 2. Replacing a defective hematopoietic system with a functional one to curesome patients who have a life-threatening nonmalignant geneticdisorder in hematopoiesis, such assickle-cell anemia or thalassemia. 3. Restoring the hematopoietic system of cancer patients after treatmentwith doses of chemotherapeuticagents and radiation so high thatthey destroy the system. Thesehigh-dose regimens can be muchmore effective at killing tumor cellsthan are therapies that use moreconventional doses of cytotoxicagents. Stem-cell transplantationmakes it possible to recover fromsuch drastic treatment. Also, certaincancers, such as some cases ofacute myeloid leukemia, can becured only by destroying the sourceof the leukemia cells, the patient'sown hematopoietic system. Restoration of the hematopoietic sys- tem by transplanting stem cells is facili-tated by several important technicalconsiderations. First, HSCs have extraordi-nary powers of regeneration. Experimentsin mice indicate that only a few\u2014perhaps,on occasion, a single HSC\u2014can com-pletely restore the erythroid population andthe immune system. In humans it is neces-sary to administer as little as 10% of a donor's total volume of bone marrow toprovide enough HSCs to completely re-store the hematopoietic system. Once in-jected into a vein, HSCs enter thecirculation and find their own way to thebone marrow, where they begin the processof engraftment. There is no need for a sur-geon to directly inject the cells into bones.In addition, HSCs can be preserved byfreezing. This means that hematopoieticcells can be \"banked.\" After collection, thecells are treated with a cryopreservative,frozen, and then stored for later use. Whenneeded, the frozen preparation is thawedand infused into the patient, where it re-constitutes the hematopoietic system. Thiscell-freezing technology even makes it AM et al. / Immunology 5e:36 PART I Introduction spans, generally ranging from a few days to a few weeks. Plasma cells \u2014the antibody-secreting effector cells of the B- cell lineage\u2014have a characteristic cytoplasm that containsabundant endoplasmic reticulum (to support their high rateof protein synthesis) arranged in concentric layers and alsomany Golgi vesicles (see Figure 2-7). The effector cells lineage include the cytokine-secreting T helper cell(T Hcell) and the T cytotoxic lymphocyte (T Ccell). Some of the progeny of B and T lymphoblasts differentiate into mem-ory cells. The persistence of this population of cells is respon-sible for life-long immunity to many pathogens. Memorycells look like small lymphocytes but can be distinguishedfrom naive cells by the presence or absence of certain cell-membrane molecules. Different lineages or maturational stages of lymphocytes can be distinguished by their expression of membrane mole-cules recognized by particular monoclonal antibodies (anti-bodies that are specific for a single epitope of an antigen; seeChapter 4 for a description of monoclonal antibodies). All ofthe monoclonal antibodies that react with a particular mem-brane molecule are grouped together as a cluster of dif- ferentiation (CD). Each new monoclonal antibody that recognizes a leukocyte membrane molecule is analyzed forwhether it falls within a recognized CD designation; if it doesnot, it is given a new CD designation reflecting a new mem- brane molecule. Although the CD nomenclature was origi-nally developed for the membrane molecules of humanleukocytes, the homologous membrane molecules of otherspecies, such as mice, are commonly referred to by the sameCD designations. Table 2-5 lists some common CD mole-cules (often referred to as CD markers) found on humanlymphocytes. However, this is only a partial listing of themore than 200 CD markers that have been described. A com-plete list and description of known CD markers is in the ap-pendix at the end of this book. The general characteristics and functions of B and T lym- phocytes were described in Chapter 1 and are reviewedbriefly in the next sections. These central cells of the immunesystem will be examined in more detail in later chapters. B LYMPHOCYTES The B lymphocyte derived its letter designation from its siteof maturation, in the bursa of Fabricius in birds; the name turned out to be apt, for bone marrow is its major site of mat- uration in a number of mammalian species, including hu-mans and mice. Mature B cells are definitively distinguishedfrom other lymphocytes by their synthesis and display ofmembrane-bound immunoglobulin (antibody) molecules, TABLE 2-5Common CD markers used to distinguish functional lymphocyte sub populations T CELL CD designation*Function B cell T molecules; IgG /H11002/H11002 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 37 which serve as receptors for antigen. Each of the approxi- mately 1.5 /H11003105molecules of antibody on the membrane of a single B cell has an identical binding site for antigen.Among the other molecules expressed on the membrane ofmature B cells are the following: IB220 (a form of CD45) is frequently used as a marker for B cells and their precursors. However, unlikeantibody, it is not expressed uniquely by B-lineage cells. IClass II MHC molecules permit the B cell to function as an antigen-presenting cell (APC). ICR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21) are receptors for certain complement products. IFc/H9253RII(CD32) is a receptor for IgG, a type of antibody. IB7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are molecules that interact with CD28 and CTLA-4, important regulatorymolecules on the surface of different types of T cells,including T Hcells. ICD40 is a molecule that interacts with CD40 ligand on the surface of helper T cells. In most cases thisinteraction is critical for the survival of antigen-stimulated B cells and for their development intoantibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. Interaction between antigen and the membrane-bound anti- body on a mature naive B cell, as well as interactions with Tcells and macrophages, selectively induces the activation anddifferentiation of B-cell clones of corresponding specificity.In this process, the B cell divides repeatedly and differentiate s over a 4- to 5-day period, generating a population of plasmacells and memory cells. Plasma cells, which have lower levelsof membrane-bound antibody than B cells, synthesize andsecrete antibody. All clonal progeny from a given B cell se-crete antibody molecules with the same antigen-bindingspecificity. Plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells,and many die in 1 or 2 weeks. T LYMPHOCYTES T lymphocytes derive their name from their site of matura-tion in the thymus. Like B lymphocytes, these cells have membrane receptors for antigen. Although the antigen-binding T-cell receptor is structurally distinct from im-munoglobulin, it does share some common structuralfeatures with the immunoglobulin molecule, most notably inthe structure of its antigen-binding site. Unlike the mem-brane-bound antibody on B cells, though, the T-cell receptor(TCR) does not recognize free antigen. Instead the TCR rec-ognizes only antigen that is bound to particular classes ofself-molecules. Most T cells recognize antigen only when it isbound to a self-molecule encoded by genes within the majorhistocompatibility complex (MHC). Thus, as explained inChapter 1, a fundamental difference between the humoraland cell-mediated branches of the immune system is that theB cell is capable of binding soluble antigen, whereas the T cellis restricted to binding antigen displayed on self-cells. T o be recognized by most T cells, this antigen must be displayed to-gether with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-pre-senting cells or on virus-infected cells, cancer cells, andgrafts. The T-cell system has developed to eliminate these al-tered self-cells, which pose a threat to the normal functioningof the body. Like B cells, T cells express distinctive membrane mole- cules. All T-cell subpopulations express the T-cell receptor, polypeptides that includes CD3; and most can bedistinguished by the presence of one or the other of twomembrane molecules, CD4 and CD8. In addition, most ma-ture T cells express the following membrane molecules: ICD28, a receptor for the co-stimulatory B7 family of molecules present on B cells and other antigen-presenting cells ICD45, a signal-transduction molecule T cells that express the membrane glycoprotein molecule CD4 are restricted to recognizing antigen bound to class IIMHC molecules, whereas T cells expressing CD8, a dimericmembrane glycoprotein, are restricted to recognition of anti-gen bound to class I MHC molecules. Thus the expression ofCD4 versus CD8 corresponds to the MHC restriction of theT cell. In general, expression of CD4 and of CD8 also definestwo major functional subpopulations of T lymphocytes.CD4 /H11001T cells generally function as T helper (T H) cells and are class-II restricted; CD8/H11001T cells generally function as T cyto- toxic (T C) cells and are class-I restricted. Thus the ratio of T H to T Ccells in a sample can be approximated by assaying the number of CD4/H11001and CD8/H11001T cells. This ratio is approxi- mately 2:1 in normal human peripheral blood, but it may besignificantly altered by immunodeficiency diseases, autoim-mune diseases, and other disorders. The classification of CD4 /H11001class II-restricted cells as T H cells and CD8/H11001class I-restricted cells as T Ccells is not ab- solute. Some CD4/H11001cells can act as killer cells. Also, some T C cells have been shown to secrete a variety of cytokines and ex-ert an effect on other cells comparable to that exerted by T H cells. The distinction between T Hand T Ccells, then, is not al- ways clear; there can be ambiguous functional activities.However, because these ambiguities are the exception andnot the rule, the generalization of T helper (T H) cells as being CD4/H11001and class-II restricted and of T cytotoxic cells (T C) as being CD8/H11001and class-I restricted is assumed throughout this text, unless otherwise specified. THcells are activated by recognition of an antigen-class II MHC complex on an antigen-presenting cell. After activa-tion, the T Hcell begins to divide and gives rise to a clone of effector cells, each specific for the same antigen-class IIMHC complex. These T Hcells secrete various cytokines, which play a central role in the activation of B cells, T cells,and other cells that participate in the immune response.Changes in the pattern of cytokines produced by T Hcells can change the type of immune response that develops among8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 37 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:38 PART I Introduction other leukocytes. The TH1 response produces a cytokine profile that supports inflammation and activates mainly cer-tain T cells and macrophages, whereas the T H2 response ac- tivates mainly B cells and immune responses that dependupon antibodies. T Ccells are activated when they interact with an antigen-class I MHC complex on the surface of analtered self-cell (e.g., a virus-infected cell or a tumor cell) in the presence of appropriate cytokines. This activation, whichresults in proliferation, causes the T Ccell to differentiate into an effector cell called a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). In contrast to T Hcells, most CTLs secrete few cytokines. In- stead, CTLs acquire the ability to recognize and eliminate al-tered self-cells. Another subpopulation of T lymphocytes\u2014called T sup- pressor (T S) cells \u2014has been postulated. It is clear that some T cells help to suppress the humoral and the cell-mediatedbranches of the immune system, but the actual isolation andcloning of normal T Scells is a matter of controversy and dis- pute among immunologists. For this reason, it is uncertainwhether T Scells do indeed constitute a separate functional subpopulation of T cells. Some immunologists believe thatthe suppression mediated by T cells observed in some sys-tems is simply the consequence of activities of T Hor T Csub- populations whose end results are suppressive. NATURAL KILLER CELLS The natural killer cell was first described in 1976, when it wasshown that the body contains a small population of large,granular lymphocytes that display cytotoxic activity against awide range of tumor cells in the absence of any previous im-munization with the tumor. NK cells were subsequentlyshown to play an important role in host defense both againsttumor cells and against cells infected with some, though notall, viruses. These cells, which constitute 5%-10% of lym-phocytes in human peripheral blood, do not express themembrane molecules and receptors that distinguish T- andB-cell lineages. Although NK cells do not have T-cell recep-tors or immunoglobulin incorporated in their plasma mem-branes, they can recognize potential target cells in twodifferent ways. In some cases, an NK cell employs NK cell re-ceptors to distinguish abnormalities, notably a reduction inthe display of class I MHC molecules and the unusual profileof surface antigens displayed by some tumor cells and cellsinfected by some viruses. Another way in which NK cells rec-ognize potential target cells depends upon the fact that sometumor cells and cells infected by certain viruses display anti-gens against which the immune system has made an anti-body response, so that antitumor or antiviral antibodies arebound to their surfaces. Because NK cells express CD16, amembrane receptor for the carboxyl-terminal end of the IgGmolecule, called the Fc region, they can attach to these anti-bodies and subsequently destroy the targeted cells. This is anexample of a process known as antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The exact mechanism of NK-cell cytotoxicity, the focus of much current experimentalstudy, is described further in Chapter 14.Several observations suggest that NK cells play an impor- tant role in host defense against tumors. For example, in hu-mans the Chediak-Higashi syndrome \u2014an autosomal NK cells and an increased inci-dence of lymphomas. Likewise, mice with an autosomalmutation called beige lack NK cells; these mutants are more susceptible than normal mice to tumor growth following in-jection with live tumor cells. There has been growing recognition of a cell type, the NK1-T cell, that has some of the characteristics of both T cells and NK cells. Like T cells, NK1-T cells have T cell recep-tors (TCRs). Unlike most T cells, the TCRs of NK1-T cells in-teract with MHC-like molecules called CD1 rather than withclass I or class II MHC molecules. Like NK cells, they havevariable levels of CD16 and other receptors typical of NKcells, and they can kill cells. A population of triggered NK1-Tcells can rapidly secrete large amounts of the cytokinesneeded to support antibody production by B cells as well asinflammation and the development and expansion of cyto-toxic T cells. Some immunologists view this cell type as a kind of rapid response system that has evolved to pro-vide early help while conventional T Hresponses are still developing. Mononuclear Phagocytes The mononuclear phagocytic system consists of monocytes circulating in the blood and macrophages in the tissues (Figure 2-8). During hematopoiesis in the bone marrow,granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells differentiate intopromonocytes, which leave the bone marrow and enter the blood, where they further differentiate into maturemonocytes. Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream forabout 8 h, during which they enlarge; they then migrate intothe tissues and differentiate into specific tissue macrophagesor, as discussed later, into dendritic cells. Differentiation of a monocyte into a tissue macrophage involves a number of changes: The cell enlarges five- ten-fold; its intracellular organelles increase in both number andcomplexity; and it acquires increased phagocytic ability, pro-duces higher levels of hydrolytic enzymes, and begins to se-crete a variety of soluble factors. Macrophages are dispersedthroughout the body. Some take up residence in particulartissues, becoming fixed macrophages, whereas others remainmotile and are called free, or wandering, macrophages. Freemacrophages travel by amoeboid movement throughout the tissues. Macrophage-like cells serve different functions indifferent tissues and are named according to their tissue location: IAlveolar macrophages in the lung IHistiocytes in connective tissues IKupffer cells in the liver IMesangial cells in the kidney8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 38 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 39 IMicroglial cells in the brain IOsteoclasts in bone Although normally in a resting state, macrophages are acti- vated by a variety of stimuli in the course of an immune re-sponse. Phagocytosis of particulate antigens serves as aninitial activating stimulus. However, macrophage activity canbe further enhanced by cytokines secreted by activated T H cells, by mediators of the inflammatory response, and bycomponents of bacterial cell walls. One of the most potentactivators of macrophages is interferon gamma (IFN- /H9253) se- creted by activated T Hcells. Activated macrophages are more effective than resting ones in eliminating potential pathogens, because they exhibitgreater phagocytic activity, an increased ability to kill in-gested microbes, increased secretion of inflammatory medi-ators, and an increased ability to activate T cells. In addition,activated macrophages, but not resting ones, secrete various cytotoxic proteins that help them eliminate a broad range ofpathogens, including virus-infected cells, tumor cells, and in-tracellular bacteria. Activated macrophages also expresshigher levels of class II MHC molecules, allowing them tofunction more effectively as antigen-presenting cells. Thus,macrophages and T Hcells facilitate each other's activation during the immune response. PHAGOCYTOSIS Macrophages are capable of ingesting and digesting exoge-nous antigens, such as whole microorganisms and insolubleparticles, and endogenous matter, such as injured or deadhost cells, cellular debris, and activated clotting factors. In th e first step in phagocytosis, macrophages are attracted by andmove toward a variety of substances generated in an immuneresponse; this process is called chemotaxis. The next step in phagocytosis is adherence of the antigen to the macrophagecell membrane. Complex antigens, such as whole bacterialcells or viral particles, tend to adhere well and are readilyphagocytosed; isolated proteins and encapsulated bacteriatend to adhere poorly and are less readily phagocytosed. Ad-herence induces membrane protrusions, called pseudopo- dia, to extend around the attached material (Figure 2-9a). Fusion of the pseudopodia encloses the material within amembrane-bounded structure called a phagosome, which then enters the endocytic processing pathway (Figure 2-9b).In this pathway, a phagosome moves toward the cell interior,where it fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. Lysosomes contain lysozyme and a variety of other hy-drolytic enzymes that digest the ingested material. The di-gested contents of the phagolysosome are then eliminated ina process called exocytosis (see Figure 2-9b). The macrophage membrane has receptors for certain classes of antibody. If an antigen (e.g., a bacterium) is coatedwith the appropriate antibody, the complex of antigen andantibody binds to antibody receptors on the macrophagemembrane more readily than antigen alone and phagocyto-sis is enhanced. In one study, for example, the rate of phago-cytosis of an antigen was 4000-fold higher in the presence ofspecific antibody to the antigen than in its absence. Thus, an-tibody functions as an opsonin, a molecule that binds to both antigen and macrophage and enhances phagocytosis.The process by which particulate antigens are rendered moresusceptible to phagocytosis is called opsonization. CYTOTOXIC number antimicrobial and substances pro- duced by activated macrophages can destroy phagocytosedmicroorganisms (Table 2-6). Many of the mediators of cyto-toxicity listed in Table 2-6 are reactive forms of oxygen. OXYGEN-DEPENDENT KILLING MECHANISMS Activated produce number and a macrophage. Macrophages are five- to tenfold larger than monocy tes and contain more organelles, especially lysosomes.8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 39 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:40 PART Introduction oxide and chloride ions.

Recent evidence suggests thatmuch of the antimicrobial activity of macrophages againstbacteria, fungi, parasitic worms, and protozoa is due to nitricoxide and substances derived from it. OXYGEN-INDEPENDENT KILLING MECHANISMS Acti- vated macrophages also synthesize lysozyme and hy- drolytic enzymes whose degradative activities do not requireoxygen.

(TNF- /H9251),a cytokine that has a variety of effects and is cyto- toxic for some tumor cells. ANTIGEN PROCESSING AND PRESENTATION Although most of the antigen ingested by macrophages is de-graded and eliminated, experiments with radiolabeled anti-gens have demonstrated the presence of antigen peptides onthe macrophage membrane. As depicted in Figure 2-9b,phagocytosed antigen is digested within the endocytic pro-cessing pathway into peptides that associate with class IIMHC molecules; these peptide-class II MHC complexesthen move to the macrophage membrane. Activation ofmacrophages induces increased expression of both class IIMHC molecules and the co-stimulatory B7 family of mem-brane molecules, thereby rendering the macrophages moreeffective in activating T Hcells. This processing and presenta- tion of antigen, examined in detail in Chapter 7, are critical toT H-cell activation, a central event in the development of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. SECRETION OF FACTORS A number of important proteins central to development ofimmune responses are secreted by activated macrophages(Table 2-7). These include collection of such asinterleukin 1 (IL-1), TNF- /H9251and interleukin 6 (IL-6), that promote inflammatory responses. Typically, each of theseagents has a variety of effects. For example, IL-1 activateslymphocytes; and IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- /H9251promote the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus.Activated macrophages secrete a variety of factors in- volved in the development of an inflammatory response. Thecomplement proteins are a group of proteins that assist in eliminating foreign pathogens and in promoting the ensuinginflammatory reaction. The major site of synthesis of com-plement proteins is the liver, although these proteins are alsoproduced in macrophages. The hydrolytic enzymes con-tained within the lysosomes of macrophages also can be se-creted when the cells are activated. The buildup of theseenzymes within the tissues contributes to the inflammatoryresponse and can, in some cases, contribute to extensive tis-sue damage. Activated macrophages also secrete soluble fac-tors, such as TNF- /H9251, that can kill a variety of cells. The secretion of these cytotoxic factors has been shown to con-tribute to tumor destruction by macrophages. Finally, asmentioned earlier, activated secrete a stimulate classified as neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils on the basis of cellular cyto-plasmic staining characteristics (Figure 2-10). The neu- trophil has a multilobed nucleus and a granulated cytoplasm that stains with both acid and basic dyes; it is often called apolymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) for its multilobed nu-cleus. The eosinophil has a bilobed nucleus and a granulated cytoplasm that stains with the acid dye eosin red (hence itsname). The basophil has a lobed nucleus and heavily granu- lated cytoplasm that stains with and eosinophils are phagocytic, whereasbasophils are not. Neutrophils, which constitute 50%-70%of the circulating white blood cells, are much more eosinophils (1%-3%) hematopoiesis in the bone mar- row. They are released into the peripheral blood and circulatefor 7-10 h before migrating into the tissues, where they havea life span of only a few days. In response to many types of in-fections, the bone marrow releases more than the usual num-ber of neutrophils and these cells generally are the first toarrive at a site of inflammation. The resulting transient in-crease in the number of circulating neutrophils, called leuko- cytosis, is used medically as an indication of infection. Movement of circulating neutrophils into tissues, called extravasation, takes several steps: the cell first adheres to the vascular endothelium, then penetrates the gap betweenadjacent endothelial cells lining the vessel wall, and finallypenetrates the vascular basement membrane, moving outinto the tissue spaces. (This process is described in detail inChapter 15.) A number of substances generated in an inflam-matory reaction serve as chemotactic factors that promote accumulation of neutrophils at an inflammatory site. Amongthese chemotactic factors are some of the complement TABLE 2-7Some factors secreted by activated macrophages Factor Function Interleukin 1(IL-1) Promotes inflammatory responses and fever Interleukin 6(IL-6) Promote innate immunity and TNF- /H9251 elimination of pathogens Complement proteins Promote inflammatory response and elimination of pathogens Hydrolytic enzymes Promote inflammatory responseInterferon alpha Activates cellular genes, resulting (IFN- /H9251) in the production of proteins that confer an antiviral state on the cell Tumor necrosis factor Kills tumor cells (TNF- /H9251) GM-CSFG-CSF Promote inducible :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:42 PART I Introduction components, components of the blood-clotting system, and sev- eral cytokines are active phagocytic cells. Phagocytosis by neutrophils is similar to that described formacrophages, except that the lytic enzymes and bactericidalsubstances in neutrophils are contained within primary andsecondary granules (see Figure 2-10a). The larger, denser pri-mary granules are a type of lysosome containing peroxidase,lysozyme, and various hydrolytic enzymes. The smaller sec-ondary granules contain collagenase, lactoferrin, and lyso-zyme. Both primary and secondary granules fuse withphagosomes, whose contents are then digested and elimi-nated much as they are in macrophages.Neutrophils also employ both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent pathways to generate antimicrobialsubstances. Neutrophils are in fact much more likely thanmacrophages to kill ingested microorganisms. Neutrophilsexhibit a larger respiratory burst than macrophages and con-sequently are able to generate more reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen intermediates (see neutrophils, are motile phagocytic cells thatcan migrate from the blood into the tissue spaces. Theirphagocytic role is significantly less important than that ofneutrophils, and it is thought that they play a role in the de-fense against parasitic organisms (see Chapter 17). The se-creted contents of eosinophilic granules may damage theparasite are nonphagocytic that function byreleasing pharmacologically active substances from their cy-toplasmic granules. These substances play a major role in cer-tain allergic responses. MAST CELLS Mast-cell precursors, which are formed in the bone marrowby hematopoiesis, are released into the blood as undifferenti-ated cells; they do not differentiate until they leave the bloodand enter the tissues. Mast cells can be found in a wide vari-ety of tissues, including the skin, connective tissues of variousorgans, and mucosal epithelial tissue of the respiratory, geni-tourinary, and digestive tracts. Like circulating basophils,these cells have large numbers of cytoplasmic granules thatcontain histamine and other pharmacologically active sub-stances. Mast cells, together with blood basophils, play an im-portant role in the development of allergies. DENDRITIC CELLS The dendritic cell (DC) acquired its name because it is cov- ered with long membrane extensions that resemble the den-drites of nerve cells. Dendritic cells can be difficult to isolat e because the conventional procedures for cell isolation tend todamage their long extensions. The development of isolationtechniques that employ enzymes and gentler dispersion hasfacilitated isolation of these cells for study in vitro. There ar e many types of dendritic cells, although most mature den-dritic cells have the same major function, the presentation ofantigen to T Hcells. Four types of dendritic arises from hematopoi-etic stem cells via different pathways and in different loca-tions. Figure 2-11 shows that they descend through both themyeloid and lymphoid lineages. Despite of granulo- cytes. Note differences in the shape of the nucleus and in the num- ber and shape of cytoplasmic granules.8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 42 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 43 they all constitutively express high levels of both class II MHC molecules and members of the co-stimulatory B7 fam-ily. For this reason, they are more potent antigen-presentingcells than macrophages and B cells, both of which need to beactivated before they can function as antigen-presenting cells(APCs). Immature or precursor forms of each of these typesof dendritic cells acquire antigen by phagocytosis or endocy-tosis; the antigen is processed, and mature dendritic cells pre-sent it to T Hcells. Following microbial invasion or during inflammation, mature and immature forms of Langerhanscells and interstitial dendritic cells migrate into draininglymph nodes, where they make the critical presentation ofantigen to T Hcells that is required for the initiation of re- sponses by those key cells. Another type of dendritic cell, the follicular dendritic cell (Figure 2-12), does not arise in bone marrow and has a dif-ferent function from the antigen-presenting dendritic cellsdescribed above. Follicular dendritic cells do not express classII MHC molecules and therefore do not function as antigen-presenting cells for T H-cell activation. These dendritic cells were named for their exclusive location in organized struc-tures of the lymph node called lymph follicles, which are richin B cells. Although they do not express class II molecules,follicular dendritic cells express high levels of membrane re-ceptors for antibody, which allows the binding of antigen-an-tibody complexes. The interaction of B cells with this bound antigen can have important effects on B cell responses. Organs of the Immune System A number of morphologically and functionally diverse or-gans and tissues have various functions in the developmentof immune responses. These can be distinguished by func-tion as the primary and secondary lymphoid organs (Fig- ure 2-13). The thymus and bone marrow are the primary (orcentral) lymphoid organs, where maturation of lymphocytestakes place. The lymph nodes, spleen, and various mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) such as gut-associatedlymphoid tissue (GALT) are the secondary (or peripheral)lymphoid organs, which trap antigen and provide sites formature lymphocytes to interact with that antigen. In addi-tion, tertiary lymphoid tissues, which normally contain fewer lymphoid cells than secondary lymphoid organs, canimport lymphoid cells during an inflammatory response.Most prominent of these are cutaneous-associated lymphoidtissues. Once mature lymphocytes have been generated in theprimary lymphoid organs, they circulate in the blood andlymphatic system, a network of vessels that collect fluid that has escaped into the tissues from capillaries of the circulatorysystem and ultimately return it to the blood. Primary Lymphoid Organs Immature lymphocytes generated in hematopoiesis matureand become committed to a particular antigenic specificitywithin the primary lymphoid organs.

T cells arise in the thymus, and in many mammals\u2014humans and mice for example\u2014B cells origi-nate in bone marrow.THYMUS The thymus is the site of T-cell development and maturation. It is a flat, bilobed organ situated above the heart. Each lobeis surrounded by a capsule and is divided into lobules, whichare separated from each other by strands of connective tissuecalled trabeculae. Each lobule is organized into two compart-ments: the outer compartment, or cortex, is densely packed with immature T cells, called thymocytes, whereas the innercompartment, or medulla, is sparsely populated with thymo- cytes. Both the cortex and medulla of the criss- crossed by a three-dimensional stromal-cell network com-posed of epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages,which make up the framework of the organ and contribute tothe growth and maturation of thymocytes. Many of thesestromal cells interact physically with the developing thymo-cytes (Figure 2-14). Some thymic epithelial cells in the outercortex, called nurse cells, have long membrane extensions that surround as many as 50 thymocytes, forming large mul-ticellular complexes. Other cortical epithelial cells have longinterconnecting cytoplasmic extensions that form a networkand have been shown to interact with numerous thymocytesas they traverse the cortex. The function of the thymus is to generate and select a repertoire of T cells that will protect the body from infection.As thymocytes develop, an enormous diversity of T-cell re-ceptors is generated by a random process (see Chapter 9) thatproduces some T cells with receptors capable of recognizingantigen-MHC complexes. However, most of the T-cell recep-tors produced by this random process are incapable of recog-nizing antigen-MHC complexes and a small portion reactwith combinations of self antigen-MHC complexes. Usingmechanisms that are discussed in Chapter 10, the thymus in-duces the death of those T cells that cannot recognize anti-gen-MHC complexes and those that react with self-antigen-MHC and pose a danger of causing autoimmune disease.More than 95% of all thymocytes die by apoptosis in the thy-mus without ever reaching maturity. THE THYMUS AND IMMUNE FUNCTION The role of the thymus in immune function can be studied in mice by exam-ining the effects of neonatal thymectomy, a procedure inwhich the thymus is surgically removed from newborn mice.These thymectomized mice show a dramatic decrease in cir-culating lymphocytes of the T-cell lineage and an absence ofcell-mediated immunity. Other evidence of the importanceof the thymus comes from studies of a congenital birth defectin humans (DiGeorge's syndrome) and in certain mice (nude mice) in which the thymus fails to develop. In both cases, there is an absence of circulating T cells and of cell-me-diated immunity and an increase in infectious disease. Aging is accompanied by a decline in thymic function. This decline may play some role in the decline in immunefunction during aging in humans and mice. The thymusreaches its maximal size at puberty and then atrophies, witha significant decrease in both cortical and medullary marrowAppendixLargeintestineThymusRightlymphaticduct Tissue lymphatics FIGURE 2-13 The human lymphoid system.

Whereas the average weight of the thymus is 70 g in infants, its age-depen-dent involution leaves an organ with an average weight ofonly 3 g in the elderly (Figure 2-15). A number of experiments have been designed to look at the effect of age on the immune function of the thymus. Inone experiment, the thymus from a 1-day-old or 33-month-old mouse was grafted into thymectomized adults. (For mostlaboratory mice, 33 months is very old.) Mice receiving thenewborn thymus graft showed a significantly larger improve-ment in immune function than mice receiving the 33-month-old thymus. BONE MARROW In humans and mice, bone marrow is the site of B-cell originand development. Arising from lymphoid progenitors, im-mature B cells proliferate and differentiate within the bonemarrow, and stromal cells within the bone marrow interactdirectly with the B cells and secrete various cytokines that ar e required for development. Like thymic selection during T-cell maturation, a selection process within the bone marroweliminates B cells with self-reactive antibody receptors. Thisprocess is explained in detail in Chapter 11. Bone marrow is not the site of B-cell development in all species. In birds,a lymphoid organ called the bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoidtissue associated with the gut, is the primary site of B-cell maturation. In mammals such as primates and rodents, thereis no bursa and no single counterpart to it as a primary lym-phoid organ. In cattle and sheep, the primary lymphoid tis-sue hosting the maturation, proliferation, and diversificationof B cells early in gestation is the fetal spleen.

Also prese nt in the outer cortex are thymic nurse cells (gray), which are speci alized epithelial cells with long membrane extensions that surround asmany as 50thymocytes. The medulla is sparsely populated and is thought to contain thymocytes that are more mature. During thei rstay within the thymus, thymocytes interact with various stroma l cells, including cortical epithelial cells (light red), medulla ry epithelial cells (tan), interdigitating dendritic cells (purple), and macr ophages (yellow). These cells produce thymic hormones and express high lev- els of class I and class II MHC molecules. Hassalls corpuscles,found in the medulla, contain concentric layers of degenerating ep- ithelial cells. [ Adapted, with permission, from W. van Ewijk, 1991, Annu. Rev.

The rabbit, too, uses gut-associated tissues such as the appendix as primary lym-phoid tissue for important steps in the proliferation and di-versification of B cells. Lymphatic System As blood circulates under pressure, its fluid component(plasma) seeps through the thin wall of the capillaries into the surrounding tissue. Much of this fluid, called interstitial fluid, returns to the blood through the capillary membranes. The remainder of the interstitial fluid, now called lymph, flows from the spaces in connective tissue into a network oftiny open lymphatic capillaries and then into a series of pro-gressively larger collecting vessels called lymphatic vessels (Figure 2-16). The largest lymphatic vessel, the thoracic duct, empties into the left subclavian vein near the heart (see Figure 2-13).In this way, the lymphatic system captures fluid lost from theblood and returns it to the blood, thus ensuring steady-statelevels of fluid within the circulatory system. The heart doesnot pump the lymph through the lymphatic system; insteadthe flow of lymph is achieved as the lymph vessels aresqueezed by movements of the body's muscles. A series ofone-way valves along the lymphatic vessels ensures thatlymph flows only in one direction. When a foreign antigen gains entrance to the tissues, it is picked up by the lymphatic system (which drains all the tissues of the body) and is carried to various organized lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, which trap the foreign antigen. As lymph passes from the tissues to lym-phatic vessels, it becomes progressively enriched in lympho-cytes. Thus, the lymphatic system also serves as a means of transporting lymphocytes and antigen from the connec-tive tissues to organized lymphoid tissues where the lympho-cytes may interact with the trapped antigen and undergoactivation. Secondary Lymphoid Organs Various types of organized lymphoid tissues are locatedalong the vessels of the lymphatic system. Some lymphoidtissue in the lung and lamina propria of the intestinal wallconsists of diffuse collections of lymphocytes and macro-phages. Other lymphoid tissue is organized into structurescalled lymphoid follicles, which consist of aggregates of lym-phoid and nonlymphoid cells surrounded by a network ofdraining lymphatic capillaries. Until it is activated by anti-gen, a lymphoid follicle\u2014called a primary follicle \u2014com- of dendritic cells and small restingB cells. After an antigenic challenge, a primary follicle be-comes a larger secondary follicle \u2014a ring of concentrically packed B lymphocytes surrounding a center (the germinal center ) in which one finds a focus of proliferating B lympho- cytes and an area that contains nondividing B cells, and somehelper T cells interspersed with macrophages and folliculardendritic cells (Figure 2-17). Most antigen-activated B cells divide and differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells in lymphoid follicles,but only a few B cells in the antigen-activated population findtheir way into germinal centers. Those that do undergo oneor more rounds of cell division, during which the genes thatencode their antibodies mutate at an unusually high rate.Following the period of division and mutation, there is a rig-orous selection process in which more than 90% of these Bcells die by apoptosis. In general, those B cells producing an-tibodies that bind antigen more strongly have a much betterchance of surviving than do their weaker companions. Thesmall number of B cells that survive the germinal center's rig-orous selection differentiate into plasma cells or memory FIGURE 2-16Lymphatic vessels. Small lymphatic capillaries open- ing into the tissue spaces pick up interstitial tissue fluid an d carry it into progressively larger lymphatic vessels, which carry the fl uid, now called lymph, into regional lymph nodes. As lymph leaves the no des, it is carried through larger efferent lymphatic vessels, which eventu- ally drain into the circulatory system at the thoracic duct or right lymph duct :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 47 cells and emerge. The process of B-cell proliferation, muta- tion, and selection in germinal centers is described more fullyin Chapter 11. Lymph nodes and the spleen are the most highly orga- nized of the secondary lymphoid organs; they comprise notonly follicles, but additional distinct regions of T-cell and B-cell activity, and they are surrounded by a fibrouscapsule. Less-organized lymphoid tissue, collectively calledmucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), is found invarious body sites. MALT includes Peyer's patches (in thesmall intestine), the tonsils, and the appendix, well lymphoid follicles mucous membranes lining the upperairways, bronchi, and genital tract. LYMPH NODES Lymph nodes are the sites where immune responses aremounted to antigens in lymph. They are encapsulated bean-shaped network packedwith lymphocytes, dendritic cells. Clus-tered at junctions of the lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes arethe first organized lymphoid structure to encounter antigens that enter the tissue spaces. As lymph percolates through anode, any particulate antigen that is brought in with thelymph will be trapped by the cellular network of phagocyticcells and dendritic cells (follicular and interdigitating). Theoverall architecture of a lymph node supports an ideal mi-croenvironment for lymphocytes to effectively encounterand respond to trapped antigens. Morphologically, a lymph node can be divided into three roughly concentric regions: the cortex, the paracortex, andthe medulla, each of which supports a distinct microenviron-ment (Figure 2-18). The outermost layer, the cortex, contains lymphocytes (mostly B cells), macro-phages, and folliculardendritic cells arranged in primary follicles. After antigenicchallenge, the primary follicles enlarge into secondary folli-cles, each containing a germinal center. In children with B-celldeficiencies, the cortex lacks primary follicles and germinalcenters. Beneath the cortex is the paracortex, which is popu- lated largely by T lymphocytes and also contains interdigitat-ing dendritic cells thought to have migrated from tissues tothe node. These interdigitating dendritic cells express highlevels of class II MHC molecules, which are necessary for pre-senting antigen to T Hcells. Lymph nodes taken from neona- tally thymectomized mice have unusually few cells in theparacortical region; the paracortex is therefore sometimes re-ferred to as a thymus-dependent area in contrast to the cor- tex, which is a thymus-independent area. The innermost layer of a lymph node, the medulla, is more sparsely popu- lated with lymphoid-lineage cells; of those present, many areplasma cells actively secreting antibody molecules. As antigen is carried into a regional node by the lymph, it is trapped, processed, and presented together with class IIMHC molecules by interdigitating dendritic cells in the para-cortex, resulting in the activation of T Hcells. The initial acti- vation of B cells is also thought to take place within theT-cell-rich paracortex. Once activated, T Hand B cells form small foci consisting largely of proliferating B cells at theedges of the paracortex. Some B cells within the foci differen-tiate into plasma cells secreting IgM and IgG. These focireach maximum size within 4-6 days of antigen challenge.Within 4-7 days of antigen challenge, a few B cells and T H cells migrate to the primary follicles of the cortex. It is notknown what causes this migration. Within a primary follicle,cellular interactions between follicular dendritic cells, B cell s, and T Hcells take place, leading to development of a sec- ondary follicle with a central germinal center. Some of theplasma cells generated in the germinal center move to themedullary areas of the lymph node, and many migrate tobone marrow. Afferent lymphatic vessels pierce the capsule of a lymph node at numerous sites and empty lymph into the subcapsu-lar sinus (see Figure 2-18b). Lymph coming from the tissuespercolates slowly inward through the cortex, paracortex, andmedulla, allowing phagocytic cells and dendritic cells to trapany bacteria or particulate material (e.g., antigen-antibodycomplexes) carried by the lymph. After infection or the FIGURE 2-17 A secondary lymphoid follicle consisting of a large germinal center (gc) surrounded by a dense mantle (m) of small lym- phocytes. [ From W. Bloom and D. W.

The increase in lymphocytes in lymph leaving a node is due in part to lymphocyte proliferation within the node inresponse to antigen. Most of the increase, however, repre-sents blood-borne lymphocytes that migrate into the nodeby passing between specialized endothelial cells that line thepostcapillary venules of the node. Estimates are that 25% of the lymphocytes leaving a lymph node have migrated acrossthis endothelial layer and entered the node from the blood.Because antigenic stimulation within a node can increase thismigration tenfold, the concentration of lymphocytes in anode that is actively responding can increase greatly, and thenode swells visibly. Factors released in lymph nodes duringantigen stimulation are thought to facilitate this increasedmigration.FIGURE 2-18Structure of a lymph node. (a) The three layers of a lymph node support distinct microenvironments. (b) The left sid e depicts the arrangement of reticulum and lymphocytes within thevarious regions of a lymph node. Macrophages and dendritic cell s, which trap antigen, are present in the cortex and paracortex. T Hcells are concentrated in the paracortex; B cells are located primari ly in the cortex, within follicles and cells. Lymphocytes c ircu- lating in the lymph are carried into the node by afferent lymph atic vessels; they either enter the reticular matrix of the node or pass through it and leave by the efferent lymphatic vessel. The righ t side of (b) depicts the lymphatic artery and vein and the postcapill ary venules. Lymphocytes in the circulation can pass into the node from the postcapillary venules by a process called extravasation ( PM Page :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 49 SPLEEN The spleen plays a major role in mounting immune re- sponses to antigens in the blood stream. It is a large, ovoidsecondary lymphoid organ situated high in the left abdomi-nal cavity. While lymph nodes are specialized for trappingantigen from local tissues, the spleen specializes in filteringblood and trapping blood-borne antigens; thus, it can re-spond to systemic infections. Unlike the lymph nodes, thespleen is not supplied by lymphatic vessels. Instead, blood-borne antigens and lymphocytes are carried into the spleenthrough the splenic artery. Experiments with radioactivelylabeled lymphocytes show that more recirculating lympho-cytes pass daily through the spleen than through all thelymph nodes combined.The spleen is surrounded by a capsule that extends a num- ber of projections (trabeculae) into the interior to form acompartmentalized structure. The compartments are of twotypes, the red pulp and white pulp, which are separated by adiffuse marginal zone (Figure 2-19). The splenic red pulp consists of a network of sinusoids populated by macrophagesand numerous red blood cells (erythrocytes) and few lym-phocytes; it is the site where old and defective red blood cellsare destroyed and removed. Many of the macrophages withinthe red pulp contain engulfed red blood cells or iron pigmentsfrom degraded hemoglobin. The splenic white pulp sur- rounds the branches of the splenic artery, forming a periarte- riolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) populated mainly by T lymphocytes. Primary lymphoid follicles are attached to the FIGURE 2-19Structure of the spleen. (a) The spleen, which is about 5inches long in adults, is the largest secondary lymphoid or- gan. It is specialized for trapping blood-borne antigens. (b) D iagram- matic cross section of the spleen. The splenic artery pierces t he capsule and divides into progressively smaller arterioles, endi ng in vascular sinusoids that drain vein. The Trabecula Marginal Periarteriolar lymphoidsheath (PALS) cyte-filled red pulp surrounds the sinusoids. The white pulp fo rms a sleeve, the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS), around the a rteri- oles; this sheath contains numerous T cells. Closely associated with the PALS is the marginal zone, an area rich in B cells that con tains lymphoid follicles that can develop et al. / Immunology 5e:50 PART I Introduction PALS. These follicles are rich in B cells and some of them con- tain germinal centers. The marginal zone, located peripheral to the PALS, is populated by lymphocytes and macrophages. Blood-borne antigens and lymphocytes enter the spleen through the splenic artery, which empties into the marginalzone. In the marginal zone, antigen is trapped by interdigi-tating dendritic cells, which carry it to the PALS. Lympho-cytes in the blood also enter sinuses in the marginal zone andmigrate to the PALS. The initial activation of B and T cells takes place in the T- cell-rich PALS. Here interdigitating dendritic cells captureantigen and present it combined with class II MHC mole-cules to T Hcells. Once activated, these T Hcells can then acti- vate B cells. The activated B cells, together with some T Hcells, then migrate to primary follicles in the marginal zone. Uponantigenic challenge, these primary follicles develop into char-acteristic secondary follicles containing germinal centers(like those in the lymph nodes), where rapidly dividing Bcells (centroblasts) and plasma cells are surrounded by denseclusters of concentrically arranged lymphocytes. The effects of splenectomy on the immune response de- pends on the age at which the spleen is removed. In children,splenectomy often leads to an increased incidence of bacterialsepsis caused primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisse- ria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Splenectomy in adults has less adverse effects, although it leads to some in-crease in blood-borne bacterial infections (bacteremia). MUCOSAL-ASSOCIATED LYMPHOID membranes lining the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital systems have a combined surface area of about400 m2(nearly the size of a basketball court) and are the ma- jor sites of entry for most pathogens. These vulnerable mem-brane surfaces are defended by a group of organizedlymphoid tissues mentioned earlier and known collectivelyas mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MAL T). Struc- turally, these tissues range from loose, barely organized clus-ters of lymphoid cells in the lamina propria of intestinal villito well-organized structures such as the familiar tonsils andappendix, as well as Peyer's patches, which are found withinthe submucosal layer of the intestinal lining. The functionalimportance of MALT in the body's defense is attested to by itslarge population of antibody-producing plasma cells, whosenumber far exceeds that of plasma cells in the spleen, lymphnodes, and bone marrow combined. The tonsils are found in three locations: lingual at the base of the tongue; palatine at the sides of the back of themouth; and pharyngeal (adenoids) in the roof of the na-sopharynx (Figure 2-20). All three tonsil groups are nodularstructures consisting of a of reticular cells andfibers interspersed with lymphocytes, macrophages, granulo-cytes, and mast cells. The B cells are organized into folliclesand germinal centers; the latter are surrounded by regionsshowing T-cell activity. The tonsils defend against antigensentering through the nasal and oral epithelial routes. The best studied of the mucous membranes is the one that lines the gastrointestinal tract. This tissue, like that of the re s- piratory and urogenital tracts, has the capacity to endocytoseantigen from the lumen. Immune reactions are initiatedagainst pathogens and antibody can be generated and ex-ported to the lumen to combat the invading organisms. Asshown in Figures 2-21 and 2-22, lymphoid cells are found invarious regions within this tissue. The outer mucosal epithe- FIGURE 2-20 Three types of tonsils.

Many of these lymphocytes are T cells that express unusual receptors ( /H9253/H9254T-cell receptors, or /H9253/H9254TCRs), which exhibit limited diversity for antigen. Although this popula-tion of T cells is well situated to encounter antigens that en-ter through the intestinal mucous epithelium, their actualfunction remains largely unknown The lamina propria, which lies under the epithelial layer, contains large numbersof B cells, plasma cells, activated T Hcells, and macrophages in loose clusters. Histologic sections have revealed more than15,000 lymphoid follicles within the intestinal lamina pro-pria of a child. The submucosal layer can develop into sec-ondary follicles with germinal centers. The epithelial cells of mucous membranes play an impor- tant role in promoting the immune response by deliveringsmall samples of foreign antigen from the lumina of the res-piratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts to the underlyingmucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. This antigen transportis carried out by specialized M cells. The structure of the M cell is striking: these are flattened epithelial cells lacking t he microvilli that characterize the rest of the mucous epithe-lium. In addition, M cells have a deep invagination, orpocket, in the basolateral plasma membrane; this pocket isfilled with a cluster of B cells, T cells, and macrophages (Fig-ure 2-22a). Luminal antigens are endocytosed into vesiclesthat are transported from the luminal membrane to the un-derlying pocket membrane. The vesicles then fuse with thepocket membrane, delivering the potentially response-acti-vating antigens to the clusters of lymphocytes containedwithin the pocket. M cells are located in so-called inductive sites \u2014small re- gions of a mucous lym-phoid follicles (Figure 2-22b). Antigens transported acrossthe mucous membrane by M cells can activate B cells within FIGURE 2-21Cross-sectional diagram of the mucous membrane lining the intestine showing a nodule of lymphoid follicles tha t con- stitutes a Peyer's patch in the submucosa.

(b) Antigen transported across the ep ithelial layer by M cells at an inductive site activates B cells in The activated B cells differentiate into Ig A-pro- ducing plasma cells, which migrate along the submucosa. The out er mucosal epithelial layer contains intraepithelial lymphocytes, of which many are CD 8/H11001T cells that express /H9253/H9254TCRs with limited re- ceptor diversity for antigen.8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 51 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:52 PART I Introduction these lymphoid follicles. The activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells, which leave the follicles and secrete the IgAclass of antibodies. These antibodies then are transportedacross the epithelial cells and released as secretory IgA into the lumen, where they can interact with antigens. As described in Chapter 1, mucous membranes are an ef- fective barrier to the entrance of most pathogens, whichthereby contributes to nonspecific immunity. One reason forthis is that the mucosal epithelial cells are cemented to oneanother by tight junctions that make it difficult for patho-gens to penetrate. Interestingly, some enteric pathogens, in-cluding both bacteria and viruses, have exploited the M cellas an entry route through the mucous-membrane barrier. Insome cases, the pathogen is internalized by the M cell andtransported into the pocket. In other cases, the pathogenbinds to the M cell and disrupts the cell, thus allowing entryof the pathogen. Among the pathogens that use M cells inthese ways are several invasive Salmonella species, Vibrio cholerae, and the polio virus. Cutaneous-Associated Lymphoid Tissue The skin is an important anatomic barrier to the external en- vironment, and its large surface area makes this tissue impor-tant in nonspecific (innate) defenses. The epidermal (outer)layer of the skin is composed largely of specialized epithelialcells called keratinocytes. These cells secrete a number of cy-tokines that may function to induce a local inflammatory re-action. In addition, keratinocytes can be induced to expressclass II MHC molecules and may function as antigen-present-ing cells. Scattered among the epithelial-cell matrix of the epi-dermis are Langerhans cells, a type of dendritic cell, whichinternalize antigen by phagocytosis or endocytosis. TheLangerhans cells then migrate from the epidermis to regionallymph nodes, where they differentiate into interdigitatingdendritic cells. These cells express high levels of class II MHCmolecules and function as potent activators of naive T Hcells. The epidermis also contains so-called intraepidermal lym- phocytes. These are similar to the intraepithelial lymphocytes of MALT in that most of them are CD8/H11001T cells, many of which express /H9253/H9254T-cell receptors, which have limited diver- sity for antigen. These intraepidermal T cells are well situatedto encounter antigens that enter through the skin and someimmunologists believe that they may play a role in combat-ing antigens that enter through the skin. The underlying der-mal layer of the skin contains scattered CD4 /H11001and CD8/H11001T cells and macrophages. Most of these dermal T cells were ei-ther previously activated cells or are memory cells. Systemic Function of the Immune System The many different cells, organs, and tissues of the immune system are dispersed throughout the body, yet the variouscomponents communicate and collaborate to produce an ef-fective response to an infection. An infection that begins in one area of the body initiates processes that eventually in-volve cells, organs, and tissues distant from the site ofpathogen invasion. Consider what happens when the skin is broken, allowing bacteria to enter the body and initiate infection. The tissue damage associated with the injury and infec- tion results in an inflammatory response that causes in-creased blood flow, vasodilation, and an increase in capillarypermeability. Chemotactic signals are generated that cancause phagocytes and lymphocytes to leave the blood streamand enter the affected area. Factors generated during theseearly stages of the infection stimulate the capacity of theadaptive immune system to respond. Langerhans cells (den-dritic cells found throughout the epithelial layers of the skinand the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and genitaltracts) can capture antigens from invading pathogens andmigrate into a nearby lymphatic vessel, where the flow oflymph carries them to nearby lymph nodes. In the lymphnodes these class II MHC-bearing cells can become mem-bers of the interdigitating dendritic-cell population and ini-tiate adaptive immune responses by presenting antigen to T H cells. The recognition of antigen by T Hcells can have impor- tant consequences, including the activation and proliferationof T Hcells within the node as the T Hcells recognize the anti- gen, and the secretion by the activated T cells of factors thatsupport T-cell-dependent antibody production by B cellsthat may already have been activated by antigen delivered tothe lymph node by lymph. The antigen-stimulated T Hcells also release chemotactic factors that cause lymphocytes toleave the blood circulation and enter the lymph nodethrough the endothelium of the postcapillary venules. Lym-phocytes that respond to the antigen are retained in thelymph node for 48 hours or so as they undergo activationand proliferation before their release via the node's efferentlymphatic vessel. Once in the lymph, the newly released activated lympho- cytes can enter the bloodstream via the subclavian vein.Eventually, the circulation carries them to blood vessels nearthe site of the infection, where the inflammatory processmakes the vascular endothelium of the nearby blood vesselsmore adherent for activated T cells and other leukocytes (seeChapter 15). Chemotactic factors that attract lymphocytes,macrophages, and neutrophils are also generated during theinflammatory process, promoting leukocyte adherence tonearby vascular epithelium and leading leukocytes to the siteof the infection. Later in the course of the response,pathogen-specific antibodies produced in the node are alsocarried to the bloodstream. Inflammation aids the delivery ofthe anti-pathogen antibody by promoting increased vascularpermeability, which increases the flow of antibody-contain-ing plasma from the blood circulation to inflamed tissue. Theresult of this network of interactions among diffusible mole-cules, cells, organs, the lymphatic system, and the circulatorysystem is an effective and focused immune response to an infection.8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 52 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 53 Lymphoid Cells and Organs\u2014 Evolutionary Comparisons While innate systems of immunity are seen in invertebrates and even in plants, the evolution of lymphoid cells and or-gans evolved only in the phylum Vertebrata. Consequently,adaptive immunity, which is mediated by antibodies and T cells, is only seen in this phylum. However, as shown in Fig-ure 2-23, the kinds of lymphoid tissues seen in different or-ders of vertebrates differ.

While all have gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)and most have some version of a spleen and thymus, not allhave blood-cell-forming bone marrow or lymph nodes, andthe ability to form germinal centers is not shared by all. Thedifferences seen at the level of organs and tissues are also re-flected at the cellular level. Lymphocytes that express anti-gen-specific receptors on their surfaces are necessary tomount an adaptive immune response. So far, it has not beenpossible to demonstrate the presence of T or B lymphocytesin the jawless fishes, and attempts to demonstrate an adaptiveimmune response in lampreys and hagfish, members of theorder Agnatha, have failed. In fact, only jawed vertebrates(Gnathosomata), of which the cartilaginous fish (sharks,rays) are the earliest example, have B and T lymphocytes andsupport adaptive immune responses. SUMMARY IThe cells that participate in the immune response are whiteblood cells, or leukocytes. The lymphocyte is the only cellto possess the immunologic attributes of specificity, diver-sity, memory, and self/nonself recognition. IMany of the body's cells, tissues, and organs arise from theprogeny of different stem-cell populations. The division ofa stem cell can result in the production of another stem celland a differentiated cell of a specific type or group. IAll leukocytes develop from a common multipotenthematopoietic stem cell during hematopoiesis. Varioushematopoietic growth factors (cytokines) induce prolifer-ation and differentiation of the different blood cells. Thedifferentiation of stem cells into different cell types re-quires the expression of different lineage-determininggenes. A number of transcription factors play importantroles in this regard. IHematopoiesis is closely regulated to assure steady-statelevels of each of the different types of blood cell. Cell divi-sion and differentiation of each of the lineages is balancedby programmed cell death. IThere are three types of lymphocytes: B cells, T cells, andnatural killer cells (NK cells). NK cells are much less abun-dant than B and T cells, and most lack a receptor that isspecific for a particular antigen. However, a subtype of NKcells, NK1-T cells, have both T-cell receptors and many ofthe markers characteristic of NK cells. The three types oflymphoid cells are best distinguished on the basis of func-tion and the presence of various membrane molecules. INaive B and T lymphocytes (those that have not encoun-tered antigen) are small resting cells in the G 0phase of the cell cycle. After interacting with antigen, these cells enlargeinto lymphoblasts that proliferate and eventually differen-tiate into effector cells and memory cells. IMacrophages and neutrophils are specialized for thephagocytosis and degradation of antigens (see Figure 2-9).Phagocytosis is facilitated by opsonins such as antibody, which increase the attachment of antigen to the membraneof the phagocyte. IActivated macrophages secrete various factors that regu-late the development of the adaptive immune responseand mediate inflammation (see Table 2-7). Macrophagesalso process and present antigen bound to class II MHCmolecules, which can then be recognized by T Hcells. IBasophils and mast cells are nonphagocytic cells that re-lease a variety of pharmacologically active substances andplay important roles in allergic reactions. IDendritic cells capture antigen. With the exception of fol-licular dendritic cells, these cells express high levels of classII MHC molecules. Along with macrophages and B cells,dendritic cells play an important role in T H-cell activation by processing and presenting antigen bound to class IIMHC molecules and by providing the required co-stimula-tory signal. Follicular dendritic cells, unlike the others, fa-cilitate B-cell activation but play no role in T-cell activatio n. IThe primary lymphoid organs provide sites where lympho- cytes mature and become antigenically committed. T lym-phocytes mature within the thymus, and B lymphocytesarise and mature within the bone marrow of humans, mice,and several other animals, but not all vertebrates. IPrimary lymphoid organs are also places of selectionwhere many lymphocytes that react with self antigens areeliminated. Furthermore, the thymus eliminates thymo-cytes that would mature into useless T cells because theirT-cell receptors are unable to recognize self-MHC. IThe lymphatic system collects fluid that accumulates in tis-sue spaces and returns this fluid to the circulation via theleft subclavian vein. It also delivers antigens to the lymphnodes, which interrupt the course of lymphatic vessels. ISecondary lymphoid organs capture antigens and interactionwith clonal pro-liferation and differentiation into cells. IThere are several types of secondary lymphoid tissue:lymph nodes, spleen, the loose clusters of follicles, andPeyer's patches of the intestine, and cutaneous-associatedlymphoid tissue. Lymph nodes trap antigen from lymph,spleen traps blood-borne antigens, intestinal-associatedlymphoid tissues (as well as other secondary lymphoid tis-sues) interact with antigens that enter the body from thegastrointestinal tract, and cutaneous-associated lymphoidtissue protects epithelial tissues. IAn infection that begins in one area of the body eventuallyinvolves cells, organs, and tissues that may be distant fromthe site of pathogen invasion. Antigen from distant sitescan arrive at lymph nodes via lymph and dendritic cells,thereby assuring activation of T cells and B cells and releaseof these cells and their products to the circulation. Inflam-matory processes bring lymphocytes and other leukocytesto the site of infection. Thus, although dispersed through-8536d_ch02_024-056 8/5/02 4:02 PM Page 54 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Cells and Organs of the Immune System CHAPTER 2 55 out the body, the components of the immune system com- municate and collaborate to produce an effective responseto infection. IVertebrate orders differ greatly in the kinds of lymphoidorgans, tissues, and cells they possess. The most primitivevertebrates, the jawless fishes, have only gut-associatedlymphoid tissues, lack B and T cells, and cannot mountadaptive immune responses. Jawed vertebrates possess agreater variety of lymphoid tissues, have B and T cells, anddisplay adaptive immunity. References Appelbaum, F. R. 1996. Hematopoietic stem cell transplanta- tion.

In fact, the immunesystem actually recognizes particular macromolecules of aninfectious agent, generally either proteins or polysaccharides.Proteins are the most potent immunogens, with polysaccha-rides ranking second. In contrast, lipids and nucleic acids ofan infectious agent generally do not serve as immunogensunless they are complexed with proteins or polysaccharides.Immunologists tend to use proteins or polysaccharides asimmunogens in most experimental studies of humoral im-munity (Table 3-1). For cell-mediated immunity, only pro-teins and some lipids and glycolipids serve as immunogens.These molecules are not recognized directly. Proteins mustfirst be processed into small peptides and then presented to-gether with MHC molecules on the membrane of a cell be-fore they can be recognized as immunogens. Recent workshows that those lipids and glycolipids that can elicit cell-mediated immunity must also be combined with MHC-likemembrane molecules called CD1 (see Chapter 8). chapter 3 IImmunogenicity Versus Antigenicity IFactors That Influence Antigenicity IPattern-Recognition ReceptorsAntigens S immunoglobulin receptor of B cells, or by the T-cell receptor when complexed with MHC, are called antigens . The molecular properties of antigens and the way in which these properties ultimately contribute toimmune activation are central to our understanding of theimmune system. This chapter describes some of the molecu-lar features of antigens recognized by B or T cells. The chap-ter also explores the contribution made to immunogenicityby the biological system of the host; ultimately the biologicalsystem determines whether a molecule that combines with aB or T cell's antigen-binding receptor can then induce an im-mune response. Fundamental differences in the way B and Tlymphocytes recognize antigen determine which molecularfeatures of an antigen are recognized by each branch of theimmune system. These differences are also examined in thischapter. Immunogenicity Versus Antigenicity Immunogenicity and antigenicity are related but distinctimmunologic properties that sometimes are confused. Im- munogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell- mediated immune response: B cells /H11001antigen n effector B cells + memory B cells g (plasma cells) T cells /H11001antigen n effector T cells + memory T cells g (e.g., CTLs, T Hs) Although a substance that induces a specific immune re- sponse is usually called an antigen, it is more appropriatelycalled an immunogen. Antigenicity is the ability to combine specifically with the final products of the above responses (i.e., antibodiesand/or cell-surface receptors). Although all molecules thathave the property of immunogenicity also have the propertyof antigenicity, the reverse is not true. Some small molecules,called haptens, are antigenic but incapable, by themselves, of inducing a specific immune response. In other words, theylack immunogenicity.Complementarity of Interacting Surfaces of Antibody (left) and Antigen (right)8536d_ch03_057-075 8/7/02 9:18 AM Page 57 mac79 Mac 79:45_BW :Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Immunogenicity is not an intrinsic property of an antigen but rather depends on a number of properties of the particu-lar biological system that the antigen encounters. The nexttwo sections describe the properties that most immunogensshare and the contribution that the biological system makesto the expression of immunogenicity. The Nature of the Immunogen Contributes to Immunogenicity Immunogenicity is determined, in part, by four properties of the immunogen: its foreignness, molecular size, chemicalcomposition and complexity, and ability to be processed andpresented with an MHC molecule on the surface of an anti-gen-presenting cell or altered self-cell. FOREIGNNESS In order to elicit an immune response, a molecule must berecognized as nonself by the biological system. The capacityto recognize nonself is accompanied by tolerance of self, aspecific unresponsiveness to self antigens. Much of the abilityto tolerate self antigens arises during lymphocyte develop-ment, during which immature lymphocytes are exposed toself-components. Antigens that have not been exposed to im-mature lymphocytes during this critical period may be laterrecognized as nonself, or foreign, by the immune system.When an antigen is introduced into an organism, the degreeof its immunogenicity depends on the degree of its foreign-ness. Generally, the greater the phylogenetic distance be-tween two species, the greater the structural (and thereforethe antigenic) disparity between them. For example, the common experimental antigen bovine serum albumin (BSA) is not immunogenic when injectedinto a cow but is strongly immunogenic when injected into a rabbit. Moreover, BSA would be expected to exhibit greaterimmunogenicity in a chicken than in a goat, which is moreclosely related to bovines. There are some exceptions to thisrule. Some macromolecules (e.g., collagen and cytochromec) have been highly conserved throughout evolution and therefore display very little immunogenicity across diversespecies lines. Conversely, some self-components (e.g.,corneal tissue and sperm) are effectively sequestered fromthe immune system, so that if these tissues are injected eveninto the animal from which they originated, they will func-tion as immunogens. MOLECULAR SIZE There is a correlation between the size of a macromoleculeand its immunogenicity. The most active immunogens tendto have a molecular mass of 100,000 daltons (Da). Generally,substances with a molecular mass less than 5000-10,000 Daare poor immunogens, although a few substances with amolecular mass less than 1000 Da have proven to be im-munogenic. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND HETEROGENEITY Size and foreignness are not, by themselves, sufficient tomake a molecule immunogenic; other properties are neededas well. For example, synthetic homopolymers (polymerscomposed of a single amino acid or sugar) tend to lack im-munogenicity regardless of their size. Studies have shownthat copolymers composed of different amino acids or sugarsare usually more immunogenic than homopolymers of theirconstituents. These studies show that chemical complexitycontributes to immunogenicity. In this regard it is notablethat all four levels of protein organization\u2014primary, sec-ondary, tertiary, and quaternary\u2014contribute to the struc-tural complexity of a protein and hence affect its immuno-genicity (Figure 3-1). LIPIDS AS ANTIGENS Appropriately presented lipoidal antigens can induce B- andT-cell responses. For the stimulation of B-cell responses,lipids are used as haptens and attached to suitable carriermolecules such as the proteins keyhole limpet conjugates it is possible to obtain anti-bodies that are highly specific for the target lipids. Using thi s approach, antibodies have been raised against a wide varietyof lipid molecules including steroids, complex fatty-acid de-rivatives, and fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E. Suchantibodies are of considerable practical importance sincemany clinical assays for the presence and amounts of med-ically important lipids are antibody-based. For example, adetermination of the levels of a complex group of lipidsknown as leukotrienes can be useful in evaluating asthma pa-tients. Prednisone, an immunosuppressive steroid, is oftengiven as part of the effort to prevent the rejection of a trans-58 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 3-1Molecular weight of some common experimental antigens used inimmunology Antigen Approximate molecular mass (Da) Bovine gamma globulin 150,000 (BGG) Bovine serum albumin 69,000 W:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:planted organ. The achievement and maintenance of ade- quate blood levels of this and other immunosuppressivedrugs is important to a successful outcome of transplanta-tion, and antibody-based immunoassays are routinely usedto make these evaluations. The extraordinary sensitivity andspecificity of assays based on the use of anti-lipid antibodiesis illustrated by Table 3-2, which shows the specificity of anantibody raised against leukotriene C 4. This antibody allows the detection of as little as 16-32 picograms per ml ofleukotriene C 4. Because it has little or no reactivity with sim- ilar compounds, such as leukotriene D 4or E t can be used to assay leukotriene C 4in samples that contain this compound and a variety of other structurally relatedlipids. T cells recognize peptides derived from protein antigens when they are presented as peptide-MHC complexes. How-ever, some lipids can also be recognized by T cells. Lipoidalcompounds such as glycolipids and some phospholipids can be recognized by T-cell receptors when presented as com-plexes with molecules that are very much like MHC mole-cules. These lipid-presenting molecules are members of theCD1 family (see Chapter 8) and are close structural relativesof class I MHC molecules. The lipid molecules recognized bythe CD1-T-cell receptor system all appear to share the com-mon feature of a hydrophobic portion and a hydrophilic headgroup. The hydrophobic portion is a long-chain fatty acid oralcohol and the hydrophilic head group is composed of highlypolar groups that often contain carbohydrates. Recognition oflipids is a part of the immune response to some pathogens,and T cells that recognize lipids arising from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, which respectively cause tuberculosis and leprosy, have been isolated from hu-mans infected by these mycobacteria. More about the presen-tation of lipoidal antigens can be found in Chapter 8.Antigens CHAPTER 3 59 SECONDARY STRUCTURE TERTIARY STRUCTUREPRIMARY STRUCTURE helix pleated sheetAmino acid sequence of polypeptide chain Monomeric polypeptide molecule QUATERNARY STRUCTUREDimeric protein molecule\u2014Lys\u2014Ala\u2014His\u2014Gly\u2014Lys\u2014Lys\u2014Val\u2014Leu FIGURE 3-1The four levels of protein organizational structure.

Large, insoluble macromolecules generally aremore immunogenic than small, soluble because thelarger molecules are more readily phagocytosed andprocessed. Macromolecules that cannot be degraded andpresented with MHC molecules are poor immunogens. Thiscan be illustrated with polymers of D-amino acids, which are stereoisomers of the naturally occurring L-amino acids. Be- cause the degradative enzymes within antigen-presentingcells can degrade only proteins containing L-amino acids, polymers of D-amino acids cannot be processed and thus are poor immunogens.The Biological System Contributes to Immunogenicity Even if a macromolecule has the properties that contribute to immunogenicity, its ability to induce an immune responsewill depend on certain properties of the biological systemthat the antigen encounters. These properties include thegenotype of the recipient, the dose and route of antigen ad-ministration, and the administration of substances, calledadjuvants, that increase immune responses. GENOTYPE OF THE RECIPIENT ANIMAL The genetic constitution (genotype) of an immunized ani- mal influences the type of immune response the animalmanifests, as well as the degree of the response. For example,Hugh McDevitt showed that two different inbred strains of60 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 3-2Specificity of an antibody against a complex lipid Antibody reactivity * Lipid Structure (on scale of 1to 100) Leukotriene C 4 100.0 Leukotriene D 4 5.0 Leukotriene E 4 0.5 Prostaglandin D 2 0.001 *The reactivity of the antibody with the immunizing antigen leuk otriene C 4is assigned a value of 100in arbitrary units.OH OH CH3O S O OH NH2 OH OHOCH3HO OOH OH CH3 NH2O S O HOO O ON HOHNH OH OH CH3O S O ON HOHH2N8536d_ch03_057-075 8/6/02 10:28 AM Page Mac 79:45_B W:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:mice responded very differently to a synthetic polypeptide immunogen. After exposure to the immunogen, one strainproduced high levels of serum antibody, whereas the otherstrain produced low levels. When the two strains werecrossed, the F 1generation showed an intermediate response to the immunogen. By backcross analysis, the gene control-ling immune responsiveness was mapped to a subregion ofthe major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Numerousexperiments with simple defined immunogens have demon-strated genetic control of immune responsiveness, largelyconfined to genes within the MHC. These data indicate thatMHC gene products, which function to present processedantigen to T cells, play a central role in determining the de-gree to which an animal responds to an immunogen. The response of an animal to an antigen is also influenced by the genes that encode B-cell and T-cell receptors and bygenes that encode various proteins involved in immune reg-ulatory mechanisms. Genetic variability in all of these genesaffects the immunogenicity of a given macromolecule in dif-ferent animals. These genetic contributions to immuno-genicity will be described more fully in later chapters. IMMUNOGEN DOSAGE AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION Each experimental immunogen exhibits a particular dose-re-sponse curve, which is determined by measuring the im-mune response to different doses and different adminis-tration routes. An antibody response is measured by deter-mining the level of antibody present in the serum of immu-nized animals. Evaluating T-cell responses is less simple butmay be determined by evaluating the increase in the numberof T cells bearing TCRs that recognize the immunogen. Somecombination of optimal dosage and route of administrationwill induce a peak immune response in a given animal. An insufficient dose will not stimulate an immune re- sponse either because it fails to activate enough lymphocytesor because, in some cases, certain ranges of low doses can in-duce a state of immunologic unresponsiveness, or tolerance.The phenomenon of tolerance is discussed in chapters 10and 21. Conversely, an excessively high dose can also inducetolerance. The immune response of mice to the purifiedpneumococcal capsular polysaccharide illustrates the impor-tance of dose. A 0.5 mg dose of antigen fails to induce an im-mune response in mice, whereas a thousand-fold lower doseof the same antigen (5 /H1100310 /H110024mg) induces a humoral anti- body response. A single dose of most experimental immuno-gens will not induce a strong response; rather, repeatedadministration over a period of weeks is usually required.Such repeated administrations, or boosters, increase the clonal proliferation of antigen-specific T cells or B cells andthus increase the lymphocyte populations specific for the im-munogen. parenterally ( para, gut)\u2014that is, by routes digestive tract. The following administrationroutes are common:IIntravenous (iv): into a vein IIntradermal (id): skin ISubcutaneous (sc): beneath the skin IIntramuscular (im): into a muscle IIntraperitoneal (ip): into the peritoneal cavity The administration route strongly influences which immune organs and cell populations will be involved in the response.Antigen administered intravenously is carried first to thespleen, whereas antigen administered subcutaneously movesfirst to local lymph nodes. Differences in the lymphoid cellsthat populate these organs may be reflected in the subsequentimmune response. ADJUVANTS Adjuvants (from Latin adjuvare, to help) are substances that, when mixed with an antigen and injected with it, enhance theimmunogenicity of that antigen. Adjuvants are often used toboost the immune response when an antigen has low im-munogenicity or when only small amounts of an antigen areavailable. For example, the antibody response of mice to im-munization with BSA can be increased fivefold or more if theBSA is administered with an adjuvant. Precisely how adju-vants augment the immune response is not entirely known,but they appear to exert one or more of the following effects(Table 3-3): IAntigen persistence is prolonged. ICo-stimulatory signals are enhanced. ILocal inflammation is increased. IThe nonspecific proliferation of lymphocytes isstimulated. Aluminum potassium sulfate (alum) prolongs the persis- tence of antigen. When an antigen is mixed with alum, thesalt precipitates the antigen. Injection of this alum precipitateresults in a slower release of antigen from the injection site, s o that the effective time of exposure to the antigen increasesfrom a few days without adjuvant to several weeks with theadjuvant. The alum precipitate also increases the size of theantigen, thus increasing the likelihood of phagocytosis. Water-in-oil adjuvants also prolong the persistence of antigen. A preparation known as Freund's incomplete ad- juvant contains antigen in aqueous solution, mineral oil, and an emulsifying agent such as mannide monooleate,which disperses the oil into small droplets surrounding theantigen; the antigen is then released very slowly from thesite of injection. This preparation is based on Freund's complete adjuvant, the first deliberately formulated highly effective adjuvant, developed by Jules Freund manyyears ago and containing heat-killed Mycobacteria as an additional ingredient. 79:45_B W:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Freund's complete adjuvant far more potent than the in- complete form. Activated macrophages are more phago-cytic than unactivated macrophages and express higherlevels of class II MHC molecules and the membrane mole-cules of the B7 family. The increased expression of class IIMHC increases the ability of the antigen-presenting cell topresent antigen to T Hcells. B7 molecules on the antigen- presenting cell bind to CD28, a cell-surface protein on T H cells, triggering co-stimulation, an enhancement of the T-cell immune response. Thus, antigen presentation and therequisite co-stimulatory signal usually are increased in thepresence of adjuvant. Alum and Freund's adjuvants also stimulate a local, chronic inflammatory response that attracts both phagocytesand lymphocytes. This infiltration of cells at the site of theadjuvant injection often results in formation of a dense,macrophage-rich mass of cells called a granuloma. Because the macrophages in a granuloma are activated, this mecha-nism also enhances the activation of T Hcells. Other adjuvants (e.g., synthetic polyribonucleotides and bacterial lipopolysaccharides) stimulate the nonspecific pro-liferation of lymphocytes and thus increase the likelihood ofantigen-induced clonal selection of lymphocytes. Epitopes As mentioned in Chapter 1, immune cells do not interactwith, or recognize, an entire immunogen molecule; instead,lymphocytes recognize on antigenic determinants. Epitopes are bindto antigen-specific membrane receptors on lymphocytes orto secreted antibodies. Studies with small antigens have re-vealed that B and T cells recognize different epitopes on thesame antigenic molecule. For example, when mice were im-munized with glucagon, a small human hormone of 29amino acids, antibody was elicited to epitopes in the amino-terminal portion, whereas the T cells responded only to epi- topes in the carboxyl-terminal portion. Lymphocytes may interact with a complex antigen on sev- eral levels of antigen structure. An epitope on a protein anti-gen may involve elements of the primary, secondary, tertiary,and even quaternary structure of the protein (see Figure 3-1).In polysaccharides, branched chains are commonly present,and multiple branches may contribute to the conformationof epitopes. The recognition of antigens by T cells and B cells is funda- mentally different (Table 3-4). B cells recognize soluble anti-gen when it binds to their membrane-bound antibody.Because B cells bind antigen that is free in solution, the epi-topes they recognize tend to be highly accessible sites on theexposed surface of the immunogen. As noted previously,most T cells recognize only peptides combined with MHCmolecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and al-tered self-cells; T-cell epitopes, as a rule, cannot be consid-ered apart from their associated MHC molecules. Properties of B-Cell Epitopes Are Determined by the Nature of the Antigen-Binding Site Several generalizations have emerged from studies in which the molecular features of the epitope recognized by B cellshave been established. The ability to function as a B-cell epitope is determined by the nature of the antigen-binding site on the antibody moleculesdisplayed by B cells. Antibody binds to an epitope by weak noncovalent interactions, which operate only over short dis-tances. For a strong bond, the antibody's binding site and theepitope must have complementary shapes that place the in-teracting groups near each other. This requirement posessome restriction on the properties of the epitope. The size ofthe epitope recognized by a B cell can be no larger than thesize of the antibody's binding site. For any given antigen-an-tibody reaction, the shape of the epitope that can be recog-nized by the antibody is determined by the shape assumed by62 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 3-3Postulated mode of action of some commonly used adjuvants POSTULATED MODE OF ACTION Prolongs Enhances Induces Stimulates granuloma lymphocytes al. / Immunology 5e:the sequences of amino acids in the binding site and the chemical environment that they produce. Smaller ligands such as carbohydrates, small oligonu- cleotides, peptides, and haptens often bind within a deeppocket of an antibody. For example, angiotensin II, a smalloctapeptide hormone, binds within a deep and narrowgroove (725 \u00c5 2) of a monoclonal antibody specific for the hormone (Figure 3-2). Within this groove, the bound pep-tide hormone folds into a compact structure with two turns,which brings its amino (N-terminal) and carboxyl (C-termi-nal) termini close together. All eight amino acid residues ofthe octapeptide are in van der Waals contact with 14 residuesof the antibody's groove. A quite different picture of epitope structure emerges from x-ray crystallographic analyses of monoclonal antibod-ies bound to globular protein antigens such as hen egg-whitelysozyme (HEL) and neuraminidase (an envelope glycopro-tein of influenza virus). These antibodies make contact withthe antigen across a large flat face (Figure 3-3). The interact-ing face between antibody and epitope is a flat or undulatingsurface in which protrusions on the epitope or antibody arematched by corresponding depressions on the antibody orepitope. These studies have revealed that 15-22 amino acidson the surface of the antigen make contact with a similarnumber of residues in the antibody's binding site; the surfacearea of this large complementary interface is between 650 \u00c5 2 and 900 \u00c52. For these globular protein antigens, then, the shape of the epitope is entirely determined by the tertiaryconformation of the native protein. Thus, globular protein antigens and small peptide anti- gens interact with antibody in different ways (Figure 3-4).Typically, larger areas of protein antigens are engaged by theantibody binding site. In contrast, a small peptide such as an-giotensin II can fold into a compact structure that occupiesless space and fits into a pocket or cleft of the binding site.This pattern is not unique to small peptides; it extends to thebinding of low-molecular-weight antigens of various chemi-cal types. However, these differences between the binding ofsmall and large antigenic determinants do not reflect funda-mental differences in the regions of the antibody moleculethat make up the binding site. Despite differences in the binding patterns of small haptens and large antigens, Chap-ter 4 will show that all antibody binding sites are assembledfrom the same regions of the antibody molecule\u2014namely,parts of the variable regions of its polypeptide chains.Antigens CHAPTER 3 63 TABLE 3-4Comparison of antigen recognition by T cells and B cells Characteristic B cells T cells Interaction with antigen Involves binary complex of membrane Inv olves ternary complex of T-cell receptor, Ag, Ig and Ag and MHC molecule Binding of soluble antigen Yes NoInvolvement of MHC molecules None required Required to display pr ocessed antigen Chemical nature of antigens Protein, polysaccharide, lipid Mostl y proteins, but some lipids and glycolipids presented on MHC-like molecules Epitope properties Accessible, hydrophilic, mobile peptides Inte rnal linear peptides produced by containing sequential or nonsequential processing of antigen an d bound to amino acids MHC molecules FIGURE 3-2Three-dimensional structure of an octapeptide a monoclonal antibody Fabfragment, the antigen-binding unit of the antibody molecule.

A B-cell epitope must be accessible in order to be able to bind to an antibody; in general, protruding regions on thesurface of the protein are the most likely to be recognized asepitopes, and these regions are usually composed of predom-inantly hydrophilic amino acids. Amino acid sequences thatare hidden within the interior of a protein often consist of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids, and cannot func-tion as B-cell epitopes unless the protein is first denatured. I n the crystallized antigen-antibody complexes analyzed todate, the interface between antibody and antigen shows nu-merous complementary protrusions and depressions (Figure3-5). Between 15 and 22 amino acids on the antigen contactthe antibody by 75-120 hydrogen bonds as well as by ionicand hydrophobic interactions. B-cell epitopes can contain sequential or nonsequential acids. Epitopes may be composed of sequential con- tiguous residues along the polypeptide chain or nonsequen-tial residues from segments of the chain brought together bythe folded conformation of an antigen. Most antibodieselicited by globular proteins bind to the protein only when itis in its native conformation. Because denaturation of suchantigens usually changes the structure of their epitopes, anti-bodies to the native protein do not bind to the denaturedprotein. Five distinct sequential epitopes, each containing six to eight contiguous amino acids, have been found in spermwhale myoglobin. Each of these epitopes is on the surface ofthe molecule at bends between the /H9251-helical regions (Figure 3-6a). contains several nonse- quential epitopes, orconformational determinants. The residues that constitute these epitopes are far apart in the pr i- mary amino acid sequence but close together in the tertiarystructure of the molecule. Such epitopes depend on the 64 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses (a) (b) (c) FIGURE 3-3(a) Model of interaction between hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) and Fab fragment of anti-HEL antibody based on x - ray diffraction analysis.

Althoughthe amino acid residues that compose this epitope of HEL arefar apart in the primary amino acid sequence, they arebrought together by the tertiary folding of the protein. Sequential and nonsequential epitopes generally behave differently when a protein is denatured, fragmented, or re-duced. For example, appropriate fragmentation of spermwhale myoglobin can yield five fragments, each retaining onesequential epitope, as demonstrated by the observation thatantibody can bind to each fragment. On the other hand, frag-mentation of a protein or reduction of its disulfide bonds of-ten destroys nonsequential epitopes. For example, the finalprotein conformation (Figure 3-7a). Many antibodies toHEL recognize several epitopes, and each of eight differentepitopes have been recognized by a distinct antibody. Most ofthese epitopes are conformational determinants dependent on the overall structure of the protein. If the intrachain disul-fide bonds of HEL are reduced with mercaptoethanol, thenonsequential epitopes are lost; for this reason, antibody tonative HEL does not bind to reduced HEL. The inhibition experiment shown in Figure 3-7 nicely demonstrates this point. An antibody to a conformationaldeterminant, in this example a peptide loop present in nativeHEL, was able to bind the epitope only if the disulfide bondthat maintains the structure of the loop was intact. Infor-mation about the structural requirements of the antibodycombining site was obtained by examining the ability ofstructural relatives of the natural antigen to bind to that an-tibody. If a structural relative has the critical epitopes presen t in the natural antigen, it will bind to the antibody combiningsite, thereby blocking its occupation by the natural antigen.In this inhibition assay, the ability of the closed loop to in-hibit binding showed that the closed loop was sufficiently 66 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 3-7Experimental demonstration that binding of antibody to conformational determinants in hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL)depends on maintenance of the tertiary structure of the epitope s by intrachain disulfide bonds.

Even though the open loop had the same sequence of aminoacids as the closed loop, it lacked the epitopes recognized bythe antibody and therefore was unable to block binding ofHEL. B-cell epitopes tend to be located in flexible regions of an im- munogen and display site mobility. John A. Tainer and his col- leagues analyzed the epitopes on a number of proteinantigens (myohemerytherin, insulin, cytochrome c,myoglo- bin, and hemoglobin) by comparing the positions of theknown B-cell epitopes with the mobility of the sameresidues. Their analysis revealed that the major antigenic de-terminants in these proteins generally were located in themost mobile regions. These investigators proposed that sitemobility of epitopes maximizes complementarity with theantibody 's binding site, permitting an antibody to bind with an epitope that it might bind ineffectively if it were rigid.However, because of the loss of entropy due to binding to aflexible site, the binding of antibody to a flexible epitope isgenerally of lower affinity than the binding of antibody to arigid epitope. Complex proteins contain multiple overlapping B-cell epi- topes, some of which are immunodominant. For many years, it was dogma in immunology that each globular protein had asmall number of epitopes, each confined to a highly accessi-ble region and determined by the overall conformation of theprotein. However, it has been shown more recently that mostof the surface of a globular protein is potentially antigenic.This has been demonstrated by comparing the antigen-bind-ing profiles of different monoclonal antibodies to variousglobular proteins. For example, when 64 different mono-clonal antibodies to BSA were compared for their ability tobind to a panel of 10 different mammalian albumins, 25 dif-ferent overlapping antigen-binding profiles emerged, sug-gesting that these 64 different antibodies recognized aminimum of 25 different epitopes on BSA. Similar findingshave emerged for other globular proteins, such as myoglobinand HEL. The surface of a protein, then, presents a large number of potential antigenic sites. The subset of antigenic sites on agiven protein that is recognized by the immune system of ananimal is much smaller than the potential antigenic reper-toire, and it varies from species to species and even among in-dividual members of a given species. Within an animal, cer- tain epitopes of an antigen are recognized as immunogenic,but others are not. Furthermore, some epitopes, called im- munodominant, induce a more pronounced immune re- sponse than other epitopes in a particular animal. It is highlylikely that the intrinsic topographical properties of the epi-tope as well as the animal 's regulatory mechanisms influence the immunodominance of epitopes. Antigen-Derived Peptides Are the Key Elements of T-Cell Epitopes Studies by P . G. H. Gell and Baruj Benacerraf in 1959 sug- gested that there was a qualitative difference between the T-cell and the B-cell response to protein the humoral (B-cell) and cell-medi-ated a series of native and denaturedprotein antigens (Table 3-5). They found that when primaryimmunization was with a native protein, only native protein,not denatured protein, could elicit a secondary antibody (hu-moral) response. In contrast, both native and denatured pro-tein could elicit a secondary cell-mediated response. Thefinding that a secondary response mediated by T cells was in-duced by denatured protein, even when the primary immu-nization had been with native protein, initially puzzledimmunologists. In the 1980s, however, it became clear that Tcells do not recognize soluble native antigen but rather rec-ognize antigen that has been processed into antigenic pep- tides, which are presented in combination with MHC molecules. For this reason, destruction of the conformationof a protein by denaturation does not affect its T-cell epi-topes. Because the T-cell receptor does not bind free peptides, experimental systems for studying T-cell epitopes must in-clude antigen-presenting cells or target cells that can displaythe peptides bound to an MHC molecule. Antigenic peptides recognized by T cells form trimolecular complexes with a T-cell receptor and an MHC molecule (Figure 3-8). The structures of TCR-peptide-MHC trimolecularcomplexes have been determined by x-ray crystallographyand are described in Chapter 9. These structural studies ofclass I or class II MHC molecules crystallized with known T-cell antigenic peptides has shown that the peptide binds to aAntigens CHAPTER 3 67 TABLE 3-5Antigen recognition by T and B lymphocytes reveals qualitative differences SECONDARY IMMUNE RESPONSE Primary immunization Secondary immunization Antibody production Ce ll-mediated T DTHresponse * Native protein Native protein /H11001/H11001 Native protein Denatured protein /H11002/H11001 *TDTHis a subset of 4/H11001THcells that called delayed-type hypersensitivity (see al. / Immunology 5e:cleft MHC molecule (see Figure 7-8). Unlike B-cell epitopes, which can be viewed strictly in terms of their abilityto interact with antibody, T-cell epitopes must be viewed interms of their ability to interact with both a T-cell receptorand an MHC molecule.The binding of an MHC molecule to an antigenic peptide does not have the fine specificity of the interaction between anantibody and its epitope. Instead, a given MHC molecule canselectively bind a variety of different peptides. For example, theclass II MHC molecule designated IA dcan bind peptides from ovalbumin (residues 323 -339), hemagglutinin (residues 130 - 142), and lambda repressor (residues 12 -26). Studies revealing structural features, or motifs, common to different peptidesthat bind to a single MHC molecule are described in Chapter 7. Antigen processing is required to generate peptides that in- teract specifically with MHC molecules. As mentioned in Chapter 1, endogenous and exogenous antigens are areprocessed by the endocytic pathway. The details of antigenprocessing and presentation are described in Chapter 8. Epitopes recognized by T cells are often internal . T cells tend to recognize internal peptides that are exposed by processingwithin antigen-presenting cells or altered self-cells. J. Roth-bard analyzed the tertiary conformation of hen egg-whitelysozyme and sperm whale myoglobin to determine whichamino acids protruded from the natural molecule. He thenmapped the major T-cell epitopes for both proteins andfound that, in each case, the T-cell epitopes tended to be onthe \"inside \"of the protein molecule (Figure 3-9). Haptens and the Study of Antigenicity The pioneering work of Karl Landsteiner in the 1920s and 1930s created a simple, chemically defined system for study-ing the binding of an individual antibody to a unique epitope68 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 3-8Schematic diagram of the ternary complex formed between a T-cell receptor (TCR) on a T Hcell, an antigen, and a class II MHC molecule. Antigens that are recognized by T cells yield pep- tides that interact with MHC molecules to form a peptide-MHC co m- plex that is recognized by the T-cell receptor. As described in later chapters, the coreceptor, CD 4, on T Hcells also interacts with MHC molecules. T Ccells form similar ternary complexes with class I MHC molecules on target cells however, these cells bear MHC-interac ting CD8coreceptors.CD4 TCRClass II MHC Peptide TH cellAntigen-presenting cell FIGURE 3-9Experimental evidence that T Hcells tend to recognize internal peptides of antigens.

[From J. AM :Goldsby al. / Immunology 5e:on a complex protein antigen. Landsteiner employed various haptens, small organic molecules that are antigenic but not immunogenic. Chemical coupling of a hapten to a large pro-tein, called a carrier, yields an immunogenic hapten-carrier conjugate. Animals immunized with such a conjugate specific for (1) the hapten determinant, (2)unaltered epitopes on the carrier protein, and (3) new epi-topes formed by combined parts of both the hapten and car-rier (Figure 3-10). By itself, a hapten cannot function as animmunogenic epitope. But when multiple molecules of a sin-gle hapten are coupled to a carrier protein (or nonimmuno-genic homopolymer), the hapten becomes accessible to theimmune system and can function as an immunogen. The beauty of the hapten-carrier system is that it provides immunologists with a chemically defined determinant thatcan be subtly modified by chemical means to determine theeffect of various chemical structures on immune specificity.In his studies, Landsteiner immunized rabbits with a hapten-carrier conjugate and then tested the reactivity of the rabbit 's immune sera with that hapten and with closely related hap-tens coupled to a different carrier protein. He was thus able tomeasure, specifically, the reaction of the antihapten antibod-ies in the immune serum and not that of antibodies to theoriginal carrier epitopes. Landsteiner tested whether an anti- hapten antibody could bind to other haptens having aslightly different chemical structure. If a reaction occurred, itwas called a cross-reaction. By observing which hapten modifications prevented or permitted cross-reactions, Land-steiner was able to gain insight into the specificity of antigen - antibody interactions. Using various derivatives of aminobenzene as haptens, Landsteiner found that the overall configuration of a haptenplays a major role in determining whether it can react with a given antibody. For example, antiserum from rabbits im-munized with aminobenzene or one of its carboxyl deriva-tives ( o-aminobenzoic acid, m-aminobenzoic acid, or p- aminobenzoic acid) coupled to a carrier protein reacted onlywith the original immunizing hapten and did not cross-reactwith any of the other haptens (Table 3-6). In contrast, if theoverall configuration of the hapten was kept the same andthe hapten was modified in the para position with variousnonionic derivatives, then the antisera showed various de-grees of cross-reactivity. Landsteiner 's work not only demon- strated the specificity of the immune system, but also demon-strated the enormous diversity of epitopes that the immunesystem is capable of recognizing. Many biologically important substances, including drugs, peptide hormones, and steroid hormones, can function ashaptens. Conjugates of these haptens with large protein car-riers can be used to produce hapten-specific antibodies.These antibodies are useful for measuring the presence ofvarious substances in the body. For instance, the originalhome pregnancy test kit employed antihapten antibodies todetermine whether a woman 's urine contained human chori- onic gonadotropin (HCG), which is a sign of pregnancy.However, as shown in the Clinical Focus, the formation ofdrug-protein conjugates in the body can produce drug aller-gies that may be life-threatening. Pattern-Recognition Receptors The receptors of adaptive and innate immunity differ. Anti-bodies and T-cell receptors, the receptors of adaptive immu-nity, recognize details of molecular structure and candiscriminate with exquisite specificity between antigens fea-turing only slight structural differences. The receptors of in-nate immunity recognize broad structural motifs that arehighly conserved within microbial species but are generallyabsent from the host. Because they recognize particular over-all molecular patterns, such receptors are called pattern- recognition receptors (PRRs). Patterns recognized by this type of receptor include combinations of sugars, certain pro-teins, particular lipid-bearing molecules, and some nucleicacid motifs. Typically, the ability of pattern-recognition receptors to distinguish between self and nonself is perfectbecause the molecular pattern targeted by the receptor is produced only by the pathogen and never by the host. Thiscontrasts sharply with the occasional recognition of selfAntigens CHAPTER 3 69 FIGURE 3-10 A hapten-carrier conjugate contains multiple copies of the hapten\u2014a small nonimmunogenic organic compound suchas dinitrophenol (DNP)\u2014chemically linked to a large protein car rier as bovine serum albumin (BSA). Immunization with DNPalone immunization with DNP - BSA elicits three types of antibodies.

Like antibodies and T-cell recep-tors, pattern-recognition receptors are proteins. However,the genes that encode PRRs are present in the germline of theorganism. In contrast, the genes that encode the enormousdiversity of antibodies and TCRs are not present in thegermline. They are generated by an extraordinary process ofgenetic recombination that is discussed in Chapter 5. Many different pattern-recognition receptors have been identified and several examples appear in Table 3-7. Some arepresent in the bloodstream and tissue fluids as soluble circu-lating proteins and others are on the membrane of cells suchas macrophages, neutrophils, that bind to microbial surfaces andpromote their opsonization. Both of these receptors alsohave the ability to activate the complement system when theyare bound to the surface of microbes, thereby making the invader a likely target of complement-mediated lysis. Y et another soluble receptor of the innate immune system,lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, is an important part of the system that recognizes and signals a response tolipopolysaccharide, a component of the outer cell wall ofgram-negative bacteria. Pattern-recognition receptors found on the cell mem- brane include scavenger receptors and the toll-like receptors.Scavenger receptors (SRs) are present on macrophages andmany types of dendritic cells, and are involved in the bindingand internalization of gram-positive and gram-negative bac-teria, as well as the phagocytosis of apoptotic host cells. Theexact roles and mechanisms of action of the many types ofscavenger receptors known to date are under active investiga-tion. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important in recog-nizing many microbial patterns. This family of proteins isancient \u2014toll-like receptors mediate the recognition and generation of defensive responses to pathogens in organismsas widely separated in evolutionary history as humans andflies. Typically, signals transduced through the TLRs causetranscriptional activation and the synthesis and secretion ofcytokines, which promote inflammatory responses thatbring macrophages and neutrophils to sites of inflammation.70 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 3-6Reactivity of antisera /H11001 00 m-Aminobenzoic acid 00 /H11001 SOURCE: 1962 , The Specificity of Serologic Reactions, Dover Press.

The links to T cellsand cytokine release shows the intimate relationship betweeninnate and adaptive responses. A search of the human genome has uncovered 10 TLRs, and the functions of six members of this PRR family havebeen determined. TLR2, often with the collaboration ofTLR6, binds a wide variety of molecular classes found in mi-crobes, including peptidoglycans, zymosans, and bacteriallipopeptides. TLR4 is the key receptor for most bacteriallipopolysaccharides, although TLR2 also binds some vari-eties of LPS. The binding of LPS by either of these TLRs iscomplex and involves the participation of three additionalproteins, one of which is the lipopolysaccharide-bindingprotein mentioned above, abbreviated LBP . The first step inthe process is the binding of LPS by circulating LBP , whichthen delivers it to a complex of TLR4 (or TLR2) with two ad- ditional proteins, CD14 and MD2. The engagement of LPSby this complex causes its TLR component to initiate a sig-nal-transduction process that can produce a cellular re-sponse. Another family member, TLR5, recognizes flagellin,the major structural component of bacterial flagella. TLR3recognizes the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that appearsafter infection by RNA viruses. As shown in Table 3-7,dsRNA is also recognized by dsRNA-activated kinase. Finally,TLR9 recognizes and initiates a response cytosine linked to guanine) sequences. These sequencesare represented in abundance in microbial sequences but aremuch less common in mammalian sequences. Table 3-7summarizes the receptors of adaptive immunity and listsmany pattern-recognition receptors of innate immunity. Themicrobial targets and physiological sites of many PRRs areshown in Figure 3-11.72 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses Since World War II, penicillin has been used to successfullytreat a wide variety of bacterial infec-tions. However, the penicillin family ofantibiotics is not without drawbacks.One is the role of penicillins and otherantibiotics in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Another istheir capacity to induce allergic reactionsin some patients. Penicillin and its rela-tives are responsible for most of therecorded allergic reactions to drugs and97% of the deaths caused each year by drug allergies. Allergies to penicillin and other drugs can be induced by small doses and arenot consequences of the pharmacologi-cal or physiological effects of the drugs.An allergic response usually occursabout a week or so after the patient's firstexposure to the agent, with typically mildsymptoms often including hives, fever,swelling of lymph nodes, and occasion-CLINICAL FOCUS Drug Allergies\u2014When Medicines Become Immunogens ally an arthritis-like discomfort. Subse- quent treatments with the drug usuallycause much more rapid and often moresevere reactions. Within minutes thethroat and eyelids may swell. Grave dan-ger arises if these symptoms progress toanaphylaxis, a physiological collapse thatoften involves the respiratory, circulatory,and digestive systems. Hives, vomiting,abdominal pain, and diarrhea may be apreamble to respiratory and circulatoryproblems that are life threatening.Wheezing and shortness of breath maybe accompanied by swelling of the larynxand epiglottis that can block airflow, anda profound drop in blood pressurecauses shock, frequently accompaniedby weakened heart contractions. The treatment of choice for anaphy- laxis is injection of the drug epinephrine(adrenaline), which can reverse thebody's slide into deep anaphylaxis byraising blood pressure, easing constric-tion of the air passages, and inhibitingthe release from mast cells and ba- sophils of the agents that induce ana-phylaxis. Other drugs may be used toraise the low blood pressure, strengthenheart contractions, and expand theblocked airways. After a case of drug-in-duced anaphylaxis, affected individualsare advised to carry a notice warning future healthcare providers of the drugallergy. Most drugs, including penicillin, are low-molecular-weight compounds thatcannot induce immune responses un-less they are conjugated with a largermolecule. Intensive investigation of al-lergy to penicillin has provided critical in-sight into the basis of allergic reactionsto this and other drugs. As shown in theaccompanying figure, penicillin can reactwith proteins to form a penicilloyl-pro-tein derivative. The penicilloyl-proteinbehaves as a hapten-carrier conjugate,with the acting as ahaptenic epitope. This epitope is readilyrecognized by the immune system, andantibodies are produced against it. Someindividuals respond to penicillin by pro-ducing significant amounts of a type ofantibody known as immunoglobulin E(IgE). Once generated, these IgE anti-bodies are dispersed throughout thebody and are bound by IgE receptors onthe surfaces of mast cells and basophils, 8536d_ch03_057-075 8/6/02 10:28 AM Page et al. / Immunology 5e:Antigens R CO CHN HC avariety of majorand minordeterminantsIsomerization When nucleophiles such as amino groups or hydroxyl groups are present on soluble proteins or on the membrane of cells,they can react with penicillin and its relatives to form covale nt linkages between host macromolecular structures and thedrug. This is illustrated by the reaction of the free aminogroup of a lysine residue with penicillin (or with its sponta-neously forming isomeric compounds, such as penicillenicacid) to produce protein-drug or cell-surface-drug derivatives.Such adducts are the major immunogenic species that elicitimmune responses to this antibiotic. However, as indicated,other hapten-carrier conjugates of somewhat different struc-ture are also formed and, because of their structural similarit y, can also induce immune responses to penicillin. [Adapted from N. F. Adkinson, 1995, in Manual of Clinical Laboratory Immunology, N. Rose et al., eds., American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.] where they can remain for a long time. If a person with penicillin-specific IgE anti-body bound to mast cells is subse-quently treated with penicillin, there maybe an allergic reaction. In fact, between 1and 5percent of people treated with penicillin develop some degree of allergyto it.Penicillin is not the only drug against which patients can develop allergies.Others include streptomycin, aspirin, theso-called \"sulfa-drugs\" such as the sul-fonamides, anesthetics (e.g., suc-cinyl choline), and some opiates. All ofthese small molecules first react withproteins to form drug-protein deriva-tives. When this happens, there is a pos- sibility that the immune system will pro-duce an anti-hapten response to thedrug, just as with penicillin. (andtheir metabolites) that are offorming all antigens are im- munogens. IImmunogenicity is determined by many factors includingforeignness, molecular size, chemical composition, com-plexity, dose, susceptibility to antigen processing and pre-sentation, the genotype of the recipient animal (inparticular, its MHC genes), route of administration, andadjuvants. IThe sizes of B-cell epitopes range widely. Some are quitesmall (e.g., small peptides or small organic molecules),and are often bound in narrow grooves or deep pockets ofthe antibody. Protein B-cell epitopes are much larger andinteract with a larger, flatter complementary surface onthe antibody molecule.IT-cell epitopes are generated by antigen processing, whichfragments protein into small peptides that combine withclass I or class II MHC molecules to form peptide-MHCcomplexes that are displayed on the surface of cells. T-cellactivation requires the formation of a ternary complex between a T cell's TCR and peptide-MHC on antigen-presenting or altered self cells. IHaptens are small molecules that can bind to antibodiesbut cannot by themselves induce an immune response.However, the conjugate formed by coupling a hapten to alarge carrier protein is immunogenic and elicits produc-tion of anti-hapten antibodies when injected into an ani-mal. Such injections also produce anti-carrier and anti-hapten/carrier antibodies as well. IIn the body, the formation of hapten-carrier conjugates isthe basis of allergic responses to drugs such as penicillin.

Thus, the /H9253-globulin fraction was identified as con- taining serum antibodies, which were called immunoglob- ulins, to distinguish them from any other proteins that might be contained in the /H9253-globulin fraction. The early experi- ments of now that although immunoglobulin G (IgG), the main class ofantibody molecules, is indeed mostly found in the /H9253-globulin fraction, significant amounts of it and other importantclasses of antibody molecules are found in the /H9251and the /H9252 fractions of serum. Antibodies Are Heterodimers Antibody molecules have a common structure of four peptide chains (Figure 4-2). This structure consists of twoidentical light (L) chains, polypeptides of about 25,000 molecular weight, and two identical heavy (H) chains, larger chapter 4 IBasic Structure of Antibodies IObstacles to Antibody Sequencing IImmunoglobulin Fine Structure IAntibody-Mediated Effector - on the B-cell membrane and secreted byplasma cells. Membrane-bound - B-cell clones is elicted the interaction ofmembrane antibody with antigen. Secreted antibodies cir-culate in the blood, where they serve as the effectors of hu-moral immunity by searching out and neutralizing antigensor marking them for elimination. All antibodies share struc-tural features, bind to antigen, and participate in a limitednumber of effector functions. The antibodies produced in response to a particular anti- gen are heterogeneous. Most antigens are complex and con-tain many different antigenic determinants, and the immunesystem usually responds by producing antibodies to severalepitopes on the antigen. This response requires the recruit-ment of several clones of B cells. Their outputs are mono-clonal antibodies, each of which specifically binds a singleantigenic determinant. T ogether, these monoclonal antibod-ies make up the polyclonal and heterogeneous serum anti-body response to an immunizing antigen. Basic Structure of Antibodies Blood can be separated in a centrifuge into a fluid and a cel-lular fraction. The fluid fraction is the plasma and the cellu- lar fraction contains red blood cells, leukocytes, andplatelets. Plasma contains all of the soluble small moleculesand macromolecules of blood, including fibrin and otherproteins required for the formation of blood clots. If theblood or plasma is allowed to clot, the fluid phase that re-mains is called serum. It has been known since the turn of the century that antibodies reside in the serum. The first evidence that antibodies were contained in particular serum protein fractions came from a classic experiment byA. Tiselius and E. A. Kabat, in 1939. They immunized rabbitswith the protein ovalbumin (the of was re- acted with ovalbumin, and the precipitate that formed wasremoved; the remaining serum proteins, which did not reactwith the antigen, were then electrophoresed. A comparisonof the electrophoretic profiles of these two serum aliquotsrevealed that there was a significant drop in the /H9253-globulinIgM, the First Responder8536d_ch04_076 9/9/02 12:03 PM Page 76 mac76 mac76:385_reb:polypeptides of molecular weight 50,000 or more. Like the antibody molecules they constitute, H and L chains are alsocalled immunoglobulins. Each light chain is bound to aheavy chain by a disulfide bond, and by such noncovalent in-teractions as salt linkages, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobicbonds, to form a heterodimer (H-L). Similar noncovalent in-teractions and disulfide bridges link the two identical heavyand light (H-L) chain combinations to each other to form thebasic four-chain (H-L) 2antibody structure, a dimer of dimers. As we shall see, the exact number and precise posi-tions of these interchain disulfide bonds differs among anti-body classes and subclasses. The first 110 or so amino acids of the amino-terminal re- gion of a light or heavy chain varies greatly among antibodiesof different specificity. These segments of highly variable se-quence are called V regions: V Lin light chains and V Hin heavy. All of the differences in specificity displayed by different ant i- bodies can be traced to differences in the amino acid se-quences of V regions. In fact, most of the differences amongantibodies fall within areas of the V regions called comple- mentarity-determining regions (CDRs), and it is these CDRs, on both light and heavy chains, that constitute the antigen-binding site of the antibody molecule. By contrast, within thesame antibody class, far fewer differences are seen when onecompares sequences throughout the rest of the molecule. Theregions of relatively constant sequence beyond the variable re-gions have been dubbed C regions, C Lon the light chain andCHon the heavy chain. Antibodies are glycoproteins; with few exceptions, the sites of attachment for carbohydrates are re-stricted to the constant region. We do not completely under-stand the role played by glycosylation of antibodies, but itprobably increases the solubility of the molecules. Inappro-priate glycosylation, or its absence, affects the rate at whichantibodies are cleared from the serum, and decreases the effi-ciency of interaction between antibody and the complementsystem and between antibodies and Fc receptors. Chemical and Enzymatic Methods Revealed Basic Antibody Structure Our knowledge of basic antibody structure was derived from a variety of experimental observations. When the /H9253-globulin fraction of serum is separated into high- and low-molecular-weight fractions, antibodies of around 150,000-MW, des-ignated as immunoglobulin G (IgG) are found in the low-molecular-weight fraction. In a key experiment, brief diges-tion of IgG with the enzyme papain produced three frag-ments, two of which were identical fragments and a third that was quite different (Figure 4-3). The two identical fragmentsAntibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 77 GlobulinsAlbuminAbsorbance Migration distance+ FIGURE 4-1Experimental demonstration that most antibodies are in the /H9253-globulin fraction of serum proteins.

The other fragment (MW of 50,000) had no antigen-binding activity at all. Because it was found to crystallizeduring cold storage, it was called the Fc fragment (\"frag- ment, crystallizable\"). Digestion with pepsin, a different pro-teolytic enzyme, also demonstrated that the antigen-bindingproperties of an antibody can be separated from the rest ofthe molecule. Pepsin digestion generated a single 100,000-MW fragment composed of two Fab-like fragments desig-nated the F(ab /H11541) 2fragment, which binds antigen. The Fc fragment was not recovered from pepsin digestion because ithad been digested into multiple fragments. A key observation in deducing the multichain structure of IgG was made when the molecule was subjected to mercap-toethanol reduction and alkylation, a chemical treatmentthat irreversibly cleaves disulfide bonds. If the sample is chro-matographed on a column that separates molecules by sizefollowing cleavage of disulfide bonds, it is clear that the intac t 150,000-MW IgG molecule is, in fact, composed of subunits.Each IgG molecule contains two 50,000-MW polypeptidechains, designated as heavy (H) chains, and two 25,000-MWchains, designated as light (L) chains (see Figure 4-3). Antibodies themselves were used to determine how the enzyme digestion products\u2014Fab, F(ab /H11032) 2, and the heavy-chain and light-chain reduction products.This question was answered by using antisera from goats that had been immunized with either the Fab fragments or the Fcfragments of rabbit IgG. The antibody to the Fab fragmentcould react with both the H and the L chains, whereas anti-body to the Fc fragment reacted only with the H chain. Theseobservations led to the conclusion that the Fab fragmentconsists of portions of a heavy and a light chain and that Fccontains only heavy-chain components. From these results,and those mentioned above, the structure of IgG shown inFigure 4-3 was deduced. According to this model, the IgGmolecule consists of two identical H chains and two identicalL chains, which are linked by disulfide bridges. The enzymepapain cleaves just above the interchain disulfide chains, whereas the enzyme pepsin cleaves justbelow these bonds, so that the two enzymes gen-erate different digestion products. Mercaptoethanol reduc-tion and alkylation allow separation of the individual heavyand light chains. Obstacles to Antibody Sequencing Initial attempts to determine the amino acid sequence of theheavy and light chains of antibody were hindered because in-sufficient amounts of homogeneous protein were available.Although the basic structure and chemical properties of differ-78 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell SS SH SHSS SSPapain digestion SH HS+ SH SH++ FIGURE 4-3 Prototype structure of IgG, showing chain structure and interchain disulfide bonds.

The population of antibodies in the serum /H9253-globulin fraction consists of a heterogeneous spectrum of antibodies.Even if immunization is done with a hapten-carrier conjugate,the antibodies formed just to the hapten alone are heteroge-neous: they recognize different epitopes of the hapten andhave different binding affinities. This heterogeneity of serumantibodies made them unsuitable for sequencing studies. Pure Immunoglobulin Obtained from Multiple Myeloma Patients Made Sequencing Possible Sequencing analysis finally became feasible with the discov- ery of multiple myeloma, a cancer of antibody-producing plasma cells. The plasma cells in a normal individual are end-stage cells that secrete a single molecular species of antibodyfor a limited period of time and then die. In contrast, a cloneof plasma cells in an individual with multiple myeloma hasescaped normal controls on their life span and proliferationand are not end-stage cells; rather, they divide over and overin an unregulated way without requiring any activation byantigen to induce proliferation. Although such a cancerousplasma cell, called a myeloma cell, has been transformed, its protein-synthesizing machinery and secretory functions arenot altered; thus, the cell continues to secrete molecularly ho-mogeneous antibody. This antibody is indistinguishablefrom normal antibody molecules but is called myeloma pro- tein to denote its source. In a patient afflicted with multiple myeloma, myeloma protein can account for 95% of theserum immunoglobulins. In most patients, the myelomacells also secrete excessive amounts of light chains. These ex-cess light chains were first discovered in the urine ofmyeloma patients and were named Bence-Jones proteins, for their discoverer. Multiple myeloma also occurs in other animals. In mice it can arise spontaneously, as it does in humans, or conditions fa-voring myeloma induction can be created by injecting mineraloil into the peritoneal cavity. The clones of malignant plasmacells that develop are called plasmacytomas, and many of these are designated MOPCs, denoting the mineral-oil induction ofplasmacytoma cells. MOPC lines se-creting different immunoglobulin classes are presently carriedby the American Type-Culture Collection, a nonprofit reposi-tory of cell lines commonly used in research. Light-Chain Sequencing Revealed That Immunoglobulins Have Constant andVariable Regions When the amino acid sequences of several Bence-Jones pro- teins (light chains) from different individuals were com-pared, a striking pattern emerged. The amino-terminal halfof the chain, consisting of 100-110 amino acids, was foundto vary among different Bence-Jones proteins. This regionwas called the variable (V) region. The carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule, called the constant (C) region, had two basic amino acid sequences. This led to the recognition thatthere were two light chain types, kappa ( /H9260)and lambda ( /H9261). In humans, 60% of the light chains are kappa and 40% arelambda, whereas in mice, 95% of the light chains are kappaand only 5% are lambda. A single antibody molecule con-tains only one light chain type, either /H9260or /H9261, never both. The amino acid sequences of /H9261light chains show minor dif- ferences that are used to classify /H9261light chains into subtypes. In mice, there are three subtypes ( /H92611,/H92612, and /H92613); in humans, there are four subtypes. Amino acid substitutions at only a fewpositions are responsible for the subtype differences. Heavy-Chain Sequencing Revealed Five Basic Varieties of Heavy Chains For heavy-chain sequencing studies, myeloma proteins were reduced with mercaptoethanol and alkylated, and the heavychains were separated by gel filtration in a denaturing sol-vent. When the amino acid sequences of several myelomaprotein heavy chains were compared, a pattern similar to thatof the light chains emerged. The amino-terminal part of thechain, consisting of 100-110 amino acids, showed great se-quence variation among myeloma heavy chains and wastherefore called the variable (V) region. The remaining partof the protein revealed five basic sequence patterns, corre-sponding to five different heavy-chain constant (C) regions(/H9262,/H9254,/H9253,/H9280and /H9251). Each of these five different heavy chains is called an isotype. The length of the constant regions is ap- proximately 330 amino acids for /H9254,/H9253, and /H9251, and 440 amino acids for /H9262and /H9255. The heavy chains of a given antibody mol- ecule determine the class IgA(/H9251), IgD( can have either /H9260or /H9261 light chains. A single antibody molecule has two identicalheavy chains and two identical light chains, H 2L2, or a multi- ple (H 2L2)nof this basic four-chain structure (Table 4-1). Minor differences in the amino acid sequences of the /H9251 and /H9253heavy chains led to further classification of the heavy chains into subisotypes that determine the subclass of anti-body molecules they constitute. In humans, there are twosubisotypes of /H9251heavy chains\u2014 /H92511 In mice, there subisotypes,/H92531,/H92532a,/H92532b, and /H92533, and the corresponding subclasses. Immunoglobulin Fine Structure The structure of the immunoglobulin molecule is deter- mined by the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternaryorganization of the protein. The primary structure, theamino acid sequence, accounts for the variable and constantregions of the heavy and light chains. The secondary struc-ture is formed by folding of the extended polypeptide chainAntibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 79 Go to www.whfreeman.com/immunology Molecular Visualization An Introduction to Immunoglobulin Structure 8536d_ch04_076-104 9/6/02 9:02 PM Page mm:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:back and forth upon itself into an antiparallel /H9252pleated sheet (Figure 4-4). The chains are then folded into a tertiary struc-ture of compact globular domains, which are connected toneighboring domains by continuations of the polypeptidechain that lie outside the /H9252pleated sheets. Finally, the globu- lar domains of adjacent heavy and light polypeptide chainsinteract in the quaternary structure (Figure 4-5), formingfunctional domains that enable the molecule to specificallybind antigen and, at the same time, perform a number of bi-ological effector functions. Immunoglobulins Possess Multiple Domains Based on the Immunoglobulin Fold Careful analysis of the amino acid sequences of immunoglob- ulin heavy and light chains showed that both chains containseveral homologous units of about 110 amino acid residues. Within each unit, termed a domain, an intrachain disulfidebond forms a loop of about 60 amino acids. Light chains con-tain one variable domain (V L), and one constant domain (CL); heavy chains contain one variable domain (V H), and ei- ther three or four constant domains (C H1, C H2, C H3, and CH4), depending on the antibody class (Figure 4-6). X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that im- munoglobulin domains are folded into a characteristic com-pact structure called the immunoglobulin fold. This structure consists of a \"sandwich\" of two /H9252pleated sheets, each containing antiparallel /H9252strands of amino acids, which are connected by loops of various lengths (Figure 4-7). The /H9252 strands within a sheet are stabilized by hydrogen bonds thatconnect the -NH groups in one strand with carbonyl groupsof an adjacent strand (see Figure 4-4). The /H9252strands are characterized by alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilicamino acids whose side chains are arranged perpendicular tothe plane of the sheet; the hydrophobic amino acids are ori-ented toward the interior of the sandwich, and the hy-drophilic amino acids face outward. The two /H9252sheets within an immunoglobulin fold are sta- bilized by the hydrophobic interactions between them and bythe conserved disulfide bond. An analogy has been made totwo pieces of bread, the butter between them, and a tooth-pick holding the slices together. The bread slices represent thetwo /H9252pleated sheets; the butter represents the hydrophobic interactions between them; and the toothpick represents theintrachain disulfide bond. Although variable and constantdomains have a similar structure, there are subtle differencesbetween them. The V domain is slightly longer than the C do-main and contains an extra pair of /H9252strands within the /H9252- sheet structure, as well as the extra loop sequence connectingthis pair of /H9252strands (see Figure 4-7). The basic structure of the immunoglobulin fold con- tributes to the quaternary structure of immunoglobulinsby facilitating noncovalent interactions between domains80 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 4-1Chain composition of the five immunoglobulin classes in humans Heavy Light Molecular Class chain Subclasses ON CCH ON HO NC HO NC CCH ON CC CH ON CCC C C C CR R R R R R R RR R R R R R R RH ONC FIGURE 4-4Structural formula of a /H9252pleated sheet containing two antiparallel /H9252strands.

Interactions form links between identical domains (e.g., C H2/C H2, CH3/C H3, and C H4/C H4) and between nonidentical do- mains (e.g., V H/VLand C H1/C L). The structure of the im- munoglobulin fold also allows for variable lengths andsequences of amino acids that form the loops connecting the /H9252strands.

The pattern of this variation is best summarized bya quantitative plot of the variability at each position of thepolypeptide chain. The variability is defined as: # of different amino acids at a given position Variability /H11005 Frequency of the most common amino acidat given positionThus if a comparison of the sequences of 100 heavy chainsrevealed that a serine was found in position 7 in 51 of the se-quences (frequency 0.51), it would be the most commonamino acid. If examination of the other 49 sequences showedthat position 7 was occupied by either glutamine, histidine,proline, or tryptophan, the variability at that position wouldbe 9.8 (5/0.51). Variability plots of V Land V Hdomains of hu- man antibodies show that maximum variation is seen inthose portions of the sequence that correspond to the loopsthat join the /H9252strands (Figure 4-9). These regions were orig- inally called hypervariable regions in recognition of their high variability. Hypervariable regions form the antigen-binding site of the antibody molecule.

The three heavy-chain and three light-chain CDR regions are located on the loops that con-nect the /H9252strands of the V Hand V Ldomains. The remainder of the V Land V Hdomains exhibit far less variation; these stretches are called the framework regions (FRs). The wide range of specificities exhibited by antibodies is due to varia-tions in the length and amino acid sequence of the six CDRsin each Fab fragment. The framework region acts as a scaf-fold that supports these six loops. The three-dimensionalstructure of the framework regions of virtually all antibodiesanalyzed to date can be superimposed on one another; in contrast, the hypervariable loops (i.e., the CDRs) have differ-ent orientations in different antibodies.

In general, more residues in theheavy-chain CDRs appear to contact antigen than in thelight-chain CDRs.

The dominant role of the heavy chain in antigen binding was demonstratedin a study in which a single heavy chain specific for a glyco-protein antigen of the human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) was combined with various light chains of differentantigenic specificity. All of the hybrid antibodies bound tothe HIV glycoprotein antigen, indicating that the heavy chainalone was sufficient to confer specificity. However, oneshould not conclude that the light chain is largely irrelevant;in some antibody-antigen reactions, the light chain makesthe more important contribution. The actual shape of the antigen binding site formed by whatever combination of CDRs are used in a particular anti-body has been shown to vary dramatically. As pointed out inChapter 3, contacts between a large globular protein antigenand antibody occur over a broad, often rather flat, undulat-ing face. In the area of contact, protrusions or depressions onthe antigen are likely to match complementary depressionsor protrusions on the antibody. In the case of the well studiedlysozyme/anti-lysozyme system, crystallographic studieshave shown that the surface areas of interaction are quitelarge, ranging from about 650 \u00c5 2to more than 900 \u00c52. Within this area, some 15-22 amino acids in the antibodycontact the same number of residues in the protein antigen.In contrast, antibodies bind smaller antigens, such as smallhaptens, in smaller, recessed pockets in which the ligand isburied. This is nicely illustrated by the interaction of thesmall octapeptide hormone angiotensin II with the binding site of an anti-angiotensin antibody (Figure 4-10). Conformational Changes May Be Induced by Antigen Binding As more x-ray crystallographic analyses of Fab fragments were completed, it became clear that in some cases binding ofantigen induces conformational changes in the antibody,antigen, or both. Formation of the complex between neur-aminidase and anti-neuraminidase is accompanied by achange in the orientation of side chains of both the epitopeand the antigen-binding site. This conformational change re-sults in a closer fit between the epitope and the antibody'sbinding site. In another example, comparison of an anti-hemagglutinin Fab fragment before and after binding to a hemagglutininpeptide antigen has revealed a visible conformational changein the heavy-chain CDR3 loop and in the accessible surface ofthe binding site. Another striking example of conformationalchange has been seen in the complex between an Fab frag-ment derived from a monoclonal antibody against the HIVprotease and the peptide epitope of the protease. As shown inFigure 4-11, there are significant changes in the Fab uponbinding. In fact, upon antigen binding, the CDR1 region ofthe light chain moves as much as 1 \u00c5 and the heavy chainCDR3 moves 2.7 \u00c5. Thus, in addition to variability in theAntibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 85 L1H3 L2 L3H1H2 FIGURE 4-11Structure of a complex between a peptide derived from HIV protease and an Fab fragment from an anti-protease ant i- body ( left) and comparison of the Fab structure before and after pep- tide binding ( right).

There are significant conf or- mational changes in the CDRs of the Fab on binding the antigen.These are especially pronounced in the light chain CDR 1(L1) and the heavy chain al., Page 85 mac76 mac76:385 Go ldsby et al./Immunology5e:length and amino acid composition of the CDR loops, the ability of these loops to significantly change conformationupon antigen binding enables antibodies to assume a shapemore effectively complementary to that of their epitopes. As already indicated, conformational changes following antigen binding need not be limited to the antibody. Al-though it is not shown in Figure 4-11, the conformation ofthe protease peptide bound to the Fab shows no structuralsimilarity to the corresponding epitope in the native HIVprotease. It has been suggested that the inhibition of proteaseactivity by this anti-HIV protease antibody is a result of itsdistortion of the enzyme's native conformation. Constant-Region Domains The immunoglobulin constant-region domains take part invarious biological functions that are determined by theamino acid sequence of each domain. CH1AND C LDOMAINS The C H1 and C Ldomains serve to extend the Fab arms of the antibody molecule, thereby facilitating interaction with anti-gen and increasing the maximum rotation of the Fab arms.In addition, these constant-region domains help to hold theV Hand V Ldomains together by virtue of the interchain disulfide bond between them (see Figure 4-6). Also, the C H1 and C Ldomains may contribute to antibody diversity by al- lowing more random associations between V Hand V Ldo- mains than would occur if this association were driven by theVH/VLinteraction alone. These considerations have impor- tant implications for building a diverse repertoire of anti-bodies. As Chapter 5 will show, random rearrangements ofthe immunoglobulin genes generate unique V Hand V Lse- quences for the heavy and light chains expressed by each Blymphocyte; association of the V Hand V Lsequences then generates a unique antigen-binding site. The presence of C H1 and C Ldomains appears to increase the number of stable V H and V Linteractions that are possible, thus contributing to the overall diversity of antibody molecules that can be expressedby an animal. HINGE REGION The /H9253,/H9254, and /H9251heavy chains contain an extended peptide se- quence between the C H1 and C H2 domains that has no ho- mology with the other domains (see Figure 4-8). This region,called the hinge region, is rich in proline residues and is flex- ible, giving IgG, IgD, and IgA segmental flexibility. As a result,the two Fab arms can assume various angles to each otherwhen antigen is bound. This flexibility of the hinge regioncan be visualized in electron micrographs of antigen-anti-body complexes. For example, when molecule containingtwo dinitrophenol (DNP) groups reacts with anti-DNP anti-body and the complex is captured on a grid, negativelystained, and observed by electron microscopy, large com-plexes (e.g., dimers, trimers, tetramers) are seen. The anglebetween the arms of the Y-shaped antibody molecules differsin the different complexes, reflecting the flexibility of thehinge region (Figure 4-12).86 PART II Generation of FIGURE 4-12Experimental demonstration of the flexibility of the hinge region in antibody molecules.

The antibody protein stands out as a light struc- ture against the electron-dense background. Because of the flex ibility of the hinge region, the angle between the arms of the antibody mol- ecules varies. [Photograph from R. C. Valentine and N. M. Green, 1967,J. Mol.

The large number of proline residues in thehinge region gives it an extended polypeptide conformation,making it particularly vulnerable to cleavage by proteolyticenzymes; it is this region that is cleaved with papain or pepsin(see Figure 4-3). The cysteine residues form interchain disul-fide bonds that hold the two heavy chains together. The num-ber of interchain disulfide bonds in the hinge region variesconsiderably among different classes of antibodies and be-tween species. Although /H9262and /H9280chains lack a hinge region, they have an additional domain of 110 amino acids(C H2/C H2) that has hingelike features. OTHER CONSTANT-REGION DOMAINS As noted already, the heavy chains in IgA, IgD, and IgG con-tain three constant-region domains and a hinge region,whereas the heavy chains in IgE and IgM contain four con-stant-region domains and no hinge region. The correspond-ing domains of the two groups are as follows: IgA, IgD, IgG IgE, CH3/CH3 CH4/CH4 Although the C H2/C H2 domains in IgE and IgM occupy the same position in the polypeptide chains as the hinge regionin the other classes of immunoglobulin, a function for thisextra domain has not yet been determined. X-ray crystallographic analyses have revealed that the two C H2 domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG (and the C H3 do- mains of IgE and IgM) are separated by oligosaccharide sidechains; as a result, these two globular domains are muchmore accessible than the others to the aqueous environ-ment (see Figure 4-8b). This accessibility is one of the ele-ments that contributes to the biological activity of thesedomains in the activation of complement components byIgG and IgM. The carboxyl-terminal domain is designated C H3/ C H3 in IgA, IgD, and IgG and C H4/C H4 in IgE and IgM. The five classes of antibody and their subclasses can be expressed ei-ther as secreted immunoglobulin (sIg) or domain in secreted immunoglobulin differs in both struc-ture and function from the corresponding domain in mem-brane-bound immunoglobulin. Secreted immunoglobulinhas a hydrophilic amino acid sequence of various lengths atthe carboxyl-terminal end. The functions of this domain inthe various classes of secreted antibody will be describedlater. In membrane-bound immunoglobulin, contains three regions:IAn extracellular hydrophilic sequencecomposed of 26 amino acid residues IA hydrophobic transmembrane sequence IA short cytoplasmic tail The length of the transmembrane sequence is constant among all immunoglobulin isotypes, whereas the lengths of the extra-cellular spacer sequence and the cytoplasmic tail vary. B cells express different classes of mIg at different devel- opmental stages. The immature B cell, called a pre-B cell, ex-presses only mIgM; later in maturation, mIgD appears and iscoexpressed with IgM on the surface of mature B cells beforethey have been activated by antigen. A memory B cell can ex-press mIgM, mIgG, mIgA, or mIgE. Even when differentclasses are expressed sequentially on a single cell, the anti-genic specificity of all the membrane antibody molecules ex-pressed by a single cell is identical, so that each antibodymolecule binds to the same epitope. The genetic mechanismthat allows a single B cell to express multiple immunoglobu-lin isotypes all with the same antigenic specificity is de-scribed in Chapter 5. Antibody-Mediated Effector Functions In addition to binding antigen, antibodies participate in a broad range of other biological activities. When consideringthe role of antibody in defending against disease, it is impor-tant to remember that antibodies generally do not kill or remove pathogens solely by binding to them. In order to be effective against pathogens, antibodies must not only recognize antigen, but also invoke responses\u2014effector functions\u2014that will result in removal of the antigen anddeath of the pathogen. While variable regions of antibody arethe sole agents of binding to antigen, the heavy-chain con-stant region (C H) is responsible for a variety of collaborative interactions with other proteins, cells, and tissues that resultin the effector functions of the humoral response. Because these effector functions result from interactions between heavy-chain constant regions and other serum pro-teins or cell-membrane receptors, not all classes of im-munoglobulin have the same functional properties. Anoverview of four major effector functions mediated by do-mains of the constant region is presented here. A fifth func-tion unique to IgE, the activation of mast cells, eosinophils,and basophils, will be described later. Opsonization Is Promoted by Antibody Opsonization, the promotion of phagocytosis of antigens by macrophages and neutrophils, is an important factor in an-tibacterial defenses. Protein molecules called Fc receptors (FcR), which can bind the constant region of Ig molecules, are present on the surfaces of macrophages and neutrophils.Antibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 878536d_ch04_076-104 9/5/02 AM Page 87 al./Immunology5e:The binding of phagocyte Fc receptors with several antibody molecules complexed with the same target, such as a bacter-ial cell, produces an interaction that results in the binding ofthe pathogen to the phagocyte membrane. This crosslinkingof the FcR by binding to an array of antibody Fc regions ini-tiates a signal-transduction pathway that results in thephagocytosis of the antigen-antibody complex. Inside thephagocyte, the pathogen becomes the target of various de-structive processes that include enzymatic digestion, oxida-tive damage, and the membrane-disrupting effects ofantibacterial peptides. Antibodies Activate Complement IgM and, in humans, most IgG subclasses can activate a col-lection of serum glycoproteins called the complement sys- tem. Complement includes a collection of proteins that can perforate cell membranes. An important byproduct of thecomplement activation pathway is a protein fragment calledC3b, which binds nonspecifically to cell- and antigen-anti-body complexes near the site at which complement was acti-vated. Many cell types\u2014for example, red blood cells andmacrophages\u2014have receptors for C3b and so bind cells orcomplexes to which C3b has adhered. Binding of adherentC3b by macrophages leads to phagocytosis of the cells ormolecular complexes attached to C3b. Binding of antigen-antibody complexes by the C3b receptors of a red blood cellallows the erythrocyte to deliver the complexes to liver orspleen, where resident macrophages remove them withoutdestroying the red cell. The collaboration between antibodyand the complement system is important for the inactivationand removal of antigens and the killing of pathogens. Theprocess of complement activation is described in detail inChapter 13. Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) Kills Cells The linking of antibody bound to target cells (virus infected cells of the host) with the Fc receptors of a number of celltypes, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, can direct the cy-totoxic activities of the effector cell against the target cell. In this process, called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyto- toxicity (ADCC), the antibody acts as a newly acquired re- ceptor enabling the attacking cell to recognize and kill the target cell. The phenomenon of ADCC is discussed inChapter 14. Some Antibodies Can Cross Epithelial Layers by Transcytosis The delivery of antibody to the mucosal surfaces of the respi- ratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts, as well as its ex - port to breast milk, requires the movement of immunoglob-ulin across epithelial layers, a process called transcytosis. The capacity to be transported depends on properties of theconstant region. In humans and mice, IgA is the major anti- body species that undergoes such transcytosis, although IgMcan also be transported to mucosal surfaces. Some mam-malian species, such as humans and mice, also transfer sig-nificant amounts of most subclasses of IgG from mother tofetus. Since maternal and fetal circulatory systems are sepa-rate, antibody must be transported across the placental tissuethat separates mother and fetus. In humans, this transfertakes place during the third trimester of gestation. The im-portant consequence is that the developing fetus receives asample of the mother's repertoire of antibody as a protectiveendowment against pathogens. As with the other effectorfunctions described here, the capacity to undergo transpla-cental transport depends upon properties of the constant re-gion of the antibody molecule. The transfer of IgG from mother to fetus is a form of pas- sive immunization, which is the acquisition of immunity by receipt of preformed antibodies rather than by active pro-duction of antibodies after exposure to antigen. The ability totransfer immunity from one individual to another by thetransfer of antibodies is the basis of passive antibody therapy,an important and widely practiced medical procedure (seeClinical Focus). Antibody Classes and Biological Activities The various immunoglobulin isotypes and classes have been mentioned briefly already. Each class is distinguishedby unique amino acid sequences in the heavy-chain con-stant region that confer class-specific structural and func-tional properties. In this section, the structure and effectorfunctions of each class are described in more detail. Themolecular properties and biological activities of the immunoglobulin classes are summarized in Table 4-2(page 90). The structures of the five major classes are dia-gramed in Figure 4-13 (page 91). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) IgG, the most abundant class in serum, about80% of the total serum immunoglobulin. The IgG of two /H9253heavy chains and two /H9260or two /H9261light chains (see Figure 4-13a). There are four human IgG subclasses, dis-tinguished by differences in /H9253-chain sequence and numbered according to their decreasing average serum concentrations:IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 (see Table 4-2). acid sequences that distinguish the four IgG subclasses are encoded by different germ-line C Hgenes, whose DNA sequences are 90%-95% homologous. Thestructural characteristics that distinguish these subclassesfrom one another are the size of the hinge region and thenumber and position of the interchain disulfide bonds be-tween the heavy chains (Figure 4-14, page 92). The subtle88 PART II Generation of B-Cell T-Cell Go et al./Immunology5e:Antibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 89 tice. During the 1930s and 1940s , pas- sive endowment ofresistance to ofthe agent of immunity from an immu-nized donor to an unimmunized recipi-ent, was used to prevent or modify thecourse of measles and hepatitis A. Dur-ing subsequent years, clinical experienceand advances in the technology of prepa-ration of immunoglobulin for passiveimmunization have made this approacha standard medical practice. Passive im-munization based on the transfer of anti-bodies is widely used in the treatment ofimmunodeficiency diseases and as aprotection against anticipated exposureto infectious agents against which onedoes not have immunity. Immunoglobulin for passive immu- nization is prepared from the pooledplasma of thousands of donors. In effect,recipients of these antibody preparationsare receiving a sample of the antibodiesproduced by many people to a broad di-versity of different pathogens. In fact agram of intravenous immune globulin(IVIG) contains about 10 18molecules of antibody (mostly IgG) and may incorpo-rate more than 10 7different antibody specificities. During the course of ther-apy, patients receive significant amountsof IVIG, usually 200-400 mg per kilo- gram of body weight. This means that an immunodeficient patient weighing 70kilograms would receive 14to 28 grams of IVIG every 3to 4weeks. A prod- uct derived from the blood of such alarge number of donors carries a risk ofharboring pathogenic agents, particu-larly viruses. The risk is minimized by the processes used to produce intra-venous immune globulin. The manufac-ture of IVIG involves treatment withsolvents, such as ethanol, and the use ofdetergents that are highly effective in inactivating viruses such as HIV and he-patitis. In addition to removing or inacti-vating infectious agents, the productionprocess must also eliminate aggregatedimmunoglobulin, because antibody ag-gregates can trigger massive activationof the complement pathway, leading tosevere, even fatal, anaphylaxis. Passively administered antibody ex- erts its protective action in a number ofways. One of the most important is therecruitment of the complement pathwayto the destruction or removal of apathogen. In bacterial infections, anti-body binding to bacterial surfaces pro-motes opsonization, the phagocytosisand the invader by Toxins andviruses can be bound and neutralized byantibody, even as the antibody marks thepathogen for removal from the body byphagocytes and by organs such as liverand kidneys. By the initiation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity(ADCC), antibodies can also mediate thekilling of target cells by cytotoxic cell pop-ulations such as natural killer cells.In 1890, Emil and Shibasaburo Kitasato reported an extra-ordinary experiment. They immunizedrabbits with tetanus and then collectedserum from these animals. Subse-quently, they injected 0.2ml of the im- mune serum into the abdominal cavity ofsix mice. After 24hours, they infected the treated animals and untreated controlswith live, virulent tetanus bacteria. All ofthe control mice died within 48hours of infection, whereas the treated mice notonly survived but showed no effects ofinfection. This landmark experimentdemonstrated two important points.One, it showed that following immuniza-tion, substances appeared in serum thatcould protect an animal against path-ogens. Two, this work demonstrated thatimmunity could be passively acquired.Immunity could be transferred from oneanimal to another by taking serum froman immune animal and injecting it into anonimmune one. These and subsequentexperiments did not go unnoticed. Bothmen eventually received titles (Behringbecame von Behring and Kitasato be-came Kitasato). A few years later,in 1901 , von Behring was awarded the first Nobel prize in Medicine. These early observations and others paved the way for the introduction ofpassive immunization into clinical prac-CLINICAL FOCUS Passive Antibody Therapy amino acid differences between subclasses of IgG affect the biological activity of the molecule: IIgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 readily cross the placenta and play an important role in protecting the developing fetus. IIgG3 is the most effective complement activator,followed by IgG1; IgG2 is less efficient, and IgG4 is notable to activate complement at all. IIgG1 and IgG3 bind with high affinity to Fc receptors onphagocytic cells and thus mediate opsonization. IgG4has an intermediate affinity for Fc receptors, and IgG2has an extremely low affinity.Immunoglobulin M (IgM) IgM accounts for 5%-10% of the total serum immunoglob-ulin, with an average serum concentration of 1.5 mg/ml.Monomeric IgM, with a molecular weight of 180,000, is ex-pressed as membrane-bound antibody on B cells. IgM is se-creted by plasma cells as a pentamer in which five monomerunits are held together by disulfide bonds that link their car-boxyl-terminal heavy chain domains (C /H92624/C /H92624) and their C/H92623/C /H92623 domains (see Figure 4-13e). The five monomer subunits are arranged with their Fc regions in the center of the pentamer and the ten antigen-binding sites on the periphery of the molecule. Each pentamer contains an 8536d_ch04_076-104 9/6/02 9:02 PM Page 85:365_s mm:Goldsby al. / Immunology 5e:90 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 4-2Properties and biological activities ,000 150 ,000 150 ,000- 150,000- 900,000 190 ,000 150 ,000 .53 .00 .51 .50 .0003 0 .03 level (mg/ml) In vivo serum 23 23 8 23 6 6 5 2 .53 half life (days) monomers; IgA exist as a monomer, dimer, trimer, or tetramer.

IgM is the first isotype produced by the neonate and during a primary immune response. additional Fc-linked polypeptide called the J (joining) chain, which is disulfide-bonded to the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue of two of the ten /H9262 chains. The J chain ap- pears to be required for polymerization of the monomers toform pentameric IgM; it is added just before secretion of thepentamer. IgM is the first immunoglobulin class produced in a pri- mary response to an antigen, and it is also the first im-munoglobulin to be synthesized by the neonate. Because ofits pentameric structure with 10 antigen-binding sites, serumIgM has a higher valency than the other isotypes. An IgMmolecule can bind 10 small hapten molecules; however, be-cause of steric hindrance, only 5 or fewer molecules of largerantigens can be bound simultaneously. Because of its high va-lency, pentameric IgM is more efficient than other isotypes inbinding antigens with many repeating epitopes such as viralparticles and red blood cells (RBCs). For example, whenRBCs are incubated with specific antibody, they clump to-gether into large aggregates in a process called agglutination.It takes 100 to 1000 times more molecules of IgG than of IgMto achieve the same level of agglutination. A similar phenom-enon occurs with viral particles: less IgM than IgG is requiredto neutralize viral infectivity. IgM is also more efficient than IgG at activating complement. Complement activation re-quires two Fc regions in close proximity, and the pentamericstructure of a single molecule of IgM fulfills this requirement. Because of its large size, IgM does not diffuse well and therefore is found in very low concentrations in the intercel-lular tissue fluids. The presence of the J chain allows IgM tobind to receptors on secretory cells, which transport it acrossepithelial linings to enter the external secretions that bathemucosal surfaces. Although IgA is the major isotype foundin these secretions, IgM plays an important accessory role asa secretory immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Although IgA constitutes only 10%-15% of the total im-munoglobulin in serum, it is the predominant im-munoglobulin class in external secretions such as breastmilk, saliva, tears, and mucus of the bronchial, genitouri-nary, and digestive tracts. In serum, IgA exists primarily as amonomer, but polymeric forms (dimers, trimers, and sometetramers) are sometimes seen, all containing a 9/5/02 6:19 AM Page 90 mac76 mac76:385 Go ldsby (see Figure 4-13d). The IgA of external secre- tions, called secretory IgA, consists of a dimer or a J-chain polypeptide, and a polypeptide chain called secre- tory component (Figure 4-15a, page 93). As is explained be- low, secretory component is derived from the receptor that isresponsible for transporting polymeric IgA across cell mem-branes. The J-chain polypeptide in IgA is identical to thatfound in pentameric IgM and serves a similar function in fa-cilitating the polymerization of both serum IgA and secre- tory IgA. The secretory component is a 70,000-MW polypep-tide produced by epithelial cells of mucous membranes. Itconsists of five immunoglobulin-like domains that bind tothe Fc region domains of the IgA dimer. This interaction isstabilized by a disulfide bond between the fifth domain of thesecretory component and one of the chains of the dimericIgA.Antibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 91 (b) the five major classes of se- creted antibody. Light chains are shown in shades of pink, disu lfide bonds are indicated by thick black lines. Note that the IgG, Ig A, and IgD heavy chains (blue, orange, and green, respectively) contai n four domains and a hinge region, whereas the IgM and IgE heavy chain s (purple and yellow, respectively) contain five domains but no h inge region. The polymeric forms of IgM and IgA contain a polypeptid e,called the J chain, that is linked by two disulfide bonds to th e Fc re- gion in two different monomers. Serum IgM is always a pentamer;most serum IgA exists a monomer, although dimers, trimers, a nd even tetramers are sometimes present. Not shown in these figure s are intrachain disulfide bonds and disulfide bonds linking ligh t and heavy chains (see Figure 4-2).8536d_ch04_076-104 9/5/02 6:19 AM Page 91 mac76 mac76:385 Go ldsby et al./Immunology5e:The daily production of secretory IgA is greater than that of any other immunoglobulin class. IgA-secreting plasmacells are concentrated along mucous membrane surfaces.Along the jejunum of the small intestine, for example, thereare more than 2.5 /H1100310 10IgA-secreting plasma cells\u2014a number that surpasses the total plasma cell population of thebone marrow, lymph, and spleen combined! Every day, a hu-man secretes from 5 g to 15 g of secretory IgA into mucoussecretions. The plasma cells that produce IgA preferentially migrate (home) to subepithelial tissue, where the secreted IgA bindstightly to a receptor for polymeric immunoglobulin mole-cules (Figure 4-15b). This poly-Ig receptor is expressed on the basolateral surface of most mucosal epithelia (e.g., thelining of the digestive, respiratory, and genital and onglandular epithelia in the mammary, salivary, and lacrimalglands. After polymeric IgA binds to the poly-Ig receptor, thereceptor-IgA complex is transported across the epithelialbarrier to the lumen. Transport of the receptor-IgA complexinvolves receptor-mediated endocytosis into coated pits anddirected transport of the vesicle across the epithelial cell tothe luminal membrane, where the vesicle fuses with theplasma membrane. The poly-Ig receptor is then cleaved en-zymatically from the membrane and becomes the secretorycomponent, which is bound to and released together withpolymeric IgA into the mucous secretions. The secretorycomponent masks sites susceptible to protease cleavage in thehinge region of secretory IgA, allowing the polymeric mole-cule to exist longer in the protease-rich mucosal environ-ment than would be possible otherwise. Pentameric IgM isalso transported into mucous secretions by this mechanism,although it accounts for a much lower percentage of anti-body in the mucous secretions than does IgA. The poly-Ig re-ceptor interacts with the J chain of both polymeric IgA andIgM antibodies. Secretory IgA serves an important effector function at mucous membrane surfaces, which are the main entry sitesfor most pathogenic organisms. Because it is polymeric, se- cretory IgA can cross-link large antigens with multiple epi-topes. Binding of secretory IgA to bacterial and viral surfaceantigens prevents attachment of the pathogens to the mu-cosal cells, thus inhibiting viral infection and bacterial colo-nization. Complexes of secretory IgA and antigen are easilyentrapped in mucus and then eliminated by the ciliated ep-ithelial cells of the respiratory tract or by peristalsis of thegut. Secretory IgA has been shown to provide an importantline of defense against bacteria such as Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and viruses such as polio, influenza, and reovirus. Breast milk contains secretory IgA and many other mole- cules that help protect the newborn against infection duringthe first month of life (Table 4-3). Because the immune sys-tem of infants is not fully functional, breast-feeding plays animportant role in maintaining the health of newborns. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) The potent biological activity of IgE allowed it to be identi-fied in serum despite its extremely low average serum con-centration (0.3 /H9262g/ml). IgE antibodies mediate the immediate hypersensitivity reactions that are responsible for the symp-toms of hay fever, asthma, hives, and anaphylactic shock. Thepresence of a serum component responsible for allergic reac-tions was first demonstrated in 1921 by K. Prausnitz and H. Kustner, who injected serum from an allergic person intra-dermally into a nonallergic individual. When the appropriate antigen was later injected at the same site, awheal and flare reaction (analogous to hives) developedthere. This reaction, called the P-K reaction (named for its originators, Prausnitz and Kustner), was the basis for the firstbiological assay for IgE activity. Actual identification of IgE was accomplished by K. and T. Ishizaka in 1966.

The rabbit antiserum was then allowed toreact with each class of human antibody known at that time(i.e., IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgD). In this way, each of the knownanti-isotype antibodies was precipitated and removed fromthe rabbit anti-serum. What remained was an anti-isotypeantibody specific for an unidentified class of antibody. Thisantibody turned out to completely block the P-K reaction.The new antibody was called IgE (in reference to the E anti-gen of ragweed pollen, which is a potent inducer of this classof antibody).IgE binds to Fc receptors on the membranes of blood ba- sophils and tissue mast cells. Cross-linkage of receptor-bound IgE molecules by antigen (allergen) induces basophilsand mast cells to translocate their granules to the plasmamembrane and release their contents to the extracellular en-vironment, a process known as degranulation. As a result, avariety of pharmacologically active mediators are releasedand give rise to allergic manifestations (Figure 4-16). Local-ized mast-cell degranulation induced by IgE also may releasemediators that facilitate a buildup of various cells necessaryfor antiparasitic defense (see Chapter 15).Antibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 93 FIGURE 4-15Structure and formation of secretory IgA.

FIGURE 4-16 Allergen cross-linkage of receptor-bound IgE on mast cells induces degranulation, causing release of substances(blue dots) that mediate light-chain type and a species (see Fig- ure 4-17a). Each isotype is encoded by a separate constant-region gene, and all members of a species carry the sameconstant-region genes (which may include multiple alleles).Within a species, each normal individual will express all iso-types in the serum. Different species inherit different con-stant-region genes and therefore express different isotypes.Therefore, when an antibody from one species is injectedinto another species, the isotypic determinants will be recog-nized as foreign, inducing an antibody response to the iso-typic determinants on the foreign antibody. Anti-isotypeantibody is routinely used for research purposes to deter- mine the class or subclass of serum antibody produced dur-ing an immune response or to characterize the class ofmembrane-bound antibody present on B cells. Allotype Although all members of a species inherit the same set of iso-type genes, multiple alleles exist for some of the genes (seeFigure 4-17b). These alleles encode subtle amino acid differ-ences, called allotypic determinants, that occur in some, butnot all, members of a species. The sum of the individual allo-typic determinants displayed by an antibody determines itsallotype. In humans, allotypes have been characterized for all four IgG subclasses, for one IgA subclass, and for the /H9260 light chain. The /H9253-chain allotypes are referred to as Gm markers. At least 25 different Gm allotypes have been identi-fied; they are designated by the class and subclass followed bythe allele number, for example, G1m(1), has allotypes, as A2m(1) three of these allotypic determinants represents dif- ferences in one to four amino acids that are encoded by different alleles. Antibody to allotypic determinants can be produced by injecting antibodies from one member of a species into an-other member of the same species who carries different allo-typic determinants. Antibody to allotypic determinantssometimes is produced by a mother during pregnancy in re-sponse to paternal allotypic determinants on the fetal im-munoglobulins. Antibodies to allotypic determinants canalso arise from a blood transfusion. Idiotype The unique amino acid sequence of the V Hand V Ldomains of a given antibody can function not only as an antigen-bind-ing site but also as a set of antigenic determinants. The idio-typic determinants arise from the sequence of the heavy- andlight-chain variable regions. Each individual antigenic deter-minant of the variable region is referred to as an idiotope (see Figure 4-17c). In some cases an idiotope may be the ac-tual antigen-binding site, and in some cases an idiotope maycomprise variable-region sequences outside of the antigen-binding site. Each antibody will present multiple idiotopes;the sum of the individual idiotopes is called the idiotype of the antibody. Because the antibodies produced by individual B cells de- rived from the same clone have identical variable-region se-quences, they all have the same idiotype. Anti-idiotypeantibody is produced by injecting antibodies that have mini-mal variation in their isotypes and allotypes, so that the idio-typic difference can be recognized. Often a homogeneousantibody such as myeloma protein or monoclonal antibodyis used. Injection of such an antibody into a recipient who isAntibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 95 FIGURE 4-17Antigenic determinants of immunoglobulins.

The B-Cell Receptor Immunologists have long been puzzled about how mIg me-diates an activating signal after contact with an antigen. Thedilemma is that all isotypes of mIg have very short cytoplas-mic tails: the mIgM mIgD cytoplasmic tails tail, 14 amino acids; and the mIgGand mIgE tails, 28 amino acids. In each case, the cytoplasmictail is too short to be able to associate with intracellular si g- naling molecules (e.g., tyrosine kinases and G proteins). The answer to this puzzle is that mIg does not constitute the entire antigen-binding receptor on B cells. Rather, the B- cell receptor (BCR) is a transmembrane protein complex composed of mIg and disulfide-linked heterodimers calledIg-/H9251/Ig-/H9252. Molecules of this heterodimer associate with an mIg molecule to form a BCR (Figure 4-18). The Ig- /H9251chainhas a long cytoplasmic tail containing 61 amino acids; the tail of the Ig- /H9252chain contains 48 amino acids. The tails in both Ig-/H9251and Ig- /H9252are long enough to interact with intracellular signaling molecules. Discovery of the Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimer by Michael Reth and his colleagues in the early 1990s hassubstantially furthered understanding of B-cell activation,which is discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Fc Receptors Bond to Fc Regions of Antibodies Many cells feature membrane glycoproteins called Fc recep- tors (FcR) that have an affinity for the Fc portion of the anti- body molecule. These receptors are essential for many of thebiological functions of antibodies. Fc receptors are responsi-ble for the movement of antibodies across cell membranesand the transfer of IgG from mother to fetus across the pla-centa. These receptors also allow passive acquisition of anti-body by many cell types, including B and T lymphocytes,neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and nat-ural killer cells. Consequently, Fc receptors provide a meansby which antibodies\u2014the products of the adaptive immunesystem\u2014can recruit such key cellular elements of innate im-munity as macrophages and natural killer cells. Engagementof antibody-bound antigens by the Fc receptors of macro-phages or neutrophils provides an effective signal for the efficient phagocytosis (opsonization) of antigen-antibodycomplexes. In addition to immunoregulatory signals that affect cell activation,induce differentiation and, in some cases, downregulate cel-lular responses. There are many different Fc receptors (Figure 4-19). The poly Ig receptor is essential for the transport of polymericimmunoglobulins (polymeric IgA and to some extent, pen-tameric IgM) across epithelial surfaces. In humans, theneonatal Fc receptor (FcR N)transfers IgGs from mother to fetus during gestation and also plays a role in the regulationof IgG serum levels. Fc receptors have been discovered for allof the Ig classes. Thus there is an Fc /H9251R receptor that binds IgA, an Fc /H9280R that binds IgE (see Figure 4-16 also), an Fc /H9254R that binds IgD, IgM is bound by /H9262R, and several vari- eties of Fc /H9253R receptors capable of binding IgG and its sub- classes are found in humans. In many cases, the crosslinkingof these receptors by binding of antigen-antibody complexesresults in the initiation of signal-transduction cascades thatresult in such behaviors as phagocytosis or ADCC. The Fc re-ceptor is often part of a signal-transducing complex that in-volves the participation of other accessory polypeptidechains. As shown in Figure 4-19, this may involve a pair of /H9253 chains or, in the case of the IgE receptor, a more complex as-semblage of two /H9253chains and a /H9252chain. The association of an extracellular receptor with an intracellular signal-transduc-ing unit was seen in the B cell receptor (Figure 4-18) and is acentral feature of the T-cell-receptor complex (Chapter 9).96 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 4-18General structure of the B-cell receptor (BCR). This antigen-binding receptor is composed of (mIg) disulfide-linked heterodimers called Ig-/H9251/Ig-/H9252. Each heterodimer contains the immunoglobulin-fold structure and cytoplasmic tails much longer than those of mIg. As depicted, an mIg molecule is associated with one Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252 heterodimer.

Immunol. 10:97.]SSS SS S S SS SS SS SSSSS Immunoglobulin Superfamily The structures of the various immunoglobulin heavy and light chains described earlier share several features, suggest-ing that they have a common evolutionary ancestry. In particular, all heavy- and light-chain classes have the immunoglobulin-fold domain structure (see Figure 4-7).The presence of this characteristic structure in all im-munoglobulin heavy and light chains suggests that the genesencoding them arose from a common primordial gene en-coding a polypeptide of about 110 amino acids. Gene dupli-cation and later divergence could then have generated thevarious heavy- and light-chain genes. Large numbers of membrane proteins have been shown to possess one or more regions homologous to an im-munoglobulin domain. Each of these membrane proteins isclassified as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The term superfamily is used to denote proteins whose corre- sponding genes derived from a common primordial gene en-coding the basic domain structure. These genes have evolvedindependently and do not share genetic linkage or function.The following proteins, in addition to the immunoglobulinsthemselves, are representative members of the immunoglob-ulin superfamily (Figure 4-20):IIg-/H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimer, part of the B-cell receptor IPoly-Ig receptor, which contributes the secretory component to secretory IgA and IgM IT-cell receptor IT-cell accessory proteins, including /H9253,/H9254, /H9255chains and class II MHC molecules I/H92522-microglobulin, an invariant protein associated with class I cell-adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1,ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and LFA-3 IPlatelet-derived growth factor Numerous other proteins, some of them discussed in other chapters, also belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. X-ray crystallographic analysis has not been accom- plished for all members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.Nevertheless, the primary amino acid sequence of these proteins suggests that they all contain the typical immuno-globulin-fold domain. Specifically, all members of the immunoglobulin superfamily contain at least one or morestretches of about 110 amino acids, capable of arrangementAntibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 97 S S S SS S S SS S S SS S S S S SS S S S2mFcRI FcRNPoly IgR S S S SS SFcRII CD64CD32S S S S CD16FcRIIIA S S S S Fc/H9280RI S S S S CD89FcR FIGURE 4-19The structure of a number of human Fc-receptors.

Most members of the immunoglobulin superfamily can- not bind antigen. Thus, the characteristic Ig-fold structurefound in so many membrane proteins must have some func- tion other than antigen binding. One possibility is that theimmunoglobulin fold may facilitate interactions betweenmembrane proteins. As described earlier, interactions canoccur between the faces of /H9252pleated sheets both of homolo-8536d_ch04_076-104 9/5/02 6:19 al./Immunology5e:gous immunoglobulin domains (e.g., C H2/C H2 interaction) and of nonhomologous domains (e.g., V H/VLand C H1/C L interactions). Monoclonal Antibodies As noted in Chapter 3, most antigens offer multiple epitopesand therefore induce proliferation and differentiation of avariety of B-cell clones, each derived from a B cell that recog-nizes a particular epitope. The resulting serum antibodies areheterogeneous, comprising a mixture of antibodies, eachspecific for one epitope (Figure 4-21). Such a polyclonal an- tibody response facilitates the localization, phagocytosis, and complement-mediated lysis of antigen; it thus has clear ad-vantages for the organism in vivo. Unfortunately, the anti- body heterogeneity that increases immune protection in vivooften reduces the efficacy of an antiserum for various in vitrouses. For most research, diagnostic, and therapeutic pur-poses, monoclonal antibodies, derived from a single clone and thus specific for a single epitope, are preferable. Direct biochemical purification of a monoclonal anti- body from a polyclonal antibody preparation is not feasible.In 1975, Georges K\u00f6hler and Cesar Milstein devised amethod for preparing monoclonal antibody, which quicklybecame one of immunology's key technologies. By fusing anormal activated, antibody-producing B cell with a myelomacell (a cancerous plasma cell), they were able to generate a hy-brid cell, called a hybridoma, that possessed the immortal- growth properties of the myeloma cell and secreted theAntibodies: Structure and Function CHAPTER 4 99 214 3AntigenEpitopes 1 2 3 4+1 2 3 4 11 122 233 344 4Isolate spleen cells Hybridize Select conventional polyclonal antiserum produced in response to a complex antigen contains a mixture of mono-clonal antibodies, each specific for one of the four epitopesshown on the antigen (inset).

The result- ing clones of hybridoma cells, which secrete large quantitiesof monoclonal antibody, can be cultured indefinitely. Thedevelopment of techniques for producing monoclonal anti-bodies, the details of which are discussed in Chapter 23, gaveimmunologists a powerful and versatile research tool. Thesignificance of the work by K\u00f6hler and Milstein was ac-knowledged when each was awarded a Nobel Prize. Monoclonal Antibodies Have Important Clinical Uses Monoclonal antibodies are proving to be very useful as diag- nostic, imaging, and therapeutic reagents in clinical medi-cine. Initially, monoclonal antibodies were used primarily as in vitro diagnostic reagents. Among the many monoclonalantibody diagnostic reagents now available are products fordetecting pregnancy, diagnosing numerous pathogenic mi-croorganisms, measuring the blood levels of various drugs,matching histocompatibility antigens, and detecting anti-gens shed by certain tumors. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can also be used in vivo for detecting or locating tumor antigens, permitting ear-lier diagnosis of some primary or metastatic tumors in pa-tients. For example, monoclonal antibody to breast-cancercells is labeled with iodine-131 and introduced into the bloodto detect the spread of a tumor to regional lymph nodes. Thismonoclonal imaging technique can reveal breast-cancermetastases that would be undetected by other, less sensitivescanning techniques. Immunotoxins composed of tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies coupled to lethal toxins are potentially valuabletherapeutic The toxins used in preparing immuno-toxins include ricin, Shigella toxin, and diphtheria toxin, all of which inhibit protein synthesis. These toxins are so potentthat a single molecule has been shown to kill a cell. Each ofthese toxins consists of two types of functionally distinctpolypeptide components, an inhibitory (toxin) chain andone or more binding chains, which interact with receptors oncell surfaces; without the binding polypeptide(s) the toxincannot get into cells and therefore is harmless. An immuno-toxin is prepared by replacing the binding polypeptide(s)with a monoclonal antibody that is specific for a particulartumor cell (Figure 4-22a). In theory, the attached mono-clonal antibody will deliver the toxin chain specifically to tu - mor cells, where it will cause death by inhibiting proteinsynthesis (Figure 4-22b). The initial clinical responses tosuch immunotoxins in patients with leukemia, lymphoma,and some other types of cancer have shown promise, and re-search to develop and demonstrate their safety and effective-ness is underway. Abzymes Are Monoclonal Antibodies That Catalyze Reactions The binding of an antibody to its antigen is similar in many ways to the binding of an enzyme to its substrate. In bothcases the binding involves weak, noncovalent interactionsand exhibits high specificity and often high affinity. Whatdistinguishes an antibody-antigen interaction from an en-zyme-substrate interaction is that the antibody does not alterthe antigen, whereas the enzyme catalyzes a chemical changein its substrate. However, like enzymes, antibodies of appro-priate specificity can stabilize the transition state of a boundsubstrate, thus reducing the activation energy for chemicalmodification of the substrate. The similarities between antigen-antibody interactions and enzyme-substrate interactions raised the question ofwhether some antibodies could behave like enzymes and catalyze chemical reactions. T o investigate this possibility, a100 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell toxin + aa Active used to prepare immunotoxins include ricin, Shigella toxin, and diphtheria toxin. Each toxin contains an in- hibitory toxin chain (red) and a binding component (yellow). To make an immunotoxin, the binding component of the toxin is replacedwith a monoclonal antibody (blue). (b) Diphtheria toxin binds t o a cell-membrane receptor ( left) and a diphtheria-immunotoxin binds to a tumor-associated antigen ( right). In either case, the toxin is in- ternalized in an endosome. The toxin chain is then released int o the cytoplasm, where it inhibits protein synthesis by catalyzing th e inac- tivation of mac76:385 G oldsby et al./Immunology5e:hapten-carrier complex was synthesized in which the hapten structurally resembled the transition state of an ester under-going hydrolysis. Spleen cells from mice immunized with thistransition fused substrate, some of them accelerated hydrolysis by about1000-fold; that is, they acted like the enzyme that normallycatalyzes the substrate's hydrolysis. The catalytic activity ofthese antibodies was highly specific; that is, they hydrolyzedonly esters whose transition-state structure closely resembledthe transition state analogue used as a hapten in the immu-nizing conjugate. These catalytic antibodies have been calledabzymes in reference to their dual role as antibody and enzyme. A central goal of catalytic antibody research is the deriva- tion of a battery of abzymes that cut peptide bonds at specificamino acid residues, much as restriction enzymes cut DNAat specific sites. Such abzymes would be invaluable tools inthe structural and functional analysis of proteins. Addition-ally, it may be possible to generate abzymes with the ability todissolve blood clots or to cleave viral glycoproteins at specif ic sites, thus blocking viral infectivity. Unfortunately, catalyticantibodies that cleave the peptide bonds of proteins havebeen exceedingly difficult to derive. Much of the researchcurrently being pursued in this field is devoted to the solu-tion of this important but difficult problem. SUMMARY IAn antibody molecule consists of two identical light chainsand two identical heavy chains, which are linked by disul-fide bonds. Each heavy chain has an amino-terminal vari-able region followed by a constant region. IIn any given antibody molecule, the constant region con-tains one of five basic heavy-chain sequences ( /H9262,/H9253,/H9254,/H9251,o r /H9280) called /H9261) called different effector functions, average serum concentrations, and half-lives. IEach of the domains in the immunoglobulin molecule hasa characteristic tertiary structure called the immunoglob-ulin fold. The presence of an immunoglobulin fold do-main also identifies many other nonantibody proteins asmembers of the immunoglobulin superfamily. IWithin the amino-terminal variable domain each chain are three complementarity-determining re-gions (CDRs). These polypeptide regions contribute the anti-gen-binding site of an antibody, determining its specificity. IImmunoglobulins are expressed in two forms: secreted antibody that is produced by plasma cells, and mem-brane-bound antibody that associates with Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimers to form the B-cell antigen receptor present on the surface of B cells. IThe three major effector functions that enable antibodiesto remove antigens opsonization,which neutrophils; complement activation, which activates apathway that leads to the generation of a collection of pro-teins that can perforate antibodies that arise from many B cellclones and have a heterogeneous collection of bindingsites, a monoclonal antibody is derived from a single B cellclone and is a homogeneous collection of binding sites.

While we think of genomic DNA as a stable genetic blueprint, the lymphocyte cell lineage does not retain an in-tact copy of this blueprint. Genomic rearrangement is an es-sential feature of lymphocyte differentiation, and no othervertebrate cell type has been shown to undergo this process. This chapter first describes the detailed organization of the immunoglobulin genes, the process of Ig-gene rearrange-ment, and the mechanisms by which the dynamic im-munoglobulin genetic system generates more than 10 8 different antigenic specificities. Then it describes the mecha-nism of class switching, the role of differential RNA process-ing in the expression of immunoglobulin genes, and theregulation of Ig-gene transcription.

As immunoglobulin (Ig) sequence data accu-mulated, virtually every antibody molecule studied wasfound to contain a unique amino acid sequence in its vari-able region but only one of a limited number of invariant se-quences in its constant region. The genetic basis for thiscombination of constancy and tremendous variation in asingle protein molecule lies in the organization of the im-munoglobulin genes. In germ-line DNA, multiple gene segments encode por- tions of a single immunoglobulin heavy or light chain. Thesegene segments are carried in the germ cells but cannot betranscribed and translated into complete chains until theyare rearranged into functional genes. During B-cell matura-tion in the bone marrow, certain of these gene segments arerandomly shuffled by a dynamic genetic system capable ofgenerating more than 10 6combinations. Subsequent processes increase the diversity of the repertoire of antibodybinding sites to a very large number that exceeds 10 6by at least two or three orders of magnitude. The processes of B-cell development are carefully regulated: the maturation of aprogenitor B cell progresses through an ordered sequence ofIg-gene rearrangements, coupled with modifications to thegene that contribute to the diversity of the final product. Bythe end of this process, a mature, immunocompetent B cellwill contain coding sequences for one functional heavy-chain variable-region and one light-chain variable-region.The individual B cell is thus antigenically committed to aspecific epitope. After antigenic stimulation of a mature Bcell in peripheral lymphoid organs, further rearrangementof constant-region gene segments can generate changes inthe isotype expressed, which produce changes in the biolog-ical effector functions of the immunoglobulin moleculewithout changing its specificity. Thus, mature B cells containchromosomal DNA that is no longer identical to germ-lineKappa Light-Chain Rearrangement8536d_ch05_105-136 8/22/02 2:46 / Immunology 5e:biology of immunoglobulin genes to the engineering of anti- body molecules for therapeutic and research applications.Chapter 11 covers in detail the entire process of B-cell devel-opment from the first gene rearrangements in progenitor Bcells to final differentiation into memory B cells and anti-body-secreting plasma cells. Figure 5-1 outlines the sequen-tial stages in B-cell development, many of which result fromcritical rearrangements.Genetic Model Compatible with Ig Structure The results of the immunoglobulin-sequencing studies de- scribed in Chapter 4 revealed a number of features ofimmunoglobulin structure that were difficult to reconcile with classic genetic models.

Two different sets of theories emerged.The germ-line theories maintained that the genome con- tributed by the germ cells, egg and sperm, contains a largerepertoire of immunoglobulin genes; thus, these theories in-voked no special genetic mechanisms to account for anti-body diversity. They argued that the immense survival valueof the immune system justified the dedication of a significantfraction of the genome to the coding of antibodies. In con-trast, the somatic-variation theories maintained that the genome contains a relatively small number of immunoglob-ulin genes, from which a large number of antibody specifici-ties are generated in the somatic cells by mutation orrecombination. As the amino acid sequences of more and more im- munoglobulins were determined, it became clear that theremust be mechanisms not only for generating antibody diver-sity but also for maintaining constancy. Whether diversitywas generated by germ-line or by somatic mechanisms, aparadox remained: How could stability be maintained in theconstant (C) region while some kind of diversifying mecha-nism generated the variable (V) region? Neither the germ-line nor the somatic-variation propo- nents could offer a reasonable explanation for this centralfeature of immunoglobulin structure. Germ-line proponentsfound it difficult to account for an evolutionary mechanismthat could generate diversity in the variable part of the manyheavy- and light-chain genes while preserving the constantregion of each unchanged. Somatic-variation proponentsfound it difficult to conceive of a mechanism that could di-versify the variable region of a single heavy- or light-chaingene in the somatic cells without allowing alteration in theamino acid sequence encoded by the constant region. A third structural feature requiring an explanation emerged when amino acid sequencing of the humanmyeloma protein called Ti1 revealed that identical variable-region sequences were associated with both /H9253and /H9262heavy- chain constant regions. A similar phenomenon was observedin rabbits by C. T odd, who found that a particular allotypic marker in the heavy-chain variable region could be associ-ated with /H9251,/H9253, and /H9262 heavy-chain constant regions. Consid- erable additional evidence has confirmed that a singlevariable-region sequence, defining a particular antigenicspecificity, can be associated with multiple heavy-chain constant-region sequences; in other words, different classes,or isotypes, of (e.g., IgG, IgM) can be expressedwith identical variable-region sequences. Dreyer and Bennett Proposed the Two-Gene Model In an attempt to develop a genetic model consistent with the known findings about the structure of immunoglobulins, W.Dreyer and J. Bennett suggested, in their classic theoreticalpaper of 1965, that two separate genes encode a single im-munoglobulin heavy or light chain, one gene for the V region(variable region) and the other for the C region (constant re-gion). They suggested that these two genes must somehowcome together at the DNA level to form a continuous mes-sage that can be transcribed and translated into a single Igheavy or light chain. Moreover, they proposed that hundredsor thousands of V-region genes were carried in the germ line,whereas only single copies of C-region class and subclassgenes need exist. The strength of this type of recombinational model (which combined elements of the germ-line and somatic-variation theories) was that it could account for those im-munoglobulins in which a single V region was combinedwith various C regions. By postulating a single constant-region gene for each immunoglobulin class and subclass, themodel also could account for the conservation of necessarybiological effector functions while allowing for evolutionarydiversification of variable-region genes. At first, support for the Dreyer and Bennett hypothesis was indirect. Early studies of DNA hybridization kinetics us-ing a radioactive constant-region DNA probe indicated thatthe probe hybridized with only one or two genes, confirmingthe model's prediction that only one or two copies of eachconstant-region class and subclass gene existed. However, in-direct evidence was not enough to overcome stubborn resis-tance in the scientific community to the hypothesis of Dreyerand Bennet. The suggestion that two genes encoded a singlepolypeptide contradicted the existing one gene-onepolypeptide principle and was without precedent in anyknown biological system. As so often is the case in science, theoretical and intellec- tual understanding of Ig-gene organization progressed aheadof the available methodology. Although the Dreyer and Ben-nett model provided a theoretical framework for reconcilingthe dilemma between Ig-sequence data and gene organiza-tion, actual validation of their hypothesis had to wait for sev-eral major technological advances in the field of molecularbiology.Organization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 1078536d_ch05_105-136 8/1/02 8:53 AM Page al. / Immunology 5e:Tonegawa's Bombshell\u2014Immunoglobulin Genes Rearrange In 1976, S. T onegawa and N. Hozumi found the first direct evidence that separate genes encode the V and C regions ofimmunoglobulins and that the genes are rearranged in thecourse of B-cell differentiation. This work changed the fieldof immunology. In 1987, T onegawa was awarded the NobelPrize for this work. Selecting DNA from embryonic cells and adult myeloma cells\u2014cells at widely different stages of development\u2014T onegawa and Hozumi used various restriction endonucle-ases to generate DNA fragments. The fragments were thenseparated by size and analyzed for their ability to hybridizewith a radiolabeled mRNA probe. Two separate restrictionfragments from the embryonic DNA hybridized with themRNA, whereas only a single restriction fragment of theadult myeloma DNA hybridized with the same probe. T one-gawa and Hozumi suggested that, during differentiation oflymphocytes from the embryonic state to the fully differenti-ated plasma-cell stage (represented in their system by themyeloma cells), the V and C genes undergo rearrangement. In the embryo, the V and C genes are separated by a largeDNA segment that contains a restriction-endonuclease site;during differentiation, the V and C genes are brought closertogether and the intervening DNA sequence is eliminated. The pioneering experiments of T onegawa and Hozumi employed a tedious and time-consuming procedure that hassince been replaced by the much more powerful approach ofSouthern-blot analysis. This method, now universally used toinvestigate the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes,eliminates the need to elute the separated DNA restrictionfragments from gel slices prior to analysis by hybridizationwith an immunoglobulin gene segment probe. Figure 5-2shows the detection of rearrangement at the /H9260light-chain lo- cus by comparing the fragments produced by digestion ofDNA from a clone of B-lineage cells with the pattern ob-tained by digestion of non-B cells (e.g., sperm or liver cells).The rearrangement of a V gene deletes an extensive section ofgerm-line DNA, thereby creating differences between re-arranged and unrearranged Ig loci in the distribution andnumber of restriction sites. This results in the generation of 108 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 5-2Experimental basis for diagnosis of rearrangement at an immunoglobulin locus. The number and size of restriction fra g- ments generated by the treatment of DNA with a restriction enzy me is determined by the sequence of the DNA.The digestion of re-arranged DNA with a restriction enzyme (RE) yields a pattern of re- striction fragments that differ from those obtained by digestio n of an unrearranged locus with the same RE. Typically, the fragments a re an- alyzed by the technique of Southern blotting. In this example, a probe that includes a J gene segment is used to identify RE digestion frag- ments that include all or portions of this segment. As shown, r e- arrangement results in the deletion of a segment of germ-line D NA and the loss of the restriction sites that it includes. It also results in the joining of gene segments, in this case a V and a J segment, thatare separated in the germ line. Consequently, fragments depende nt on the presence of this segment for their generation are absent from the restriction-enzyme digest of DNA from the rearranged locus. Fur- thermore, rearranged DNA gives rise to novel fragments that are ab- sent from digests of DNA in the germ-line configuration. This c an be useful because both B cells and non-B cells have two immunoglob u- lin loci. One of these is rearranged and the other is not. Cons equently, unless a genetic accident has resulted in the loss of the germ- line lo- cus, digestion of DNA from a myeloma or normal B-cell clone wil l produce a pattern of restriction that includes all of those in a germ- line digest plus any novel fragments that are generated from th e change in DNA sequence that accompanies rearrangement. Notethat only one of the several J gene segements present is shown.3 5VnRE line Rearranged Germ line RearrangedDeleted RearrangementJ C Probe Probe RE digestion RE digestion Southern blot8536d_ch05_105-136 8/22/02 2:46 PM Page 108 mac46 mac46:1256 _des:8536d:Goldsby et / Immunology 5e:different restriction patterns by rearranged and unre- arranged loci. Extensive application of this approach hasdemonstrated that the Dreyer and Bennett two-genemodel\u2014one gene encoding the variable region and anotherencoding the constant region\u2014applied to both heavy andlight-chain genes. Multigene Organization of Ig Genes As cloning and sequencing of the light- and heavy-chainDNA was accomplished, even greater complexity was re-vealed than had been predicted by Dreyer and Bennett. The /H9260 and /H9261light chains and the heavy chains are encoded by sepa- rate multigene families situated on different chromosomes(Table 5-1). In germ-line DNA, each of these multigene fam-ilies contains several coding sequences, called gene seg- ments, separated by noncoding regions. During B-cell maturation, these gene segments are rearranged and broughttogether to form functional immunoglobulin genes. Each Multigene Family Has Distinct Features The /H9260and /H9261light-chain families contain V, J, and C gene seg- ments; the rearranged VJ segments encode the variable re- gion of the light chains. The heavy-chain family contains V, D, J, and C gene segments; the rearranged VDJ gene seg- ments encode the variable region of the heavy chain. In eachgene family, C gene segments encode the constant regions.Each V gene segment is preceded at its 5 /H11032end by a small exon that encodes a short signal or leader (L) peptide that guides the heavy or light chain through the endoplasmic reticulum.The signal peptide is cleaved from the nascent light and heavychains before assembly of the finished immunoglobulin mol-ecule. Thus, amino acids encoded by this leader sequence donot appear in the immunoglobulin molecule. /H9261-CHAIN MULTIGENE FAMILY The first evidence that the light-chain variable region was ac- tually encoded by two gene segments appeared when T one-gawa cloned the germ-line DNA that encodes the variableregion of mouse /H9261light chain and determined its completenucleotide sequence. When the nucleotide sequence was compared with the known amino acid sequence of the /H9261- chain variable region, an unusual discrepancy was observed.Although the first 97 amino acids of the /H9261-chain variable re- gion corresponded to the nucleotide codon sequence, the re-maining 13 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the protein'svariable region did not. It turned out that many base pairsaway a separate, 39-bp gene segment, called J for joining, en- coded the remaining 13 amino acids of the /H9261-chain variable region. Thus, a functional /H9261variable-region gene contains two coding segments\u2014a 5 /H11032V segment and a 3 /H11032J segment\u2014 which are separated by a noncoding DNA sequence in unre-arranged germ-line DNA. The /H9261multigene family in the mouse germ line contains three V /H9261gene segments, four J /H9261gene segments, and four C /H9261 gene segments (Figure 5-3a). The J /H92614 is a pseudogene, a de- fective gene that is incapable of encoding protein; suchgenes are indicated with the psi symbol ( /H9274). Interestingly, J /H92614's constant region partner, C /H92614, is a perfectly functional gene. The V /H9261and the three functional J /H9261gene segments en- code the variable region of the light chain, and each of thethree functional C /H9261gene segments encodes the constant re- gion of one of the three /H9261-chain subtypes ( /H92611,/H92612, and /H92613). In humans, the lambda locus is more complex. There are 31 functional V /H9261gene segments, 4 J /H9261segments, and 7 C /H9261segments. In additional to the functional gene seg- ments, the human lambda complex contains many V /H9261,J/H9261, and C /H9261pseudogenes. /H9260-CHAIN MULTIGENE FAMILY The /H9260-chain multigene in the mouse contains approx- imately 85 V /H9260gene segments, each with an adjacent leader se- quence a short distance upstream (i.e., on the 5 /H11032side). There are five J /H9260gene segments (one of which is a nonfunctional pseudogene) and a single C /H9260gene segment (Figure 5-3b). As in the /H9261multigene family, the V /H9260and J /H9260gene segments en- code the variable region of the /H9260light chain, and the C /H9260gene segment encodes the constant region. Since there is only oneC /H9260gene segment, there are no subtypes of /H9260light chains. Comparison of parts aand bof Figure 5-3 shows that the arrangement of the gene segments is quite different in the /H9260 and /H9261gene families. The /H9260-chain multigene family in hu- mans, which has an organization similar to that of themouse, contains approximately 40 V /H9260gene segments, 5 J /H9260 segments, and a single C /H9260segment. HEAVY-CHAIN MULTIGENE FAMILY The organization of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genesis similar to, but more complex than, that of the /H9260and /H9261light-chain genes (Figure 5-3c). An additional gene segment encodes part of the heavy-chain variable region.The existence of this gene segment was first proposed by Leroy Hood and his colleagues, who compared theheavy-chain variable-region amino acid sequence with theV Hand J Hnucleotide sequences. The V Hgene segment was found to encode amino acids 1 to 94 and the J Hgene segmentOrganization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 109 TABLE 5-1Chromosomal locations of immunoglobulin genes inhuman and mouse CHROMOSOME Gene Human Mouse /H9261Light chain 22 16 /H9260Light chain 26 Heavy chain 14 128536d_ch05_105-136 8/22/02 2:46 PM 109 mac46 mac46:1256 _des:8536d:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:was found to encode amino acids 98 to 113; however, neither of these gene segments carried the information to encodeamino acids 95 to 97. When the nucleotide sequence was de-termined for a rearranged myeloma DNA and comparedwith the germ-line DNA sequence, an additional nucleotidesequence was observed between the V Hand J Hgene seg- ments. This nucleotide sequence corresponded to aminoacids 95 to 97 of the heavy chain. From these results, Hood and his colleagues proposed that a third germ-line gene segment must join with the V Hand J H gene segments to encode the entire variable region of theheavy chain. This gene segment, which encoded amino acidswithin the third complementarity-determining region(CDR3), was designated D for diversity, because of its contri- bution to the generation of antibody diversity. T onegawa andhis colleagues located the D gene segments within mousegerm-line DNA with a cDNA probe complementary to the Dregion, which hybridized with a stretch of DNA lying be-tween the V Hand J Hgene segments. The heavy-chain multigene family on human chromo- some 14 has been shown by direct sequencing of DNA tocontain 51 V Hgene segments located upstream from a clus- ter of 27 functional D Hgene segments. As with the light- chain genes, each V Hgene segment is preceded by a leadersequence a short distance upstream. Downstream from the DHgene segments are six functional J Hgene segments, fol- lowed by a series of C Hgene segments. Each C Hgene seg- ment encodes the constant region of an immunoglobulinheavy-chain isotype. The C Hgene segments consist of introns. Each exon encodes a separatedomain of the heavy-chain constant region. A similar heavy-chain gene organization is found in the mouse. The conservation of important biological effector func- tions of the antibody molecule is maintained by the limitednumber of heavy-chain constant-region genes. In humansand mice, the C Hgene segments are arranged sequentially in the order C /H9262,C/H9254,C/H9253,C/H9280,C/H9251(see Figure 5-3c). This sequential arrangement is no accident; it is generally related to the se-quential expression of the immunoglobulin classes in thecourse of B-cell development and the initial IgM response ofa B cell to its first encounter with an antigen.

At the end of thisprocess, each B cell contains a single functional variable-region DNA sequence for its heavy chain and another for itslight chain. The process of variable-region gene rearrangement pro- duces mature, immunocompetent B cells; each such cell iscommitted to produce antibody with a binding site encodedby the particular sequence of its rearranged V genes. As de-scribed later in this chapter, rearrangements of the heavy-chain constant-region genes will generate further changes inthe immunoglobulin class (isotype) expressed by a B cell, butthose changes will not affect the cell's antigenic specificity. The steps in variable-region gene rearrangement occur in an ordered sequence, but they are random events that resultin the random determination of B-cell specificity. The order,mechanism, and consequences of these rearrangements aredescribed in this section.Light-Chain DNA Undergoes V-J Rearrangements Expression of both /H9260and /H9261light chains requires rearrange- ment of the variable-region V and J gene segments. In hu-mans, any of the functional V /H9261genes can combine with any of the four functional J /H9261-C/H9261combinations. In the mouse, things are slightly more complicated. DNA rearrangementcan join the V /H92611 gene segment with either the J /H92611 or the J /H92613 gene segment, or the V /H92612 gene segment can be joined with the J /H92612 gene segment. In human or mouse /H9260light-chain DNA, any one of the V /H9260gene segments can be joined with any one of the functional J /H9261gene segments. Rearranged /H9260and /H9261genes contain the following regions in order from the 5 /H11032to 3/H11032end: a short leader (L) exon, a non- coding sequence (intron), a joined VJ gene segment, a secondintron, and the constant region. Upstream from each leadergene segment is a promoter sequence. The rearranged light-chain sequence is transcribed by RNA polymerase from the Lexon through the C segment to the stop signal, generating alight-chain primary RNA transcript (Figure 5-4). The in-trons in the primary transcript are removed by RNA-processing enzymes, and the resulting light-chain messengerOrganization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 111 FIGURE 5-4Kappa light-chain gene rearrangement and RNA pro- cessing events required to generate a /H9260light-chain protein.

Heavy-Chain DNA Undergoes V-D-J Rearrangements Generation of a functional immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene requires two separate rearrangement events within thevariable region. As illustrated in Figure 5-5, a D Hgene seg- ment first joins to a J Hsegment; the resulting D HJHsegment then moves next to and joins a V Hsegment to generate a VHDHJHunit that encodes the entire variable region. In heavy-chain DNA, variable-region rearrangement producesa rearranged gene consisting of the following sequences,starting from the 5 /H11032end: a short L exon, an intron, a joined VDJ segment, another intron, and a series of C gene seg-ments. As with the light-chain genes, a promoter sequence islocated a short distance upstream from each heavy-chainleader sequence. Once heavy-chain gene rearrangement is accomplished, RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter sequence andtranscribe the entire heavy-chain gene, including the introns.Initially, both C /H9262and C /H9254gene segments are transcribed. Dif- ferential polyadenylation and RNA splicing remove the in-trons and process the primary transcript to generate mRNAincluding either the C /H9262or the C /H9254transcript. These two mRNAs are then translated, and the leader peptide of the re-sulting nascent polypeptide is cleaved, generating finished and /H9254chains. The production of two different heavy-chain mRNAs allows a mature, immunocompetent B cell to expressboth IgM and IgD with identical antigenic specificity on itssurface.112 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 5-5Heavy-chain gene rearrangement and RNA process- ing events required to generate finished /H9262or /H9254heavy-chain protein. Two DNA joinings are necessary to generate a functional heavy-c hain gene: a D Hto J Hjoining and Hto D HJHjoining. In this example, VH21, DH7, and J H3are joined. Expression of functional heavy-chaingenes, although generally similar to expression of light-chain genes, involves differential RNA processing, which generates several d iffer- ent products, including /H9262or /H9254heavy chains. Each C gene is drawn as a single coding sequence; in reality, each is organized as a se ries of exons and splicing heavy chainVJD L Immunology 5e:Mechanism of Variable-Region DNA Rearrangements Now that we've seen the results of variable-region gene re- arrangements, let's examine in detail how this process occursduring maturation of B cells. Recombination Signal Sequences Direct Recombination The discovery of two closely related conserved sequences in variable-region germ-line DNA paved the way to fuller un-derstanding of the mechanism of gene rearrangements. DNAsequencing studies revealed the presence of unique recombi- nation signal sequences (RSSs) flanking each germ-line V , D, and J gene segment. One RSS is located 3 /H11032to each V gene segment, 5 /H11032to each J gene segment, and on both sides of each D gene segment. These sequences function as signals for therecombination process that rearranges the genes. Each RSScontains a conserved palindromic heptamer and a conservedAT-rich nonamer sequence separated by an intervening se-quence of 12 or 23 base pairs (Figure 5-6a). The intervening12- and 23-bp sequences correspond, respectively, to one andtwo turns of the DNA helix; for this reason the sequences arecalled one-turn recombination signal sequences and two- turn signal sequences. The V /H9260signal sequence has a one-turn spacer, and the J /H9260 signal sequence has a two-turn spacer. In /H9261light-chain DNA, this order is reversed; that is, the V /H9261signal sequence has a two-turn spacer, and the J /H9261signal sequence has a one-turnspacer. In heavy-chain DNA, the signal sequences of the V H and J Hgene segments have two-turn spacers, the signals on either side of the D Hgene segment have one-turn spacers (Figure 5-6b). two-turn so-called one-turn/two-turn joining rule). This joining rule en-sures, for example, that a V Lsegment joins only to a J L segment and not to another V Lsegment; the rule likewise en- sures that V H,DH, and J Hsegments join in proper order and that segments of the same type do not join each other. Gene Segments Are Joined by Recombinases V-(D)-J recombination, which takes place at the junctionsbetween RSSs coding sequences, is catalyzed by enzymescollectively called V(D)J recombinase. Identification of the enzymes that catalyze recombination of V , D, and J gene segments began in the late 1980s and is stillongoing. In 1990 David Schatz, Marjorie Oettinger, andDavid Baltimore first reported the identification of two recombination-activating genes, designated RAG -1and RAG -2,whose encoded proteins act synergistically and are re- quired to mediate V-(D)-J joining. The deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) are the only lymphoid-specific gene products that have been shown to be involved in V-(D)-J rearrangement. The recombination of variable-region gene segments consists of the following steps, catalyzed by a system of re-combinase enzymes (Figure 5-7): IRecognition of recombination signal sequences (RSSs)by recombinase enzymes, followed by synapsis in whichOrganization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 113 FIGURE 5-6Two conserved sequences in light-chain and heavy- chain DNA function as recombination signal sequences (RSSs).(a) Both signal sequences consist of a conserved palindromic he p- tamer and separated bynonconserved spacers and heavy-chain germ- line DNA.

The transcriptional orientation of the genesegments to be joined determines the fate of the signal jointand intervening DNA. When the two gene segments are inthe same transcriptional orientation, joining results in dele-tion of the signal joint and intervening DNA as a circular ex-cision product (Figure 5-8). Less frequently, the two genesegments have opposite orientations.

(a) Deletional joining occurs when the gene segments to be join ed have the same transcriptional orientation (indicated by horizon tal blue arrows). This process yields two products: a rearranged VJ unit that includes the coding joint, and a circular excision product con- sisting of the recombination signal sequences (RSSs), signal jo int, and intervening DNA. (b) Inversional joining occurs when the ge ne segments have opposite transcriptional orientations. In this ca se, the RSSs, signal joint, and intervening DNA are retained, and the o rien- tation of one of the joined segments is inverted. In both types of re- combination, a few nucleotides may be deleted from or added to the cut ends of the coding sequences before they are rejoined. FIGURE 5-8Circular DNA isolated from thymocytes in which the DNA encoding the chains of the T-cell receptor (TCR) undergoes re- arrangement in a process like that involving the immunoglobulingenes. Isolation of this circular excision product is direct ev idence for the mechanism of deletional joining shown in [From K. Okazaki al. / Immunology 5e:both the coding joint and the signal joint (and intervening DNA) on the chromosome. In the human /H9260locus, about half of the V /H9260gene segments are inverted with respect to J /H9260and their joining is thus by inversion. Ig-Gene Rearrangements May Be Productive or Nonproductive One of the striking features of gene-segment recombination is the diversity of the coding joints that are formed betweenany two gene segments. Although the double-strand DNAbreaks that initiate V-(D)-J rearrangements are introducedprecisely at the junctions of signal sequences and coding se-quences, the subsequent joining of the coding sequences isimprecise. Junctional diversity at the V-J and V-D-J generated by a number of mechanisms: variation incutting of the hairpin to generate P-nucleotides, variation intrimming of the coding sequences, variation in N-nucleotideaddition, and flexibility in joining the coding sequences. Theintroduction of randomness in the joining process helps gen-erate antibody diversity by contributing to the hypervariabil-ity of the antigen-binding site. (This phenomenon is coveredin more detail below in the section on generation of antibodydiversity.)Another consequence of imprecise joining is that gene segments may be joined out of phase, so that the triplet read-ing frame for translation is not preserved. In such a nonpro- ductive rearrangement, the resulting VJ or VDJ unit is likely to contain numerous stop codons, which interrupt transla-tion (Figure 5-9). When gene segments are joined in phase,the reading frame is maintained. In such a productive re- arrangement, the resulting VJ or VDJ unit can be translated in its entirety, yielding a complete antibody. If one allele rearranges nonproductively, a B cell may still be able to rearrange the other allele productively. If an in-phase rearranged heavy-chain and light-chain gene are notproduced, the B cell dies by apoptosis. It is estimated thatonly one in three attempts at V L-JLjoining, and one in three subsequent attempts at V H-DHJHjoining, are productive. As a result, less than 1/9 (11%) of the early-stage pre-B cells inthe bone marrow progress to maturity and leave the bonemarrow as mature immunocompetent B cells.

In-phase joining (arrows 1, 2, and 3) generates a productive rearrangement, which can be translated into protein.

HH H* * ** HPaternal chromosomes Gene rearrangementMaternal chromosomes Maternal H chain Maternal chain Maternal H chain Paternal chain FIGURE 5-10Because of allelic exclusion, the immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes of only one parental chromosome ar e expressed per cell. This process ensures that B cells possess a single antigenic specificity. The allele selected for rearrangement is chosen randomly. Thus the expressed immunoglobulin may contain one ma-ternal and one paternal chain or both chains may derive from on ly one parent. Only B cells and T cells exhibit allelic exclusion. Asterisks () indicate the mac46:1256 _des:8536d:Goldsby / Immunology 5e:diploid, it expresses the rearranged heavy-chain genes from only one chromosome and the rearranged light-chain genesfrom only one chromosome. The process by which this is ac-complished, called allelic exclusion, ensures that functional B cells never contain more than one V HDHJHand one V LJL unit (Figure 5-10). This is, of course, essential for the antigenic specificity of the B cell, because the expression ofboth alleles would render the B cell multispecific. The phe-nomenon of allelic exclusion suggests that once a productiveV H-DH-JHrearrangement and a productive V L-JLrearrange- ment have occurred, the recombination machinery is turnedoff, so that the heavy- and light-chain genes on the homolo-gous chromosomes are not expressed. G. D. Y ancopoulos and F. W. Alt have proposed a model to account for allelic exclusion (Figure 5-11). They suggest thatonce a productive rearrangement is attained, its encodedprotein is expressed and the presence of this protein acts as a signal to prevent further gene rearrangement. According to their model, the presence of /H9262heavy chains signals the 116 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 5-11Model to account for allelic exclusion. Heavy-chain genes rearrange first, and once a productive heavy-chain generearrangement occurs, the /H9262protein product prevents rearrange- ment of the other heavy-chain allele and initiates light-chain gene rearrangement. In the mouse, rearrangement of /H9260light-chain genes precedes rearrangement of the /H9261genes, as shown here. In humans,V J\u00b5 Productive of allele #2\u00b5 + chains inhibit rearrangement \u00b5 + chains inhibit rearrangement of allele #2 and rearrangement \u00b5 heavy chain inhibits rearrangement of allele #2 and rearrangement \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5maturing B cell to turn off rearrangement of the other heavy-chain allele and to turn on rearrangement of the /H9260 light-chain genes. If a productive /H9260rearrangement occurs, /H9260 light chains are produced and then pair with /H9262heavy chains to form a complete antibody molecule. The presence of thisantibody then turns off further light-chain rearrangement.If/H9260rearrangement is nonproductive for both /H9260alleles, re- arrangement of the /H9261-chain genes begins. If neither /H9261allele rearranges productively, the B cell presumably ceases to ma-ture and soon dies by apoptosis. Two studies with transgenic mice have supported the hy- pothesis that the protein products encoded by rearrangedheavy- and light-chain genes regulate rearrangement of theremaining alleles. In one study, transgenic mice carrying arearranged /H9262heavy-chain transgene were prepared. The /H9262 transgene product was expressed by a large percentage of theB cells, and rearrangement of the endogenous immunoglob-ulin heavy-chain genes was blocked. Similarly, cells from atransgenic mouse carrying a /H9260light-chain transgene did not either /H9260or /H9261rearrangement can proceed once a productive heavy- chain rearrangement has occurred. Formation of a completeimmunoglobulin inhibits further light-chain gene rearrangement. If a nonproductive rearrangement occurs for one allele, then the c ell attempts rearrangement of the other allele. [Adapted from G. D. Yancopoulos and F. W. Alt, 5e:rearrange the endogenous /H9260-chain genes when the /H9260trans- gene was expressed and was associated with a heavy chain toform complete immunoglobulin. These studies suggest thatexpression of the heavy- and light-chain proteins may indeedprevent gene rearrangement of the remaining alleles and thusaccount for allelic exclusion. Generation of Antibody Diversity As the organization of the immunoglobulin genes was deci-phered, the sources of the vast diversity in the variable regionbegan to emerge. The germ-line theory, mentioned earlier,argued that the entire variable-region repertoire is encodedin the germ line of the organism and is transmitted from par-ent to offspring through the germ cells (egg and sperm). Thesomatic-variation theory held that the germ line contains alimited number of variable genes, which are diversified in thesomatic cells by mutational or recombinational events dur-ing development of the immune system. With the cloningand sequencing of the immunoglobulin genes, both modelswere partly vindicated. T o date, seven means of antibody diversification have been identified in mice and humans: IMultiple germ-line gene association of light and heavy chains Although the exact contribution of each of these avenues of diversification to total antibody diversity is not known, theyeach contribute significantly to the immense number of dis-tinct antibodies that the mammalian immune system is ca-pable of generating. There Are Numerous Germ-Line V, D, and J Gene Segments An inventory of functional V , D, and J gene segments in the germ-line DNA of one human reveals 51 V H, 25 D, 6 J H, 40 V /H9260,5 J /H9260, 31 V /H9261, and 4 J /H9261gene segments. In addition to these functional segments, there are many pseudogenes. It shouldbe borne in mind that these numbers were largely derivedfrom a landmark study that sequenced the DNA of the immunoglobulin loci of a single individual. The immuno-globulin loci of other individuals might contain slightly dif-ferent numbers of particular types of gene segments. In the mouse, although the numbers are known with less precision than in the human, there appear to be about 85 V /H9260 gene segments and 134 V Hgene segments, 4 functional J H,4functional J /H9260, 3 functional J /H9261, and an estimated 13 D Hgene segments, but only three V /H9261gene segments. Although the number of germ-line genes found in either humans or miceis far fewer than predicted by early proponents of the germ-line model, multiple germ-line V , D, and J gene segmentsclearly do contribute to the diversity of the antigen-bindingsites in antibodies. Combinatorial V-J and V-D-J Joining Generates Diversity The contribution of multiple germ-line gene segments to an- tibody diversity is magnified by the random rearrangementof these segments in somatic cells. It is possible to calculatehow much diversity can be achieved by gene rearrangments(Table 5-2). In humans, the ability of any of the 51 V Hgene segments to combine with any of the 27 D Hsegments and any of the 6 J Hsegments allows a considerable amount of heavy-chain gene diversity to be generated (51 /H1100327/H110036/H11005 8262 possible combinations). Similarly, 40 V /H9260gene segments randomly combining with 5 J /H9260segments has the potential of generating 200 possible combinations at the /H9260locus, while 30 V/H9261and 4 J /H9261gene segments allow up to 120 possible combina- tions at the human /H9261locus. It is important to realize that these are minimal calculations of potential diversity. Junc-tional flexibility and P- and N-nucleotide addition, as men-tioned above, and, especially, somatic hypermutation, whichwill be described shortly, together make an enormous contri-bution to antibody diversity. Although it is not possible tomake an exact calculation of their contribution, most work-ers in this field agree that they raise the potential for antib ody combining-site diversity in humans to well over 10 10. This does not mean that, at any given time, a single individual hasa repertoire of 10 10different antibody combining sites. These very large numbers describe the set of possible variations, ofwhich any individual carries a subset that is smaller by severa l orders of magnitude. Junctional Flexibility Adds Diversity The enormous diversity generated by means of V , D, and Jcombinations is further augmented by a phenomenon calledjunctional flexibility. As described above, recombination in- volves both the joining of recombination signal sequences toform a signal joint and the joining of coding sequences toform a coding joint (see Figure 5-7). Although the signal se-quences are always joined precisely, joining of the coding se-quences is often imprecise. In one study, for example, joiningof the V /H926021 and J /H92601 coding sequences was analyzed in several pre-B cell lines. Sequence analysis of the signal and codingjoints revealed the contrast in junctional precision (Figure 5-12). As illustrated previously, junctional flexibility leads to many nonproductive rearrangements, but it also generatesproductive combinations that encode alternative aminoacids at each coding joint (see Figure 5-9), thereby increasingantibody diversity.

Also, in the human case, only the functional gene segments have been listed. The genome contains additional segments that are incapable of rearrangement or cont ain stop codons or both. In the mouse case, the figures contained in the table are only best es timates, because the locus has not been completely sequenced. Because of the diversity contributed by junctional flexibility, P-region nucleotide addition, N-region nucleotide addition, an d somatic mutation, the actual potential exceeds these estimates by several orders of magnitude. FIGURE 5-12Experimental evidence for junctional flexibility in im- munoglobulin-gene rearrangement. The nucleotide sequences flank - ing the coding joints between V /H926021and J /H92601and the corresponding signal joint sequences were determined in four pre-B cell lines . The sequence constancy in the signal joints contrasts with the sequ ence variability in the coding joints. Pink and yellow shading indic ate nu- cleotides derived from V /H926021and J respectively, and purple and or- ange Immunology 5e:(Figure 5-13b). Evidence that TdT is responsible for the ad- dition of these N-nucleotides has come from transfection studies transfected withthe RAG-2 genes, V-D-J rearrangement occurred but no N-nucleotides were present in the coding joints. How-ever, when the fibroblasts were also transfected with the geneencoding TdT, then V-D-J rearrangement was accompaniedby addition of N-nucleotides at the coding joints. Up to 15 N-nucleotides can be added to both the D H-JH and V H-DHJHjoints. Thus, a complete heavy-chain variable region is encoded by a V HND HNJHunit. The additional heavy- chain diversity generated by N-region nucleotide addition is quite large because N regions appear to consist ofwholly random sequences. Since this diversity occurs at V-D-Jcoding joints, it is localized in CDR3 of the heavy-chain genes. Somatic Hypermutation Adds Diversity in Already-Rearranged Gene Segments All the antibody diversity described so far stems from mech- anisms that operate during formation of specific variable regions by gene rearrangement. Additional antibody diver-sity is generated in rearranged variable-region gene units bya process called somatic hypermutation. As a result of so- matic hypermutation, individual nucleotides in VJ or VDJunits are replaced with alternatives, thus potentially alteringthe specificity of the encoded immunoglobulins. Normally, somatic hypermutation occurs only within germinal centers (see Chapter 11), structures that form in sec-ondary lymphoid organs within a week or so of immuniza-tion with an antigen that activates a T-cell-dependent B-cellresponse. Somatic hypermutation is targeted to rearranged V-regions located within a DNA sequence containing about1500 nucleotides, which includes the whole of the VJ or VDJsegment. Somatic hypermutation occurs at a frequency ap-proaching 10 /H110023per base pair per generation. This rate is at least a hundred thousand-fold higher (hence the name hyper- mutation ) than the spontaneous mutation rate, about 10/H110028/bp/generation, in other genes. Since the combined length of the H-chain and L-chain variable-region genes isabout 600 bp, one expects that somatic hypermutation willintroduce at least one mutation per every two cell divisions inthe pair of V Hand V Lgenes that encode an antibody. The mechanism of somatic hypermutation has not yet been determined. Most of the mutations are nucleotide substitutionsrather than deletions or insertions. Somatic hypermutation in-troduces these substitutions in a largely, but not completely,random fashion. Recent evidence suggests that certain nu-cleotide motifs and palindromic sequences within V Hand V L may be especially susceptible to somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutations occur throughout the VJ or VDJ segment, but in mature B cells they are clustered within theCDRs of the V Hand V Lsequences, where they are most likely to influence the overall affinity for antigen. Following expo-sure to antigen, those B cells with higher-affinity receptorswill be preferentially selected for survival.

P-Addition Adds Diversity at Palindromic Sequences As described earlier, after the initial single-strand DNA cleav- age at the junction of a variable-region gene segment and at-tached signal sequence, the nucleotides at the end of thecoding sequence turn back to form a hairpin structure (seeFigure 5-7). This hairpin is later cleaved by an endonuclease.This second cleavage sometimes occurs at a position thatleaves a short single strand at the end of the coding sequence.The subsequent addition of complementary nucleotides tothis strand by repair enzymes generates a palin- dromic sequence in the coding joint, and so these nucleotidesare called P-nucleotides (Figure 5-13a). Variation in the po- sition at which the hairpin is cut thus leads to variation in t he sequence of the coding joint. N-Addition Adds Considerable Diversity by Addition of Nucleotides Variable-region coding joints in rearranged heavy-chain genes have been shown to contain short amino acid se-quences that are not encoded by the germ-line V , D, or J genesegments.

The overall process, called affinity maturation, takes place within germinal centers, and is de- scribed more fully in Chapter 11. Claudia Berek and Cesar Milstein obtained experimental evidence demonstrating somatic hypermutation during thecourse of an immune response to a hapten-carrier conju-gate. These researchers were able to sequence mRNA thatencoded antibodies raised against a hapten in response toprimary, secondary, or tertiary immunization (first, second,or third exposure) with a hapten-carrier conjugate. Thehapten they chose was 2-phenyl-5-oxazolone (phOx), cou-pled to a protein carrier. They chose this hapten because ithad previously been shown that the majority of antibodiesit induced were encoded by a single germ-line V Hand V /H9260 gene segment. Berek and Milstein immunized mice with thephOx-carrier conjugate and spleencells to the H chain and /H9260light chain of each hybridoma was then determined to identify deviations from the germ-linesequences. The results of this experiment are depicted in Figure 5-14. Of the 12 hybridomas obtained from mice seven daysafter a primary immunization, all used a particular V H, the VHOx-1 gene segment, and all but one used the same V L gene segment, V /H9260Ox-1. Moreover, only a few mutations from the germ-line sequence were present in these hybrido-mas. By day 14 after primary immunization, analysis of eighthybridomas revealed that six continued to use the germ-lineV HOx-1 gene segment and all continued to use the V /H9260Ox-1 gene segment. Now, however, all of these hybridomas included one or more mutations from the germ-line sequence. Hybridomas analyzed from the secondary and tertiary responses showed a larger percentage utilizinggerm-line V Hgene segments other than the V HOx-1 gene. In those hybridoma clones that utilized the V HOx-1 and V /H9260 Ox-1 gene segments, most of the mutations were clusteredin the CDR1 and CDR2 hypervariable regions. The numberof mutations in the anti-phOx hybridomas progressively in-creased following primary, secondary, and tertiary immu-nizations, as did the overall affinity of the antibodies forphOx (see Figure 5-14). A Final Source of Diversity Is Combinatorial Association of Heavy and Light Chains In humans, there is the potential to generate 8262 heavy- chain genes and 320 light-chain genes as a result of variable-region gene rearrangements. Assuming that any one of thepossible heavy-chain and light-chain genes can occur ran-domly in the same cell, the potential number of heavy- andlight-chain combinations is 2,644,240. This number is prob-ably higher than the amount of combinatorial diversity actu-ally generated in an individual, because it is not likely that a ll V Hand V Lwill pair with each other. Furthermore, the re- combination process is not completely random; not all V H, D, or V Lgene segments are used at the same frequency. Some are used often, others only occasionally, and still others al-most never. Although the number of different antibody combining sites the immune system can generate is difficult to calculatewith precision, we know that it is quite high.

In this example, four extra base pairs (blue) are present in the coding joint as the result of P-nucleotide addition.

In addition tothese sources of antibody diversity, the phenomenon of so-matic hypermutation contributes enormously to the reper-toire after antigen stimulation. Class Switching among Constant-Region Genes After antigenic stimulation of a B cell, the heavy-chain DNA can undergo a further rearrangement in which the V HDHJHunit can combine with any C Hgene segment. The exact mechanism of this process, called class switching or iso- type switching, is unclear, but it involves DNA flanking sequences (called switch regions ) located 2-3 kb upstream from each C Hsegment (except C /H9254). These switch regions, though rather large (2 to 10 kb), are composed of multiplecopies of short repeats (GAGCT and TGGGG). One hy-pothesis is that a protein or system of proteins that consti-tute the switch recombinase recognize these repeats andupon binding carry out the DNA recombination that resultsin class switching. Intercellular regulatory proteins knownas cytokines act as \"switch factors\" and play major roles indetermining the particular immunoglobulin class that is ex-pressed as a consequence of switching.

In some cases, IL-4 has been observed to induce class switch-ing in a successive manner: first from C /H9262to C /H92531 and then from C /H92531 to C /H9280(Figure 5-15). Examination of the DNA ex- cision products produced during class switching from C /H9262to C/H92531 showed that a circular excision product containing C /H9262 together with the 5 /H11032end of the /H92531 switch region (S /H92531) and the 3 /H11032end of the /H9262switch region (S /H9262) was generated. Fur- thermore, the switch from C /H92531 to C /H9280produced circular exci- sion products containing C /H92531 together with portions of the /H9262,/H9253, and /H9280switch regions. Thus class switching depends upon the interplay of three elements: switch regions, aswitch recombinase, and the cytokine signals that dictate theisotype to which the B cell switches. A more complete de-scription of the role of cytokines in class switching appears in Chapter 11. Expression of Ig Genes As in the expression of other genes, post-transcriptionalprocessing of immunoglobulin primary transcripts is required to produce functional mRNAs (see Figures 5-4and 5-5). The primary transcripts produced from re-arranged heavy-chain and contain inter-vening DNA sequences that introns andJ gene segments not lost during V-(D)-J rearrangement.In addition, as noted earlier, the heavy-chain C-gene 122 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 5-15Proposed mechanism for class switching induced by interleukin 4in rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes.

Each exon of a C Hgene segment corre- sponds to a constant-region domain or a hinge region ofthe heavy-chain polypeptide. The primary transcript mustbe processed to remove the intervening DNA sequences,and the remaining exons must be connected by a processcalled RNA splicing. Short, moderately conserved splicesequences, or splice sites, which are located at the intron-exon boundaries within a primary transcript, signal thepositions at which splicing occurs. Processing of the pri-mary transcript in the nucleus removes each of these in-tervening sequences to yield the final mRNA product. ThemRNA is then exported from the nucleus to be translatedby ribosomes into complete H or L chains. Heavy-Chain Primary Transcripts Undergo Differential RNA Processing Processing of an immunoglobulin heavy-chain primary transcript can yield several different mRNAs, which explainshow a single B cell can produce secreted or membrane-bound forms of a particular immunoglobulin and simulta-neously express IgM and IgD. EXPRESSION OF MEMBRANE OR SECRETED IMMUNOGLOBULIN As explained in Chapter 4, a particular immunoglobulin can exist in either membrane-bound or secreted form. The twoforms differ in the amino acid sequence of the heavy-chaincarboxyl-terminal domains (C H3/C H3 in IgA, IgD, and IgG and C H4/C H4 in IgE and IgM). The secreted form has a hy- drophilic sequence of about 20 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal domain; this is replaced in the membrane-boundform with a sequence of about 40 amino acids containing ahydrophilic segment that extends outside the cell, a hy-drophobic transmembrane segment, and a short hydrophilicsegment at the carboxyl terminus that extends into the cyto-plasm (Figure 5-16a). For some time, the existence of thesetwo forms seemed inconsistent with the structure of germ-line heavy-chain DNA, which had been shown to contain asingle C Hgene segment corresponding to each class and subclass. The resolution of this puzzle came from DNA sequenc- ing of the C /H9262gene segment, which consists of four exons (C/H92621, C /H92622, C /H92623, and C /H92624) corresponding to the four do- mains of the IgM molecule. The C /H92624 exon contains a nu- cleotide sequence (called S) at its 3 /H11032end that encodes the hydrophilic sequence in the C H4 domain of secreted IgM. Two additional exons called M1 and M2 are located just1.8 kb downstream from the 3 /H11032end of the C /H92624 exon. The M1 exon encodes the transmembrane segment, and M2encodes the cytoplasmic segment of the C H4 domain in membrane-bound IgM. Later DNA sequencing revealedthat all the C Hgene segments have two additional down- stream M1 and M2 exons that encode the transmembraneand cytoplasmic segments. The primary transcript produced by transcription of a re- arranged /H9262heavy-chain gene contains two polyadenylation signal sequences, or poly-A sites, in the C /H9262segment. Site 1 is located at the 3 /H11032end of the C /H92624 exon, and site 2 is at the 3 /H11032 end of the M2 exon (Figure 5-16b). If cleavage of the pri-mary transcript and addition of the poly-A tail occurs at site1, the M1 and M2 exons are lost. Excision of the introns andsplicing of the remaining exons then produces mRNA en-coding the secreted form of the heavy chain. If cleavage andpolyadenylation of the primary transcript occurs instead atsite 2, then a different pattern of splicing results. In this case , splicing removes the S sequence at the 3 /H11032end of the C /H92624 exon, which encodes the hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal endof the secreted form, and joins the remainder of the C /H92624 exon with the M1 and M2 exons, producing mRNA for themembrane form of the heavy chain. Thus, differential processing of a common primary tran- script determines whether the secreted or membrane formof an immunoglobulin will be produced. As noted previ-ously, mature naive B cells produce only membrane-boundantibody, whereas differentiated plasma cells produce se-creted antibodies. It remains to be determined precisely hownaive B cells and plasma cells direct RNA processing prefer-entially toward the production of mRNA encoding one formor the other. SIMULTANEOUS EXPRESSION OF IgM AND IgD Differential RNA processing also underlies the simultane-ous expression of membrane-bound IgM and IgD by ma-ture B cells. As mentioned already, transcription ofrearranged heavy-chain genes in mature B cells producesprimary transcripts containing both the C /H9262and C /H9254gene segments. The C /H9262and C /H9254, gene segments are close together in the rearranged gene (only about 5 kb apart), and the lackof a switch site between them permits the entire VDJC /H9262C/H9254 region to be transcribed into a single primary RNA tran-script about 15 kb long, which contains four poly-A sites(Figure 5-17a). Sites 1 and 2 are associated with C /H9262,a s d e - scribed in the previous section; sites 3 and 4 are located atsimilar places in the C /H9254gene segment. If the heavy-chain transcript is cleaved and polyadenylated at site 2 after theC /H9262exons, then the mRNA will encode the membrane form of the /H9262heavy chain (Figure 5-17b); if polyadenylation is instead further downstream at site 4, after the C /H9254exons, then RNA splicing will remove the intervening C /H9262exons and produce mRNA encoding the membrane form of the /H9254 heavy chain (Figure 5-17c). Since the mature B cell expresses both IgM and IgD on its membrane, both processing pathways must occur si-multaneously.

Synthesis, of Immunoglobulins Immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain mRNAs separate polyribosomes of the rough endo-plasmic reticulum (RER). Newly synthesized chains con-tain an amino-terminal leader sequence, which serves toguide the chains into the lumen of the RER, where the sig-nal sequence is then cleaved. The assembly of light (L) andheavy (H) chains into the disulfide-linked and glycosylatedimmunoglobulin molecule occurs as the chains passthrough the cisternae of the RER. The complete moleculesare transported to the Golgi apparatus and then into secretory vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane (Figure 5-18). The order of chain assembly varies among the im- munoglobulin classes. In the case of IgM, the H and L chainsassemble within the RER to form half-molecules, and thentwo half-molecules assemble to form the complete molecule.In the case of IgG, two H chains assemble, then an H 2L inter- mediate is assembled, and finally the complete H 2L2mole- cule is formed. Interchain disulfide bonds are formed, andthe polypeptides are glycosylated as they move through theGolgi apparatus. If the molecule contains the transmembrane sequence of the membrane form, it becomes anchored in the membraneof a secretory vesicle and is inserted into the plasma mem-brane as the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane (seeFigure 5-18, insert). If the molecule contains the hydrophilicsequence of secreted immunoglobulins, it is transported as afree molecule in a secretory vesicle and is released from thecell when the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane.Organization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 125 FIGURE 5-17Expression of membrane forms of /H9262and /H9254heavy chains by alternative RNA processing.

As withother eukaryotic genes, three major classes of cis regulatorysequences in DNA regulate transcription of immunoglobu-lin genes: IPromoters: relatively short nucleotide sequences, extending about 200 bp upstream from the transcriptioninitiation site, that promote initiation of RNAtranscription in a specific direction IEnhancers: nucleotide sequences situated some distance upstream or downstream from a gene that activatetranscription from the promoter sequence in anorientation-independent manner ISilencers: nucleotide sequences that down-regulate transcription, operating in both directions over adistance. The locations of the three types of regulatory elements in germ-line immunoglobulin DNA are shown in Figure 5-19.All of these regulatory elements have clusters of sequencemotifs that can bind specifically to one or more nuclear pro-teins. Each V Hand V Lgene segment has a promoter located just upstream from the leader sequence. In addition, the J /H9260 cluster and each of the D Hgenes of the heavy-chain locus are preceded by promoters. Like other promoters, the immunoglobulin promoters contain a highly conserved AT-rich sequence called the TATA box, which serves as a site forthe binding of a number of proteins that are necessary for theinitiation of RNA transcription. The actual process of tran-scription is performed by RNA polymerase II, which startstranscribing DNA from the initiation site, located about 25bp downstream of the TATA box. Ig promoters also containan essential and conserved octamer that confers B-cell speci-ficity on the promoter. The octamer binds two transcriptionfactors, oct-1, found in many cell types, and oct-2, foundonly in B cells. While much remains to be learned about the function of enhancers, they have binding sites for a number of proteins,many of which are transcription factors. A particularly im-portant role is played by two proteins encoded by the E2A gene which can undergo alternate splicing to generate twocollaborating proteins, both of which bind to the /H9262and /H9260in- tronic enhancers. These proteins are essential for B-cell de-velopment and E2A knockout mice make normal numbers ofT cells but show a total absence of B cells. Interestingly, trans-fection of these enhancer-binding proteins into a T cell lineresulted in a dramatic increase in the transcription of /H9262chain mRNA and even induced the T cell to undergo D H/H11001JH DHJHrearrangement.

If so, they could be important con- tributors to the high levels of Ig gene transcription that arecharacteristic of B cells but absent in other cell types. One heavy-chain enhancer is located within the intron between the last (3 /H11032) J gene segment and the first (5 /H11032) C gene segment (C /H9262), which encodes the /H9262heavy chain. Because this heavy-chain enhancer (E /H9262) is located 5 /H11032of the S /H9262switch site near C /H9262, it can continue to function after class switching has occurred. Another heavy-chain enhancer (3 /H11032/H9251E) has been detected 3 /H11032of the C /H9251gene segment. One /H9260light-chain enhancer (E /H9260) is located between the J /H9260segment and the C/H9260segment, and another enhancer (3 /H11032/H9260E) is located 3 /H11032of the C /H9260segment. The /H9261light-chain enhancers are located 3 of C /H92614 and 3 /H11032of C /H92611. Silencers have been identified in heavy-chain and /H9260-chain DNA, adjacent to enhancers, but not in /H9261-chain DNA. DNA Rearrangement Greatly Accelerates Transcription The promoters associated with the immunoglobulin V gene segments bind RNA polymerase II very weakly, and the vari-able-region enhancers in germ-line DNA are quite distantfrom the promoters (about 250-300 kb), too remote to signif-icantly influence transcription. For this reason, the rate oftranscription of V Hand V Lcoding regions is negligible in un- rearranged germ-line DNA. Variable-region gene rearrange-ment brings a promoter and enhancer within 2 kb of eachother, close enough for the enhancer to influence transcriptionfrom the nearby promoter. As a result, the rate of transcriptionof a rearranged V LJLor V HDHJHunit is as much as 104times the rate of transcription of unrearranged V Lor V Hsegments. This effect was demonstrated directly in a study in which Bcells transfected with rearranged heavy-chain genes from which the enhancer had been deleted did not transcribe thegenes, whereas B cells transfected with similar genes that con-tained the enhancer transcribed the transfected genes at a highrate. These findings highlight the importance of enhancers inthe normal transcription of immunoglobulin genes. Genes that regulate cellular proliferation or prohibit cell death sometimes translocate to the immunoglobulin heavy-or light-chain loci. Here, under the influence of an im-munoglobulin enhancer, the expression of these genes is sig-nificantly elevated, resulting in high levels of growthpromoting or cell death inhibiting proteins. Translocationsof the c- myc and bcl-2 oncogenes have each been associated with malignant B-cell lymphomas. The translocation of c-myc leads to The translocation of bcl-2 leads to suspension of programmed cell death in B cells, resulting in follicular B-celllymphoma. These cancer-promoting translocations are cov-ered in greater detail in Chapter 22. Ig-Gene Expression Is Inhibited in T Cells As noted earlier, germ-line DNA encoding the T-cell receptor(TCR) undergoes V-(D)-J rearrangement to generate func-tional TCR genes. Rearrangement of both immunoglobulinand TCR germ-line DNA occurs by similar recombinationprocesses mediated by RAG-1 and RAG-2 and involving re-combination signal sequences with one-turn or two-turnspacers (see Figure 5-7). Despite the similarity of theprocesses, complete Ig-gene rearrangement of H and Lchains occurs only in B cells and complete TCR-gene rearrangement is limited to T cells.Organization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 127 FIGURE 5-19Location of promoters (dark red), enhancers (green), and silencers (yellow) in mouse heavy-chain, /H9260light-chain, and germ-line DNA. Variable-region DNA rearrange- ment moves an enhancer close enough to a promoter that the en-hancer can activate transcription from the promoter. The promot ers that precede the DH cluster, a number of the C genes and the J /H9261clus- ter are omitted from this diagram for the sake of clarity.3 5VH P 5e:Hitoshi Sakano and coworkers have obtained results sug- gesting that a sequence within the /H9260-chain 3 /H11032enhancer (3 /H11032/H9260E) serves to regulate the joining of V /H9260to J /H9260in B and T cells. When a sequence known as the PU.1 binding site within the3/H11032/H9260-chain enhancer was mutated, these researchers found that V /H9260-J/H9260joining occurred in T cells as well as B cells. They propose that binding of a protein expressed by T cells, butnot B cells, to the unmutated /H9260-chain enhancer normally prevents V /H9260-J/H9260joining in T cells. The identity of this DNA- binding protein in T cells remains to be determined. Similarprocesses may prevent rearrangement of heavy-chain and /H9261- chain DNA in T cells. Antibody Genes and Antibody Engineering There are many clinical applications in which the exquisite specificity of a mouse monoclonal antibody would be useful.However, when mouse monoclonal antibodies are intro-duced into humans they are recognized as foreign and evokean antibody response that quickly clears the mouse mono-clonal antibody from the bloodstream. In addition, circulat-ing complexes of mouse and human antibodies can causeallergic reactions. In some cases, the buildup of these com-plexes in organs such as the kidney can cause serious andeven life-threatening reactions. Clearly, one way to avoidthese undesirable reactions is to use human monoclonal an-tibodies for clinical applications. However, the preparation ofhuman monoclonal antibodies has been hampered by nu-merous technical problems. In response to the difficulty ofproducing human monoclonal antibodies and the complica-tions resulting from the use of mouse monoclonal antibodiesin humans, there is now a major effort to engineer mono-clonal antibodies and antibody binding sites with recombi-nant DNA technology. The growing knowledge of antibody gene structure and regulation has made possible what Cesar Milstein, one of theinventors of monoclonal antibody technology, has called\"man-made antibodies.\" It is now possible to design and con-struct genes that encode immunoglobulin molecules inwhich the variable regions come from one species and theconstant regions come from another. New genes have beencreated that link nucleotide sequences coding nonantibodyproteins with sequences that encode antibody variable re-gions specific for particular antigens. These molecular hy-brids or chimeras may be able to deliver powerful toxins to particular antigenic targets, such as tumor cells. Finally, byreplacement of the immunoglobulin loci of one species withthat of another, animals of one species have been endowedwith the capacity to respond to immunization by producingantibodies encoded by the donor's genetically transplanted Iggenes. By capturing a significant sample of all of the im-munoglobulin heavy- and light-chain variable-region genesvia incorporation into libraries of bacteriophage, it has beenpossible to achieve significant and useful reconstructions of the entire antibody repertoires of individuals. The next fewsections describe each of these types of antibody genetic en-gineering. Chimeric and Hybrid Monoclonal Antibodies Have Potent Clinical Potential One approach to engineering an antibody is to clone recom- binant DNA containing the promoter, leader, and variable-region sequences from a mouse antibody gene and theconstant-region exons from a human antibody gene (Figure5-20). The antibody encoded by such a recombinant gene is amouse-human chimera, commonly known as a humanized antibody. Its antigenic specificity, which is determined by the variable region, is derived from the mouse DNA; its isotype,which is determined by the constant region, is derived fromthe human DNA. Because the constant regions of thesechimeric antibodies are encoded by human genes, the anti-128 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses LIGHT-CHAIN GENES HEAVY-CHAIN These vectors are transfected into A b /H11002 myeloma cells. Culture in ampicillin medium selects for transfe cted myeloma cells that secrete the chimeric antibody. Verhoeyen and L. Immunology 5e:bodies have fewer mouse antigenic determinants and are far less immunogenic when administered to humans thanmouse monoclonal antibodies (Figure 5-21a). The ability ofthe mouse variable regions remaining in these humanizedantibodies to provide the appropriate binding site to allowspecific recognition of the target antigen has encouraged fur-ther exploration of this approach. It is possible to producechimeric human-mouse antibodies in which only the se-quences of the CDRs are of mouse origin (Figure 5-21b). An-other advantage of humanized chimeric antibodies is thatthey retain the biological effector functions of human anti-body and are more likely to trigger human complement acti-vation or Fc receptor binding. One such chimeric human-mouse antibody has been used to treat patients with B-cellvarieties of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (see Clinical Focus).Chimeric monoclonal antibodies that function as im- munotoxins (see Figure 4-23) can also be prepared. In thiscase, the terminal constant-region domain in a tumor-specific monoclonal antibody is replaced with toxin chains(Figure 5-21c). Because these immunotoxins lack the terminal Fc domain, they are not able to bind to cells bearingFc receptors. These immunotoxins can bind only to tumorcells, making them highly specific as therapeutic reagents. Heteroconjugates, or bispecific antibodies, are hybrids of two different antibody molecules (Figure 5-21d). Theycan be constructed by chemically crosslinking two differentantibodies or by synthesizing them in hybridomas consist-ing of two different monoclonal-antibody-producing celllines that have been fused. Both of these methods generatemixtures of monospecific and bispecific antibodies fromwhich the desired bispecific molecule must be purified. Us-ing genetic engineering to construct genes that will encodemolecules only with the two desired specificities is a muchsimpler and more elegant approach. Several bispecific mole-cules have been designed in which one half of the antibodyhas specificity for a tumor and the other half has specificityfor a surface molecule on an immune effector cell, such as anNK cell, an activated macrophage, or a cytotoxic T lympho-cyte (CTL). Such heteroconjugates have been designed toactivate the immune effector cell when it is crosslinked tothe tumor cell so that it begins to mediate destruction of thetumor cell. Monoclonal Antibodies Can Be Constructed from Ig-Gene Libraries A quite different approach for generating monoclonal anti- bodies employs the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to am-plify the DNA that encodes antibody heavy-chain andlight-chain Fab fragments from hybridoma cells or plasmacells. A promoter region and EcoRI restriction site (see Chap- ter 23) are added to the amplified sequences, and the result-ing constructs are inserted into bacteriophage /H9261, yielding separate heavy- and light-chain libraries. Cleavage withEcoRI and random joining of the heavy- and light-chain genes yield numerous novel heavy-light constructs (Figure 5-22). This procedure generates an enormous diversity of anti- body specificities\u2014libraries with /H1102210 10unique members have been obtained\u2014and clones containing these randomcombinations of H /H11001L chains can be rapidly screened for those secreting antibody to a particular antigen. The level ofdiversity is comparable to the human in vivo repertoire, andit is possible to demonstrate that specificities against a widevariety of antigens can be obtained from these libraries. Sucha combinatorial library approach opens the possibility of ob-taining specific antibodies without any need whatsoever forimmunization. However, the real challenge to bypassing in vivo immu- nization in the derivation of useful antibodies of high affin-ity lies in finding ways to mimic the biology of the humoralOrganization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 129 and hybrid monoclonal antibodies recombinant DNA technology.

If particu-lar types of cancer cells had antigens thatwere tumor specific, these antigenswould be ideal targets for immune attack.Unfortunately, there are few such mole-cules known. However, a number of anti-gens are known that are restricted to thecell lineage in which the tumor originatedand are expressed on the tumor cells. Many cell-lineage-specific antigens have been identified for B lymphocytesand B lymphomas, including immuno-globulin, the hallmark of the B cell, andCD20, a membrane-bound phosphopro- tein. CD 20has emerged as an attractive candidate for antibody-mediated im-munotherapy because it is present on Blymphomas, and antibody-mediatedcrosslinking does not cause it to down-regulate or internalize. Indeed, someyears ago, mouse monoclonal antibodieswere raised against CD 20, and one of these has formed the basis for an anti-B-cell lymphoma immunotherapy. This ap-proach appears ready to take its place asan adjunct or alternative to radiation andchemotherapy. The development of thisanti-tumor antibody is an excellent casestudy of the combined application of im-munological insights and molecular biol-ogy to engineer a novel therapeutic agent. The original anti-CD 20antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody with murine/H9253heavy chains and /H9260light chains. The DNA sequences of the light- and heavy-chain variable regions of this antibodywere amplified by PCR. Then a chimericgene was created by replacing the CDRgene sequences of a human /H92531heavy chain with those from the murine heavychain. In a similar maneuver, CDRs fromthe mouse /H9260were ligated into a human /H9260gene. The chimeric genes thus created were incorporated into vectors that per-mitted high levels of expression in mam-malian cells. When an appropriate cellline was co-transfected with both of theseconstructs, it produced chimeric antibod-ies containing CDRs of mouse origin to-gether with human variable-regionframeworks and constant regions. Afterpurification, the biological activity of theantibody was evaluated, first in vitro andthen in a primate animal model. The initial results were quite promis- ing. The grafted human constant regionsupported effector functions such as thecomplement-mediated lysis of human B lymphoid cells. Fur-thermore, weekly injections of the anti-body into monkeys resulted in the rapidand sustained depletion of B cells from pe-ripheral blood, lymph nodes, and evenbone marrow. When the anti-CD 20anti- body infusions were stopped, the differen-tiation of new B cells from progenitorpopulations allowed B-cell populationseventually to recover and approach nor-mal levels. From these results, the hopegrew that this immunologically activechimeric antibody could be used to clearentire B cell populations, including B lym-phoma cells, from the body in a way thatspared other cell populations. This led tothe trial of the antibody in human patients. The human trials enrolled patients with B-cell lymphoma who had a relapseafter chemotherapy or radiation treat-ment. These trials addressed three im-portant issues: efficacy, safety, andimmunogenicity. While not all patients re-sponded to treatment with anti-CD 20, close to 50% exhibited full or partial re- mission. Thus, efficacy was demon-strated, because this level of response iscomparable to the success rate with tradi-tional approaches that employ highly cyto-toxic drugs or radiation\u2014it offers a trulyalternative therapy. Side effects such asnausea, low blood pressure, and short-ness of breath were seen in some pa-tients (usually during or shortly after theinitiation of therapy); these were, for themost part, not serious or life-threatening.Consequently, treatment with the Lymphomas are cancers of lymphatic tissue in which thetumor cells are of lymphocytic origin.There are two major forms of lymphoma:Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin'slymphoma. The less common form isHodgkin's lymphoma, named for its dis-coverer, Thomas Hodgkin, an Englishphysician. This unusually gifted earlypathologist, who worked without the ben-efit of a microscope, recognized this con-dition in several patients and firstdescribed the anatomical features of thedisease in 1832 . Because many tissue specimens taken from patients Hodgkinsuspected of harboring the disease weresaved in the Gordon Museum of Guy'sHospital in London, it has been possiblefor later generations to judge the accu-racy of his diagnoses. Hodgkin has faredwell. Studies of these preserved tissuesconfirm that he was right in about 60% of the cases, a surprising achievement, con-sidering the technology of the time. Actu-ally, most lymphoma is non-Hodgkin'stype and includes about 10different types of disease. B-cell lymphomas are an im-portant fraction of these. For some years now, the major thera- pies directed against lymphomas havebeen radiation, chemotherapy, or a com-bination of both. While these therapiesbenefit large numbers of patients by in-creasing survival, relapses after treat-ment are common, and many treatedpatients experience debilitating side ef-fects. The side effects are an expectedconsequence of these therapies, becausethe agents used kill or severely damage abroad spectrum of normal cells as well astumor cells. One of the holy grails of can-cer treatment is the discovery of therapiesCLINICAL FOCUS Therapy for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Other / Immunology 5e:Organization and Expression of Immunoglobulin Genes CHAPTER 5 131 cancers that over-express a growth factor receptor called HER 2(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Many tumors that over-express HER 2grow faster and pose a more serious threat than those withnormal levels of this protein on their sur-face. A chimeric anti-HER 2monoclonal antibody in which all of the protein exceptthe CDRs are of human origin was createdby genetic engineering. Specifically, theDNA sequences for the heavy-chain andlight-chain CDRs were taken from clonedmouse genes encoding an anti-HER 2 monoclonal antibody. As in the anti-CD 20 strategy described above, each of themouse CDR gene segments were used toreplace the corresponding human CDRgene segments in human genes encodingthe human IgG 1heavy chain and the hu- man /H9260light chain. When this engineered antibody is used in combination with achemotherapeutic drug, it is highly effec-tive against metastatic breast cancer. Theeffects on patients who were given only a chemotherapeutic drug were comparedwith those for patients receiving both thechemotherapeutic anti-HER 2antibody. The combina- 2/chemotherapy treatment showed reduced rates of tu-mor progression, a higher percentage ofresponding patients, and a higher one-yearsurvival rate. Treatment with Herceptin, asthis engineered monoclonal antibody iscalled, has become part of the standardrepertoire of breast cancer therapies. The development of engineered and conventional monoclonal antibodies isone of the most active areas in the phar-maceutical industry. The table provides apartial compilation of monoclonal anti-bodies that have received approval fromthe Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for use in the treatment of humandisease. Many more are in variousstages of development and testing.chimeric anti-CD 20appears safe. Patients who received the antibody have been ob-served closely for the appearance of hu-man anti-mouse-Ig antibodies (HAMA)and for human anti-chimeric antibody(HACA) responses. Such responses werenot observed. Therefore, the antibody wasnot immunogenic. The absence of suchresponses demonstrate that antibodiescan be genetically engineered to mini-mize, or even avoid, untoward immunereactions. Another reason for humanizingmouse antibodies arises from the veryshort half life (a few hours) of mouse IgGantibodies in humans compared with thethree-week half lives of their human or hu-manized counterparts. Antibody engineering has also con- tributed to the therapy of other malignan-cies such as breast cancer, which isdiagnosed in more than 180,000Ameri- can women each year.

As we shall see in Chapter 11, the in vivo evolution of most humoral immune responses produces twodesirable outcomes. One is class switching, in which a varietyof antibody classes of the same specificity are produced. Thisis an important consideration because the class switchingthat occurs during an immune response produces antibodiesthat have the same specificity but different effector functionsand hence, greater biological versatility. The other is the gen-eration of antibodies of higher and higher affinity as the re-sponse progresses. A central goal of Ig-gene library ap-proaches is the development of strategies to produce anti-bodies of appropriate affinity in vitro as readily as they aregenerated by an in vivo immune response. When the formi-dable technical obstacles to the achievement of these goalsare overcome, combinatorial approaches based on phage libraries will allow the routine and widespread production of useful antibodies from any desired species without thelimitations of immunization and hybridoma technology that currently complicate the production of monoclonal antibodies. Mice Have Been Engineered with Human Immunoglobulin Loci It is possible to functionally knock out, or disable, the heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin loci in mouse embryonicstem (ES) cells. N. Lonberg and his colleagues followed thisprocedure and then introduced large DNA sequences (asmuch as 80 kb) containing human heavy- and light-chaingene segments. The DNA sequences contained constant-re-gion gene segments, J segments, many V-region segments,and, in the case of the heavy chain, D Hsegments. The ES cells containing these miniature human Ig gene loci (miniloci) areused to derive lines of transgenic mice that respond to anti-genic challenge by producing antigen-specific human anti- bodies (Figure 5-23). Because the human heavy- andlight-chain miniloci undergo rearrangement and all theother N-addition, P-addition, and even somatic hypermutation after antigenicchallenge, there is an opportunity for the generation of agreat deal of diversity in these mice. The presence of humanheavy-chain minilocus genes for more than one isotype andtheir accompanying switch sites allows class switching aswell. A strength of this method is that these completely hu-man antibodies are made in cells of the mouse B-cell lineage,from which antibody-secreting hybridomas are readily de-rived by cell fusion. This approach thus offers a solution tothe problem of producing human monoclonal antibodies ofany specificity desired. SUMMARY IImmunoglobulin /H9260and /H9261light chains and heavy chains are encoded by three separate multigene families, each con-taining numerous gene segments and located on differentchromosomes. IFunctional light-chain and heavy-chain genes are gener-ated by of the variable-region genesegments in germ-line IV(D)J recombinase activiatinggenes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, and the participation of other enzymes and proteins. The joining of segments is directedby recombination signal sequences (RSS), conserved DNAsequences that flank each V , D, and J gene segment. IEach recombination signal sequence contains a conservedheptamer sequence, a gene segments flanked by a one-turn spacer join only to segments flanked by a two-turnspacer, assuring proper V L-JLand V H-DH-JHjoining.132 PART II Generation B-Cell VL-CLPlasma cell #1 PCRIsolate VH-CH1 VH-CH1 FIGURE 5-22General procedure for producing gene libraries en- coding Fab fragments.

The capacity of mice to rearrange Ig heavy- and ligh t- chain gene segments was disabled by knocking out the C /H9262and C /H9260 loci. The antibody-producing capacity of these mice was reconst i- tuted by introducing long stretches of DNA incorporating a larg e part of the human germ-line /H9260and heavy-chain loci (miniloci).Chimeric mice were then bred to establish a line of transgenic mice bearing both heavy- and light-chain human miniloci.Immunization of these mice results in the production of humanantibody specific for the target antigen.

Low-affinity antibodies bind antigen weakly and tend to dis-sociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies bind antigenmore tightly and remain bound longer. The association be-tween a binding site on an antibody (Ab) with a monovalentantigen (Ag) can be described by the equation k1Ag/H11001Ab 34 k/H110021 Principles and Applications T - - lecular association similar to an enzyme-substrateinteraction, with an important distinction: it does not lead to an irreversible chemical alteration in either theantibody or the antigen. The association between an anti-body and an antigen involves various noncovalent interac-tions between the antigenic determinant, or epitope, of theantigen the variable-region (V H/VL) domain of the an- tibody molecule, particularly the hypervariable regions, orcomplementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The exquis-ite specificity of antigen-antibody interactions has led to thedevelopment of a variety of immunologic assays, which canbe used to detect the presence of either antibody or antigen.Immunoassays have played vital roles in diagnosing diseases,monitoring the level of the humoral immune response, andidentifying molecules of biological or medical interest.These assays differ in their speed and sensitivity; some arestrictly qualitative, others are quantitative. This chapter ex-amines the nature of the antigen-antibody interaction, and itdescribes various immunologic assays that measure or ex-ploit this interaction. Strength of Antigen-Antibody Interactions The noncovalent interactions that form the basis of antigen- antibody (Ag-Ab) binding include hydrogen bonds, ionicbonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interac-tions (Figure 6-1). Because these interactions are individu-ally weak (compared with a covalent bond), a large numberof such interactions are required to form a strong Ag-Ab in-teraction. Furthermore, each of these noncovalent interac-tions operates over a very short distance, generally about1/H1100310 /H110027mm (1 angstrom, \u00c5); consequently, a strong Ag- Ab interaction depends on a very close fit between the anti-gen and antibody. Such fits require a high degree ofcomplementarity between antigen and antibody, a require-ment that underlies the exquisite specificity al. / Immunology 5e:where k1is the forward (association) rate constant and k/H110021is the reverse (dissociation) rate constant. The ratio k1/k/H110021is the association constant Ka(i.e., k1/k/H110021/H11005Ka), a measure of affinity. Because Kais the equilibrium constant for the above reaction, it can be calculated from the ratio of the molar con-centration of bound Ag-Ab complex to the molar concentra-tions of unbound antigen and antibody at equilibrium asfollows: K a/H11005 The value of Kavaries for different Ag-Ab complexes and depends upon both k1, which is expressed in units of liters/mole/second (L/mol/s), and k/H110021, which is expressed in units of 1/second. For small haptens, the forward rate con-stant can be extremely high; in some cases, k 1can be as high as 4/H11003108L/mol/s, approaching the theoretical upper limit of diffusion-limited reactions (109L/mol/s). For larger pro- tein antigens, however, k1is smaller, with values in the range of 105L/mol/s. The rate at which bound antigen leaves an antibody's binding site (i.e., the dissociation rate constant, k/H110021) plays a major role in determining the antibody's affinity for anantigen. Table 6-1 illustrates the role of k /H110021in determining[Ag-Ab]/H5007[Ab][Ag]the association constant Kafor several Ag-Ab interactions. For example, the k1for the DNP- L-lysine system is about one fifth that for the fluorescein system, but its k/H110021is 200 times greater; consequently, the affinity of the antifluores-cein antibody K afor the fluorescein system is about 1000- fold higher than that of anti-DNP antibody. Low-affinityAg-Ab complexes have K avalues between 104and 105 L/mol; high-affinity complexes can have Kavalues as high as 1011L/mol. For some purposes, the dissociation of the antigen-anti- body complex is of interest: Ag-Ab 334 Ab/H11001Ag The equilibrium constant for that reaction is Kd, the recipro- cal of Ka Kd/H11005[Ab][Ag] /H11408[Ab-Ag] /H110051/H11408Ka and is a quantitative indicator of the stability of an Ag-Ab complex; very stable complexes have very low values of Kd, and less stable ones have higher values. The affinity constant, Ka, can be determined by equilib- rium dialysis or by various newer methods. Because equilib- rium dialysis remains for many the standard against which138 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 6-1The interaction between an antibody and an anti- gen depends on four types of noncovalent forces: ( 1) hydrogen bonds, in which a hydrogen atom is shared between two elec-tronegative atoms; ( 2) ionic bonds between oppositely charged hydrophobic interactions, in which water forces hy-drophobic groups together; and ( 4) van der Waals interactions between the outer electron clouds of two or more atoms.

This proce- dure uses a dialysis chamber containing two equal compart-ments separated by a semipermeable membrane. Antibody isplaced in one compartment, and a radioactively labeled lig-and that is small enough to pass through the semipermeablemembrane is placed in the other compartment (Figure 6-2).Suitable ligands include haptens, oligosaccharides, and oligo-peptides. In the absence of antibody, ligand added to com-partment B will equilibrate on both sides of the membrane(Figure 6-2a). In the presence of antibody, however, part of the labeled ligand will be bound to the antibody at equi- librium, trapping the ligand on the antibody side of the ves-sel, whereas unbound ligand will be equally distributed inboth compartments. Thus the total concentration of ligandwill be greater in the compartment containing antibody (Fig-ure 6-2b). The difference in the ligand concentration in thetwo compartments represents the concentration of ligandbound to the antibody (i.e., the concentration of Ag-Ab com-plex). The higher the affinity of the antibody, the more ligandis bound.Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 139 TABLE 6-1Forward and reverse rate constants ( k1and k/H115461) and association and dissociation 1990 , Immunology, 3rd ed., Harper & Row Publishers.

This is conveniently done by determining theslope of the curve at the point where half of the antigen bind-ing sites are filled. Antibody Avidity Incorporates Affinity of Multiple Binding Sites The affinity at one binding site does not always reflect the true strength of the antibody-antigen interaction. Whencomplex antigens containing multiple, repeating antigenicdeterminants are mixed with antibodies containing multiplebinding sites, the interaction of an antibody molecule withan antigen molecule at one site will increase the probabilityof reaction between those two molecules at a second site. Thestrength of such multiple interactions between a multivalentantibody and antigen is called the avidity. The avidity of an antibody is a better measure of its binding capacity within bi-ological systems (e.g., the reaction of an antibody with anti-genic determinants on a virus or bacterial cell) than theaffinity of its individual binding sites. High avidity can com-pensate for low affinity. For example, secreted pentameric140 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 6-3Scatchard plots are based on repeated equilibrium dialyses with a constant concentration of antibody and varying con- centration of ligand. In these plots, requals moles of bound lig- and/mole antibody and cis the concentration of free ligand. From a Scatchard plot, both the equilibrium constant ( Ka) and the number of binding sites per antibody molecule ( n), or its valency, can be ob- tained. (a) If all antibodies have the same affinity, then a Sc atchard plot yields a straight line with a slope of /H11002Ka. The xintercept is n, the valency of the antibody, which is 2for IgG and other divalent Igs. For IgM, which is pentameric, n/H1100510, and for dimeric IgA, n/H110054. In thisgraph, antibody # 1has a higher affinity than antibody # 2.

Cross-Reactivity Although Ag-Ab reactions are highly specific, in some casesantibody elicited by one antigen can cross-react with an un-related antigen. Such cross-reactivity occurs if two different antigens share an identical or very similar epitope. In the lat-ter case, the antibody's affinity for the cross-reacting epitopeis usually less than that for the original epitope. Cross-reactivity is often observed among polysaccharide antigens that contain oligosaccharide residues. TheABO blood-group antigens, for example, are glycoproteins expressed on red blood cells. Subtle differences in the termi-nal residues of the sugars attached to these surface proteinsdistinguish the A and B blood-group antigens. An individuallacking one or both of these antigens will have serum anti-bodies to the missing antigen(s). The antibodies are inducednot by exposure to red blood cell antigens but by exposure tocross-reacting microbial antigens present on common in-testinal bacteria. These microbial antigens induce the for-mation of antibodies in individuals lacking the similarblood-group antigens on their red blood cells. (In individu-als possessing these antigens, complementary antibodieswould be eliminated during the developmental stage inwhich antibodies that recognize self epitopes are weededout.) The blood-group antibodies, although elicited by mi-crobial antigens, will cross-react with similar oligosaccha-rides on foreign red blood cells, providing the basis forblood typing tests and accounting for the necessity of com-patible blood types during blood transfusions. A type A in-dividual has anti-B antibodies; a type B individual hasanti-A; and a type O individual thus has anti-A and anti-B(Table 6-2). A number of viruses and bacteria have antigenic determi- nants identical or similar to normal host-cell components. Insome cases, these microbial antigens have been shown toelicit antibody that cross-reacts with the host-cell compo-nents, resulting in a tissue-damaging autoimmune reaction.The bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, for example, expresses cell-wall proteins called M antigens. Antibodies produced tostreptococcal M antigens have been shown to cross-reactwith several myocardial and skeletal muscle proteins andhave been implicated in heart and kidney damage followingstreptococcal infections. The role of other cross-reactingantigens in the development of autoimmune diseases is dis-cussed in Chapter 20. Some vaccines also exhibit cross-reactivity. For instance, vaccinia virus, which causes cowpox, expresses variola virus, the causative agent of the basis of Jenner's method of us-ing vaccinia virus to induce immunity to smallpox, as men-tioned in Chapter 1. Precipitation Reactions Antibody and soluble antigen interacting in aqueous solu-tion form a lattice that eventually develops into a visible pre - cipitate. Antibodies that aggregate soluble antigens are calledprecipitins. Although formation of the soluble Ag-Ab com- plex occurs within minutes, formation of the visible precipi-tate occurs more slowly and often takes a day or two to reachcompletion. Formation of an Ag-Ab lattice depends on the valency of both the antibody and antigen: IThe antibody must be bivalent; a precipitate will notform with monovalent Fab fragments. IThe antigen must be either bivalent or polyvalent; that is,it must have at least two copies of the same epitope, orhave different epitopes that react with differentantibodies present in polyclonal antisera. Experiments with myoglobin illustrate the requirement that protein antigens be bivalent or polyvalent for a precip-itin Myoglobin well with spe-cific polyclonal but fails to precipitate with a speci fic monoclonal antibody because it contains multiple, distinctepitopes but only a single copy of each epitope (Figure 6-4a).Myoglobin thus can form a crosslinked lattice structure withpolyclonal antisera but not with monoclonal antisera. Theprinciples that underlie precipitation reactions are presentedbecause they are essential for an understanding of commonlyused immunological assays. Although various modificationsof the precipitation reaction were at one time the major typesof assay used in immunology, they have been largely replacedby methods that are faster and, because they are far more sen-sitive, require only very small quantities of antigen or anti-body. Also, these modern assay methods are not limited toantigen-antibody reactions that produce a precipitate. Table6-3 presents a comparison of the sensitivity, or minimum amount of antibody detectable, by a number of immunoas-says.Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 141 TABLE 6-2ABO blood types Blood type Antigens on RBCs Serum antibodies A A Anti-B B B B NeitherO Neither Anti-A AM W:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:Precipitation Reactions in Fluids Yield a Precipitin Curve A quantitative precipitation reaction can be performed by placing a constant amount of antibody in a series of tubesand adding increasing amounts of antigen to the tubes. Atone time this method was used to measure the amount ofantigen or antibody present in a sample of interest. After theprecipitate forms, each tube is centrifuged to pellet the pre-cipitate, the supernatant is poured off, and the amount ofprecipitate is measured. Plotting the amount of precipitateagainst increasing antigen concentrations yields a precipitincurve. As Figure 6-4b shows, excess of either antibody orantigen interferes with maximal precipitation, which occursin the so-called equivalence zone, within which the ratio of antibody to antigen is optimal. As a large multimolecular lattice is formed at equivalence, the complex increases in sizeand precipitates out of solution. As shown in Figure 6-4, un-der conditions of antibody excess or antigen excess, extensive lattices do not form and precipitation is inhibited. Althoughthe quantitative precipitation reaction is seldom used exper-imentally today, the principles of antigen excess, antibody ex- cess, and equivalence apply to many Ag-Ab reactions. Precipitation Reactions in Gels Yield Visible Precipitin Lines Immune precipitates can form not only in solution but also in an agar matrix. When antigen and antibody diffuse toward oneanother in agar, or when antibody is incorporated into the agarand antigen diffuses into the antibody-containing matrix, avisible line of precipitation will form. As in a precipitation re - action in fluid, visible precipitation occurs in the region ofequivalence, whereas no visible precipitate forms in regions ofantibody or antigen excess. Two types of immunodiffusion re- actions can be used to determine relative concentrations of an- tibodies or antigens, to compare antigens, or to determine therelative purity of an antigen preparation. They are radial im- munodiffusion (the Mancini method) and double immun- odiffusion (the Ouchterlony method); both are carried out in a semisolid medium such as agar. In radial immunodiffusion,an antigen sample is placed in a well and allowed to diffuse in to142 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 6-4Precipitation reactions. (a) Polyclonal antibodies can form lattices, or large aggregates, that precipitate out of sol ution. However, if each antigen molecule contains only a single epitop e rec- ognized by a given monoclonal antibody, the antibody can link o nly two molecules of antigen and no precipitate is formed. (b) A pr ecip- itation curve for a system of one antigen and its antibodies. T his plot of the amount of antibody precipitated versus increasing antige n concentrations (at constant total antibody) reveals three zones : azone of antibody excess, in which precipitation is inhibited an d anti- body not bound to antigen can be detected in the supernatant; a n equivalence zone of maximal precipitation in which antibody andantigen form large insoluble complexes and neither antibody norantigen can be detected in the supernatant; and a zone of antig en ex- cess in which precipitation is inhibited and antigen not bound to antibody can be detected in AM al. / Immunology 5e:agar containing a suitable dilution of an antiserum. As the antigen diffuses into the agar, the region of equivalence is es-tablished and a ring of precipitation, a precipitin ring, formsaround the well (Figure 6-5, upper panel). The area of the pre-cipitin ring is proportional to the concentration of antigen. Bycomparing the area of the precipitin ring with a standard curve(obtained by measuring the precipitin areas of known concen-trations of the antigen), the concentration of the antigen sam-ple can be determined. In the Ouchterlony method, bothantigen and antibody diffuse radially from wells toward eachother, thereby establishing a concentration gradient. As equiv-alence is reached, a visible line of precipitation, a precipitinline, forms (Figure 6-5, lower panel). Immunoelectrophoresis Combines Electrophoresis and Double Immunodiffusion In immunoelectrophoresis, the antigen mixture is first elec- trophoresed to separate its components by charge. Troughsare then cut into the agar gel parallel to the direction ofthe electric field, and antiserum is added to the troughs. Antibody and antigen then diffuse toward each other andproduce lines of precipitation where they meet in appropri-ate proportions (Figure 6-6a). Immunoelectrophoresis isused in clinical laboratories to detect the presence or absenceof proteins in the serum. A sample of serum is elec-trophoresed, and the individual serum components are identified with antisera specific for a given protein or im-munoglobulin class (Figure 6-6b). This technique is useful indetermining whether a patient produces abnormally lowamounts of one or more isotypes, characteristic of certainimmunodeficiency diseases. It can also show whether a pa-tient overproduces some serum protein, such as albumin,immunoglobulin, or transferrin. The immunoelectropho-retic pattern of serum from patients with multiple myeloma,for example, shows a heavy distorted arc caused by the largeamount of myeloma protein, which is monoclonal Ig andtherefore uniformly charged (Figure 6-6b). Because immu-noelectrophoresis is a strictly qualitative technique that only detects relatively high antibody concentrations (greater thanseveral hundred /H9262g/ml), it utility is limited to the detectionAntigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 143 TABLE 6-3Sensitivity of various immunoassays Sensitivity Assay ( /H9262g antibody/ml) Precipitation reaction in Flow cytometry 0.06-0.006 The sensitivity depends upon the affinity of the antibody as we ll as the epi- tope density and distribution.

A related quantitative technique, rocket electrophore- sis,does permit measurement of antigen levels. In rocket electrophoresis ,a negatively charged antigen is elec- trophoresed in a gel containing antibody. The precipitateformed between antigen and antibody has the shape of arocket, the height of which is proportional to the concen-tration of antigen in the well. One limitation of rocketelectrophoresis is the need for the antigen to be negativelycharged for electrophoretic movement within the agar matrix. Some proteins, immunoglobulins for example,are not sufficiently charged to be quantitatively analyzed by rocket electrophoresis; nor is it possible to measure the amounts of several antigens in a mixture at the sametime. Agglutination Reactions The interaction between antibody and a particulate antigen re-sults in visible clumping called agglutination. Antibodies that produce such reactions are called agglutinins. Agglutination reactions are similar in principle to precipitation reactions;they depend on the crosslinking of polyvalent antigens. Just as144 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses Antigens(a) Antibody FIGURE 6-6Immunoelectrophoresis of an antigen mixture.

Because prozone effects can be en- countered in many types of immunoassays, understanding thebasis of this phenomenon is of general importance. Several mechanisms can cause the prozone effect. First, at high antibody concentrations, the number of antibody bind-ing sites may greatly exceed the number of epitopes. As a re-sult, most antibodies bind antigen only univalently instead of multivalently. Antibodies that bind univalently cannotcrosslink one antigen to another. Prozone effects are readilydiagnosed by performing the assay at a variety of antibody(or antigen) concentrations. As one dilutes to an optimumantibody concentration, one sees higher levels of agglutina-tion or whatever parameter is measured in the assay beingused. When one is using polyclonal antibodies, the prozoneeffect can also occur for another reason. The antiserum maycontain high concentrations of antibodies that bind to theantigen but do not induce agglutination; these antibodies,called incomplete antibodies, are often of the IgG class. At high concentrations of IgG, incomplete antibodies may oc-cupy most of the antigenic sites, thus blocking access by IgM,which is a good agglutinin. This effect is not seen with agglu-tinating monoclonal antibodies. The lack of agglutinatingactivity of an incomplete antibody may be due to restrictedflexibility in the hinge region, making it difficult for the ant i- body to assume the required angle for optimal cross-linkingof epitopes on two or more particulate antigens. Alterna-tively, the density of epitope distribution or the location ofsome epitopes in deep pockets of a particulate antigen maymake it difficult for the antibodies specific for these epitope s to agglutinate certain particulate antigens. When feasible, thesolution to both of these problems is to try different antibod-ies that may react with other epitopes of the antigen that donot present these limitations. Hemagglutination Is Used in Blood Typing Agglutination reactions (Figure 6-7) are routinely performedto type red blood cells (RBCs). In typing for the ABO antigens, RBCs are mixed on a slide with antisera to the A or B blood-group antigens. If the antigen is present on thecells, they agglutinate, forming a visible clump on the slide.Determination of which antigens are present on donor andrecipient RBCs is the basis for matching blood types fortransfusions. Bacterial Agglutination Is Used To Diagnose Infection A bacterial infection often elicits the production of serum antibodies specific for surface antigens on the bacterial cells . The presence of such antibodies can be detected by bacterialagglutination reactions. Serum from a patient thought to beinfected with a given bacterium is serially diluted in an arrayof tubes to which the bacteria is added. The last tube showingvisible agglutination will reflect the serum antibody titer of the patient. The agglutinin titer is defined as the reciprocal o f the greatest serum dilution that elicits a positive agglutina-tion reaction. For example, if serial twofold dilutions ofserum are prepared and if the dilution of 1/640 shows agglu-tination but the dilution of 1/1280 not, then the agglu-tination titer of the patient's serum is 640. In some casesserum can be diluted up to 1/50,000 and still show agglutina-tion of bacteria. The agglutinin titer of an antiserum can be used to diag- nose a bacterial infection. Patients with typhoid fever, for ex-ample, show a significant rise in the agglutination titer toSalmonella typhi. Agglutination reactions also provide a way to type bacteria. For instance, different species of the bac-terium Salmonella can be distinguished by agglutination re- actions with a panel of typing antisera. Passive Agglutination Is Useful with Soluble Antigens The sensitivity and simplicity of agglutination reactions can be extended to soluble antigens by the technique of passivehemagglutination. In this technique, antigen-coated redblood cells are prepared by mixing a soluble antigen with redblood cells that have been treated with tannic acid orchromium chloride, both of which promote adsorption ofthe antigen to the surface of the cells. Serum containing anti-body is serially diluted into microtiter plate wells, and theantigen-coated red blood cells are then added to each well;agglutination is assessed by the size of the characteristicspread pattern of agglutinated red blood cells on the bottomof the well, like the pattern seen in agglutination reactions(see Figure 6-7). Over the past several years, there has been a shift away from red blood cells to synthetic particles, such as latexbeads, as matrices for agglutination reactions. Once the anti-gen has been coupled to the latex beads, the preparation caneither be used immediately or stored for later use. The use of synthetic beads offers the advantages of consistency,Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 145 FIGURE 6-7Demonstration of hemagglutination using antibodies against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). The control tube ( 10) con- tains only SRBCs, which settle into a solid \"button.\" The exper imen- tal tubes 1-9contain a serial two-fold dilutions of anti-SRBC serum.

Thompson.]8536d_ch06_137-160 8/1/02 9:01 AM Page 79:45_B Immunology Furthermore, agglutination reac- tions employing synthetic beads can be read rapidly, oftenwithin 3 to 5 minutes of mixing the beads with the test sam-ple. Whether based on red blood cells or the more convenientand versatile synthetic beads, agglutination reactions aresimple to perform, do not require expensive equipment, andcan detect small amounts of antibody (concentrations as lowas nanograms per milliliter). In Agglutination Inhibition, Absence of Agglutination Is Diagnostic of Antigen A modification of the agglutination reaction, called agglu- tination inhibition, provides a highly sensitive assay for small quantities of an antigen. For example, one of the earlytypes of home pregnancy test kits included latex particles coated with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) andantibody to HCG (Figure 6-8). The addition urine froma pregnant woman, which contained HCG, inhibited agglu-tination of the latex particles when the anti-HCG the absence of agglutination assays can also be used to deter- mine whether an individual is using certain types of illegaldrugs, such as cocaine or heroin. A urine or blood sample isfirst incubated with antibody specific for the suspected drug.Then red blood cells (or other particles) coated with the drugare added. If the red blood cells are not agglutinated by theantibody, it indicates the sample contained an antigen recog-nized by the antibody, suggesting that the individual was 146 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 6-8The original home pregnancy test kit employed hap- ten inhibition to determine the presence or absence of human ch ori- onic gonadotropin (HCG). The original test kits used the presen ce or absence of visible clumping to determine whether HCG was presen t. If a woman was not pregnant, her urine would not contain HCG; i n this case, the anti-HCG antibodies and HCG-carrier conjugate in thekit would react, producing visible clumping. If a woman was pre g- nant, the HCG in her urine would bind to the anti-HCG antibodie s, thus inhibiting the subsequent binding of the antibody to the H CG- carrier conjugate. Because of this inhibition, no visible clump ing oc- curred if a woman was pregnant. The kits currently on the marke t use ELISA-based assays (see Figure 6- 10).KIT antibody TEST PROCEDURE UrineIncubate HCG carrier conjugateObserve for visible clumping Visible clumping + reaction: pregnant No visible clumpingHCG in urine+POSSIBLE REACTIONS reaction: et al. / Immunology 5e:using the illicit drug. One problem with these tests is that some legal drugs have chemical structures similar to those ofillicit drugs, and these legal drugs may cross-react with theantibody, giving a false-positive reaction. For this reason apositive reaction must be confirmed by a nonimmunologicmethod. Agglutination inhibition assays are widely used in clinical laboratories to determine whether an individual has been exposed to certain types of viruses that cause agglutination ofred blood cells. If an individual's serum contains specific an-tiviral antibodies, then the antibodies will bind to the virusand interfere with hemagglutination by the virus. This tech-nique is commonly used in premarital testing to determinethe immune status of women with respect to rubella virus.The reciprocal of the last serum dilution to hemagglutination is serum. A titergreater than 10 (1:10 dilution) indicates that a woman is im-mune to rubella, whereas a titer of less than 10 is indicative ofa lack of immunity and the need for immunization with therubella vaccine. Radioimmunoassay One of the most sensitive techniques for detecting antigen orantibody is radioimmunoassay (RIA). The technique was first developed in 1960 by two endocrinologists, S. A. Bersonand Rosalyn Y alow, to determine levels of insulin-anti-in-sulin complexes in diabetics. Although their technique en-countered some skepticism, it soon proved its value formeasuring hormones, serum proteins, drugs, and vitamins atconcentrations of 0.001 micrograms per milliliter or less. In 1977, some years after Berson's death, the significance of thetechnique was acknowledged by the award of a Nobel Prize toY alow. The principle of RIA involves competitive binding of ra- diolabeled antigen and unlabeled antigen to a high-affinityantibody. The labeled antigen is mixed with antibody at aconcentration that saturates the antigen-binding sites of theantibody. Then test samples of unlabeled antigen of un-known concentration are added in progressively largeramounts. The antibody does not distinguish labeled fromunlabeled antigen, so the two kinds of antigen compete foravailable binding sites on the antibody. As the concentrationof unlabeled antigen increases, more labeled antigen will bedisplaced from the binding sites. The decrease in the amountof radiolabeled antigen bound to specific antibody in thepresence of the test sample is measured in order to determinethe amount of antigen present in the test sample. The antigen is generally labeled with a gamma-emitting isotope such as 125I, but beta-emitting isotopes such as tri- tium (3H) are also routinely used as labels. The radiola- beled antigen is part of the assay mixture; the test samplemay be a complex mixture, such as serum or other bodyfluids, that contains the unlabeled antigen. The first step inAntigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 147 setting up an RIA is to determine the amount of antibodyneeded to bind 50%-70% of a fixed quantity of radioactiveantigen (Ag ) in the assay mixture. This ratio of antibody to Agis chosen to ensure that the number of epitopes presented by the labeled antigen always exceeds the totalnumber of antibody binding sites. Consequently, unlabeledantigen added to the sample mixture will compete with ra-diolabeled antigen for the limited supply of antibody. Evena small amount of unlabeled antigen added to the assaymixture of labeled antigen and antibody will cause a de-crease in the amount of radioactive antigen bound, and thisdecrease will be proportional to the amount of unlabeledantigen added. T o determine the amount of labeled antigenbound, the Ag-Ab complex is precipitated to separate itfrom free antigen (antigen not bound to Ab), and the ra-dioactivity in the precipitate is measured. A standard curvecan be generated using unlabeled antigen samples ofknown concentration (in place of the test sample), andfrom this plot the amount of antigen in the test mixturemay be precisely determined. Several methods have been developed for separating the bound antigen from the free antigen in RIA. One method in-volves precipitating the Ag-Ab complex with a secondaryanti-isotype antiserum. For example, if the Ag-Ab complexcontains rabbit IgG antibody, then goat anti-rabbit IgG the rabbit IgG and precipitate the complex. Anothermethod makes use of the fact that protein A of Staphylococcus aureus has high affinity for IgG. If the Ag-Ab complex con- tains an IgG antibody, the complex can be precipitated bymixing with formalin-killed S. aureus. After removal of the complex by either of these methods, the amount of free la-beled antigen remaining in the supernatant can be measuredin a radiation counter; subtracting this value from the totalamount of labeled antigen added yields the amount of la-beled antigen bound. Various solid-phase RIAs have been developed that make it easier to separate the Ag-Ab complex from the unboundantigen. In some cases, the antibody is covalently cross-linked to Sepharose beads. The amount of radiolabeled anti-gen bound to the beads can be measured after the beads havebeen centrifuged and washed. Alternatively, the antibody canbe immobilized on polystyrene or polyvinylchloride wellsand the amount of free labeled antigen in the supernatantcan be determined in a radiation counter. In another ap-proach, the antibody is immobilized on the walls of mi-crotiter wells and the amount of bound antigen determined.Because the procedure requires only small amounts of sam-ple and can be conducted in small 96-well microtiter plates(slightly larger than a 3 /H110035 card), this procedure is well suited for determining the concentration of a particular anti-gen in large numbers of samples. For example, a microtiterRIA has been widely used to screen for the presence of the he-patitis B virus (Figure 6-9). RIA screening of donor blood hassharply reduced the incidence of hepatitis B infections in re-cipients of blood transfusions.8536d_ch06_137-160 8/1/02 9:01 AM Page assay, commonly known as ELISA (or EIA), is similar in principle to RIA but depends on an enzyme rather than a radioactive label. An enzymeconjugated with an antibody reacts with a colorless substrateto generate a colored reaction product. Such a substrate iscalled a chromogenic substrate. A number of enzymes have been employed for ELISA, including alkaline phosphatase,horseradish peroxidase, and /H9252-galactosidase. These assays approach the sensitivity of RIAs and have the advantage ofbeing safer and less costly. There Are Numerous Variants of ELISA A number of variations of ELISA have been developed, al-lowing qualitative detection or quantitative measurementof either antigen or antibody. Each type of ELISA can beused qualitatively to detect the presence of antibody orantigen. Alternatively, a standard curve based on knownconcentrations of antibody or antigen is prepared, from which the unknown concentration of a sample can be determined. INDIRECT ELISA Antibody can be detected or quantitatively determined withan indirect ELISA (Figure 6-10a). Serum or some other sam-ple containing primary antibody (Ab 1) is added to an anti- gen-coated microtiter well and allowed to react with theantigen attached to the well. After any free Ab 1is washed away, the presence of antibody bound to the antigen is de-tected by adding an enzyme-conjugated secondary anti-iso-type antibody (Ab 2), which binds to the primary antibody. Any free Ab 2then is washed away, and a substrate for the en- zyme is added. The amount of colored reaction product thatforms is measured by specialized spectrophotometric platereaders, which can measure the absorbance of all of the wellsof a 96-well plate in seconds. Indirect ELISA is the method of choice to detect the pres- ence of serum antibodies against human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS. In this assay, re-combinant envelope and core proteins of HIV are adsorbed148 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 6-9A solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) to detect hepatitis B virus in blood samples. (a) Microtiter wells are co ated with a constant amount of antibody specific for HBsAg, the surf ace antigen on hepatitis B virions. A serum sample and [125I]HBsAg are then added. After incubation, the supernatant is removed an d the radioactivity of the antigen-antibody complexes is measured . If the sample is infected, the amount of label bound will be less thanin controls with uninfected serum. (b) A standard curve is obta ined by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled HBsAg to a fix ed quantity of [125I]HBsAg and specific antibody. From the plot of the percentage of labeled antigen bound versus the concentration ofunlabeled antigen, the concentration of HBsAg in unknown serumsamples can be determined by using the linear part of the curve .(a) Infected serum to wells. Individuals in- HIV will produce serum antibodies to epitopes onthese viral proteins. Generally, serum antibodies to HIV canbe detected by indirect ELISA within 6 weeks of infection. SANDWICH ELISA Antigen can be detected or measured by a sandwich ELISA(Figure 6-10b). In this technique, the antibody (rather thanthe antigen) is immobilized on a microtiter well. A samplecontaining antigen is added and allowed to react with theimmobilized antibody. After the well is washed, a second en-zyme-linked antibody specific for a different epitope on theantigen is added and allowed to react with the bound anti-gen. After any free second antibody is removed by washing,substrate is added, and the colored reaction product is measured. COMPETITIVE ELISA Another variation for measuring amounts of antigen is com-petitive ELISA (Figure 6-10c). In this technique, antibody isfirst incubated in solution with a sample containing antigen.The antigen-antibody mixture is then added to an antigen-coated microtiter well. The more antigen present in the sam-ple, the less free antibody will be available to bind to theantigen-coated well. Addition of an enzyme-conjugated sec-ondary antibody (Ab 2) specific for the isotype of the primary antibody can be used to determine the amount of primaryantibody bound to the well as in an indirect ELISA.

CHEMILUMINESCENCE Measurement of light produced by chemiluminescence dur-ing certain chemical reactions provides a convenient andhighly sensitive alternative to absorbance measurements inELISA assays. In versions of the ELISA using chemilumines-cence, a luxogenic (light-generating) substrate takes the placeof the chromogenic substrate in conventional ELISA reac-tions. For example, over chro- mogenic ones is enhanced sensitivity. In general, the detec-tion limit can be increased at least ten-fold by switching froma chromogenic to a luxogenic substrate, and with the addi-tion of enhancing agents, more than 200-fold. In fact, underideal conditions, as little as 5 /H1100310 /H1100218moles (5 attomoles) of target antigen have been detected. ELISPOT ASSAY A modification of the ELISA assay called the ELISPOT assayallows the quantitative determination of the number of cellsin a population that are producing antibodies specific for agiven antigen or an antigen for which one has a specific anti-body (Figure 6-11). In this approach, the plates are coatedwith the antigen (capture antigen) recognized by the anti-body of interest or with the antibody (capture antibody) spe-cific for the antigen whose production is being assayed. Asuspension of the cell population under investigation is thenadded to the coated plates and incubated. The cells settleonto the surface of the plate, and secreted molecules reactivewith the capture molecules are bound by the capture mole-cules in the vicinity of the secreting cells, producing a ring ofantigen-antibody complexes around each cell that is produc-ing the molecule of interest. The plate is then washed and anenzyme-linked antibody specific for the secreted antigen orspecific for the species (e.g., goat anti-rabbit) of the secretedantibody is added and allowed to bind. Subsequent develop-ment of the assay by addition of a suitable chromogenic orchemiluminescence-producing substrate reveals the positionof each antibody- or antigen-producing cell as a point ofcolor or light. Western Blotting Identification of a specific protein in a complex mixture ofproteins can be accomplished by a technique known as W est- ern blotting, named for its similarity to Southern blotting,150 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses Incubate at 37 \u00b0C Add enzyme-linke chromogeni substrateCP /H11005 colored productS NS Non-secretorSecretor Add test cell population Discard cells Wash plateNS S EECS Top viewCS CP FIGURE 6-11In the ELISPOT assay, a well is coated with antibody against the antigen of interest, a cytokine in this example, an d then a suspension of a cell population thought to contain some members syn- thesizing and secreting the cytokine are layered onto the botto m of the well and incubated. Most of the cytokine molecules secreted by a par- ticular cell react with nearby well-bound antibodies. After the incubation period, the well is washed and an enzyme-labeled anti-cytokine antibody is added. After washing away unbound antibody, a chromogenic su b- strate that forms an insoluble colored product is added. The co lored product (purple) precipitates and forms a spot only on the area s of the well where cytokine-secreting cells had been deposited. By coun ting the number of colored spots, it is possible to determine how ma ny cytokine-secreting cells were present in the added cell suspens ion.8536d_ch06_137-160 8/1/02 12:41 PM Page et al. / Immunology 5e:which detects DNA fragments, and Northern blotting, which detects mRNAs. In Western blotting, a protein mixture iselectrophoretically separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), a slab gel infused with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a dissociating agent (Figure 6-12). The protein bandsare transferred to a nylon membrane by electrophoresis andthe individual protein bands are identified by flooding thenitrocellulose membrane with radiolabeled or enzyme-linked polyclonal or monoclonal antibody specific for theprotein of interest. The Ag-Ab complexes that form on theband containing the protein recognized by the antibody canbe visualized in a variety of ways. If the protein of interest wasbound by a radioactive antibody, its position on the blot canbe determined by exposing the membrane to a sheet of x-rayfilm, a procedure called autoradiography. However, the mostgenerally used detection procedures employ enzyme-linkedantibodies against the protein. After binding of the enzyme-antibody conjugate, addition of a chromogenic substrate thatproduces a highly colored and insoluble product causes theappearance of a colored band at the site of the target antigen.The site of the protein of interest can be determined withmuch higher sensitivity if a chemiluminescent compoundalong with suitable enhancing agents is used to produce lightat the antigen site. Western blotting can also identify a specific antibody in a mixture. In this case, known antigens of well-defined molec-ular weight are separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto ni-trocellulose. The separated bands of known antigens are thenprobed with the sample suspected of containing antibodyspecific for one or more of these antigens. Reaction of an an-tibody with a band is detected by using either radiolabeled orenzyme-linked secondary antibody that is specific for thespecies of the antibodies in the test sample. The most widelyused application of this procedure is in confirmatory testingfor HIV , where Western blotting is used to determinewhether the patient has antibodies that react with one ormore viral proteins.Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER antigens denatured in SDSDirection of migrationAdd of gel(a) Electrophorese in SDS-polyacrylamide gel(b) Remove gel and perform electrotransfer Electric current Porous membranesheet(c) Bind antigen of interest with enzyme-linkedantibodies(d) Add substrate to activate color reaction(e)+ FIGURE 6-12In Western blotting, a protein mixture is (a) treated with SDS, a strong denaturing detergent, (b) then separated by elec- trophoresis in an SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) which sepa-rates the components according to their molecular weight; lowermolecular weight components migrate farther than higher molecul ar weight ones.

It also provides a sensitive assay for the presence of a particular antigen in a given cell or tissue type. An extract pr o- duced by disruption of cells or tissues is mixed with an anti-body against the antigen of interest in order to form anantigen-antibody complex that will precipitate. However, ifthe antigen concentration is low (often the case in cell and ti s- sue extracts), the assembly of antigen-antibody complexesinto precipitates can take hours, even days, and it is difficult to isolate the small amount of immunoprecipitate that forms. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to avoid these limitations. One is to attach the antibody to a solid support,such as a synthetic bead, which allows the antigen-antibodycomplex to be collected by centrifugation. Another is to adda secondary antibody specific for the primary antibody tobind the antigen-antibody complexes. If the secondary anti-body is attached to a bead, the immune complexes can becollected by centrifugation. A particularly ingenious versionof this procedure involves the coupling of the secondary an-tibody to magnetic beads. After the secondary antibodybinds to the primary antibody, immunoprecipitates are collected by placing a magnet against the side of the tube(Figure 6-13). When used in conjunction with biosynthetic radioisotope labeling, immunoprecipitation can also be used to determinewhether a particular antigen is actually synthesized by a cell or tissue. Radiolabeling of proteins synthesized by cells of in-terest can be done by growing the cells in cell-culturemedium containing one or more radiolabeled amino acids.Generally, the amino acids used for this application are thosemost resistant to metabolic modification, such as leucine,cysteine, or methionine. After growth in the radioactivemedium, the cells are lysed and subjected to a primary anti-body specific for the antigen of interest. The Ag-Ab complexis collected by immunoprecipitation, washed free of unin-corporated radiolabeled amino acid and other impurities,and then analyzed. The complex can be counted in a scintil-lation counter to obtain a quantitative determination of theamount of the protein synthesized. Further analysis often in-volves disruption of the complex, usually by use of SDS andheat, so that the identity of the immunoprecipitated antigencan be confirmed by checking that its molecular weight isthat expected for the antigen of interest. This is done by sep-aration of the disrupted complex by SDS-PAGE and subse-quent autoradiography to determine the position of theradiolabeled antigen on the gel. Immunofluorescence In 1944, Albert Coons showed that antibodies could be la-beled with molecules that have the property of fluorescence.Fluorescent molecules absorb light of one wavelength 152 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses Specific antibody Antigen A Add specific antibody tocell extractAdd secondary antibody coupledto magnetic beadsApply magnet and rinse toremove unboundmaterialMagnetic bead (a) (b) (c) FIGURE 6-13Immunoprecipitates can be collected using mag- netic beads coupled to a secondary antibody.

If antibody molecules are tagged with a fluorescent dye, orfluorochrome, immune complexes containing these fluores- cently labeled antibodies (FA) can be detected by coloredlight emission when excited by light of the appropriate wave-length. Antibody molecules bound to antigens in cells or tis-sue sections can similarly be visualized. The emitted light canbe viewed with a fluorescence microscope, which is equippedwith a UV light source. In this technique, known as im- munofluorescence, fluorescent compounds such as fluores- cein and rhodamine are in common use, but other highlyfluorescent substances are also routinely used, such as phyco-erythrin, an intensely colored and highly fluorescent pig-ment obtained from algae. These molecules can beconjugated to the Fc region of an antibody molecule withoutaffecting the specificity of the antibody. Each of the fluo-rochromes below absorbs light at one wavelength and emitslight at a longer wavelength: IFluorescein, an organic dye that is the most widely used label for immunofluorescence procedures, absorbs bluelight (490 nm) and emits an intense yellow-greenfluorescence (517 nm). IRhodamine, another organic dye, absorbs in the yellow-green range (515 nm) and emits a deep redfluorescence (546 nm). Because it emits fluorescence at a longer wavelength than fluorescein, it can be used intwo-color immunofluorescence assays. An antibodyspecific to one determinant is labeled with fluorescein,and an antibody recognizing a different antigen islabeled with rhodamine. The location of thefluorescein-tagged antibody will be visible by its yellow-green color, easy to distinguish from the red coloremitted where the rhodamine-tagged antibody hasbound. By conjugating fluorescein to one antibody andrhodamine to another antibody, one can, for example,visualize simultaneously two different cell-membraneantigens on the same cell. IPhycoerythrin is an efficient absorber of light (~30-fold greater than fluorescein) and a brilliant emitter of redfluorescence, stimulating its wide use as a label forimmunofluorescence. Fluorescent-antibody staining of cell membrane mole- cules or tissue sections can be direct or indirect (Figure 6-14 ). In direct staining, the specific antibody (the primary anti- body) is directly conjugated with fluorescein; in indirect staining, the primary antibody is unlabeled and is detected with an additional fluorochrome-labeled reagent. A num-ber of reagents have been developed for indirect staining.Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 153 FIGURE 6-14Direct and indirect immunofluorescence staining of membrane antigen (mAg). Cells are affixed to a microscopeslide. In the direct method (a), cells are stained with anti-mA g anti- body that is labeled with a fluorochrome (Fl). In the indirect meth- ods (b and c), cells are first incubated with unlabeled anti-mA g antibody and then stained with a fluorochrome-labeled secondaryreagent that binds to the primary antibody.

First, the primary antibody doesnot need to be conjugated with a fluorochrome. Because thesupply of primary antibody is often a limiting factor, indirectmethods avoid the loss of antibody that usually occurs dur-ing the conjugation reaction. Second, indirect methods in-crease the sensitivity of staining because multiple moleculesof the fluorochrome reagent bind to each primary antibodymolecule, increasing the amount of light emitted at the loca-tion of each primary antibody molecule. Immunofluorescence has been applied to identify a num- ber of subpopulations of lymphocytes, notably the CD4 /H11001 and CD8/H11001T-cell subpopulations. The technique is also suit- able for identifying bacterial species, detecting Ag-Ab com-plexes in autoimmune disease, detecting complementcomponents in tissues, and localizing hormones and othercellular products stained in situ. Indeed, a major applicationof the fluorescent-antibody technique is the localization ofantigens in tissue sections or in subcellular compartments.Because it can be used to map the actual location of targetantigens, fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for relat-ing the molecular architecture of tissues and organs to theiroverall gross anatomy. Flow Cytometry and Fluorescence The fluorescent antibody techniques described are ex-tremely valuable qualitative tools, but they do not give quantitative data. This shortcoming was remedied by development of the flow cytometer, which was designed toautomate the analysis and separation of cells stained withfluorescent antibody. The flow cytometer uses a laser beamand light detector to count single intact cells in suspension(Figure 6-15). Every time a cell passes the laser beam, light isdeflected from the detector, and this interruption of thelaser signal is recorded. Those cells having a fluorescentlytagged antibody bound to their cell surface antigens are ex-cited by the laser and emit light that is recorded by a seconddetector system located at a right angle to the laser beam.The simplest form of the instrument counts each cell as itpasses the laser beam and records the level of fluorescencethe cell emits; an attached computer generates plots of thenumber of cells as the ordinate and their fluorescence inten-sity as the abscissa. More sophisticated versions of the in-strument are capable of sorting populations of cells intodifferent containers according to their fluorescence profile.Use of the instrument to determine which and how manymembers of a cell population bind fluorescently labeled an-tibodies is called analysis; use of the instrument to place cellshaving different patterns of reactivity into different contain-ers is called cell sorting.The flow cytometer has multiple applications to clinical and research problems. A common clinical use is to deter-mine the kind and number of white blood cells in bloodsamples. By treating appropriately processed blood sam-ples with a fluorescently labeled antibody and performingflow cytometric analysis, one can obtain the following information: IHow many cells express the target antigen as an absolutenumber and also as a percentage of cells passing thebeam. For example, if one uses a fluorescent antibodyspecific for an antigen present on all T cells, it would bepossible to determine the percentage of T cells in thetotal white blood cell population. Then, using the cell-sorting capabilities of the flow cytometer, it wouldbe possible to isolate the T-cell fraction of the leukocytepopulation. IThe distribution of cells in a sample populationaccording to antigen densities as determined byfluorescence intensity. It is thus possible to obtain ameasure of the distribution of antigen density within thepopulation of cells that possess the antigen. This is apowerful feature of the instrument, since the same typeof cell may express different levels of antigen dependingupon its developmental or physiological state. IThe size of cells. This information is derived fromanalysis of the light-scattering properties of members ofthe cell population under examination. Flow cytometry also makes it possible to analyze cell pop- ulations that have been labeled with two or even three differ-ent fluorescent antibodies. For example, if a blood sample isreacted with a fluorescein-tagged antibody specific for Tcells, and also with a phycoerythrin-tagged antibody specificfor B cells, the percentages of B and T cells may be deter-mined simultaneously with a single analysis. Numerous vari-ations of such \"two-color\" analyses are routinely carried out,and \"three-color\" experiments are common. Aided by appro-priate software, highly sophisticated versions of the flow cy-tometer can even perform \"five-color\" analyses. Flow cytometry now occupies a key position in im- munology and cell biology, and it has become an indispens-able clinical tool as well. In many medical centers, the flowcytometer is one of the essential tools for the detection andclassification of leukemias (see the Clinical Focus). Thechoice of treatment for leukemia depends heavily on the celltypes involved, making precise identification of the neoplas-tic cells an essential part of clinical practice. Likewise, therapid measurement of T-cell subpopulations, an importantprognostic indicator in AIDS, is routinely done by flow-cytometric analysis. In this procedure, labeled monoclonalantibodies against the major T-cell subtypes bearing theCD4 and CD8 antigens are used to determine their ratios inthe patient's blood. When the number of CD4 T cells fallsbelow a certain level, the patient is at high risk for oppor-tunistic infections.154 PART II Generation of B-Cell and AM al. / Immunology 5e:Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 155 FIGURE 6-15Separation of fluorochrome-labeled cells with the flow cytometer. In the example shown, a mixed cell population i s stained with two antibodies, one specific for surface antigen A and the other specific for surface antigen B. The anti-A antibodies are labeled with fluorescein (green) and the anti-B antibodies with rho- damine (red). The stained cells are loaded into the sample cham - ber of the cytometer. The cells are expelled, one at a time, fr om a small vibrating nozzle that generates microdroplets, each conta in- ing no more than a single cell. As it leaves the nozzle, each d roplet receives a small electrical charge, and the computer that contr ols the flow cytometer can detect exactly when a drop generated by the nozzle passes through the beam of laser light that excites the fluo- rochrome. The intensity of the fluorescence emitted by eachdroplet that contains a cell is monitored by a detector and dis - played on a computer screen. Because the computer tracks theposition of each droplet, it is possible to determine when a pa rtic-ular droplet will arrive between the deflection plates. By appl ying a momentary charge to the deflection plates when a droplet is pas s- ing between them, it is possible to deflect the path of a parti cular droplet into one or another collecting vessel. This allows the sort- ing of a population of cells into subpopulations having differe nt profiles of surface markers. In the computer display, each dot represents a cell. Cells that fall into the lower left-hand panel have background levels of fluore scence and are judged not to have reacted with either antibody anti-A or anti-B. Those that appear in the upper left panel reacted with anti-B b ut not anti-A, and those in the lower right panel reacted with anti-A but not anti-B. The upper right panel contains cells that react with bo th anti-A and anti-B.

One such molecule, known as protein A, is found in the cell walls of some strains of Staphylococcus aureus , and another, protein G,appears in the walls of group C and G Streptococcus. By cloning the genes for protein A and protein G and generatinga hybrid of both, one can make a recombinant protein,known as protein A/G, that combines some of the best fea- tures of both. These molecules are useful because they bindIgG from many different species. Thus they can be labeledwith flourochromes, radioactivity, or biotin and used to de-tect IgG molecules in the antigen-antibody complexesformed during ELISA, RIA, cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Thesebacterial IgG-binding proteins can also be used to makeaffinity columns for the isolation of IgG.Egg whites contain a protein called avidin that binds biotin, a vitamin that is essential for fat synthesis. Avidin is believe d to have evolved as a defense against marauding rodents that robnests and eat the stolen eggs. The binding between avidin andbiotin is extremely specific and of much higher affinity ( K a~ 1015) than any known antigen-antibody reaction. A bacterial protein called streptavidin, made by streptomyces avidinii, has similarly high affinity and specificity. The extraordinary affin - ity and exquisite specificity of the interaction of these protein s with biotin is widely used in many immunological procedures.The primary or secondary antibody is labeled with biotin andallowed to react with the target antigen, and the unbound an-tibody is then washed away. Subsequently, streptavidin oravidin conjugated with an enzyme, flourochrome, or radioac-tive label is used to detect the bound antibody. Immunoelectron Microscopy The fine specificity of antibodies has made them powerfultools for visualizing specific intracellular tissue components156 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses adults than in children; and chronic lym- phocytic leukemia (CLL), which is rarelyseen in children but is the most com-mon form of adult leukemia in the Western world. A fourth type, chronicmyelogenous leukemia (CML), occursmuch more often in older adults than inchildren. The diagnosis of leukemia is made on the basis of two findings. One is thedetection of abnormal cells in the blood-stream, and the other is observation ofabnormal cells in the bone marrow. Clin-ical experience has shown that designingthe most appropriate therapy for the pa-tient requires knowing which type ofleukemia is present. In this regard, twoof the important questions are: ( 1) What is the lineage of the abnormal cells and(2) What is their maturational stage? A variety of approaches, including cyto-logic examination of cell morphologyand staining characteristics, immuno-phenotyping, and, in some cases, an analysis of gene rearrangements, areuseful in answering these questions.One of the most powerful of these ap-proaches is immunophenotyping, thedetermination of the profile of selectedcell-surface markers displayed by theleukemic cell. Although leukemia-spe-cific antigens have not yet been found,profiles of expressed surface antigens of-ten can establish cell lineage, and theyare frequently helpful in determining thematurational stages present in leukemiccell populations. For example, an abnor-mal cell that displays surface immuno-globulin would be assigned to the B-celllineage and its maturational stage wouldbe that of a mature B cell. On the otherhand, a cell that had cytoplasmic /H9262heavy chains, but no surface immuno-globulin,would be a B-lineage cell but atthe maturational stage of a pre-B most efficient technol-ogy for and monoclonal antibodies.The availability of monoclonal antibod-ies specific for each of the scores of anti-gens found on various types and sub-types of hematopoietic cells has made itpossible to identify patterns of antigen Leukemia is the un- checked proliferation of an abnormalclone of hematopoietic cells. Typically,leukemic cells respond poorly or inap-propriately to regulatory signals, displayaberrant patterns of differentiation, oreven fail to differentiate. Furthermore,they sometimes suppress the growth ofnormal lymphoid and myeloid cells.Leukemia can arise at any any one of the hematopoieticlineages. Lymphocytic leukemias displaymany characteristics of cells group,myelogenous leukemias, have attributesof members of the myeloid lineage.Aside from lineage, many leukemias can be classified as acute or chronic.Some examples are acute lymphocyticleukemia (ALL), the most commonchildhood leukemia; acute myelogenousleukemia (AML), found and 8/1/02 12:41 PM al. / Immunology 5e:Antigen-Antibody Interactions: Principles and Applications CHAPTER 6 157 files of surface markers on tumor cell populations.

In this technique, an elec- tron-dense label is either conjugated to the Fc portion of aspecific antibody for direct staining or conjugated an anti-immunoglobulin reagent for indirect staining. A number ofelectron-dense labels have been employed, including ferritin and colloidal gold. Because the electron-dense label absorbs electrons, it can be visualized with the electron microscopeas small black dots. In the case of immunogold labeling, dif-ferent antibodies can be conjugated with gold particles ofdifferent sizes, allowing identification of several antigenswithin a cell by the different sizes of the electron-dense goldparticles attached to the antibodies (Figure 6-16).

Jenei et of De- al. / Immunology 5e:SUMMARY IAntigen-antibody interactions depend four types of noncovalent interactions: hydrogen bonds, ionicbonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions. IThe affinity constant, which can be determined byScatchard analysis, provides a quantitative measure of thestrength of the interaction between an epitope of the anti-gen and a single binding site of an antibody. The avidity re-flects the overall strength of the interactions between amultivalent antibody molecule and a multivalent antigenmolecule at multiple sites. IThe interaction of a soluble antigen and precipitating anti-body in a liquid or gel medium forms an Ag-Ab precipi-tate. Electrophoresis can be combined with precipitationin gels in a technique called immunoelectrophoresis. IThe interaction between a particulate antigen and aggluti-nating antibody (agglutinin) produces visible clumping, oragglutination that forms the basis of simple, rapid, andsensitive immunoassays. IRadioimmunoassay (RIA) is a highly sensitive and quanti-tative utilizes radioactively labeled antigenor generates acolored reaction product. ELISA assays that employchemiluminescence instead of a chromogenic reaction arethe most sensitive immunoassays available. IIn Western blotting, a protein mixture is separated by elec-trophoresis; then the protein bands are electrophoreticallytransferred onto nitrocellulose and identified with labeledantibody or labeled antigen. IFluorescence microscopy using antibodies labeled withfluorescent molecules can be used to visualize antigen onor within cells. IFlow cytometry provides an unusually powerful technol-ogy for the quantitative analysis and sorting of cell popula-tions labeled with one or more fluorescent antibodies. References Berzofsky, J.

Although Gorer died before his contributions wererecognized fully, Snell was awarded the Nobel prize in 1980for this work. The MHC Encodes Three Major Classes of Molecules The major histocompatibility complex is a collection of genes arrayed within a long continuous stretch of DNA onchromosome 6 in humans and on chromosome 17 in mice.The MHC is referred to as the HLA complex in humans and as the H-2 complex in mice. Although the arrangement of genes is somewhat different, in both cases the MHC genes areorganized into regions encoding three classes of molecules(Figure 7-1): IClass I MHC genes encode glycoproteins expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells; the majorfunction of the class I gene products is presentation ofpeptide antigens to T Ccells. chapter 7 IGeneral Organization and Inheritance of the MHC IMHC Molecules and Genes IDetailed Genomic Map of Distribution of MHC IRegulation of MHC IMHC and Immune Responsiveness IMHC and Disease SusceptibilityMajor HistocompatibilityComplex E possesses a tightly linked cluster of genes, the ma- jor histocompatibility complex (MHC), whose products play roles in intercellular recognition and in dis-crimination between self and nonself. The MHC partici-pates in the development of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. While antibodies may reactwith antigens alone, most T cells recognize antigen onlywhen it is combined with an MHC molecule. Furthermore,because MHC molecules act as antigen-presenting struc-tures, the particular set of MHC molecules expressed by anindividual influences the repertoire of antigens to which thatindividual's T Hand T Ccells can respond. For this reason, the MHC partly determines the response of an individual toantigens of infectious organisms, and it has therefore beenimplicated in the susceptibility to disease and in the devel-opment of autoimmunity. The recent understanding thatnatural killer cells express receptors for MHC class I antigensand the fact that the receptor-MHC interaction may lead toinhibition or activation expands the known role of this genefamily (see Chapter 14). The present chapter examines theorganization and inheritance of MHC genes, the structure ofthe MHC molecules, and the central function that thesemolecules play in producing an immune response. General Organization and Inheritance of the MHC The concept that the rejection of foreign tissue is the result of an immune response to cell-surface molecules, now calledhistocompatibility antigens, originated from the work of Peter Gorer in the mid-1930s. Gorer was using inbred strainsof mice to identify blood-group antigens. In the course ofthese studies, he identified four groups of genes, designatedI through IV , that encoded blood-cell antigens. Work carriedout in the 1940s and 1950s by Gorer and George Snell estab-lished that antigens encoded by the genes in the group desig-nated II took part in the rejection of transplanted tumorsand other tissue. Snell called these genes \"histocompatibilityPresentation of Virus and genes encode glycoproteins expressed primarily on antigen-presenting cells (macrophages,dendritic cells, and B cells), where they present processedantigenic peptides to T Hcells. IClass III MHC genes encode, in addition to other products, various secreted proteins that have immunefunctions, including components of the complementsystem and molecules involved in inflammation. Class I MHC molecules encoded by the K and D regions in mice and by the A, B, and C loci in humans were the firstdiscovered, and they are expressed in the widest range ofcell types. These are referred to as classical class I molecules. Additional genes or groups of genes within the H-2 or HLAcomplexes also encode class I molecules; these genes aredesignated nonclassical class I genes. Expression of the non- classical gene products is limited to certain specific celltypes. Although functions are not known for all of thesegene products, some may have highly specialized roles inimmunity. For example, the expression of the class I HLA-G molecules on cytotrophoblasts at the fetal-maternal in-terface has been implicated in protection of the fetus frombeing recognized as foreign (this may occur when paternalantigens begin to appear) and from being rejected by ma- ternal T Ccells. The two chains of the class II MHC molecules are en- coded by the IA and IE regions in mice and by the DP , DQ,and DR regions in humans. The terminology is somewhatconfusing, since the D region in mice encodes class I MHCmolecules, whereas the D region (DR, DQ, DP) in humansrefers to genes encoding class II MHC molecules! Fortu-nately, the designation D for the general chromosomal loca-tion encoding the human class II molecules is seldom usedtoday; the sequence of the entire MHC region is available sothe more imprecise reference to region is seldom necessary.As with the class I loci, additional class II molecules en-coded within this region have specialized functions in theimmune process. The class I and class II MHC molecules have common structural features and both have roles in antigen processing.By contrast, the class III MHC region, which is flanked by theclass I and II regions, encodes molecules that are critical toimmune function but have little in common with class I or IImolecules. Class III products include the complement com-ponents C4, C2, BF (see Chapter 13), and inflammatory cy-tokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) andheat-shock proteins (see Chapter 12).162 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 7-1Simplified organization of the major histocompat- ibility complex (MHC) in the mouse and human. The MHC is re-ferred to as the H- 2complex in mice and as the HLA complex in humans. In both species the MHC is organized into a number ofregions encoding class I (pink), class II (blue), and class III(green) gene products.

The genes of the MHC loci lie close together; forexample, the recombination frequency within the H-2 com-plex (i.e., the frequency of chromosome crossover eventsduring mitosis, indicative of the distance between given genesegments) is only 0.5%\u2014crossover occurs only once in every200 mitotic cycles. For this reason, most individuals inheritthe alleles encoded by these closely linked loci as two sets, on e from each parent. Each set of alleles is referred to as a haplo- type. An individual inherits one haplotype from the mother and one haplotype from the father. In outbred populations,the offspring are generally heterozygous at many loci and maternal and paternal MHC alleles. The allelesare codominantly expressed; that is, both maternal and pater- nal gene products are expressed in the same cells. If mice areinbred (that is, have identical alleles at all loci), each H-2 lo - cus will be homozygous because the maternal and paternalhaplotypes are identical, and all offspring therefore expressidentical haplotypes. Certain inbred mouse strains have been designated as prototype strains, and the MHC haplotype expressed bythese strains is designated by an arbitrary italic superscript(e.g., H-2 a, H-2b). These designations refer to the entire set of inherited H-2 alleles within a strain without having to listeach allele individually (Table 7-1). Different inbred strainsmay have the same set of alleles, that is the same MHC hap-lotype, as the prototype strain. For example, the CBA, AKR,and C3H strains all have the same MHC haplotype (H-2 k). The three strains differ, however, in genes outside the H-2complex. If two mice from inbred strains having different MHC haplotypes are bred to one another, the F 1generation inher- its haplotypes from both parental strains and therefore ex-presses both parental alleles at each MHC locus. For exam- ple, if an H-2bstrain is crossed with an H-2k, then the F 1in- herits both parental sets of alleles and is said to be H-2b/k (Figure 7-2a). Because such an F 1expresses the MHC pro- teins of both parental strains on its cells, it is histocompatibl e with both strains and able to accept grafts from eitherparental strain (see example in Figure 7-2b). However, nei-ther of the inbred parental strains can accept a graft from theF 1mice because half of the MHC molecules will be foreign to the parent. The inheritance of HLA haplotypes from heterozygous human parents is illustrated in Figure 7-2c. In an outbredpopulation, each individual is generally heterozygous at eachlocus. The human HLA complex is highly polymorphic andmultiple alleles of each class I and class II gene exist. How-ever, as with mice, the human MHC loci are closely linkedand usually inherited as a haplotype. When the father andmother have different haplotypes, as in the example shown(Figure 7-2c) there is a one-in-four chance that siblings willinherit the same paternal and maternal haplotypes andtherefore be histocompatible with each other; none of theoffspring will be histocompatible with the parents. Although the rate of recombination by crossover is low within the HLA, it still contributes significantly to the diver-sity of the loci in human populations. Genetic recombina-tion generates new allelic combinations (Figure 7-2d), andthe high number of intervening generations since the ap-pearance of humans as a species has allowed extensive re-combination, so that it is rare for any two unrelatedindividuals to have identical sets of HLA genes. MHC Congenic Mouse Strains Are Identical at All Loci Except the MHC Detailed analysis of the H-2 complex in mice was made possible by the development of congenic mouse strains. In-bred mouse strains are syngeneic or identical at all genetic loci.

Any pheno- typic differences that can be detected between congenicstrains are related to the genetic region that distinguishesthe strains. Congenic strains that are identical with eachother except at the MHC can be produced by a series ofcrosses, backcrosses, and selections. Figure 7-3 outlines thesteps by which the H-2 complex of homozygous strain Bcan be introduced into the background genes of homozy-gous strain A to generate a congenic strain, denoted A.B.The first letter in a congenic strain designation refers to thestrain providing the genetic background and the secondletter to the strain providing the genetically different MHCregion. Thus, strain A.B will be genetically identical tostrain A except for the MHC locus or loci contributed bystrain B. During production of congenic mouse strains, a crossover event sometimes occurs within the H-2 complex, yielding arecombinant strain that differs from the parental strains orthe congenic strain at one or a few loci within the H-2 complex. Figure 7-4 depicts haplotypes present in several re- combinant congenic strains that were obtained during pro-duction of a B10.A congenic strain. Such recombinant strains have been extremely useful in analyzing the MHC be-cause they permit comparisons of functional differences Major Histocompatibility CHAPTER 7 A Ba/a FIGURE 7-3Production of congenic mouse strain A.B, which has the genetic background ofparental strain A but the H- 2complex of strain B. Crossing inbred strain A (H- 2 a) with strain B (H- 2b) generates F 1progeny that are heterozygous ( a/b) at all H- 2loci. The F 1progeny are interbred to pro- duce an F 2generation, a/a, and F 2progeny homozygous for the B-strain H- 2complex are selected by their ability to reject a skin graft from strain A; any prog-eny that accept an A-strain graft are eliminatedfrom future breeding. The selected b/bhomozy- gous mice are then backcrossed to strain A; the re-sulting progeny are again interbred and theiroffspring are again selected for b/bhomozygosity at the H- 2complex. This process of backcrossing to strain A, intercrossing, and selection for ability toreject an A-strain graft is repeated for at least 12 generations. In this way A-strain homozygosity isrestored at all loci except the H- 2locus, which is homozygous for the B strain. DH-2 loci FIGURE 7-4Examples of recombinant congenic mouse strains generated during production of the B 10.A strain from parental strain B10(H-2b) and parental strain A (H- 2a).

Furthermore, the generation of new H-2 haplotypesunder the experimental conditions of congenic strain devel-opment provides an excellent illustration of the means bywhich the MHC continues to maintain heterogeneity even inpopulations with limited diversity. MHC Molecules and Genes Class I and class II MHC molecules are membrane-boundglycoproteins that are closely related in both structure andfunction. Both class I and class II MHC molecules have beenisolated and purified and the three-dimensional structuresof their extracellular domains have been determined by x-ray crystallography. Both types of membrane glycoproteinsfunction as highly specialized antigen-presenting moleculesthat form unusually stable complexes with antigenic pep-tides, displaying them on the cell surface for recognition byT cells. In contrast, class III MHC molecules are a group ofunrelated proteins that do not share structural similarityand common function with class I and II molecules. Theclass III molecules will be examined in more detail in laterchapters.Class I Molecules Have a Glycoprotein Heavy Chain and a Small Protein Light Chain Class I MHC molecules contain a 45-kilodalton (kDa) /H9251 chain associated brane glycoprotein encoded by polymorphic genes within theA, B, and C regions of the human HLA complex and withinthe K and D/L regions of the mouse H-2 complex (see Figure7-1). /H9252 2-Microglobulin is a protein encoded by a highly con- served gene located on a different chromosome. Associationof the /H9251chain with /H9252 2-microglobulin is required for expres- sion of class I molecules on cell membranes. The /H9251chain is anchored in the plasma membrane by its hydrophobic trans-membrane segment and hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail. Structural analyses have revealed that the /H9251chain of class I MHC molecules is organized into three external domains(/H92511,/H92512, and /H92513), each containing approximately 90 amino acids; a transmembrane domain of about 25 hydrophobicamino acids followed by a short stretch of charged (hy-drophilic) amino acids; and a cytoplasmic anchor segment of30 amino acids. The /H9252 2-microglobulin is similar in size and organization to the /H92513 domain; it does not contain a trans- membrane region and is noncovalently bound to the class Iglycoprotein. Sequence data reveal homology between the /H92513166 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses 1 21 2 2-microglobulin Transmembrane segment Cytoplasmic tail2 1 3 SClass SSS SSSSSSPeptide-binding domains Membrane-proximal domains (Ig-fold structure) FIGURE 7-5Schematic diagrams of a class I and a class II MHC molecule showing the external domains, transmembrane segment,and cytoplasmic tail. The peptide-binding cleft is formed by th e mem- brane-distal domains in both class I and class II molecules. Th emembrane-proximal domains possess the basic immunoglobulin- fold structure; thus, class I and class II MHC molecules are cl assified as members of the Immunology the to its transmembrane domain, re-leasing the extracellular portion of the molecule, consisting of/H92511,/H92512,/H92513, and /H9252 2-microglobulin. Purification and crystal- lization of the portion revealed two pairs of in-teracting domains: a membrane-distal pair made up of the /H92511 and /H92512 domains and a membrane-proximal pair composed of the /H92513 domain and /H9252 2-microglobulin (Figure 7-6a). The /H92511 and /H92512 domains interact to form a platform of eight antiparallel /H9252strands spanned by two long /H9251-helical re- gions. The structure forms a deep approxi-mately \u00c5 /H1100310 \u00c5 /H1100311 as sides and the /H9252strands of the /H9252sheet as the bottom (Figure 7-6b). This peptide-binding cleft is located on the top surface of the class I MHC molecule, and it is large enough to bind a peptideof 8-10 amino acids. The great surprise in the x-ray crystallo-graphic analysis of class I molecules was the finding of smallpeptides in the cleft that had cocrystallized with the protein.These peptides are, in fact, processed antigen and self-pep-tides bound to the /H92511 and /H92512 domains in this deep groove. The /H92513 domain and /H9252 2-microglobulin are organized into two /H9252pleated sheets each formed by antiparallel /H9252strands of amino acids. As described in Chapter 4, this structure, knownas the immunoglobulin fold, is characteristic of im-munoglobulin domains. Because of this structural similarity,which is not surprising given the considerable sequence sim- ilarity with the immunoglobulin constant regions, class IMHC molecules and /H9252 2-microglobulin are classified as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see Figure 4-20). The /H92513 domain appears to be highly conserved among class I MHC molecules and contains a sequence that interactswith the CD8 membrane molecule present on T Ccells. /H92522-Microglobulin interacts extensively with the /H92513 do- main and also interacts with amino acids of the /H92511 and /H92512 domains. The interaction of /H92522-microglobulin and a peptide with a class I /H9251chain is essential for the class I molecule to reach its fully folded conformation. As described in detail inChapter 8, assembly of class I molecules is believed to occurby the initial interaction of /H9252 2-microglobulin with the fold- ing class I /H9251chain. This metastable \"empty\" dimer is then sta- bilized by the binding of an appropriate peptide to form thenative trimeric class I structure consisting of the class I /H9251 chain, /H9252 2-microglobulin, and a peptide. This complete mole- cular complex is ultimately transported to the cell surface. In the absence of /H92522-microglobulin, the class I MHC /H9251 chain is not expressed on the cell membrane. This is illus-trated by Daudi tumor cells, which are unable to synthesize/H9252 2-microglobulin. These tumor cells produce class I MHC /H9251 chains, but do not express them on the membrane. However,if Daudi cells are transfected with a functional gene encoding/H9252 2-microglobulin, class I molecules appear on the membrane.Major Histocompatibility Complex CHAPTER 7 167 (b)1 domain 2 domain1 domain Peptide-binding cleft FIGURE 7-6Representations of the three-dimensional structure of the external domains of a human class I MHC molecule based on x - ray crystallographic analysis.

Eachchain in a class II molecule contains two external domains:/H92511 and /H92512 domains in one chain and /H92521 and /H92522 domains in the other. The membrane-proximal /H92512 and /H92522 domains, like the membrane-proximal /H92513//H9252 2-microglobulin domains of class I MHC molecules, bear sequence similarity to the im-munoglobulin-fold structure; for this reason, class II MHCmolecules also are classified in the immunoglobulin super-family. The membrane-distal portion of a class II molecule iscomposed of the /H92511 and /H92521 domains and forms the antigen- binding cleft for processed antigen. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals the similarity of class II and class I molecules, strikingly apparent when themolecules are surperimposed (Figure 7-7). The peptide-binding cleft of HLA-DR1, like that in class I molecules, iscomposed of a floor of eight antiparallel /H9252strands and sides of antiparallel /H9251helices. However, the class II molecule lacks the conserved residues that bind to the terminal residues ofshort peptides and forms instead an open pocket; class I pre-sents more of a socket, class II an open-ended groove. Thesefunctional consequences of these differences in fine structurewill be explored below. An unexpected difference between crystallized class I and class II molecules was observed for human DR1 in that the latter occurred as a dimer of /H9251/H9252heterodimers, a \"dimer of dimers\" (Figure 7-8). The dimer is oriented so that the twopeptide-binding clefts face in opposite directions. While it hasnot yet been determined whether this dimeric form exists invivo, the presence of CD4 binding sites on opposite sides ofthe class II molecule suggests that it does. These two sites onthe /H92512 and /H92522 domains are adjacent in the dimer form and a CD4 molecule binding to them may stabilize class II dimers.

Like class I MHC genes, the class II genes are organized into a series of exons and introns mirroring the domain struc-ture of the /H9251and /H9252chains (see Figure 7-9b). Both the /H9251and the /H9252genes encoding mouse and human class II MHC mole- cules have a leader one or more cytoplasmic exons.Class I and II Molecules Exhibit Polymorphism in the Region That Binds to Peptides Several hundred different allelic variants of class I and II MHC molecules have been identified in humans. Any one individual,however, expresses only a small number of these molecules\u2014up to 6 different class I molecules and up to 12 different clas s II molecules. Y et this limited number of MHC molecules must beable to present an enormous array of different antigenic pep-tides to T cells, permitting the immune system to respondspecifically to a wide variety of antigenic challenges. Thus, pep-tide binding by class I and II molecules does not exhibit the f ine specificity characteristic of antigen binding by antibodies andT-cell receptors.

Because of this broad speci-ficity, the binding between a peptide and an MHC molecule isoften referred to as \"promiscuous.\" Given the similarities in the structure of the peptide-bind- ing cleft in class I and II MHC molecules, it is not surprisingthat they exhibit some common peptide-binding features(Table 7-2). In both types of MHC molecules, peptide lig-ands are held in a largely extended conformation that runsthe length of the cleft. The peptide-binding cleft in class Imolecules is blocked at both ends, whereas the cleft is open inclass II molecules (Figure 7-10). As a result of this difference,class I molecules bind peptides that typically contain 8-10amino acid residues, while the open groove of class II mole-cules accommodates slightly longer peptides of 13-18 aminoacids. Another difference, explained in more detail below, isthat class I binding requires that the peptide contain specificamino acid residues near the N and C termini; there is nosuch requirement for class II peptide binding. The peptide-MHC molecule association is very stable (K d~ 10/H110026) under physiologic conditions; thus, most of170 PART of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 7-2 Peptide binding by class I and class II MHC molecules Class I molecules Class II molecules Peptide-binding domain /H92511//H92512 /H92511//H92521 Nature of peptide-binding cleft Closed at both ends Open at both ends General size of bound peptides 8-10amino acids 13-18amino acids Peptide motifs involved in Anchor residues at both ends of Anchor residues distributed along binding to MHC molecule peptide; generally hydrophobic the length of the peptide carboxyl-terminal anchor Nature of bound peptide Extended structure in which both ends Ext ended structure that is held interact with MHC cleft but middle at a constant elevation abovearches up away from MHC molecule the floor of MHC cleft (a) Class I MHC (b) Class II MHC FIGURE 7-10MHC class I and class II molecules with bound pep- tides.

CLASS I MHC-PEPTIDE INTERACTION Class I MHC molecules bind peptides and present them toCD8 /H11001T cells. In general, these peptides are derived from en- dogenous intracellular proteins that are digested in the cy-tosol. The peptides are then transported from the cytosolinto the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, where theyinteract with class I MHC molecules. This process, known asthe cytosolic or endogenous processing pathway, is discussedin detail in the next chapter. Each type of class I MHC molecule (K, D, and L in mice or A, B, and C in humans) binds a unique set of peptides. Inaddition, each allelic variant of a class I MHC molecule (e.g.,H-2K kand H-2Kd) also binds a distinct set of peptides. Be- cause a single nucleated cell expresses about 105copies of each class I molecule, many different peptides will be ex-pressed simultaneously on the surface of a nucleated cell byclass I MHC = glutamic acid F = phenylalanine G = glycine H = histidine I = isoleucineK = lysine L = leucine N = asparagine P = proline Q = glutamineR = arginine S = serine T = threonine V = valine Y = tyrosine FIGURE 7-11Examples of anchor residues (blue) in nonameric peptides eluted from two class I MHC molecules. Anchor residuesthat interact with the class I MHC molecule tend to be hydropho bic amino acids. [Data from V. H. Engelhard, 1994,Curr. Opin. Immunol. 6:13.]In a critical study of peptide by MHC molecules, peptides bound by two allelic variants of a class I MHC mol-ecule were released chemically and analyzed by HPLC massspectrometry. More than 2000 distinct peptides were foundamong the peptide ligands released from these two class IMHC molecules. Since there are approximately 10 5copies of each class I allelic variant per cell, it is estimated that each of the 2000 distinct peptides is presented with a frequency of100-4000 copies per cell. Evidence suggests that as few as100 peptide-MHC complexes are sufficient to target a cellfor recognition and lysis by a cytotoxic T lymphocyte with areceptor specific for this target structure. The bound peptides isolated from different class I mole- cules have been found to have two distinguishing features:they are eight to ten amino acids in length, most commonlynine, and they contain specific amino acid residues that ap-pear to be essential for binding to a particular MHC mole-cule. Binding studies have shown that nonameric peptidesbind to class I molecules with a 100- to 1000-fold higheraffinity than do peptides that are either longer or shorter,suggesting that this peptide length is most compatible withthe closed-ended peptide-binding cleft in class I molecules.The ability of an individual class I MHC molecule to bind toa diverse spectrum of peptides is due to the presence of thesame or similar amino acid residues at several defined posi-tions along the peptides (Figure 7-11). Because these aminoacid residues anchor the peptide into the groove of theMHC molecule, they are called anchor residues. The side chains of the anchor residues in the peptide are comple-mentary with surface features of the binding cleft of theclass I MHC molecule. The amino acid residues lining thebinding sites vary among different class I allelic variants anddetermine the identity of the anchor residues that can inter- act with the molecule. All peptides examined to date that bind to class I mole- cules contain a carboxyl-terminal anchor. These anchors aregenerally hydrophobic residues (e.g., leucine, isoleucine), al-though a few charged amino acids have been reported. Be-sides the anchor residue found at the carboxyl terminus,another anchor is often found at the second or second andthird positions at the amino-terminal end of the peptide (seeFigure 7-11). In general, any peptide of correct length thatcontains the same or similar anchor residues will bind to thesame class I MHC molecule. The discovery of conserved an-chor residues in peptides that bind to various class I MHCmolecules may permit prediction of which peptides in acomplex antigen will bind to a particular MHC molecule,based on the presence or absence of these motifs. X-ray crystallographic analyses of peptide-class I MHC complexes have revealed how the peptide-binding cleft in agiven MHC molecule can interact stably with a broad spec-trum of different peptides. The anchor residues at both endsof the peptide are buried within the binding cleft, therebyholding the peptide firmly in place (Figure 7-12). As noted al-ready, nonameric peptides are bound preferentially; the maincontacts between class I MHC molecules and peptides in-volve residue 2 at the amino-terminal end and residue 9 at thecarboxyl terminus of the nonameric peptide. Between the an-chors the peptide arches away from the floor of the cleft in themiddle (Figure 7-13), allowing peptides that are slightlylonger or shorter to be accommodated. Amino acids that archaway from the MHC molecule are more exposed and pre-sumably can interact more directly with the T-cell receptor. CLASS II MHC-PEPTIDE INTERACTION Class II MHC molecules bind peptides and present thesepeptides to CD4 /H11001T cells. Like class I molecules, molecules of class II can bind a variety of peptides. In general, these pep-tides are derived from exogenous proteins (either self ornonself), which are degraded within the endocytic process-ing pathway (see Chapter 8). Most of the peptides associatedwith class II MHC molecules are derived from membrane-bound proteins or proteins associated with the vesicles of theendocytic processing pathway. The membrane-bound pro-teins presumably are internalized by phagocytosis or by receptor-mediated endocytosis and enter the endocytic pro-cessing pathway at this point. For instance, peptides derivedfrom digestion of membrane-bound class I MHC moleculesoften are bound to class II MHC molecules. Peptides recovered from class II MHC-peptide com- plexes generally contain 13-18 amino acid residues, some-what longer than the nonameric peptides that mostcommonly bind to class I molecules. The peptide-bindingcleft in class II molecules is open at both ends (see Figure 7-10b), allowing longer peptides to extend beyond the ends,like a long hot dog in a bun. Peptides bound to class II MHCmolecules maintain a roughly constant elevation on the8536d_ch07_161-184 8/16/02 1:49 PM Page 171 mac100 mac al. / Immunology 5e-:In addition, over 30% of the peptides eluted from class II mol- ecules contain a proline residue at position 2 and anothercluster of prolines at the carboxyl-terminal end. Class I and Class II Molecules Exhibit Diversity Within a Species and MultipleForms Occur in an Individual An enormous diversity is exhibited by the MHC molecules within a species and within individuals. This variabilityechoes the diversity of antibodies and T-cell receptors, butthe source of diversity for MHC molecules is not the same.Antibodies and T-cell receptors are generated by several so-matic processes, including gene rearrangement and somaticmutation of rearranged genes (see Table 5-2). Thus, the gen-eration of T and B cell receptors is dynamic, changing overtime within an individual. By contrast, the MHC moleculesexpressed by an individual are fixed in the genes and do notchange over time. The diversity of the MHC within a speciesstems from polymorphism, the presence of multiple alleles ata given genetic locus within the species. Diversity of MHCmolecules in an individual results not only from having dif-ferent alleles of each gene but also from the presence of du-plicated genes with similar or overlapping functions, notunlike the isotypes of immunoglobulins. Because it includesgenes with similar, but not identical structure and function(for example, HLA-A, -B, and -C), the MHC may be tobe polygenic. The MHC possesses an extraordinarily large number of different alleles at each locus and is one of the most poly-morphic genetic complexes known in higher vertebrates.These alleles differ in their DNA sequences from one indi-vidual to another by 5% to 10%. The number of amino aciddifferences between MHC alleles can be quite significant,with up to 20 amino acid residues contributing to theunique structural nature of each allele. Analysis of humanHLA class I genes has revealed, as of early 2002, approxi-mately 240 A alleles, 470 B alleles, and 110 C alleles. In mice,the polymorphism is similarly enormous. The human classII genes are also highly polymorphic and, in some cases,there are different gene numbers in different individuals.The number of HLA-DR beta-chain genes may vary from 2to 9 in different haplotypes, and approximately 350 alleles ofDRB genes have been reported. Interestingly, the DRA chainis highly conserved, with only 2 different alleles reported.Current estimates of actual polymorphism in the humanMHC are probably on the low side because the most detaileddata were obtained from populations of European descent.The fact that many non-European population groups can-not be typed using the MHC serologic typing reagents avail-able indicates that the worldwide diversity of the MHCgenes is far greater. Now that MHC genes can be sequenceddirectly, it is expected that many additional alleles will be detected. This enormous polymorphism results in a tremendous diversity of MHC molecules within a species. Using the num-bers given above for the allelic forms of human HLA-A, -B,172 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses floor of the binding cleft, another feature that distinguishespeptide binding to class I and class II molecules. Peptide binding studies and structural data for class II molecules indicate that a central core of 13 amino acids deter-mines the ability of a peptide to bind class II. Longer peptidesmay be accommodated within the class II cleft, but the bind-ing characteristics are determined by the central 13 residues.The peptides that bind to a particular class II molecule oftenhave internal conserved \"motifs,\" but unlike class I-bindingpeptides, they lack conserved anchor residues. Instead, hydro-gen bonds between the backbone of the peptide and the classII molecule are distributed throughout the binding site ratherthan being clustered predominantly at the ends of the site asfor class I-bound peptides. Peptides that bind to class II MHCmolecules contain an internal sequence comprising 7-10amino acids that provide the major contact points. Generally,this sequence has an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at theamino terminus and three additional hydrophobic residues inthe middle portion and carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide.

If class II loci are considered, the 5 DRBgenes B1 through B5 have 304, 1, 35, 11, and 15 alleles re-spectively, DQA1 and B1 contribute 22 and 49 alleles, respec-tively and, DPB1 96 alleles; this allows approximately 1.8 /H11003 10 11different class II combinations. Because each haplotype contains both class I and class II genes, the numbers are mul-tiplied to give a total of 2.25 /H1100310 18possible combinations of these class I and II alleles. LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM The calculation of theoretical diversity in the previous para-graph assumes completely random combinations of alleles.The actual diversity is known to be less, because certain alleli c combinations occur more frequently in HLA haplotypesthan predicted by random combination, a state referred to aslinkage disequilibrium. Briefly, linkage disequilibrium is the difference between the frequency observed for a particularcombination of alleles and that expected from the frequencies of the individual alleles. The expected frequency for the com-bination may be calculated by multiplying the frequencies ofthe two alleles. For example, if HLA-A1 occurs in 16% of in- dividuals in a population (frequency /H110050.16) and HLA-B8 in 9% of that group (frequency /H110050.09) it is expected that about 1.4% of the group should have both alleles (0.16 /H110030.09 /H11005 0.014). However, the data show that HLA-A1 and HLA-B8are found together in 8.8% of individuals studied. This dif-ference is a measure of the linkage disequilibrium betweenthese alleles of class I MHC genes. Several explanations have been advanced to explain link- age disequilibrium. The simplest is that too few generationshave elapsed to allow the number of crossovers necessary toreach equilibrium among the alleles present in founders ofthe population. The haplotypes that are over-represented inthe population today would then reflect the combinations ofalleles present in the founders. Alternatively, selective effectscould also result in the higher frequency of certain alleliccombinations. For example, certain combinations of allelesmight produce resistance to certain diseases, causing them tobe selected for and over-represented, or they might generateharmful effects, such as susceptibility to autoimmune disor-ders, and undergo negative selection. A third hypothesis isthat crossovers are more frequent in certain DNA sequenceregions, and the presence or absence of regions prone to crossover (hotspots) between alleles can dictate the Major Histocompatibility Complex CHAPTER 7 173 14 5 678 923Bulge N C Hydrogen bonds with MHC molecule(a) 1 234 56 78 9(b) (c) FIGURE 7-13Conformation of peptides bound to class I MHC molecules.

Data in support of this was found in mouse breeding studies that generated new recom-binant H-2 types. The points of crossover in the new MHChaplotypes were not randomly distributed throughout thecomplex. Instead, the same regions of crossover were foundin more than one recombinant haplotype. This suggests thathotspots of recombination do exist that would influencelinkage disequilibrium in populations. Despite linkage disequilibrium, there is still enormous poly- morphism in the human MHC, and it remains very difficult tomatch donor and acceptor MHC types for successful organtransplants. The consequences of this major obstacle to thetherapeutic use of transplantation are described in Chapter 21. FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE OF MHC POLYMORPHISM Sequence divergence among alleles of the MHC within aspecies is very high, as great as the divergence observed forthe genes encoding some enzymes across species. Also of in-terest is that the sequence variation among MHC moleculesis not randomly distributed along the entire polypeptidechain but instead is clustered in short stretches, largelywithin the membrane-distal /H92511 and /H92512 domains of class Imolecules (Figure 7-14a). Similar patterns of diversity are observed in the /H92511 and /H92522 domains of class II molecules. Progress has been made in locating the polymorphic residues within the three-dimensional structure of the mem-brane-distal domains in class I and class II MHC moleculesand in relating allelic differences to functional differences(Figure 7-14b). For example, of 17 amino acids previouslyshown to display significant polymorphism in the HLA-A2molecule, 15 were shown by x-ray crystallographic analysis tobe in the peptide-binding cleft of this molecule. The locationof so many polymorphic amino acids within the binding sitefor processed antigen strongly suggests that allelic difference s contribute to the observed differences in the ability of MHCmolecules to interact with a given antigenic peptide.

I n the mouse, there are nonclassical genes located downstream from Tla that a re not shown. with genes, most of which have known functions. Our cur- rent understanding of the genomic organization of mouseand human MHC genes is diagrammed in Figure 7-15. The Human Class I Region Spans about 2000 kb at the Telomeric End of the HLA Complex In humans, the class I MHC region is about 2000 kb long and contains approximately 20 genes. In mice, the class IMHC consists of two regions separated by the interveningclass II and class III regions. Included within the class I re-gion are the genes encoding the well-characterized classicalclass I MHC designated and mice.Many nonclassical class I genes, identified by molecularmapping, also are present in both the mouse and human MHC. In mice, the nonclassical class I genes are located inthree regions ( H-2Q, T, and M) downstream from the H-2 complex ( Mis not shown in Figure 7-15). In humans, the nonclassical class I genes HLA-F, HLA-G, HFE, HLA-J, and HLA-X loci as well as a recently discovered family of genes called MIC, which includes MICA through MICE . Some of the nonclassical class I MHC genes are pseudogenes and do not encode a protein product, but oth-ers, such as HLA-G and HFE, encode class I-like products with highly specialized functions. The MIC family of class Igenes has only 15%-30% sequence identity to classical classI, and those designated as MICA are highly polymorphic.The MIC gene products are expressed at low levels in epithe-lial cells and are induced by heat or other stimuli that influ-ence heat shock proteins.8536d_ch07_161-184 8/16/02 12:09 PM Page 100: 1268_tm:8536d:Goldsby al. / Immunology 5e-:176 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses The functions of the nonclassical class I MHC molecules remain largely unknown, although a few studies suggest thatsome of these molecules, like the classical class I MHC mol-ecules, may present peptides to T cells. One intriguing find-ing is that the mouse molecule encoded by the H-2M locus is able to bind a self-peptide derived from a subunit of NADHdehydrogenase, an enzyme encoded by the mitochondrialgenome. This particular self-peptide contains an amino-terminal formylated methionine. What is interesting aboutthis finding is that derived from prokaryotic organ-isms often have formylated amino-terminal methionineresidues. This H-2M -encoded class I molecule may thus be uniquely suited to present peptides from prokaryotic organ-isms that are able to grow Salmonella typhimurium . Up to this point, all description of antigen presentation by class I and class II molecules has been confined to presen-tation of peptide antigens. As will be seen in the descriptionof antigen presentation (Chapter 8), there are also moleculeswith structural similarity to class I molecules that presentnon-peptide antigens, such as glycolipids, to T cells. A majorfamily of such molecules, designated CD1, has been shownto present lipid antigens derived from bacteria. The CD1molecules are not encoded within the MHC but are locatedon chromosome 1. The Class II MHC Genes Are Located at the Centromeric End of HLA The class II MHC region contains the genes encoding the /H9251 and /H9252chains of the classical class and H-2IA and -IEin mice. Molecular mapping of the class II MHC has re-vealed multiple /H9252-chain genes in some regions in both mice and humans, as well as multiple /H9251-chain genes in humans (see Figure 7-15). In the human DR region, for example,there are three or four functional /H9252-chain genes. All of the /H9252- chain gene products can be expressed together with the /H9251- chain gene product in a given cell, thereby increasing thenumber of different antigen-presenting molecules on thecell. Although the human DR region contains just one /H9251- chain gene, the DP and DQ regions each contains two. Genes encoding nonclassical class II MHC molecules have also been identified in both humans and mice. In mice,several class II genes ( O/H9251,O/H9252,M/H9251,and M/H9252) encode non- classical MHC molecules that exhibit limited polymorphismand a different pattern of expression than the classical IAand IE class II molecules. In the human class II region, non-classical genes designated DM and DOhave been identified. The DM genes encode a class II-like molecule (HLA-DM) that facilitates the loading of antigenic peptides into the clas s II MHC molecules. Class II DO molecules, which are ex-pressed only in the thymus and mature B cells, have beenshown to serve as regulators of class II antigen processing.The functions of HLA-DM and HLA-DO will be describedfurther in Chapter 8.Human MHC Class III Genes Are Between Class I and II The class III region of the MHC in humans and mice con- tains a heterogeneous collection of genes (see Figure 7-15).These genes encode several complement components, twosteroid and twocytokines Some of these class III MHC gene products play a role in certain diseases. For example,mutations in the genes encoding 21-hydroxylase have beenlinked to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Interestingly, thepresence of a linked class III gene cluster is conserved in allspecies with an MHC region. Cellular Distribution of MHC Molecules In general, the classical class I MHC molecules are expressed on most nucleated cells, but the level of expression differsamong different cell types. The highest levels of class I mole-cules are expressed by lymphocytes, where they constituteapproximately 1% of the total plasma-membrane proteins,or some 5 /H1100310 5molecules per cell. In contrast, fibroblasts, muscle cells, liver hepatocytes, and neural cells express verylow levels of class I MHC molecules. The low level on livercells may contribute to the considerable success of livertransplants by reducing the likelihood of graft recognitionby T cof the recipient. A few cell types (e.g., neurons and sperm cells at certain stages of differentiation) appear to lackclass I MHC molecules altogether. As noted earlier, any particular MHC molecule can bind many different peptides. Since the MHC alleles are codomi-nantly expressed, a heterozygous individual expresses on itscells the gene products encoded by both alleles at each MHClocus. An F 1mouse, for example, expresses the K, D, and L from each parent (six different class I MHC molecules) oneach of its nucleated cells (Figure 7-16). A similar situationoccurs in humans; that is, a heterozygous individual ex-presses the A, B, and C alleles from each parent (six differentclass I MHC molecules) on the membrane of each nucleatedcell. The expression of so many class I MHC molecules al-lows each cell to display a large number of peptides in thepeptide-binding clefts of its MHC molecules. In normal, healthy cells, the class I molecules will display self-peptides resulting from normal turnover of self pro-teins. In cells infected by a virus, viral peptides, as well as se lf- peptides, will be displayed. A single virus-infected cellshould be envisioned as having various class I molecules onits membrane, each displaying different sets of viral pep-tides. Because of individual allelic differences in the peptide-binding clefts of the class I MHC molecules, differentindividuals within a species will have the ability to bind dif-ferent sets of viral peptides. Unlike class I MHC molecules, class II molecules are ex- pressed constitutively only by antigen-presenting cells, pri-8536d_ch07_161-184 cells, and B cells; thymic epithelial cells and some other cell types can be induced toexpress class II molecules and to function as antigen-pre-senting cells under certain conditions and under stimulationof some cytokines (see Chapter 8). Among the various celltypes that express class II MHC molecules, marked differ-ences in expression have been observed. In some cases, classII expression depends on the cell's differentiation stage. Forexample, class II molecules cannot be detected on pre-B cellsbut are expressed constitutively on the membrane of matureB cells. Similarly, monocytes and macrophages express onlylow levels of class II molecules until they are activated by in-teraction with an antigen, after which the level of expressionincreases significantly. Because each of the classical class II MHC molecules is composed of two different polypeptide chains, which are en-coded by different loci, a heterozygous individual expressesnot only the parental class II molecules but also moleculescontaining /H9251and /H9252chains from different chromosomes. For cules. The F 1progeny resulting from crosses of mice with these two haplotypes express four parental class II moleculesand four molecules containing one parent's /H9251chain and the other parent's /H9252chain (as shown in Figure 7-16). Since the human MHC contains three classical class II genes ( DP, DQ, and DR), a heterozygous individual expresses six parental class II molecules and six molecules containing /H9251and /H9252chaincombinations from either parent. The number of different class II molecules expressed by an individual is increased fur-ther by the presence of multiple /H9252-chain genes in mice and humans, and in humans by multiple /H9251-chain genes. The di- versity generated by these mechanisms presumably increasesthe number of different antigenic peptides that can be pre-sented and thus is advantageous to the organism. Regulation of MHC Expression Research on the regulatory mechanisms that control the dif-ferential expression of MHC genes in different cell types isstill in its infancy, but much has been learned. The publica-tion of the complete genomic map of the MHC complex isexpected to greatly accelerate the identification and investi-gation of coding and regulatory sequences, leading to newdirections in research on how the system is controlled. Both class I and class II MHC genes are flanked by 5 /H11032pro- moter sequences, which bind sequence-specific transcrip-tion factors. The promoter motifs and transcription factorsthat bind to these motifs have been identified for a numberof MHC genes. Transcriptional regulation of the MHC ismediated by both positive and negative elements. For exam-ple, an MHC II transactivator, called CIITA, and another transcription factor, called RFX, both have been shown to bind to the promoter region of class II MHC genes. Defectsin these transcription factors cause one form of bare lym- phocyte syndrome (see the Clinical Focus box in Chapter 8). Patients with this disorder lack class II MHC molecules ontheir cells and as a result suffer a severe immunodeficiencydue to the central role of class II MHC molecules in T-cellmaturation and activation. The expression of MHC molecules is also regulated by various cytokines. The interferons (alpha, beta, and gamma)and tumor necrosis factor have each been shown to increaseexpression of class I MHC molecules on cells. Interferongamma (IFN- /H9253), for example, appears to induce the forma- tion of a specific transcription factor that binds to the pro-moter sequence flanking the class I MHC genes. Binding ofthis transcription factor to the promoter sequence appearsto coordinate the up-regulation of transcription of the genesencoding the I /H9251chain, /H9252 2-microglobulin, subunits (TAP).IFN- /H9253also has been shown to induce expression of the class II transactivator (CIITA), thereby indirectly increasing ex-pression of class II MHC molecules on a variety of cells, in-cluding non-antigen-presenting cells (e.g., skin keratin-ocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, vascular cells, and pancreatic beta cells). Other cytokines MHC expression only in certain cell types; for example,IL-4 increases expression of class II molecules by resting Bcells. Expression of class II molecules by B cells is down-reg-ulated by IFN- /H9253; corticosteroids and prostaglandins also de- crease expression of class II molecules.

In some cases, re- duced expression of class I MHC molecules on cell surfacesis due to decreased levels of a component needed for peptidetransport or MHC class I assembly rather than in transcrip-tion. In cytomegalovirus infection, for example, a viral pro-tein binds to /H9252 2-microglobulin, preventing assembly of class I MHC molecules and their transport to the plasma mem-brane. Adenovirus 12 infection causes a pronounced de-crease in transcription of the transporter genes ( TAP1 and TAP2 ). As the next chapter describes, the TAP gene products play an important role in peptide transport from the cyto-plasm into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Blocking ofTAP gene expression inhibits peptide transport; as a result, class I MHC molecules cannot assemble with /H9252 2-microglob- ulin or be transported to the cell membrane. Decreased ex-pression of class I MHC molecules, by whatever mechanism,is likely to help viruses evade the immune response by re-ducing the likelihood that virus-infected cells can displayMHC-viral peptide complexes and become targets for CTL-mediated destruction. MHC and Immune Responsiveness Early studies by B. Benacerraf in which guinea pigs were im-munized with simple synthetic antigens were the first toshow that the ability of an animal to mount an immune re-sponse, as measured by the production of serum antibodies, is determined by its MHC haplotype. Later experiments byH. McDevitt, M. Sela, and their colleagues used congenic andrecombinant congenic mouse strains to map the control ofimmune responsiveness to class II MHC genes. In early re- ports, the genes responsible for this phenotype were desig-nated Iror immune response genes, and for this reason mouse class II products are called IA and IE. We now knowthat the dependence of immune responsiveness on the classII MHC reflects the central role of class II MHC molecules inpresenting antigen to T Hcells. Two explanations have been proposed to account for the variability in immune responsiveness observed among dif-ferent haplotypes. According to the determinant-selection model, different class II MHC molecules differ in their abil- ity to bind processed antigen. According to the alternativeholes-in-the-repertoire model, T cells bearing receptors that recognize foreign antigens closely resembling self-antigensmay be eliminated during thymic processing. Since the T-cell response to an antigen involves a trimolecular complexof the T cell's receptor, an antigenic peptide, and an MHCmolecule (see Figure 3-8), both models may be correct.That is, the absence of an MHC molecule that can bind andpresent a given peptide, or the absence of T-cell receptorsthat can recognize a given peptide-MHC molecule com-plex, could result in the absence of immune responsivenessand so account for the observed relationship between TABLE 7-3Differential binding of peptides to mouse class II MHC molecule s and correlation with MHC restriction PERCENTAGE OF LABELED PEPTIDE BOUND TO MHC peptide * of /H9261repressor ( 12-26)\u00a7IAd/H11001IEk1.6 0.32 .3 *Amino acid residues included in each peptide are indicated by t he numbers in parentheses.

Immunology 5e-:Major Histocompatibility Complex CHAPTER 179 MHC haplotype and immune responsiveness to exogenous antigens. According to the determinant-selection model, the MHC polymorphism within a species will generate a diversity ofbinding specificities, and thus different patterns of respon-siveness to antigens. If this model is correct, then class IIMHC molecules from mouse strains that respond to a par-ticular antigen and those that do not should show differen-tial binding of that antigen. Table 7-3 presents data on thebinding of various radiolabeled peptides to class II IA and IEmolecules with the H-2 dor H-2khaplotype. Each of the listed peptides binds significantly to only one of the IA or IEmolecules. Furthermore, in all but one case, the haplotype ofthe class II molecule showing the highest affinity for a par-ticular peptide is the same as the haplotype of responderstrains for that peptide, as the determinant-selection modelpredicts. The single exception to the general pattern in Table 7-3 (residues 12-26 of the /H9261repressor protein) gives evidence that the influence on immune responsiveness can also becaused by absence of functional T cells (holes-in-the-reper-toire model) capable of recognizing a given antigen-MHCmolecule complex. The /H9261repressor peptide binds best in vitro to IE d, yet the MHC restriction for response to this pep-tide is known to be associated not with IEdbut instead with IAdand IEk. This suggests that T cells recognizing this re- pressor peptide in association with IEdmay have been elim- inated by negative selection in the thymus, leaving a hole inthe T-cell repertoire. MHC and Disease Susceptibility Some HLA alleles occur at a much higher frequency in thosesuffering from certain diseases than in the general popula-tion. The diseases associated with particular MHC alleles include autoimmune disorders, certain viral diseases,disorders of the complement system, some neurologic disor-ders, and several different allergies. The association betweenHLA alleles and a given disease may be quantified by deter-mining the frequency of the HLA alleles expressed by indi-viduals afflicted with the disease, then comparing these datawith the frequency of the same alleles in the general popula-tion. Such a comparison allows calculation of relative risk (see Table 7-4). A relative risk value of 1 means that the HLAallele is expressed with the same frequency in the patient andgeneral populations, indicating that the allele confers no in-creased risk for the disease. A relative risk value substantiall y TABLE 7-4Some significant associations of HLA alleles with increased ris k for various diseases Disease Associated HLA allele Relative risk * Ankylosing diabetes Systemic lupus erythematosus DR3 5 *Relative risk is calculated by dividing the frequency of the HL A allele in the patient population by the frequency in the gene ral population: (Ag/H11001/Ag/H11002) disease RR /H11005 (Ag/H11001/Ag/H11002) control SOURCE: Data from SAM CD: A Comprehensive Knowledge Base of Internal Medicine, D.

As Table 7-4 shows, individuals with the HLA-B27 allele have a 90 times greater likelihood (relative risk of90) of developing the autoimmune disease ankylosingspondylitis, an inflammatory disease of vertebral jointscharacterized by destruction of cartilage, than do individu-als with a different HLA-B allele. The existence of an association between an MHC allele and a disease should not be interpreted to imply that the ex-pression of the allele has caused the disease\u2014the relationshipbetween MHC alleles and development of disease is complex.In the case of ankylosing spondylitis, for example, it has beensuggested that because of the close linkage of the TNF- /H9252genes with the HLA-B locus, these cytokines may be involved in the destruction of cartilage. An association ofHLA class I genes with the disease hereditary hemochro-matosis is discussed in the Clinical Focus box in this chapter. When the associations between MHC alleles and disease are weak, reflected by low relative risk values, it is likely tha t multiple genes influence susceptibility, of which only one isin the MHC. That these diseases are not inherited by simple Mendelian segregation of MHC alleles can be seen in identi-cal twins; both inherit the MHC risk factor, but it is by nomeans certain that both will develop the disease. This find-ing suggests that multiple genetic and environmental factorshave roles in the development of disease, especially autoim-mune diseases, with the MHC playing an important but notexclusive role. An additional difficulty in associating a par-ticular MHC product with disease is the genetic phenome-non of linkage disequilibrium, which was described above.The fact that some of the class I MHC alleles are in linkagedisequilibrium with the class II MHC alleles makes theircontribution to disease susceptibility appear more pro-nounced than it actually is. If, for example, DR4 contributesto risk of a disease, and if it occurs frequently in combinationwith A3 because of linkage disequilibrium, then A3 wouldincorrectly appear to be associated with the disease. Im-proved genomic mapping techniques make it possible to an-alyze the linkage between the MHC and various diseasesmore fully and to assess the contributions from other loci.milligrams per day; of this, only 1to 2mg is absorbed. The iron balance is main-tained by control of its absorption from di-gested food in the intestinal tract. Theprimary defect in HH is increased gas-trointestinal uptake of iron and, as a resultof this, patients with HH may throughouttheir lives accumulate 15to 35grams ofiron instead of the normal 3to 4grams. The iron overload results in pathologic ac-cumulation of iron in cells of many or-gans, including the heart and liver.Although a severe form of HH may resultin heart disease in children, the clinicalmanifestations of the disease are not usu-ally seen until 40to 50years of age.

HH (which in earlier reports may bereferred to as idiopathic or primary he- mochromatosis) is the most commonknown autosomal recessive genetic dis-order in North Americans of Europeandescent, with a frequency of 3-4cases per 1000 persons. Recent studies show that this disease is associated with a mu-tation in the nonclassical class I geneHFE (formerly designated HLA-H ), which lies to the telomeric side of HLA-A. The association of the HFE gene with HH is an example of how potentially life-saving clinical information can be ob-tained by studying the connection ofHLA genes with disease. The total iron content of a normal hu- man adult is 3to 4grams; the average di- etary intake of iron is about 10to 20CLINICAL FOCUS HFE and Hereditary Hemochromatosis High-magnification iron stain of liver cells from HH patient.

Further studies showed a greatly in-creased relative risk in individuals withthe combination of HLA-A3 and HLA- B14;homozygotes for these two alleles carried a relative risk for HH of 90. De- tailed studies of several populations inthe US and France with high incidence ofHH revealed a mutation in the nonclassi-cal HLA class I gene HFE in 83%-100% of patients with HH. HFE, which lies close to the HLA-A locus, was shown in several independent studies to carry acharacteristic mutation at position 283in HH patients, with substitution of a tyro-sine residue for the cysteine normallyfound at this position. The substitutionprecludes formation of the disulfide linkbetween cysteines in the /H92513domain, which is necessary for association of theMHC /H9251chain with /H9252 2-microglobulin and for expression on the cell surface. HFEmolecules are normally expressed on thesurface of cells in the stomach, in-testines, and liver. There is evidenceshowing that HFE plays a role in the abil-ity of these organs to regulate iron uptake from the circulation. The mechanism bywhich HFE functions involves binding tothe transferrin receptor, which reducesthe affinity of the receptor for iron-loadedtransferrin. This lowers the uptake of ironby the cell. Mutations that interfere withthe ability of HFE to form a complex withtransferrin and its receptor can lead to in-creased iron absorption and HH. There are several possible reasons for why this defect continues to be so com-mon in our population. Factors that favorthe spread of the defective HFE gene would include the fact that it is a reces-sive trait, so only homozygotes are af-fected; the gene is silent in carriers. Inaddition, even in most homozygotes af-fected with HH, the disease does notmanifest itself until later in life and somay have minimal influence on thebreeding success of the HH sufferer. Studies of knockout mice that lack the gene for /H9252 2-microglobulin demon- strate that MHC class I products on cellsurfaces are necessary for the mainte-nance of normal iron metabolism. Thesemice, which are unable to express any oftheir class I molecules on the cell sur-faces, suffer from iron overload with dis-ease consequences similar to HH.larged spleen, jaundice, and peripheral edema. If untreated, HH results in hepaticcancer, liver failure, severe diabetes, andheart disease. Exactly how the increase iniron content results in these diseases isnot known, but repeated phlebotomy (tak-ing blood) is an effective treatment if thedisease is recognized before there is ex-tensive damage to organs. Phlebotomydoes not reverse damage already done.Phlebotomy (also called blood-letting)was used as treatment for many condi-tions in former times; HH may be one ofthe rare instances in which the treatmenthad a positive rather than a harmful effecton the patient. Prior to appearance of the recognized signs of the disease, such as the charac-teristic skin pigmentation or liver dys-function, diagnosis is difficult unless forsome reason (such as family history ofthe disease) HH is suspected and spe-cific tests for iron metabolism are per-formed. A reliable genetic test for HHwould allow treatment to commenceprior to disease manifestation and irre-versible organ damage. Because it is a common disease, the association of HH with HLA was studied;initially a significant association with theHLA-A3 allele was found (RR of 9.3). This FIGURE 7-17 Cheetah female with two nearly full grown cubs. Polymorphism in MHC genes of the cheetah is very limited, presu m- ably because of a bottleneck in breeding that occurred in the n ot too distant past. It is assumed that all cheetahs alive today are d escen- dants of a very small breeding pool. [ Photograph taken in the Oka- vango Delta, Botswana, by T. J. Kindt. ]A number of hypotheses have been offered to account for the role of the MHC in disease susceptibility. As noted ear-lier, allelic differences may yield differences in immune re-sponsiveness arising from variation in the ability to presentprocessed antigen or the ability of T cells to recognize pre-sented antigen. Allelic forms of MHC genes may also encodemolecules that are recognized as receptors by viruses or bac-terial toxins. As will be explained in Chapter 16, the geneticanalysis of disease must consider the possibility that genes atmultiple loci may be involved and that complex interactionsamong them may be needed to trigger disease. Some evidence suggests that a reduction in MHC poly- morphism within a species may predispose that species toinfectious disease. Cheetahs and certain other wild cats, suchas Florida panthers, that have been shown to be highly sus-ceptible to viral disease have very limited MHC polymor-phism. It is postulated that the present cheetah population(Figure 7-17) arose from a limited breeding stock, causing aloss of MHC diversity. The increased susceptibility of chee-tahs to various viral diseases may result from a reduction in8536d_ch07_161-184 9/6/02 11:40 AM Page 181 mac48 Mac 48: 4 20_kec:182 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses the number of different MHC molecules available to the species as a whole and a corresponding limitation on therange of processed antigens with which these MHC mole-cules can interact. Thus, the high level of MHC polymor-phism that has been observed in various species may providethe advantage of a broad range of antigen-presenting MHCmolecules. Although some individuals within a speciesprobably will not be able to develop an immune response toany given pathogen and therefore will be susceptible to in-fection by it, extreme polymorphism ensures that at leastsome members of a species will be able to respond and willbe resistant. In this way, MHC diversity appears to protect aspecies from a wide range of infectious diseases. SUMMARY IThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) comprisesa stretch of tightly linked genes that encode proteins asso-ciated with intercellular recognition and antigen presenta-tion to T lymphocytes. IA group of linked MHC genes is generally inherited as aunit from parents; these linked groups are called haplo-types. IMHC genes are polymorphic in that there are large num-bers of alleles for each gene, and they are polygenic in thatthere are a number of different MHC genes. IClass I MHC molecules consist of a large glycoproteinchain with 3 extracellular domains and a transmembranesegment, and /H9252 2-microglobulin, a protein with a single domain. IClass II MHC molecules are composed of two noncova-lently associated glycoproteins, the /H9251and /H9252chain, en- coded by separate genes. IX-ray crystallographic analyses reveal peptide-bindingclefts in the membrane-distal regions of both class I andclass II MHC molecules. IBoth class I and class II MHC molecules present antigen toT cells. Class I molecules present processed endogenousantigen to CD8 T cells. Class II molecules present pro-cessed exogenous antigen to CD4 T cells. ICertain conserved motifs in peptides influence their abil-ity to interact with the membrane-distal regions of class Iand class II MHC molecules. IClass I molecules are expressed on most nucleated cells;class II antigens are restricted to B cells, macrophages, anddendritic cells. IThe class III region of the MHC encodes molecules thatinclude a diverse group of proteins that play no role inantigen presentation. IDetailed maps of the human and mouse MHC reveal thepresence of genes involved in antigen processing, includ-ing proteasomes and transporters.IStudies with mouse strains have shown that MHC haplo-type influences immune responsiveness and the ability topresent antigen. IIncreased susceptibility to a number of diseases, predomi-nantly, but not exclusively, of an autoimmune nature, hasbeen linked to certain MHC alleles. References Brown, J. H., et al. 1993.

Subsequently, congenic and recombinant congenic strains of mice, which differedfrom each other only in selected regions of the H-2 complex,were used as the source of macrophages and T cells. These ex-periments confirmed that the CD4 /H11001THcell is activated and proliferates only in the presence of antigen-pulsedmacrophages that share class II MHC alleles. Thus, antigenrecognition by the CD4 /H11001THcell is class II MHC restricted. In 1974 R. Zinkernagel and P . Doherty demonstrated the self-MHC restriction of CD8/H11001T cells. In their experiments, mice were immunized with lymphocytic choriomeningitis(LCM) virus; several days later, the animals' spleen cells,which included T Ccells specific for the virus, were isolated and incubated with LCM-infected target cells of the same ordifferent haplotype (Figure 8-2). They found that the T Ccells killed only syngeneic virus-infected target cells. Later studieswith congenic and recombinant congenic strains showedISelf-MHC Restriction of T Cells IRole of Antigen-Presenting Cells IEvidence for Two Processing of Nonpeptide AntigensAntigen Processing and Presentation R a T cell requires that peptides derived from theantigen be displayed within the cleft of an MHC molecule on the membrane of a cell. The formation of thesepeptide-MHC complexes requires that a protein antigen bedegraded into peptides by a sequence of events called anti- gen processing. The degraded peptides then associate with MHC molecules within the cell interior, and the peptide-MHC complexes are transported to the membrane, wherethey are displayed ( antigen presentation ). Class I and class II MHC molecules associate with pep- tides that have been processed in different intracellular com-partments. Class I MHC molecules bind peptides derivedfrom endogenous antigens that have been processed within the cytoplasm of the cell (e.g., normal cellular proteins, tu-mor proteins, or viral and bacterial proteins producedwithin infected cells). Class II MHC molecules bind peptidesderived from exogenous antigens that are internalized by phagocytosis or endocytosis and processed within the endo-cytic pathway. This chapter examines in more detail themechanism of antigen processing and the means by whichprocessed antigen and MHC molecules are combined. In ad-dition, a third pathway for the presentation of nonpeptideantigens derived from bacterial pathogens is described. Self-MHC Restriction of T Cells Both CD4/H11001and CD8/H11001T cells can recognize antigen only when it is presented by a self-MHC molecule, an attribute called self- MHC restriction. Beginning in the mid-1970s, experiments conducted by a number of researchers demonstrated self-MHC restriction in T-cell recognition. A. Rosenthal and E.Shevach, for example, showed that antigen-specific prolifera-tion of T Hcells occurred only in response to antigen presented by macrophages of the same MHC haplotype as the T cells. Intheir experimental system, guinea pig macrophages fromstrain 2 were initially incubated with an antigen. After the\"antigen-pulsed\" macrophages had processed the antigen andpresented it on their surface, they were mixed with T cells fromthe same strain (strain 2), a different strain (strain 13), or (2/H1100313) F 1animals, and the magnitude of T-cell proliferation in response to the antigen-pulsed macrophages was measured.Antigen Processing for Presentation by Class I 8/22/02 11:49 AM Page al. / Immunology 5e-:restricted. In 1996, Doherty and Zinkernagel were awarded the Nobel prize for their major contribution to the under-standing of cell-mediated immunity. Role of Antigen-Presenting Cells As early as 1959, immunologists were confronted with datasuggesting that T cells and B cells recognized antigen by dif-ferent mechanisms. The dogma of the time, which persisteduntil the 1980s, was that cells of the immune system recog-nize the entire protein in its native conformation. However,experiments by P . G. H. Gell and B. Benacerraf demonstratedthat, while a primary antibody response and cell-mediatedresponse were induced by a protein in its native conforma-tion, a secondary antibody response (mediated by B cells)could be induced only by native antigen, whereas a secondary186 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses Antigen-pulsed macrophagesAntigen-primed T cell Strain 2 Strain 13 \u00d7 13)F1 Strain 2 Strain 13(2 \u00d7 13)F 1+ or (2 \u00d7 13)F 1Strain 2 or 13 or (2 \u00d7 Peritoneal macrophagesAdherent of self-MHC restriction of THcells.

These findings wereviewed as an interesting enigma, but implications for antigenpresentation were completely overlooked until the early1980s. Processing of Antigen Is Required for Recognition by T Cells The results obtained by K. Ziegler and E. R. Unanue were among those that contradicted the prevailing dogma thatantigen recognition by B and T cells was basically similar.These researchers observed that T H-cell activation by bacter- ial protein antigens was prevented by treating the antigen-presenting cells with paraformaldehyde prior to antigenexposure. However, if the antigen-presenting cells were firstallowed to ingest the antigen and were fixed with paraform-aldehyde 1-3 h later, T H-cell activation still occurred (Figure8-3a,b). During that interval of 1-3 h, the antigen-presenting cells had processed the antigen and had displayed it on themembrane in a form able to activate T cells. Subsequent experiments by R. P . Shimonkevitz showed that internalization and processing could be bypassed if anti-gen-presenting cells were exposed to peptide digests of anantigen instead of the native antigen (Figure 8-3c). In theseexperiments, antigen-presenting cells were treated with glu-taraldehyde (this chemical, like paraformaldehyde, fixes thecell, making the membrane impermeable) and then incu-bated with native ovalbumin or with ovalbumin that hadbeen subjected to partial enzymatic digestion. The digestedovalbumin was able to interact with the glutaraldehyde-fixedantigen-presenting cells, thereby activating ovalbumin-specific T Hcells, whereas the native ovalbumin failed to do so. These results suggest that antigen processing involves thedigestion of the protein into peptides that are recognized bythe ovalbumin-specific T Hcells.Antigen Processing and Presentation CHAPTER 8 187 FIGURE 8-3Experimental demonstration that antigen process- ing is necessary for T H-cell activation. (a) When antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are fixed before exposure to antigen, they are una ble to activate T Hcells. (b) In contrast, APCs fixed at least 1h after antigen exposure can activate T Hcells. (c) When APCs are fixedbefore antigen exposure and incubated with peptide digests of t he antigen (rather than native antigen), they also can activate T Hcells. TH-cell activation is determined by measuring a specific T H-cell response (e.g., cytokine secretion).T-CELL BW:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:At about the same time, A. T ownsend and his colleagues began to identify the proteins of influenza virus that wererecognized by T Ccells. Contrary to their expectations, they found that internal proteins of the virus, such as matrixand nucleocapsid proteins, were often recognized by T C cells better than the more exposed envelope proteins.Moreover, T ownsend's work revealed that T Ccells recog- nized short linear peptide sequences of the influenza pro-tein. In fact, when noninfected target cells were incubatedin vitro with synthetic peptides corresponding to se-quences of internal influenza proteins, these cells could berecognized by T Ccells and subsequently lysed just as well as target cells that had been infected with live influenzavirus. These findings along with those presented in Figure8-3 suggest that antigen processing is a metabolic processthat digests proteins into peptides, which can then be dis-played on the cell membrane together with a class I or classII MHC molecule. Most Cells Can Present Antigen with Class I MHC; Presentation with Class II MHC Is Restricted to APCs Since all cells expressing either class I or class II MHC mole- cules can present peptides to T cells, strictly speaking they al l could be designated as antigen-presenting cells. However, byconvention, cells that display peptides associated with class IMHC molecules to CD8 /H11001TCcells are referred to as target cells; cells that display peptides associated with class II MHC mole-cules to CD4 /H11001THcells are called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This convention is followed throughout this text. A variety of cells can function as antigen-presenting cells. Their distinguishing feature is their ability to express class II MHC molecules and to deliver a co-stimulatory signal. Threecell types are classified as professional antigen-presenting cells: dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. Thesecells differ from each other in their mechanisms of antigenuptake, in whether they constitutively express class II MHCmolecules, and in their co-stimulatory activity: IDendritic cells are the most effective of the antigen-presenting cells. Because these cells constitutively expressa high level of class II MHC molecules and co-stimulatory activity, they can activate naive T Hcells.IMacrophages must be activated by phagocytosis ofparticulate antigens before they express class II MHCmolecules or the co-stimulatory B7 membrane molecule. IB cells constitutively express class II MHC molecules butmust be activated before they express the co-stimulatoryB7 molecule. Several other cell types, classified as nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells, can be induced to express class IIMHC molecules or a co-stimulatory signal (Table 8-1).Many of these cells function in antigen presentation onlyfor short periods of time during a sustained inflammatoryresponse. Because nearly all nucleated cells express class I MHC molecules, virtually any nucleated cell is able to function as atarget cell presenting endogenous antigens to T Ccells. Most often, target cells are cells that have been infected by a virusor some other intracellular microorganism. However, alteredself-cells such as cancer cells, aging body cells, or allogeneiccells from a graft can also serve as targets. Evidence for Two Processing and Presentation Pathways The immune system uses two different pathways to eliminate intracellular and extracellular antigens. Endogenous anti-gens (those generated within the cell) are processed in the cy- tosolic pathway and presented on the membrane with class I MHC molecules; exogenous antigens (those taken up by en-docytosis) are processed in the endocytic pathway and pre- sented on the membrane with class II MHC molecules(Figure 8-4). Experiments carried out by L. A. Morrison and T. J. Braciale provided early evidence that the antigenic peptidespresented by class I and class II MHC molecules are derivedfrom different processing pathways. These researchers basedtheir experimental protocol on the properties of two clonesof T Ccells, one that recognized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) associated with a class I MHC molecule, and an atypical T Cline that recognized the same antigen associated with a class II MHC molecule. (In this case, and in some 188 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 8-1Antigen-presenting cells Professional antigen-presenting cells Nonprofessional antigen-pr cells Dendritic (skin) Thymic ial cells Macrophages Glial cells et al. / Immunology 5e-:others as well, the association of T-cell function with MHC restriction is not absolute). In one set of experiments, targetcells that expressed both class I and class II MHC moleculeswere incubated with infectious influenza virus or with UV-inactivated influenza virus. (The inactivated virus retainedits antigenic properties but was no longer capable of replicat-ing within the target cells.) The target cells were then incu-bated with the class I-restricted or the atypical class II-restricted T Ccells and subsequent lysis of the target cells was determined. The results of their experiments, presented inTable 8-2, show that the class II-restricted T Ccells responded to target cells treated with either infectious or noninfectiousinfluenza virions. The class I-restricted T Ccells respondedonly to target cells treated with infectious virions. Similarly, target cells that had been treated with infectious influenzavirions in the presence of emetine, which inhibits viral pro-tein synthesis, stimulated the class II-restricted T Ccells but not the class I-restricted T Ccells. Conversely, target cells that had been treated with infectious virions in the presence ofchloroquine, a drug that blocks the endocytic processingpathway, stimulated class I- but not class II-restricted T C cells. These results support the distinction between the process- ing of exogenous and endogenous antigens, including thepreferential association molecules and of endogenous antigens with class IAntigen Processing and Presentation CHAPTER 8 189 FIGURE 8-4Overview of cytosolic and endocytic pathways for processing antigen. The proteasome complex contains enzymesthat cleave peptide bonds, converting proteins into peptides. T he antigenic peptides from proteasome cleavage and those fromendocytic compartments associate with class I or class II MHCmolecules, and the peptide-MHC complexes are then transportedto the cell membrane. TAP ( transporter of antigenic peptides) transports the peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Association of viral antigen with class I MHC molecules required replication of the influenza virusand viral protein synthesis within the target cells; associationwith class II did not. These findings suggested that the pep-tides presented by class I and class II MHC molecules aretrafficked through separate intracellular compartments; classI MHC molecules interact with peptides derived from cy-tosolic degradation of endogenously synthesized proteins,class II molecules with peptides derived from endocyticdegradation of exogenous antigens. The next two sectionsexamine these two in detail. Endogenous Antigens: The Cytosolic Pathway In eukaryotic cells, protein levels are carefully regulated. Every protein is subject to continuous turnover and is de-graded at a rate that is generally expressed in terms of its hal f- life. Some proteins (e.g., transcription factors, cyclins, andkey metabolic enzymes) have very short half-lives; dena-tured, misfolded, or otherwise abnormal proteins also are de-graded rapidly. The pathway by which endogenous antigensare degraded for presentation with class I MHC moleculesutilizes the same pathways involved in the normal turnoverof intracellular proteins. Peptides for Presentation Are Generated by Protease Complexes Called Proteasomes Intracellular proteins are degraded into short peptides by a cy - tosolic proteolytic system present in all cells. Those proteinstargeted for proteolysis often have a small protein, called ubiquitin, attached to them (Figure 8-5a). Ubiquitin-protein conjugates can be degraded by a multifunctional proteasecomplex called a proteasome. Each proteasome is a large (26S), cylindrical particle consisting of four rings of pro-tein subunits with a central channel of diameter 10-50 \u00c5.A proteasome can cleave peptide bonds between 2 or 3 different amino acid combinations in an ATP-dependentprocess (Figure 8-5b). Degradation of ubiquitin-proteincomplexes is thought to occur within the central hollow ofthe proteasome. Experimental evidence indicates that the immune system utilizes this general pathway of protein degradation to produce small peptides for presentation with class I MHCmolecules. The proteasomes involved in antigen processinginclude two subunits encoded within the MHC gene cluster,LMP2 and LMP7, and a third non-MHC protein, LMP10(also called MECL-1). All three are induced by lev-els of the T-cell cytokine LMP10 preferen-tially peptides that bind to MHC class I molecules.Such proteasomes, for example, show increased hydrolysis of peptide bonds that follow basic and/or hydrophobicresidues. As described in Chapter 7, peptides that bind to class I MHC molecules terminate almost exclusively with hy-drophobic or basic residues. Peptides Are Transported from the Cytosol to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum Insight into the role that peptide transport, the delivery of peptides to the MHC molecule, plays in the cytosolic pro-cessing pathway came from studies of cell lines with defectsin peptide presentation by class I MHC molecules. One suchmutant cell line, called RMA-S, expresses about 5% of thenormal levels of class I MHC molecules on its membrane. Al-though RMA-S cells synthesize normal levels of class I /H9251 chains and /H9252 2-microglobulin, neither molecule appears on the membrane. A clue to the mutation in the RMA-S cell linewas the discovery by A. T ownsend and his colleagues that\"feeding\" these cells peptides restored their level of mem-brane-associated class I MHC molecules to normal. Theseinvestigators suggested that peptides might be required tostabilize the interaction between the class I /H9251chain and /H9252 2-microglobulin. The ability to restore expression of class I MHC molecules on the membrane by feeding the cellspredigested peptides suggested that the RMA-S cell linemight have a defect in peptide transport.190 PART Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell PeptidesProteolytic enzyme subunit FIGURE 8-5Cytosolic proteolytic system for degradation of intra- cellular proteins.

(a) Schematic diagram of TAP, a het- erodimer anchored in the membrane of the rough endoplasmicreticulum (RER). The two chains are encoded by TAP 1and TAP 2.The cy- tosolic domain in each TAP subunit contains an ATP-binding site , and peptide transport depends on the hydrolysis of ATP. (b) In the cytosol, association of LMP 2, LMP 7, and LMP 10(black spheres) with a protea- some changes its catalytic specificity to favor production of p eptides that bind to class I MHC molecules. Within the RER membrane, a newly syn- thesized class I /H9251chain associates with calnexin until /H9252 to the /H9251chain. The class I /H9251chain/ /H92522-microglobulin heterodimer then binds to calreticulin and the TAP-associated protein tapas in. When a peptide delivered by TAP is bound to the class I molecule, fo lding of MHC class I is complete and it is released from the RER and tra nsported through the Golgi to the surface of the cell.Subsequent experiments showed that the defect in the RMA-S cell line occurs in the protein that transports pep-tides from the cytoplasm to the RER, where class I moleculesare synthesized. When RMA-S cells were transfected with afunctional gene encoding the transporter protein, the cellsbegan to express class I molecules on the membrane. Thetransporter protein, designated TAP (for transporter asso- ciated with antigen processing ) is a of two proteins: TAP1 and TAP2(Figure 8-6a). addition to their multiple transmembranesegments, the TAP1 and TAP2 proteins each have a domainprojecting into the lumen of the RER, and an ATP-bindingdomain that projects into the cytosol. Both TAP1 and TAP2belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette proteins foundin the membranes of many cells, including bacteria; theseproteins mediate ATP-dependent transport of amino acids,sugars, ions, and peptides. Peptides generated in the cytosol by the proteasome are translocated by TAP into the RER by a process that requiresthe hydrolysis of ATP (Figure 8-6b). TAP has the highestaffinity for peptides containing 8-10 amino acids, which isthe optimal peptide length for class I MHC binding. In addi-tion, TAP appears to favor peptides with hydrophobic or ba-sic carboxyl-terminal amino acids, the preferred anchorresidues for class I MHC molecules. Thus, TAP is optimizedto transport peptides that will interact with class I MHCmolecules. The TAP1 and TAP2 genes map within the class II MHC region, adjacent to the LMP2 and LMP7 genes (see Figure 7-15). Both the transporter genes and these LMP genes are polymorphic; that is, different allelic forms of these genesexist within the population. Allelic differences in LMP-me-diated proteolytic cleavage of protein antigens or in thetransport of different peptides from the cytosol into the RERmay contribute to the observed variation among individualsin their response to different endogenous antigens. TAP deficiencies can lead to a disease syndrome that has aspectsof both immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (see Clinical Focus). Peptides Assemble with Class I MHC Aided by Chaperone Molecules Like other proteins, the /H9251chain and /H92522-microglobulin components of the class I MHC molecule are synthesizedon polysomes along the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As-sembly of these components into a stable class I MHCmolecular complex that can exit the RER requires thepresence of a peptide in the binding groove of the class Imolecule. The assembly process involves several steps andincludes the participation of molecular chaperones, which facilitate the folding of polypeptides. The first molecularchaperone involved in class I MHC assembly is calnexin, a resident membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum.Calnexin associates with the free class I /H9251chain and pro- motes its folding. When /H9252 2-microglobulin binds to the /H9251 chain, calnexin is released and the class I molecule associ-ates with the chaperone calreticulin and with tapasin . Tapasin (TAP-associated protein) brings the TAP trans-porter into proximity with the class I molecule and allows it to acquire an antigenic peptide (Figure al. / Immunology 5e:192 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses of the upper respiratory tract, and in the second decade begins to have chronic in-fection of the lungs. It is thought that apost-nasal-drip syndrome common inyounger patients promotes the bacteriallung infections in later life. Noteworthy isthe absence of any severe viral infection,which is common in immunodeficien-cies with T-cell involvement (see Chapter19). Bronchiectasis (dilation of the bronchial tubes) often occurs and recur-ring infections can lead to lung damagethat may be fatal. The most characteristicmark of the deficiency is the occurrenceof necrotizing skin lesions on the extrem-ities and the midface. These lesions ul-cerate and may cause disfigurement (seefigure). The skin lesions are probably dueto activated NK cells and /H9253/H9254T cells; NKcells were isolated from biopsied skin from several patients, supporting thispossibility. Normally, the activity of NKcells is limited through the action ofkiller-cell-inhibitory receptors (KIRs),which deliver a negative signal to the NKcell following interaction with class Imolecules (see Chapter 14). The defi- ciency of class I molecules in TAP-relatedBLS patients explains the excessive activ-ity of the NK cells. Activation of NK cellsfurther explains the absence of severevirus infections, which are limited by NKand /H9253/H9254cells. The best treatment for the character- istic lung infections appears to be antibi-otics and intravenous immunoglobulin.Attempts to limit the skin disease by im-munosuppressive regimens, such assteroid treatment or cytotoxic agents,can of lesions and istherefore contraindicated. Mutations inthe promoter region of TAPthat preclude expression of the gene were found forseveral patients, suggesting the possibil-ity of gene therapy, but the cellular distri-bution of class I is so widespread that itis not clear what cells would need to becorrected to alleviate all symptoms. A relatively rare con- dition known as bare lymphocyte syn-drome, or BLS, has been recognized formore than lymphocytes in BLS patients express MHC molecules atbelow-normal levels and, in some cases,not at all. In type 1BLS, a deficiency in MHC class I molecules exists; in type 2 BLS, expression of class II molecules isimpaired. The pathogenesis of one typeof BLS underscores the importance ofthe class I family of MHC molecules intheir dual roles of preventing autoim-munity as well as defending againstpathogens. Defects in promoter sequences that preclude MHC gene transcription werefound for some type 2BLS cases, but in many instances the nature of the under-lying defect is not known. A recent studyhas identified a group of patients withtype 1BLS due to defects in TAP 1or TAP 2genes. Manifestations of the TAP deficiency were consistent in this patientgroup and define a unique disease. Asdescribed earlier in this chapter, TAP pro-teins are necessary for the loading ofpeptides onto class I molecules, a stepthat is essential for expression of class IMHC molecules on the cell surface. Lym-phocytes in individuals with TAP defi-ciency express levels of class I moleculessignificantly lower than normal controls.Other cellular abnormalities include in-creased numbers of NK and /H9253/H9254T cells, and decreased levels of CD 8 /H11001/H9251/H9252T cells. As we shall see, the disease manifesta-tions are reasonably well explained bythese deviations in the levels of certaincells involved in immune function.

An additional chaperone protein, ERp57,has been observed in association with calnexin and calretic-ulin complexes. The precise role of this resident endoplasmicreticulum protein in the class I peptide assembly and loadingprocess has not yet been defined, but it is thought to con-tribute to the formation of disulfide bonds during the matu-ration of class I chains. Because its role is not clearly defined , ERp57 is not shown in Figures 8-6 The Endocytic Pathway Figure 8-8 recapitulates the endogenous pathway discussed previously (left side), and compares it with the separate exoge-nous pathway (right), which we shall now consider. Whetheran antigenic peptide associates with class I or with class II m ol- ecules is dictated by the mode of entry into the cell, either ex-ogenous or endogenous, and by the site of processing. Antigen-presenting cells can internalize antigen by phago- cytosis, endocytosis, or both. Macrophages internalize antigenby both processes, whereas most other APCs are not phago-cytic or are poorly phagocytic and therefore internalize exoge-nous antigen only by endocytosis (either receptor-mediatedendocytosis or pinocytosis). B cells, for example, internalizeantigen very effectively by receptor-mediated endocytosis us-ing antigen-specific membrane antibody as the receptor. Peptides Are Generated from Internalized Molecules in Endocytic Vesicles Once an antigen is internalized, it is degraded into peptides within compartments of the endocytic processing pathway. Asthe experiment shown in Figure 8-3 demonstrated, internal- ized antigen takes 1-3 h to transverse the endocytic pathwayand appear at the cell surface in the form of peptide-class IIMHC complexes. The endocytic pathway appears Internalized antigen fromearly to late endosomes and finally to lysosomes, encounteringhydrolytic enzymes and a lower pH in each compartment (Fig-ure 8-9). Lysosomes, for example, contain a unique of endocyticpathway, antigen is degraded into oligopeptides of about 13-18 residues, which bind to class II MHC molecules. Because thehydrolytic enzymes are optimally active under acidic condi-tions (low pH), antigen processing can be inhibited by chemi-cal agents that increase the pH of the compartments (e.g.,chloroquine) as well as by protease inhibitors (e.g., leupeptin) . The mechanism by which internalized antigen moves from one endocytic compartment to the next has not beenconclusively demonstrated. It has been suggested that earlyendosomes from the periphery move inward to become lateendosomes and finally lysosomes. Alternatively, small trans-port vesicles may carry antigens from one compartment tothe next. Eventually the endocytic compartments, or por-tions of them, return to the cell periphery, where they fusewith the plasma membrane. In this way, the surface receptorsare recycled. The Invariant Chain Guides Transport of Class II MHC Molecules to Endocytic Vesicles Since antigen-presenting cells express both class I and class I I MHC molecules, some mechanism must exist to preventclass II MHC molecules from binding to the same set of anti-genic peptides as the class I molecules. When class II MHCmolecule are synthesized within the RER, three pairs of classII /H9251/H9252chains associate with a preassembled trimer of a FIGURE 8-7Assembly and stabilization of class I MHC mole- cules. Newly formed class I /H9251chains associate with calnexin, a molecular chaperone, in the RER membrane. Subsequent bindingto /H9252 2-microglobulin releases calnexin and allows binding to thechaperonin calreticulin and to tapasin, which is associated wit h the peptide transporter TAP. This association promotes binding of a n antigenic peptide, which stabilizes the class I molecule-peptid e complex, allowing its release from the RER.++ Peptides Exit RER Calnexin CalnexinClass I MHC chainClass moleculeCalreticulin-tapasin al. / Immunology 5e:194 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 8-8Separate antigen-presenting pathways are utilized for endogenous (green) and exogenous (red) antigens. The modeof antigen entry into cells and the site of antigen processing de-termine whether antigenic peptides associate with class I MHC molecules in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or with class IImolecules in endocytic compartments.Endogenous pathway (class I MHC)Exogenous pathway (class MHC) pro- interacts with peptide-binding the class IImolecules, preventing any endogenously derived peptidesfrom binding to the cleft while the class II molecule is within the RER (see right side of Figure 8-8). The invariant chainalso appears to be involved in the folding of the class II /H9251and8536d_ch08_194 8/23/02 11:59 AM Page 194 mac100 mac 100: 126 8_tm:8536d:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e-:/H9252chains, their exit from the RER, and the subsequent routing of class II molecules to the endocytic processing pathwayfrom the trans-Golgi network. The role of the invariant chain in the routing of class II mol- ecules has been demonstrated in transfection experiments withcells that lack the genes encoding class II MHC molecules andthe invariant chain. Immunofluorescent labeling of such cellstransfected only with class II MHC genes revealed class II mol-ecules localized within the Golgi complex. However, in cellstransfected with both the class II MHC genes and invariant-chain gene, the class II molecules were localized in the cytopla s- mic vesicular structures of the endocytic pathway. Theinvariant chain contains sorting signals in its cytoplasmic tai l that directs the transport of the class II MHC complex from thetrans-Golgi network to the endocytic compartments. Peptides Assemble with Class II MHC Molecules by Displacing CLIP Recent experiments indicate that most class II MHC-invari- ant chain complexes are transported from the RER, wherethey are formed, through the Golgi complex and trans-Golginetwork, and then through the endocytic pathway, movingfrom early endosomes to late endosomes, and finally to lyso-somes. As the proteolytic activity increases in each successivecompartment, the invariant chain is gradually degraded.However, a short fragment of the invariant chain termedCLIP (for class II-associated invariant chain peptide ) remains bound to the class II molecule after the invariant chain hasbeen cleaved within the endosomal compartment. CLIPphysically occupies the peptide-binding groove of the class IIMHC molecule, presumably preventing any premature bind-ing of antigenic peptide (see Figure 8-8).A nonclassical class II MHC molecule called HLA-DM is required to catalyze the exchange of CLIP with antigenicpeptides (Figure 8-10a). MHC class II genes encoding HLA-DM have been identified in the mouse and rabbit, indicating Antigen Processing and Presentation CHAPTER 8 195 Recycling of receptors Early endosome pH 6.0 -6.5Clathrin- coatedvesicleAntigen Late endosome pH 5.0 4.5 -5.0 complex FIGURE 8-9Generation of antigenic peptides in the endocytic processing pathway.

Digestion of the inva riant chain leaves CLIP, a small fragment remaining in the binding gr oove of the class II MHC molecule. HLA-DM, a nonclassical MHC class II molecule expressed within endosomal compartments, mediates ex-change of antigenic peptides for CLIP. The nonclassical class I I mol- ecule HLA-DO may act as a negative regulator of class II antige n processing by binding to HLA-DM and inhibiting its role in the dis- sociation of CLIP from class II molecules.

The red lines show DR 4complexed with collagen II peptide, yellow lines are DR 1with influenza hemagglutinin peptide, and blue lines are DR 3associated with CLIP. (N indicates the amino terminus and C the carboxyl terminus of the peptides.) No major differen ces in the structures of the class II molecules or in the conformation of the bound peptides are seen. This comparison shows that CLIP bindsthe class II molecule in a manner identical to that of antigeni c pep- tides. [Part (b) from Dessen et al., of / Immunology 5e:that HLA-DM is widely conserved among mammalian species. Like other class II MHC molecules, HLA-DM is aheterodimer of /H9251and /H9252chains. However, unlike other class II molecules, HLA-DM is not polymorphic and is not ex-pressed at the cell membrane but is found predominantlywithin the endosomal compartment. The DM/H9251and DM/H9252 genes are located near the TAP and LMP genes in the MHC complex of humans and DM is expressed in cells that expressclassical class II molecules. The reaction between HLA-DM and the class II CLIP complex facilitating exchange of CLIP for another peptide isimpaired in the presence of HLA-DO, which binds to HLA-DM and lessens the efficiency of the exchange reaction. HLA-DO, like HLA-DM, is a nonclassical and nonpolymorphicclass II molecule that is also found in the MHC of otherspecies. HLA-DO differs from HLA-DM in that it is ex-pressed only by B cells and the thymus, and unlike other classII molecules, its expression is not induced by IFN- /H9253.A n a d - ditional difference is that the genes encoding the /H9251and the /H9252 chains of HLA-DO are not adjacent in the MHC as are allother class II /H9251and /H9252pairs (see Fig 7-15). An HLA-DR3 molecule associated with CLIP was isolated from a cell line that did not express HLA-DM and was there-fore defective in antigen processing. Superimposing thestructure of HLA-DR3-CLIP on another DR moleculebound to antigenic peptide reveals that CLIP binds to class IIin the same stable manner as the antigenic peptide (Figure 8-10b). The discovery of this stable complex in a cell with de-fective HLA-DM supports the argument that HLA-DM isrequired for the replacement of CLIP . Although it certainly modulates the activity of HLA-DM, the precise role of HLA-DO remains obscure. One possibilityis that it acts in the selection of peptides bound to class IIMHC molecules in B cells. DO occurs in complex with DMin these cells and this association continues in the endosomalcompartments. Conditions of higher acidity weaken the as-sociation of DM/DO and increase the possibility of antigenicpeptide binding despite the presence of DO. Such a pH-de-pendent interaction could lead to preferential selection ofclass II-bound peptides from lysosomal compartments in Bcells as compared with other APCs. As with class I MHC molecules, peptide binding is required to maintain the structure and stability of class II MHC mole-cules. Once a peptide has bound, the peptide-class II complexis transported to the plasma membrane, where the neutral pHappears to enable the complex to assume a compact, stableform. Peptide is bound so strongly in this compact form that itis difficult to replace a class II-bound peptide on the mem-brane with another peptide at physiologic conditions. Presentation of Nonpeptide Antigens T o this point the discussion has been limited to peptide anti-gens and their presentation by classical class I and II MHCmolecules. It is well known that nonprotein antigens also arerecognized by the immune system, and there are reports dat- ing back to the 1980s of T cell proliferation in the presence ofnonprotein antigens derived from infectious agents. More re-cent reports indicate that T cells that express the /H9253/H9254TCR (T- cell receptors are dimers of either /H9251/H9252or /H9253/H9254chains) that react with glycolipid antigens derived from bacteria such as My- cobacterium tuberculosis . These nonprotein antigens are pre- sented by members of the CD1 family of nonclassical class Imolecules. The CD1 family of molecules associates with /H9252 2-mi- croglobulin and has general structural similarity to class IMHC molecules. There are five genes encoding human CD1molecules ( CD1A-E, encoding the gene products CD1a-d, with no product yet identified for E). These genes are located not within the MHC but on chromosome 1 (Figure 8-11a).The genes are classified into two groups based on sequencehomology. Group 1 includes CD1A, B, C, and E;CD1D is in group 2. All mammalian species studied have CD1 genes, al-though the number varies. Rodents have only group 2 CD1 genes, the counterpart of human CD1D, whereas rabbits, like humans, have five genes, including both group 1 and 2 types.Sequence identity of CD1 with classical class I molecules isconsiderably lower than the identity of the class I moleculeswith each other. Comparison of the three-dimensional struc-ture of the mouse CD1d1 with the class I MHC molecule H-2k bshows that the antigen-binding groove of the CD1d1 molecules is deeper and more voluminous than that of theclassical class I molecule (Fig 8-11b). Expression of CD1 molecules varies according to subset; CD1D1 genes are expressed mainly in nonprofessional APCs and on certain B-cell subsets. The mouse CD1d1 is morewidely distributed and found on T cells, B cells, dendriticcells, hepatocytes, and some epithelial cells. The CD1A, B, and Cgenes are expressed on immature thymocytes and pro- fessional APCs, mainly those of the dendritic type. CD1C gene expression is seen on B cells, whereas the CD1A and B products are not. CD1 genes can be induced by exposure to certain cytokines such as GM-CSF or IL-3. The intracellulartrafficking patterns of the CD1 molecules differ; for example,CD1a is found mostly in early endosomes or on the cell sur-face; CD1b and CD1d localize to late endosomes; and CD1cis found throughout the endocytic system. Certain CD1 molecules are recognized by T cells in the ab- sence of foreign antigens, and self restriction can be demon-strated in these reactions. Examination of antigens presentedby CD1 molecules revealed them to be lipid components(mycolic acid) of the M. tuberculosis cell wall. Further studies of CD1 presentation indicated that a glycolipid (lipoarabino-mannan) from Mycobacterium leprae could also be presented by these molecules. The data concerning CD1 antigen pre-sentation point out the existence of a third pathway for theprocessing of antigens, a pathway with distinct intracellularsteps that do not involve the molecules found to facilitateclass I antigen processing. For example, CD1 molecules areable to process antigen in TAP-deficient cells. Recent data indicate that the CD1a and 1b molecules traffic differently,196 PART II Generation / Immunology 5e:with CD1a at the surface or in the recycling endocytic compartments and CD1b and CD1d in the lysomal compart-ments. Exactly how the CD1 pathway complements or inter-sects the better understood class I and class II pathways remai ns an open question. The T-cell types reactive to CD1 were firstthought to be limited to T cells expressing the /H9253/H9254TCR and lack- ing both CD4 and CD8, or T cells with a single TCR /H9251chain, but recent reports indicate that a wider range of T-cell types w ill recognize CD1-presenting cells. Recent evidence indicates thatnatural killer T cells recognize CD1d molecules presenting au-tologous antigen. This may represent a mechanism for elimi-nating cells that are altered by stress, senescence, or neoplasia .

The obvi- ous parallels between the recognition functions of T cellsand B cells stimulated a great deal of experimental effort totake advantage of the anticipated structural similarities be-tween immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors. Reportspublished in the 1970s claimed discovery of immunoglob-ulin isotypes associated exclusively with T cells (IgT) andof antisera that recognize variable-region markers (idio-types) common to antibodies and T-cell receptors withsimilar specificity. These experiments could not be repro-duced and were proven to be incorrect when it was demon-strated that the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulins donot have common recognition elements and are encodedby entirely separate gene families. As the following sectionswill show, a sequence of well-designed experiments usingcutting-edge technology was required to correctly answerquestions about the structure of the T-cell receptor, thegenes that encode it, and the manner in which it recognizesantigen. chapter 9 IEarly Studies of the T-Cell Receptor I/H9251/H9252 and /H9253/H9254T-Cell Receptors: Structure and Roles IOrganization Rearrangement of TCR Genes IT-Cell Receptor Complex: TCR-CD3 IT-Cell Accessory Membrane Molecules TCR-Peptide- MHC Complexes IAlloreactivity of T CellsT-Cell Receptor T - - clearly implies that T cells possess an antigen-specific and clonally restricted receptor. However, the identity of this receptor remained unknown long afterthe B-cell receptor (immunoglobulin molecule) had beenidentified. Relevant experimental results were contradictoryand difficult to conceptualize within a single model becausethe T-cell receptor (TCR) differs from the B-cell antigen-binding receptor in important ways. First, the T-cell receptoris membrane bound and does not appear in a soluble formas the B-cell receptor does; therefore, assessment of its struc-ture by classic biochemical methods was complicated, andcomplex cellular assays were necessary to determine its speci-ficity. Second, most T-cell receptors are specific not for anti-gen alone but for antigen combined with a molecule encodedby the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This prop-erty precludes purification of the T-cell receptor by simpleantigen-binding techniques and adds complexity to any ex-perimental system designed to investigate the receptor. A combination of immunologic, biochemical, and molecular-biological manipulations has overcome theseproblems. The molecule responsible for T-cell specificitywas found to be a heterodimer composed of either /H9251and /H9252 or /H9253and express TCRs have mately 10 5TCR molecules on their surface. The genomic organization of the T-cell receptor gene families and themeans by which the diversity of the component chains isgenerated were found to resemble those of the B-cell re-ceptor chains. Further, the T-cell receptor is associated onthe membrane with a signal-transducing complex, CD3,whose function is similar to that of the Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252complex of the B-cell receptor. Important new insights concerning T-cell receptors have been gained by recent structure determinations using x-raycrystallography, including new awareness of differences inhow TCRs bind to class I or class II MHC molecules. Thischapter will explore the nature of the T-cell receptor mole-cules that specifically recognize MHC-antigen complexes, aswell as some that recognize native antigens. Early Studies of the T-Cell Receptor By the early 1980s, investigators had learned much aboutT-cell function but were thwarted in their attempts toInteraction of /H9251/H9252TCR with Class II MHC-PeptideART TO COME8536d_ch09_200-220 8/2/02 1:00 PM Page 200 mac79 Mac 79:45_B W:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:T-Cell Receptor CHAPTER 9 201 Classic Experiments Demonstrated the Self-MHC Restriction of the T-Cell Receptor By the early 1970s, immunologists had learned to generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for virus-infectedtarget cells. For example, when mice were infected with lym-phocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, they would produceCTLs that could lyse LCM-infected target cells in vitro. Y etthese same CTLs failed to bind free LCM virus or viral anti-gens. Why didn't the CTLs bind the virus or viral antigens di-rectly as immunoglobulins did? The answer began to emergein the classic experiments of R. M. Zinkernagel and P . C.Doherty in 1974 (see Figure 8-2). These studies demon-strated that antigen recognition by T cells is specific not forviral antigen alone but for antigen associated with an MHCmolecule (Figure 9-1). T cells were shown to recognize anti-gen only when presented on the membrane of a cell by a self-MHC molecule. This attribute, called self-MHC restriction, distinguishes recognition of antigen by T cells and B cells. In1996, Doherty and Zinkernagel were awarded the NobelPrize for this work. Two models were proposed to explain the MHC restric- tion of the T-cell receptor. The dual-receptor model envi- sioned a T cell with two separate receptors, one for antigenand one for class I or class II MHC molecules. The altered-self model proposed that a single receptor recognizes an alter- ation in self-MHC molecules induced by their associationwith foreign antigens. The debate between proponents ofthese two models was waged for a number of years, until anelegant experiment by J. Kappler and P . Marrack demon-strated that specificity for both MHC and antigen resides in asingle receptor. An overwhelming amount of structural andfunctional data has since been added in support of the altered-self model.T-Cell Receptors Were Isolated by Using Clonotypic Antibodies Identification and isolation of the T-cell receptor was accom- plished by producing large numbers of monoclonal antibod-ies to various T-cell clones and then screening the antibodiesto find one that was clone specific, or clonotypic . This ap- proach assumes that, since the T-cell receptor is specific forboth an antigen and an MHC molecule, there should be sig-nificant structural differences in the receptor from clone toclone; each T-cell clone should have an antigenic markersimilar to the idiotype markers that characterize monoclonalantibodies. Using this approach, researchers in the early1980s isolated the receptor and found that it was a het-erodimer consisting of /H9251and /H9252chains. When antisera were of various T-cell clones, some antis-era bound to /H9251/H9252heterodimers from all the clones, whereas other antisera were clone specific. This finding suggested thatthe amino acid sequences of the TCR /H9251and /H9252chains, like those of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, haveconstant and variable regions. Later, a second type of TCRheterodimer consisting of /H9254and /H9253chains was identified. In human and mouse, the majority of T cells express the /H9251/H9252het- erodimer; the remaining T cells express the /H9253/H9254heterodimer. As described below, the exact proportion of T cells expressing/H9251/H9252or /H9253/H9254TCRs differs by organ and species, but /H9251/H9252T cells normally predominate. The TCR /H9252-Chain Gene Was Cloned by Use of Subtractive Hybridization In order to identify and isolate the TCR genes, S. M. Hedrick and M. M. Davis sought to isolate mRNA that encodes the /H9251 and /H9252chains from a T H-cell clone. This was no easy task be- cause the receptor mRNA represents only a minor fraction ofthe total cell mRNA. By contrast, in the plasma cell, im-munoglobulin is a major secreted cell product, and mRNAsencoding the heavy and light chains are abundant and easy topurify. The successful scheme of Hedrick and Davis assumed that the TCR mRNA\u2014like the mRNAs that encode other integralmembrane proteins\u2014would be associated with membrane-bound polyribosomes rather than with free cytoplasmic ri-bosomes. They therefore isolated the membrane-boundpolyribosomal mRNA from a T H-cell clone and used reverse transcriptase to synthesize 32P-labeled (Figure 9-2). Because of lymphocyte in the membrane-bound polyribosomal step elimi-nated 97% of the cell mRNA. Hedrick and Davis next used a technique called DNA sub- tractive hybridization to remove from their preparation the [ 32P]cDNA that was not unique to T cells. Their rationale for this step was based on earlier measurements by Davis show-ing that 98% of the genes expressed in lymphocytes are com-mon to B cells and T cells.

This ap-proach was based on the assumption that, since the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor appeared to have constant and variable regions, itsgenes should undergo DNA rearrangements like those ob-served in the Ig genes of B cells. The two investigators testedDNA from T cells, B cells, liver cells, and macrophages bySouthern-blot analysis using the 10 [ 32P]cDNA probes to identify unique T-cell genomic DNA sequences. One cloneshowed bands indicating DNA rearrangement in T cells butnot in the other cell types. This cDNA probe identified sixdifferent patterns for the DNA from six different mature T-cell lines (see Figure 9-2 inset, upper panel). These differentpatterns presumably represented rearranged TCR genes.Such results would be expected if rearranged TCR genes oc-cur only in mature T cells. The observation that each of thesix T-cell lines showed different Southern-blot patterns wasconsistent with the predicted differences in TCR specificityin each T-cell line. The cDNA clone 1 identified by the Southern-blot analy- ses shown in Figure 9-2 has all the hallmarks of a putativeTCR gene: it represents a gene sequence that rearranges, isexpressed as a membrane-bound protein, and is expressedonly in T cells. This cDNA clone was found to encode the /H9252 chain of the T-cell receptor. Later, cDNA clones were identi-fied encoding the /H9251chain, the /H9253chain, and finally the /H9254chain. These findings opened the way to understanding the T-cellreceptor and made possible subsequent structural and func-tional studies. /H9251/H9252and /H9253/H9254T-Cell Receptors: Structure and Roles The domain structures of /H9251/H9252and /H9253/H9254TCR heterodimers are strikingly similar to that of the immunoglobulins;is unique to T cells should include the genes encoding the T- cell receptor. Therefore, by hybridizing B-cell mRNA withtheir T H-cell [32P]cDNA, they were able to remove, or sub- tract, all the cDNA that was common to B cells and T cells.The unhybridized [ 32P]cDNA remaining after this step pre- sumably represented the expressed polyribosomal mRNAthat was unique to the T H-cell clone, including the mRNA encoding its T-cell receptor. Cloning of the unhybridized [32P]cDNA generated a li- brary from which 10 different cDNA clones were identified.T o determine which of these T-cell-specific cDNA clones202 PART II Generation of B-Cell Use probes in Southern blots of genomic DNA FIGURE 9-2Production and identification of a cDNA clone en- coding the T-cell receptor. The flow chart outlines the procedu re used by S. Hedrick and M. Davis to obtain [32P]cDNA clones correspond- ing to T-cell-specific mRNAs. The technique of DNA subtractive hy- bridization enabled them to isolate [32P]cDNA unique to the T cell. The labeled T H-cell cDNA clones were used as probes ( inset) in Southern-blot analyses of genomic DNA from liver cells, B-lym-phoma cells, and six different T H-cell clones (a-f). Probing with cDNA clone 1produced a distinct blot pattern each T-cell clone, whereas probing with cDNA clone 2did not. Assuming that liver cells and B cells contained unrearranged germ-line TCR DNA, andthat each of the T-cell clones contained different rearranged T CR genes, the results using cDNA clone 1as the probe identified cDNA of clone 2identified the gene for another T-cell membrane molecule encoded by DNA thatdoes not undergo rearrangement. [Based on S. Hedrick et al., 1984, Nature 308: 9:49 AM et al. / Immunology 5e:thus, they are classified as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see Figure 4-19). Each chain in a TCR has twodomains containing an intrachain disulfide bond that spans60-75 amino acids. The amino-terminal domain in bothchains exhibits marked sequence variation, but the sequencesof the remainder of each chain are conserved. Thus the TCRdomains-one variable (V) and one constant (C)-are struc-turally homologous to the V and C domains of immuno-globulins, and the TCR molecule resembles an Fab fragment(Figure 9-3). The TCR variable domains have three hyper-variable regions, which appear to be equivalent to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in immuno-globulin light and heavy chains. There is an additional area ofhypervariability (HV4) in the /H9252chain that does not normally contact antigen and therefore is not considered a CDR. In addition to the constant domain, each TCR chain con- tains a short connecting sequence, in which a cysteine residueforms a disulfide link with the other chain of the het-erodimer. Following the connecting region is a transmem-brane region of 21 or 22 amino acids, which anchors eachchain in the plasma membrane. The transmembrane do-mains of both chains are unusual in that they contain posi-tively charged amino acid residues. These residues enable thechains of the TCR heterodimer to interact with chains of thesignal-transducing CD3 complex. Finally, each TCR chainT-Cell Receptor CHAPTER 9 203 contains a short cytoplasmic tail of 5-12 amino acids at thecarboxyl-terminal end. /H9251/H9252and /H9253/H9254T-cell receptors were initially difficult to inves- tigate because, like all transmembrane proteins, they are in-soluble. This problem was circumvented by expressingmodified forms of the protein in vitro that had been engi-neered to contain premature in-frame stop codons that pre-clude translation of the membrane-binding sequence thatmakes the molecule insoluble. The majority of T cells in the human and the mouse ex- press T-cell receptors encoded by the /H9251/H9252genes. These recep- tors interact with peptide antigens processed and presentedon the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Early indicationsthat certain T cells reacted with nonpeptide antigens were puzzling until some light was shed on the problem whenproducts of the CD1 family of genes were found to presentcarbohydrates and lipids. More recently, it has been foundthat certain /H9253/H9254cells react with antigen that is neither processed nor presented in the context of a MHC molecules. Differences in the antigen-binding regions of /H9251/H9252and /H9253/H9254 were expected because of the different antigens they recog-nize, but no extreme dissimilarities were expected.

The TCR /H9251and /H9252chain each contains two domains with the im- munoglobulin-fold structure. The amino-terminal domains (V /H9251and V/H9252) exhibit sequence variation and contain three hypervariable re - gions equivalent to the CDRs in antibodies. The sequence of the con- stant domains (C /H9251and C /H9252) does not vary. The two TCR chains are connected by a disulfide bond between their constant sequences; theIgM H chains are connected to one another by a disulfide bond i n the hinge region of the H chain, and the L chains are connected to the H chains by disulfide links between the C termini of the L chains and the C /H9262region. TCR molecules interact with CD 3via positively charged amino acid residues (indicated by /H11001) in their transmem- brane regions. Numbers indicate the length of the chains in the TCR molecule. Unlike the antibody molecule, which is bivalent, the TCR is monovalent.8536d_ch09_200-220 8/2/02 9:49 AM Page Mac 79:45_B W:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:differences in the overall structures of the two receptor types, pointing to possible functional variation. The receptor theystudied was composed of the /H92539 and /H92542 chains, which are those most frequently expressed in human peripheral blood.A deep cleft on the surface of the molecule accommodatesthe microbial phospholipid for which the /H9253/H9254receptor is spe- cific. This antigen is recognized without MHC presentation. The most striking feature of the structure is how it differs from the /H9251/H9252receptor in the orientation of its V and C re- gions. The so-called elbow angle between the long axes of theV and C regions of /H9253/H9254TCR is 111\u00b0; in the /H9251/H9252TCR, the elbow angle is 149\u00b0, giving the molecules distinct shapes (Figure 9-4). The full significance of this difference is not known,but it could contribute to differences in signaling mecha-nisms and in how the molecules interact with coreceptormolecules. The number of /H9253/H9254cells in circulation is small compared with cells that have /H9251/H9252 receptors, and the V gene segments of /H9253/H9254receptors exhibit limited diversity. As seen from the data in Table 9-1, the majority of /H9253/H9254cells are negative for both CD4 and CD8, and most express a single /H9253/H9254-chain subtype. In humans the predominant receptor expressed on circulat-ing /H9253/H9254 cells recognizes a microbial phospholipid antigen, 3- formyl-1-butyl pyrophosphate, found on M. tuberculosis and other bacteria and parasites. This specificity for frequentlyencountered pathogens led to speculation that /H9253/H9254cells may function as an arm of the innate immune response, allowingrapid reactivity to certain antigens without the need for aprocessing step. Interestingly, the specificity of circulating /H9253/H9254 cells in the mouse and of other species studied does not par-allel that of humans, suggesting that the /H9253/H9254response may be directed against pathogens commonly encountered by agiven species. Furthermore, data indicating that /H9253/H9254cells can secrete a spectrum of cytokines suggest that they may play aregulatory role in recruiting /H9251/H9252T cells to the site of invasion by pathogens. The recruited /H9251/H9252T cells would presumably display a broad spectrum of receptors; those with the highestaffinity would be selectively activated and amplified to deal with the pathogen. Organization and Rearrangement of TCR Genes The genes that encode the /H9251/H9252and /H9253/H9254 T-cell receptors are ex- pressed only in cells of the T-cell lineage. The four TCR loci(/H9251,/H9252,/H9253, and /H9254) are organized in the germ line in a manner that is remarkably similar to the multigene organization ofthe immunoglobulin (Ig) genes (Figure 9-5). As in the caseof Ig genes, functional TCR genes are produced by re-arrangements of V and J segments in the /H9251-chain and /H9253- chain families and V , D, and J segments in the /H9252-chain and /H9254-chain families. In the mouse, the /H9251-,/H9252-, and /H9253-chain gene segments are located on chromosomes 14, 6, and 13, respec-tively. The /H9254-gene segments are located on chromosome 14 between the V /H9251and J /H9251segments. The location of the /H9254-chain gene family is significant: a productive rearrangement of the/H9251-chain gene segments deletes C /H9254, so that, in a given T cell, the /H9251/H9252TCR receptor cannot be coexpressed with the /H9253/H9254 receptor. Mouse germ-line DNA contains about 100 V /H9251and 50 J /H9251 gene segments and a single C /H9251segment. The /H9254-chain gene family contains about 10 V gene segments, which are largelydistinct from the V /H9251gene segments, although some sharing204 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses V domains C domains /H9253/H9254 TCR 111/H11034/H9251/H9252 TCR 147/H11034 FIGURE 9-4Comparison of the /H9253/H9254TCR and /H9251/H9252TCR.

Two D /H9254and two J /H9254gene segments and one C /H9254 segment have also been identified. The /H9252-chain gene family has 20-30 V gene segments and two almost identical repeatsof D, J, and C segments, each repeat consisting of one D /H9252, six J/H9252, and one C /H9252. The /H9253-chain gene family consists of seven V /H9253 segments and three different functional J /H9253-C/H9253repeats. The organization of the TCR multigene families in humans isgenerally similar to that in mice, although the number of seg-ments differs (Table 9-2).TCR Variable-Region Genes Rearrange in a Manner Similar to Antibody Genes The /H9251chain, like the immunoglobulin L chain, is encoded by V , J, and C gene segments. The /H9252chain, like the im- munoglobulin H chain, is encoded by V , D, J, and C gene seg-ments. Rearrangement of the TCR /H9251- and /H9252-chain gene segments results in VJ joining for the /H9251chain and VDJ join- ing for the /H9252chain (Figure 9-6). After transcription of the rearranged TCR genes, RNA processing, and translation, the /H9251and /H9252chains are expressed as a disulfide-linked heterodimer on the membrane of the Tcell. Unlike immunoglobulins, which can be membranebound or secreted, the /H9251/H9252heterodimer is expressed only in a membrane-bound form; thus, no differential RNA process-ing is required to produce membrane and secreted forms.Each TCR constant region includes a connecting sequence, atransmembrane sequence, and a cytoplasmic sequence. The germ-line DNA encoding the TCR /H9251and /H9252chain constant regions is much simpler than the immunoglobulinheavy-chain germ-line DNA, which has multiple C gene seg-ments encoding distinct isotypes with different effector func-tions. TCR /H9251-chain DNA has only a single C gene segment; the /H9252-chain DNA has two C gene segments, but their protein products differ by only a few amino acids and have no knownfunctional differences.

All of the TCR-gene rearrangementsfollow the one-turn/two-turn joining rule observed for the Iggenes, so recombination can occur only between the two dif-ferent types of RSSs. Like the pre-B cell, the pre-T V-J and during TCR-gene rearrangement by the same deletionalor inversional mechanisms that occur in the Ig genes (see Figure 5-7). As described in Chapter 5 for the immunoglobulin genes, RAG-1/2 introduces a nick on one DNA strand between the coding and signal sequences. Therecombinase then catalyzes a transesterification reactionthat results in the formation of a hairpin at the coding sequence and a flush 5 /H11032phosphorylated double-strand break at the signal sequence. Circular excision productsthought to be generated by looping-out and deletion dur-ing TCR-gene rearrangement have been identified in thy-mocytes (see Figure 5-8). Studies with SCID mice, which lack functional T and B cells, provide evidence for the similarity in the mechanismsof Ig-gene and TCR-gene rearrangements. As explained inChapter 19, SCID mice have a defect in a gene required forthe repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. As a result of thisdefect, D and J gene segments are not joined during re-arrangement of either Ig or TCR DNA (see Figure 5-10). This206 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 9-6Example of gene rearrangements that yield a func- tional gene encoding the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor.

Transcription of the re- arranged genes yields primary transcripts, which are processed to give mRNAs encoding the /H9251and /H9252chains of the membrane-bound TCR. The leader sequence is cleaved from the nascent polypeptide chain and is not present in the finished protein. A s no secreted TCR is produced, differential processing of the pri - mary transcripts does not occur. Although the /H9252-chain DNA con- tains two C genes, the gene products of these two C genes exhib it no known functional differences. The C genes are composed ofseveral exons and introns, which are not individually shown her e (see Figure 9-7).Protein product heterodimer3 5V1 -chain AM Mac 79:45_B W:Goldsby / Immunology 5e:finding suggests that the same double-stranded break-repair enzymes are involved in V-D-J rearrangements in B cells andin T cells. Although B cells and T cells use very similar mechanisms for variable-region gene rearrangements, the Ig genes are notnormally rearranged in T cells and the TCR genes are not re-arranged in B cells. Presumably, the recombinase enzyme sys-tem is regulated in each cell lineage, so that onlyrearrangement of the correct receptor DNA occurs. Re-arrangement of the gene segments in both T and B cell cre-ates a DNA sequence unique to that cell and its progeny. Thelarge number of possible configurations of the rearrangedgenes makes this new sequence a marker that is specific forthe cell clone. These unique DNA sequences have been usedto aid in diagnoses and in treatment of lymphoid leukemiasand lymphomas, cancers that involve clonal proliferation ofT or B cells (see Clinical Focus on page 208). ALLELIC EXCLUSION OF TCR GENES As mentioned above, the /H9254genes are located within the /H9251- gene complex and are deleted by /H9251-chain rearrangements. This event provides an irrevocable mode of exclusion for the/H9254genes located on the same chromosome as the rearranging /H9251genes. Allelic exclusion of genes for the TCR /H9251and /H9252chains occurs as well, but exceptions have been observed. The organization of the /H9252-chain gene segments into two clusters means that, if a nonproductive rearrangement oc-curs, the thymocyte can attempt a second rearrangement.This increases the likelihood of a productive rearrangementfor the /H9252chain. Once a productive rearrangement occurs for one /H9252-chain allele, the rearrangement of the other /H9252allele is inhibited. Exceptions to allelic exclusion are most often seen for the TCR /H9251-chain genes. For example, analyses of T-cell clones that express a functional /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor revealed a num- ber of clones with productive rearrangements of both /H9251- chain alleles. Furthermore, when an immature T-celllymphoma that expressed a particular /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor was subcloned, several subclones were obtained that expressedthe same /H9252-chain allele but an /H9251-chain allele different from the one expressed by the original parent clone. Studies withtransgenic mice also indicate that allelic exclusion is lessstringent for TCR /H9251-chain genes than for /H9252-chain genes. Mice that carry a productively rearranged /H9251/H9252-TCR transgene do not rearrange and express the endogenous /H9252-chain genes. However, the endogenous /H9251-chain genes sometimes are ex- pressed at various levels in place of the already rearranged /H9251- chain transgene. Since allelic exclusion is not complete for the TCR /H9251 chain, there are rare occasions when more than one /H9251chain is expressed on the membrane of a given T cell. The obviousquestion is how do the rare T cells that express two /H9251/H9252T-cell receptors maintain a single antigen-binding specificity? Oneproposal suggests that when a T cell expresses two different/H9251/H9252T-cell receptors, only one is likely to be self-MHC re- stricted and therefore functional.Rearranged TCR Genes Are Assembled from V, J, and D Gene Segments The general structure of rearranged TCR genes is shown in Figure 9-7. The variable regions of T-cell receptors are, ofcourse, encoded by rearranged VDJ and VJ sequences. InTCR genes, combinatorial joining of V CDR1 and CDR2, whereas junctional flexi-bility and N-region nucleotide addition generate CDR3.Rearranged TCR genes also contain a short leader (L) exonupstream of the joined VJ or VDJ sequences. The amino acidsencoded by the leader are cleaved as the nascentpolypeptide enters the endoplasmic reticulum. The constant region of each TCR chain is encoded by a C gene segment that has multiple exons (see Figure 9-7) corre-sponding to the structural domains in the protein (see Figure9-3). The first exon in the C gene segment encodes most ofthe C domain of the corresponding chain. Next is a shortexon that encodes the connecting sequence, followed by ex-ons that encode the transmembrane region and the cytoplas-mic tail. TCR Diversity Is Generated Like Antibody Diversity but Without Somatic Mutation Although TCR germ-line DNA contains far fewer V gene seg- ments than Ig germ-line DNA, several mechanisms that op-erate during TCR gene rearrangements contribute to a highdegree of diversity among T-cell receptors. Table 9-3 (page210) and Figure 9-8 (page 211) compare the generation ofdiversity among antibody molecules and TCR molecules.T-Cell Receptor CHAPTER 9 207 Rearranged -chain gene Rearranged -chain geneV C (V or V)Constant domain (C or C)Connecting sequence Trans- membrane region Cyto- plasmi c tail D FIGURE 9-7Schematic diagram of rearranged /H9251/H9252-TCR genes showing the exons that encode the various domains of the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor and approximate position of the CDRs. Junctional diver sity (vertical arrows) generates CDR 3(see Figure 9-8). The structures of the rearranged /H9253- and /H9254-chain genes are similar, although additional junctional diversity can occur in /H9254-chain genes.8536d_ch09_200-220 8/2/02 2:06 PM al. / Immunology 5e:208 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses the TCR genes in the T cells occurs be- fore the product molecule is expressed,T cells in early stages of developmentcan be detected. The unique gene frag-ments that result from TCR gene re-arrangement can be detected by sim-ple molecular-biological techniques andprovide a true fingerprint for a clonal cell population. DNA patterns that result from re- arrangement of the genes in the TCR /H9252 region are used most frequently as mark-ers. There are approximately 50V /H9252gene segments that can rearrange to one oftwo D-region gene segments and subse-quently to one of 12J gene segments (see Figure 9-8). Because each of the 50 or so V-region genes is flanked by uniquesequences, this process creates newDNA sequences that are unique to eachcell that undergoes the rearrangement;these new sequences may be detected bySouthern-blot techniques or by PCR(polymerase chain reaction). Since theentire sequence of the D, J, and C regionof the TCR gene /H9252complex is known, the appropriate probes and restriction en-zymes are easily chosen for Southernblotting (see diagram). Detection of rearranged TCR DNA may be used as a diagnostic tool whenabnormally enlarged lymph nodes per-sist; this condition could result eitherfrom inflammation due to chronic infec-tion or from proliferation of a cancerous lymphoid cell. If inflammation is thecause, the cells would come from a vari-ety of clones, and the DNA isolatedfrom them would be a mixture of manydifferent TCR sequences resulting frommultiple rearrangements; no uniquefragments would be detected. If the per-sistent enlargement of the nodes repre-sents a clonal proliferation, there wouldbe a detectable DNA fragment, becausethe cancerous cells would all containthe same TCR DNA sequence producedby DNA rearrangement in the parentcell. Thus the question whether the ob-served enlargement was due to the can-cerous growth of T cells could beanswered by the presence of a singlenew gene fragment in the DNA from thecell population. Because Ig genes re-arrange in the same fashion as the TCRgenes, similar techniques use Ig probesto detect clonal B-cell populations bytheir unique DNA patterns. The tech-nique, therefore, has value for a widerange of lymphoid-cell cancers. Although the detection of a unique DNA fragment resulting from rearrangedTCR or Ig genes indicates clonal prolifer-ation and possible malignancy of T or Bcells, the absence of such a fragmentdoes not rule out cancer of a populationof lymphoid cells. The cell involved maynot contain rearranged TCR or Ig genesthat can be detected by the method used,either because of its developmental stageor because it is of another lineage ( /H9253/H9254T cells, for example). If the DNA fragment test and other di- agnostic criteria indicate that the patienthas a lymphoid cell cancer, treatment by T-cell cancers, which include leukemia and lymphoma, involve the un-controlled proliferation of a clonal popu-lation of T cells. Successful treatmentrequires quick and certain diagnosis inorder to apply the most effective treat-ment. Once treatment is initiated, reli-able tests are needed to determinewhether the treatment regimen was suc-cessful. In principle, because T-cell can-cers are clonal in nature, the cellpopulation that is cancerous could beidentified and monitored by the expres-sion of its unique T-cell receptor mole-cules. However, this approach is rarelypractical because detection of a specificTCR molecule requires the tedious andlengthy preparation of a specific anti-body directed against its variable region(an anti-idiotype antibody). Also, surfaceexpression of the TCR molecule occurssomewhat late in the development of theT cell, so cancers stemming from T cellsthat have not progressed beyond an earlystage of development will not display aTCR molecule and will not be detected bythe antibody. An alternative means ofidentifying a clonal population of T cellsis to look at their DNA rather than pro-tein products. The pattern resulting fromrearrangement of the TCR genes canprovide a unique marker for the cancer-ous T cell. Because rearrangement of CLINICAL FOCUS T-Cell Rearrangements as Markers for Cancerous Cells Combinatorial joining of variable-region gene segments generates a large number of random gene combinations forall the TCR chains, as it does for the Ig heavy- and light-chain genes. For example, 100 V /H9251and 50 J /H9251gene segments can generate 5 /H11003103possible VJ combinations for the TCR /H9251chain. Similarly, 25 V /H9252,2 D /H9252, and 12 J /H9252gene segments can give 6 /H11003102possible combinations. Although there arefewer TCR V /H9251and V /H9252gene segments than immunoglobulin VHand V /H9251segments, this difference is offset by the greater number of J segments in TCR germ-line DNA.

When the DNA has rearranged, a 5/H11032restriction site will be excised. Digestion with EcoRI will yield a different fragment unique to the specific V /H9252and J /H9252 region gene segments incorporated into the rearranged gene, as indicated in this hypothetical example. The technique used for this analysis derives from that first used by S. M. Hedrick and his coworkers to detect unique TCR /H9252genes in a series of mouse T-cell clones (see inset to Figure 9-2). For highly sensitive detection of the rearranged TCR sequenc e, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used. The sequence of the 5/H11032primer (red bar) is based on a unique sequence in the (V /H9252) gene segment used by the cancerous clone (V /H92522in this example) and the 3/H11032primer (red bar) is a constant-region sequence. For chromosomes on which this V gene is not rearranged, the fragment will be absent because it is to o large to be efficiently amplified. plify, or synthesize multiple copies of, a specific DNA sequence in a sample;primers can hybridize to the two ends ofthat specific sequence and thus direct aDNA polymerase to copy it; see Figure23-13for details.) To detect a portion of the rearranged TCR DNA, amplificationusing a sequence from the rearranged Vregion as one primer and a sequencefrom the /H9252-chain C region as the other primer will yield a rearranged TCR DNAfragment of predicted size in sufficientquantity to be detected by electrophore-sis (see red arrow in the diagram). Re- cently, quantitative PCR methods havebeen used to follow patients who are inremission in order to make decisionsabout resuming treatment if the num-ber of cancerous cells, as estimated bythese techniques, has risen above a cer-tain level. Therefore, the presence of therearranged DNA in the clonal popula-tion of T cells gives the clinician a valu-able tool for diagnosing lymphoid-cellcancer and for monitoring the progressof treatment.radiation therapy or chemotherapy would follow. The success of this treatment canbe monitored by probing DNA from thepatient for the unique sequence found inthe cancerous cell. If the treatment regi-men is successful, the number of cancer-ous cells will decline greatly. If thenumber of cancerous cells falls below 1% or 2% of the total T-cell population, analysis by Southern blot may no longerdetect the unique fragment. In this case,a more sensitive technique, PCR, may beused. (With PCR it is possible to am- for the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor. Additional means to generate di- versity in the TCR V genes are described below, so 3 /H11003106 combinations represents a minimum estimate. As illustrated in Figure 9-8b, the location of one-turn (12-bp) and two-turn se-quences (RSSs) in TCR /H9252- and /H9254-chain DNA differs from that in Ig heavy-chain DNA. Because of the arrangement ofthe RSSs in TCR germ-line DNA, alternative joining of D gene segments can occur while the one-turn/two-turn join-ing rule is observed. Thus, it is possible for a V /H9252gene seg- ment to join directly with a J /H9252or a D /H9252gene segment, generating a (VJ) /H9252or (VDJ) /H9252unit. Alternative joining of /H9254-chain gene segments generates similar units; in addition, one D /H9254can join with PM Immunology 5e-:random selection of nucleotides (see Figure 9-8d). Some of these combinations, however, lead to nonproductive re-arrangements by inserting in-frame stop codons that prema-turely terminate the TCR chain, or by substituting aminoacids that render the product nonfunctional. Although eachjunctional region in a TCR gene encodes only 10-20 aminoacids, enormous diversity can be generated in these regions.Estimates suggest that the combined effects of P- and N-region nucleotide addition and joining flexibility can gener-ate as many as 10 13possible amino acid sequences in the TCR junctional regions alone. The mechanism by which diversity is generated for the TCR must allow the receptor to recognize a very large num-ber of different processed antigens while restricting itsMHC-recognition repertoire to a much smaller number ofself-MHC molecules. TCR DNA has far fewer V gene seg-ments than Ig DNA (see Table 9-3). It has been postulatedthat the smaller number of V gene segments in TCR DNAhave been selected to encode a limited number of CDR1 andCDR2 regions with affinity for regions of the /H9251helices of MHC molecules. Although this is an attractive idea, it is210 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses /H9254and, in humans, (VDDDJ) This nism, which cannot operate in Ig heavy-chain DNA, gener-ates considerable additional diversity in TCR genes. The joining of gene segments during TCR-gene re- arrangement exhibits junctional flexibility. As with the Ig genes, this flexibility can generate many nonproductive re-arrangements, but it also increases diversity by encoding sev-eral alternative amino acids at each junction (see Figure9-8c). In both Ig and TCR genes, nucleotides may be added atthe junctions between some gene segments during re-arrangement (see Figure 5-15). Variation in endonucleasecleavage leads to the addition of further nucleotides that arepalindromic. Such P-region nucleotide addition can occur in the genes encoding all the TCR and Ig chains. Addition ofN-region nucleotides, catalyzed by a terminal deoxynu- cleotidyl Whereas the addition N-region nucleotides inimmunoglobulins occurs only in the Ig heavy-chain genes, itoccurs in the genes encoding all the TCR chains.

Therefore the TCR residues thatbind to peptide versus those that bind MHC are not confinedsolely to the highly variable CDR3 region. In contrast to the limited diversity of CDR1 and CDR2, the CDR3 of the TCR has even greater diversity than thatseen in immunoglobulins. Diversity in CDR3 is generated byjunctional diversity in the joining of V , D, and J segments,joining of multiple D gene segments, and the introduction of P and N nucleotides at the V-D-J and V-J junctions (seeFigure 9-7). Unlike the Ig genes, the TCR genes do not appear to un- dergo extensive somatic mutation.

Although a few experimentshave provided evidence for somatic mutation of receptorgenes in T cells in the germinal center, this appears to be theexception and not the rule. T-Cell Receptor Complex: TCR-CD 3 As explained in Chapter 4, membrane-bound immunoglob- ulin on B cells associates with another membrane protein,the Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimer, to form the B-cell antigen recep- Figure 4-18). Similarly, the T-cell receptor associateswith CD3, forming the TCR-CD3 membrane complex. In both cases, the accessory molecule participates in signaltransduction after interaction of a B or T cell with antigen; it does not influence interaction with antigen. The first evidence suggesting that the T-cell receptor is as- sociated with another membrane molecule came from ex-periments in which fluorescent antibody to the receptor wasshown to cause aggregation of another membrane proteindesignated CD3. Later experiments by J. P . Allison and L. Lanier using cross-linking reagents demonstrated that the two chains must be within 12 \u00c5. Subsequent experimentsdemonstrated not only that CD3 is closely associated withthe /H9251/H9252heterodimer but also that its expression is required for membrane expression of /H9251/H9252and /H9253/H9254T-cell receptors\u2014each heterodimer forms a complex with CD3 on the T-cell mem-brane. Loss of the genes encoding either CD3 or the TCRchains results in loss of the entire molecular complex fromthe membrane. CD3 is a complex of five invariant polypeptide chains that associate to form three dimers: a heterodimer of gamma andepsilon chains ( /H9253/H9280), a of delta and epsilon chains (/H9254/H9280), and a homodimer of two zeta chains ( /H9256/H9256) or a heterodimer of zeta and eta chains ( /H9256/H9257) (Figure 9-9). The /H9256and /H9257chains are encoded by the same gene, but differ in their carboxyl-terminalends because of differences in RNA splicing of the primarytranscript. About 90% of the CD3 complexes examined to dateincorporate have the ( heterodimer. The T-cell receptor complex can dimers: the /H9251/H9252or /H9253/H9254TCR dimers(/H9253/H9280,/H9254/H9280, and /H9256/H9256or /H9256/H9257) are required for membrane expression of the T-cell receptor and for signal transduction.212 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 9-9Schematic diagram of the TCR-CD 3complex, which constitutes the T-cell antigen-binding receptor. The CD 3complex consists of the /H9256/H9256homodimer (alternately, a /H9256/H9257heterodimer) plus /H9253/H9280 and /H9254/H9280heterodimers. The external domains of the /H9253, /H9254, and /H9280chains of CD 3are similar to the immunoglobulin fold, which facilitates their interaction with the T-cell receptor and each other. Ionic inte ractionsalso may occur between the oppositely charged transmembrane re- gions in the TCR and CD 3chains. The long cytoplasmic tails of the CD3chains contain a common sequence, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which functions in sign al transduction.NH2 S SS SS SS SS SS SSSS SS 9023 91 134 Immunology 5e:The CD3 are members immuno- globulin superfamily, each containing an immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain followed by a transmembraneregion and a cytoplasmic domain of more than 40 aminoacids. The /H9256chain has a distinctly different structure, with a very short external region of only 9 amino acids, a trans-membrane region, and a long cytoplasmic tail containing 113amino acids. The transmembrane region of all the CD3polypeptide chains contains a negatively charged asparticacid residue that interacts with one or two positively chargedamino acids in the transmembrane region of each TCRchain. The cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 chains contain a motif called the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation mo- tif (ITAM). ITAMs are found in a number of other receptors, including the Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimer of the B-cell receptor complex and the Fc receptors for IgE and IgG. The ITAMsites have been shown to interact with tyrosine kinases and toplay an important role in signal transduction. In CD3, the /H9253, /H9254, and /H9280chains each contain a single copy of ITAM, whereas the /H9256and /H9257chains contain three copies (see Figure 9-9). The function of CD3 in signal transduction is described morefully in Chapter 10. T-Cell Accessory Membrane Molecules Although recognition of antigen-MHC complexes is medi- ated solely by the TCR-CD3 complex, various other mem-brane molecules play important accessory roles in antigenrecognition and T-cell activation (Table 9-4). Some of thesemolecules strengthen the interaction between T cells andantigen-presenting cells or target cells, some act in signal transduction, and some do both. CD4and CD 8Coreceptors Bind to Conserved Regions of MHC Class II or I Molecules. T cells can be subdivided into two populations according to their expression of CD4 or CD8 membrane molecules. As de-scribed in preceding chapters, CD4 /H11001T cells recognize anti- gen that is combined with class II MHC molecules andfunction largely as helper cells, whereas CD8 /H11001T cells recog- nize antigen that is combined with class I MHC moleculesand function largely as cytotoxic cells. CD4 is a 55-kDamonomeric membrane glycoprotein that contains domains (D 1-D 4), a hy- drophobic transmembrane and a long cytoplasmictail (Figure 9-10) containing three serine residues that can bephosphorylated. CD8 generally takes the form of a disulfide-linked /H9251/H9252heterodimer or of an /H9251/H9251homodimer. Both the /H9251and are small glycoproteins of ap- proximately kDa. Each chain consists of a single ex-tracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Figure 9-10)containing 25-27 residues, several of which can be phos-phorylated. CD4 and CD8 are classified as coreceptors based on their abilities to recognize the peptide-MHC complex and theirroles in signal transduction. The extracellular domains ofCD4 and CD8 to regions of MHC mole-cules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or target cells. Crys-tallographic studies of a complex composed of the class IMHC molecule HLA-A2, an antigenic peptide, and a CD8/H9251/H9251homodimer indicate that CD8 binds to class I moleculesT-Cell Receptor CHAPTER 9 213 TABLE 9-4Selected T-cell accessory molecules FUNCTION Signal Member of Name / Immunology 5e-:by contacting the MHC class I /H92512 and /H92513 domains as well as having some contact with /H92522-microglobulin (Figure 9-11a). The orientation of the class I /H92513 domain changes slightly upon binding to CD8. This structure is consistent with a sin-gle MHC molecule binding to CD8; no evidence for the pos-sibility of multimeric class I-CD8 complexes was observed.Similar structural data document the mode by which CD4binds to the class II molecule. The contact between CD4 andMHC II involves contact of the membrane-distal domain ofCD4 with a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues from the/H92512 and /H92522 domains of MHC II. CD4 facilitates signal trans- duction and T-cell activation of cells recognizing class II-peptide complexes (Figure 9-11b). Whether there are differences between the roles played by the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors remains open to speculation.Despite the similarities in structure, recall that the nature ofthe binding of peptide to class I and class II molecules differsin that class I has a closed groove that binds a short peptidewith a higher degree of specificity. Recent data shown belowindicate that the angle at which the TCR approaches the pep-tide MHC complex differs between class I and II. The differ-ences in roles played by the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors maybe due to these differences in binding requirements. As willbe explained in Chapter 10, binding of the CD4 and CD8molecules serves to transmit stimulatory signals to the Tcells; the signal-transduction properties of both CD4 and214 PART II Generation of B-Cell and CD 4and CD 8coreceptors. CD8may take the form of an /H9251/H9252heterodimer, or an /H9251/H9251homodimer. The monomeric CD 4molecule contains four Ig-fold domains; each chain in the CD 8molecule contains one.

Re- cent data on the interaction between CD4 and the peptide-class II complex indicates that there is very weak affinity between them, suggesting that recruitment of molecules involved in signal transduction may be the major role forCD4. Affinity of TCR for Peptide-MHC Complexes Is Weak Compared with Antibody Binding The affinity of T-cell receptors for peptide-MHC complexes is low to moderate, with Kdvalues ranging from 10/H110024 to 10/H110027M. This level of affinity is weak compared with antigen-antibody interactions, which generally have Kdval- ues ranging from 10/H110026to 10/H1100210M (Figure 9-12a). However, T-cell interactions do not depend solely on binding by theTCR; cell-adhesion molecules strengthen the bond between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell or a target cell. Severalaccessory membrane molecules, including CD2, LFA-1,CD28, and CD45R bind independently to other ligands onantigen-presenting cells or target cells (see Table 9-4 andFigure 9-12b). Once cell-to-cell contact has been made bythe molecules, the T-cell receptor may scan themembrane for peptide-MHC complexes.

Soon after ac-tivation, the degree of adhesion declines and the T cell de-taches from the antigen-presenting cell or target cell. LikeCD4 and CD8, some of these other molecules also functionas signal-transducers. Their important role is demonstratedby the ability of monoclonal antibodies specific for thebinding sites of the cell-adhesion molecules to block T-cellactivation. Three-Dimensional Structures of TCR-Peptide-MHC Complexes The interaction between the T-cell receptor and an antigen bound to an MHC molecule is central to both humoral andcell-mediated responses. The molecular elements of this in-teraction have now been described in detail by x-ray crys-tallography for TCR molecules binding to peptide-MHCclass I and class II complexes. A three-dimensional struc-ture has been determined for the trimolecular complex, in-cluding TCR /H9251and /H9252chains and an HLA-A2 molecule to which an antigenic peptide is bound. Separate studies de-scribe a mouse TCR molecule bound to peptides com-plexed with the mouse class I molecule H-2K band with the mouse class II IAkmolecule. The comparisons of the TCR complexed with either class I or class II suggest that thereare differences in how the TCR contacts the MHC-peptidecomplex. Newly added to our library of TCR structures isthat of a /H9253/H9254receptor bound to an antigen that does not re- quire processing. From x-ray analysis, the TCR-peptide-MHC complex consists of a single TCR molecule bound to a single MHCmolecule and its peptide. The TCR contacts the MHC mole-cule through the TCR variable domains (Figure 9-13 a,b).Although the structures of the constant region of the TCR /H9251 chain and the MHC /H92513 domain were not clearly established by studies of the crystallized human complexes (see Figure9-13a), the overall area of contact and the structure of thecomplete TCR variable regions were clear. The constant re-gions were established by studies of the mouse complex,which showed the orientation proposed for the humanmodels (see Figure 9-13b). Viewing the MHC molecule withits bound peptide from above, we can see that the TCR is sit-uated across it diagonally, relative to the long dimension ofthe peptide (Figure 9-13c). The CDR3 loops of the TCR /H9251 and /H9252chains meet in the center of the peptide; and the CDR1 loop of the TCR /H9251chain is at the N terminus of the peptide, while CDR1 of the /H9252chain is at the C terminus of the peptide. The CDR2 loops are in contact with the MHCmolecule; CDR2 /H9251is over the /H92512 domain alpha helix and CDR2 /H9252over the /H92511 domain alpha helix (Figure 9-13c). A space-filling model of the binding site viewed from above(looking down into the MHC cleft) indicates that the pep-tide is buried beneath the TCR and therefore is not seenfrom this angle (Figure 9-13d). The data also show that the fourth hypervariable regions of the /H9251and /H9252chains are not in contact with the antigenic peptide. As predicted from data for immunoglobulins, the recog- nition of the peptide-MHC complex occurs through thevariable loops in the TCR structure. CDR1 and CDR3 fromboth the TCR /H9251and the TCR /H9252chain contact the peptide and a large area of the MHC molecule. The peptide isburied (see Figure 9-13d) more deeply in the MHC mole-cule than it is in the TCR, and the TCR molecule fits acrossthe MHC molecule, contacting it through a flat surface ofthe TCR at the \"high points\" on the MHC molecule. Thefact that the CDR1 region contacts both peptide and MHCsuggests that regions other than CDR3 are involved in pep-tide binding. TCRs Interact Differently with Class I and Class II Molecules Can the conclusions drawn from the three-dimensional structure of TCR-peptide-class I complexes be extrapo-lated to interactions of TCR with class II complexes? EllisReinherz and his colleagues resolved this question by analy-sis of a TCR molecule in complex with a mouse class II mol-ecule and its specific antigen. While the structures of thepeptide-binding regions in class I and class II molecules aresimilar, Chapter 7 showed that there are differences in howthey accommodate bound peptide (see Figures 7-10a andb). A comparison of the interactions of a TCR with class IMHC-peptide and class II-peptide reveals a significantdifference in the angle at which the TCR molecule sits onthe MHC complexes (Figure 9-14). Also notable is a greaternumber of contact residues between TCR and class IIMHC, which is consistent with the known higher affinity ofinteraction. However, it remains to be seen whether the ev-ident difference in the number of contact points will be truefor all class I and II structures.

However,as noted in Chapter 7, MHC molecules were first identifiedbecause of their role in rejection of foreign tissue. Graft-rejection reactions result from the direct response of T cellsto MHC molecules, which function as histocompatibility antigens. Because of the extreme polymorphism of the MHC, most individuals of the same species have unique setsof MHC molecules, or histocompatibility antigens, and areconsidered to be allogeneic, a term used to describe geneti- cally different individuals of the same species (see Chapter21). Therefore, T cells respond even to allografts (grafts from members of the same species), and MHC molecules are con-sidered alloantigens. Generally, CD4 /H11001T cells are alloreactive to class II alloantigens, and CD8/H11001T cells respond to class I alloantigens. The alloreactivity of T cells is puzzling for two reasons. First, the ability of T cells to respond to allogeneic histocom-patibility antigens alone appears to contradict all the evi-dence indicating that T cells can respond only to foreignantigen plus self-MHC molecules. In responding to allo- geneic grafts, however, T cells recognize a foreign MHC mol- ecule directly. A second problem posed by the T-cell responseto allogeneic MHC molecules is that the frequency of allore-active T cells is quite high; it has been estimated that 1%-5%of all T cells are reactive to a given alloantigen, which ishigher than the normal frequency of T cells reactive with anyparticular foreign antigenic peptide plus self-MHC mole-cule. This high frequency of alloreactive T cells appears tocontradict the basic tenet of clonal selection. If 1 T cell in 20reacts with a given alloantigen and if one assumes there areon the order of 100 distinct H-2 haplotypes in mice, thenthere are not enough distinct T-cell specificities to cover allthe H-2 alloantigens, let alone antigens dis-played by self-MHC molecules. One possible and biologically satisfying explanation for the high frequency of alloreactive T cells is that a particularT-cell receptor specific for a foreign antigenic peptide plusa self-MHC molecule can also cross-react with certain allo-geneic MHC molecules. In other words, if an allogeneicMHC molecule plus allogeneic peptide structurally resem-bles a processed foreign peptide plus self-MHC same T-cell receptor may recognize both peptide-MHCcomplexes. Since allogeneic cells express on the order of 10 5 class I MHC molecules per cell, T cells bearing low-affinitycross-reactive receptors might be able to bind by virtue ofthe high density of membrane alloantigen. Foreign antigen,on the other hand, would be sparsely displayed on themembrane of an antigen-presenting cell or altered self-cellassociated with class I or class II MHC molecules, limitingresponsiveness to only those T cells bearing high-affinityreceptors.Information relevant to mechanisms for alloreactivity was gained by Reiser and colleagues, who determined the struc-ture of a mouse TCR complexed with an allogeneic class Imolecule containing a bound octapeptide. This analysis re-vealed a structure similar to those reported for TCR bound toclass I self-MHC complexes, leading the authors to concludethat allogeneic recognition is not unlike recognition of self-MHC antigens. The absence of negative selection for the pep-tides contained in the foreign MHC molecules cancontribute to the high frequency of alloreactive T cells. Thiscondition, coupled with the differences in the structure ofthe exposed portions of the allogeneic MHC molecule, mayaccount for the phenomenon of alloreactivity. An explana-tion for the large number of alloreactive cells can be found inthe large number of potential antigens provided by the for-eign molecule plus the possible peptide antigens bound bythem. SUMMARY IMost T-cell receptors, unlike antibodies, do not react withsoluble antigen but rather with processed antigen boundto a self-MHC molecule; certain /H9253/H9254receptors recognize antigens not processed and presented with MHC.

Aside from being the main source of allT cells, it is where T cells diversify and then are shaped into an effective primary T-cell repertoire by an extraordinary pair ofselection processes. One of these, positive selection, permits the survival of only those T cells whose TCRs are capable ofrecognizing self-MHC molecules. It is thus responsible forthe creation of a self-MHC-restricted repertoire of T cells.The other, negative selection, eliminates T cells that react too strongly with self-MHC or with self-MHC plus self-peptides. It is an extremely important factor in generating a primary T-cell repertoire that is self-tolerant. As shown in Figure 10-1, when T-cell precursors arrive at the thymus, they do not express such signature surface mark-ers of T cells as the T-cell receptor, the CD3 complex, or thecoreceptors CD4 and CD8. In fact, these progenitor cells have chapter 10 IT-Cell Maturation and the Thymus IThymic Selection of the T-Cell Repertoire ITH-Cell Death and T-Cell Populations IPeripheral /H9253/H9254T-CellsT-Cell Maturation, Activation, andDifferentiation T recognition by most T cells from recognition by Bcells is MHC restriction. In most cases, both the maturation of progenitor T cells in the thymus and the acti-vation of mature T cells in the periphery are influenced bythe involvement of MHC molecules. The potential antigenicdiversity of the T-cell population is reduced during matura-tion by a selection process that allows only MHC-restrictedand nonself-reactive T cells to mature. The final stages in thematuration of most T cells proceed along two different de-velopmental pathways, which generate functionally distinctCD4 /H11001and CD8/H11001subpopulations that exhibit class II and class I MHC restriction, respectively. Activation of mature peripheral T cells begins with the interaction of the T-cell receptor (TCR) with an antigenicpeptide displayed in the groove of an MHC molecule. Al-though the specificity of this interaction is governed by theTCR, its low avidity necessitates the involvement of corecep-tors and other accessory membrane molecules thatstrengthen the TCR-antigen-MHC interaction and trans-duce the activating signal. Activation leads to the prolifera-tion and differentiation of T cells into various types ofeffector cells and memory T cells. Because the vast majorityof thymocytes and peripheral T cells express the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor rather than the /H9253/H9254T-cell receptor, all references to the T-cell receptor in this chapter denote the /H9251/H9252receptor un- less otherwise indicated. Similarly, unless otherwise indi-cated, all references to T cells denote those /H9251/H9252receptor- bearing T cells that undergo MHC restriction. T-Cell Maturation and the Thymus Progenitor T cells from the early sites of hematopoiesis beginto migrate to the thymus at about day 11 of gestation in miceand in the eighth or ninth week of gestation in humans. In amanner similar to B-cell maturation in the bone marrow, T-cell maturation involves rearrangements of the germ-lineTCR genes and the expression of various membrane mark-ers. In the thymus, developing T cells, known as thymocytes, proliferate and differentiate along developmental pathwaysthat generate functionally distinct subpopulations of matureT Mac 83:379_kyw :not yet rearranged their TCR genes and do not express pro- teins, such as RAG-1 and RAG-2, that are required for re-arrangement. After arriving at the thymus, these T-cellprecursors enter the outer cortex and slowly proliferate. Dur-ing approximately three weeks of development in the thy-mus, the differentiating T cells progress through a series ofstages that are marked by characteristic changes in their cell-surface phenotype. For example, as mentioned previously,thymocytes early in development lack detectable CD4 andCD8. Because these cells are CD4 /H11002CD8/H11002, they are referred to as double-negative (DN) cells. Even though these coreceptors are not expressed during the DN early stages, the differentiation program is progress-ing and is marked by changes in the expression of such cellsurface molecules as c-Kit, CD44, and CD25. The initial thy-mocyte population displays c-Kit, the receptor for stem-cellgrowth factor, and CD44, an adhesion molecule involved inhoming; CD25, the /H9252-chain of the IL-2 receptor, also appears222 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses on early-stage DN cells. During this period, the cells are pro- liferating but the TCR genes remain unrearranged. Then thecells stop expressing c-Kit, markedly reduce CD44 expres-sion, turn on expression of the recombinase genes RAG-1 and RAG-2 and begin to rearrange their TCR genes. Al- though it is not shown in Figure 10-1, a small percentage(/H110215%) of thymocytes productively rearrange the /H9254-chain genes and develop into double-negative CD3 /H11001/H9253/H9254 T cells. In mice, this thymocyte subpopulation can be detectedby day 14 of gestation, reaches maximal numbers betweendays 17 and 18, and then declines until birth (Figure 10-2). Most double-negative thymocytes progress down the /H9251/H9252 developmental pathway. They stop proliferating and begin torearrange the TCR /H9252-chain genes, then express the /H9252chain. Those cells of the /H9251/H9252lineage that fail to productively re- arrange and express /H9252chains die. Newly synthesized /H9252chains combine with a 33-kDa glycoprotein known as the pre-T /H9251 chain and associate with the CD3 group to form a novel com-VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 10-1Development of /H9251/H9252 T cells in the mouse.

IRenders the cell permissive for rearrangement of theTCR /H9251chain. IInduces developmental progression to the CD4/H110018/H11001 double-positive state. After advancing to the double-positive (DP) stage, where both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors are expressed, the thymo-cytes begin to proliferate. However, during this proliferativephase, TCR /H9251-chain gene rearrangement does not occur; both the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes are transcriptionally ac- tive, but the RAG-2 protein is rapidly degraded in proliferat-ing cells, so rearrangement of the /H9251-chain genes cannot take place. The rearrangement of /H9251-chain genes does not begin until the double-positive thymocytes stop proliferating andRAG-2 protein levels increase. The proliferative phase priorto the rearrangement of the /H9251-chain increases the diversity of the T-cell repertoire by generating a clone of cells with a sin-gle TCR /H9252-chain rearrangement. Each of the cells within this clone can then rearrange a different /H9251-chain gene, thereby generating a much more diverse population than if the orig-inal cell had first undergone rearrangement at both the /H9252- and /H9251-chain loci before it proliferated. In mice, the TCR /H9251- chain genes are not expressed until day 16 or 17 of gestation;double-positive cells expressing both CD3 and the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor begin to appear at day 17 and reach maximal levelsabout the time of birth (see Figure 10-2). The possession of acomplete TCR enables DP thymocytes to undergo the rigorsof positive and negative selection. T-cell development is an expensive process for the host.

Nonetheless, the most distinctive property of mature T cells is that they recognizeonly foreign antigen combined with self-MHC molecules. As noted, thymocytes undergo two selection processes in the thymus: IPositive selection for thymocytes bearing receptorscapable of binding self-MHC molecules, which results inMHC restriction. Cells that fail positive selection are eliminated within the thymus by apoptosis. INegative selection that eliminates thymocytes bearinghigh-affinity receptors for self-MHC molecules alone orself-antigen presented by self-MHC, which results inself-tolerance. Both processes are necessary to generate mature T cells that are self-MHC restricted and self-tolerant. As noted already,some 98% or more of all thymocytes die by apoptosis withinthe thymus. The bulk of this high death rate appears to reflecta weeding out of thymocytes that fail positive selection be-cause their receptors do not specifically recognize foreignantigen plus self-MHC molecules. Early evidence for the role of the thymus in selection of the T-cell repertoire came from chimeric mouse experi-ments by R. M. Zinkernagel and his colleagues (Figure 10-4). These researchers implanted thymectomized and ir-radiated (A /H11003B) F with a B-type thymus and then reconstituted the animal's immune system with an intra-venous infusion of F 1bone-marrow cells. T o be certain that the thymus graft did not contain any mature T cells, it wasirradiated before being transplanted. In such an experi-mental system, T-cell progenitors from the (A /H11003B) F 1 bone-marrow transplant mature within a thymus that ex- presses only B-haplotype MHC molecules on its stromalcells. Would these (A /H11003B) F 1T cells now be MHC- restricted for the haplotype of the thymus? T o answer thisquestion, the chimeric mice were infected with LCM virusand the immature T cells were then tested for their ability tokill LCM-infected target cells from the strain A or strain Bmice. As shown in Figure 10-4, when T Ccells from the chimeric mice were tested on LCM virus infected targetcells from strain A or strain B mice, they could only lyseLCM-infected target cells from strain B mice. These micehave the same MHC haplotype, B, as the implanted thymus.Thus, the MHC haplotype of the thymus in which T cellsdevelop determines their MHC restriction. Thymic stromal cells, including epithelial cells, macro- phages, and dendritic cells, play essential roles in positive andnegative selection. These cells express class I MHC moleculesand can display high levels of class II MHC also. The interac-tion of immature thymocytes that express the TCR-CD3complex with populations of thymic stromal cells results inpositive and negative selection by mechanisms that are underintense investigation. First, we'll examine the details of eachselection process and then study some experiments that pro-vide insights into the operation of these processes. Positive Selection Ensures MHC Restriction Positive selection takes place in the cortical region of the thy - mus and involves the interaction of immature thymocyteswith cortical epithelial cells (Figure 10-5). There is evidencethat the T-cell receptors on thymocytes tend to cluster with224 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 10-4Experimental demonstration that the thymus selects for maturation only those T cells whose T-cell receptors recogn ize antigen presented on target cells with the haplotype of the thy mus. Thymectomized and lethally irradiated (A /H11003B) F 1mice were grafted with a strain-B thymus and reconstituted with (A /H11003B) F 1bone- marrow cells. After infection with the LCM virus, the CTL cells were assayed for their ability to kill 51Cr-labeled strain-A or strain-B target cells infected with the LCM virus. Only strain-B target cells w ere lysed, suggesting that the H- 2bgrafted thymus had selected for maturation only those T cells that could recognize antigen comb ined with (H-2a/b) Infect with LCM virus Spleen cells CONTROL Infect with LCM virus (A B)F1 2nd shift:1268_tm:8536d:MHC molecules on the cortical cells at sites of cell-cell con- tact. Some researchers have suggested that these interactionsallow the immature thymocytes to receive a protective signalthat prevents them from undergoing cell death; cells whosereceptors are not able to bind MHC molecules would not in-teract with the thymic epithelial cells and consequentlywould not receive the protective signal, leading to their deathby apoptosis.During positive selection, the RAG-1, RAG-2, and TdT proteins required for gene rearrangement and modificationcontinue to be expressed. Thus each of the immature thymo-cytes in a clone expressing a given /H9252chain have an opportu- nity to rearrange different TCR /H9251-chain genes, and the resulting TCRs are then selected for self-MHC recognition.Only those cells whose /H9251/H9252TCR heterodimer recognizes a self-MHC molecule are selected for survival. Consequently,the presence of more than one combination of /H9251/H9252TCR chains among members of the clone is important because itincreases the possibility that some members will \"pass\" thetest for positive selection. Any cell that manages to rearrangean /H9251chain that allows the resulting /H9251/H9252TCR to recognize self- MHC will be spared; all members of the clone that fail to doso will die by apoptosis within 3 to 4 days. Negative Selection Ensures Self-Tolerance The population of MHC-restricted thymocytes that survivepositive selection comprises some cells with low-affinity re-ceptors for self-antigen presented by self-MHC moleculesand other cells with high-affinity receptors. The latter thy-mocytes undergo negative selection by an interaction withthymic stromal cells. During negative selection, dendriticcells and macrophages bearing class I and class II MHC mol-ecules interact with thymocytes bearing high-affinity recep-tors for self-antigen self-MHC molecules or forself-MHC molecules alone (see Figure 10-5). However, theprecise details of the process are not yet known. Cells that ex-perience negative selection are observed to undergo death byapoptosis. T olerance to self-antigens encountered in the thy-mus is thereby achieved by eliminating T cells that are reac-tive to these antigens. Experiments Revealed the Essential Elements of Positive and Negative Selection Direct evidence that binding of thymocytes to class I or class II MHC molecules is required for positive selection in thethymus came from experimental studies with knockout miceincapable of producing functional class I or class II MHCmolecules (Table 10-1). Class I-deficient mice were found tohave a normal distribution of double-negative, double-posi-tive, and CD4 /H11001thymocytes, but failed to double-negative,double-positive, and CD8 /H11001thymocytes but lacked CD4/H11001 thymocytes. Not surprisingly, the lymph nodes of these classII-deficient mice lacked CD4 /H11001T cells. Thus, the absence of class I or II MHC molecules prevents positive selection ofCD8 /H11001or CD4/H11001T cells, respectively. Further experiments with transgenic mice provided addi- tional evidence that interaction with MHC molecules plays arole in positive selection. In these experiments, rearranged/H9251/H9252-TCR genes derived from a CD8 /H11001T-cell clone specific for influenza antigen plus H-2kclass I MHC molecules were in- jected into fertilized eggs from two different mouse strains,T-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 225 FIGURE 10-5Positive and negative selection of thymocytes in the thymus.

Since the receptor transgenes were al-ready rearranged, other TCR-gene rearrangements weresuppressed in the transgenic mice; therefore, a high percent-age of the thymocytes in the transgenic mice expressed the T-cell receptor encoded by the transgene. Thymocytes expressing the TCR transgene were found to mature intoCD8 /H11001T cells only in the transgenic mice with the H-2kclass I MHC haplotype (i.e., the haplotype for which the transgenereceptor was restricted). In transgenic mice with a differentMHC haplotype (H-2 d), immature, double-positive thymo- cytes expressing the transgene were present, but these thy-mocytes failed to mature into CD8 /H11001T cells. These findings confirmed that interaction between T-cell receptors on im-mature thymocytes and self-MHC molecules is required forpositive selection. In the absence of self-MHC molecules, asin the H-2 dtransgenic mice, positive selection and subse- quent maturation do not occur. Evidence for deletion of thymocytes reactive with self- antigen plus MHC molecules comes from a number of ex-perimental systems. In one system, thymocyte maturationwas analyzed in transgenic mice bearing an /H9251/H9252TCR trans- gene specific for the class I D bMHC molecule plus H-Y anti- gen, a small protein that is encoded on the Y chromosomeand is therefore a self-molecule only in male mice. In this ex-periment, the MHC haplotype of the transgenic mice was H-2 b, the same as the MHC restriction of the transgene- encoded receptor. Therefore any differences in the selectionof thymocytes in male and female transgenics would be re-lated to the presence or absence of H-Y antigen. Analysis of thymocytes in the transgenic mice revealed that female mice contained thymocytes expressing the H-Y-specific TCR transgene, but male mice did not (Figure 10-7).In other words, H-Y-reactive thymocytes were self-reactivein the male mice and were eliminated. However, in the femaletransgenics, which did not express the H-Y antigen, thesecells were not self-reactive and thus were not eliminated.When thymocytes from these male transgenic mice were cul-tured in vitro with antigen-presenting cells expressing the H-Y antigen, the thymocytes were observed to undergoapoptosis, providing a striking example of negative selection. Some Central Issues in Thymic Selection Remain Unresolved Although a great deal has been learned about the develop- mental processes that generate mature CD4/H11001and CD8/H11001T cells, some mysteries persist. Prominent among them is aseeming paradox: If positive selection allows only thymo-cytes reactive with self-MHC molecules to survive, and nega-tive selection eliminates the self-MHC-reactive thymo-cytes, then no T cells would be allowed to mature. Since thisis not the outcome of T-cell development, clearly, other fac-tors operate to prevent these two MHC-dependent processesfrom eliminating the entire repertoire of MHC-restricted Tcells. Experimental evidence from fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) has been helpful in resolving this puzzle. In this sys-tem, mouse thymic lobes are excised at a gestational age of day16 and placed in culture. At this time, the lobes consist pre-dominantly of CD4 /H110028/H11002thymocytes. Because these immature, double-negative thymocytes continue to develop in the organculture, thymic selection can be studied under conditions thatpermit a range of informative experiments. Particular use has226 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 10-1Effect of class I or II MHC deficiency on thymocyte populations* KNOCKOUT MICE Control Class I Class II Cell type mice deficient distribution of indicated cell types in thymus.

FIGURE 10-6Effect of host haplotype on T-cell maturation in mice carrying transgenes encoding an H- 2bclass I-restricted T-cell recep- tor specific for influenza virus. The presence of the rearrange d TCR transgenes suppressed other gene rearrangements in the transgen - ics; therefore, most of the thymocytes in the transgenics expre ssed the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor encoded by the transgene. Immature double- positive thymocytes matured into CD 8/H11001T cells only in transgenics with the haplotype (H- 2k) corresponding to the MHC restriction of the of mice in which the peptide transporter, TAP-1, has been knocked out. In the absence of TAP-1, only low levelsof MHC class I are expressed on thymic cells, and the develop-ment of CD8 /H11001thymocytes is blocked. However, when exoge- nous peptides are added to these organ cultures, thenpeptide-bearing class I MHC molecules appear on the surfaceof the thymic cells, and development of CD8 /H11001T cells is re- stored. Significantly, when a diverse peptide mixture is added,the extent of CD8 /H11001T-cell restoration is greater than when a single peptide is added. This indicates that the role of peptideis not simply to support stable MHC expression but also to berecognized itself in the selection process. Two competing hypotheses attempt to explain the para- dox of MHC-dependent positive and negative selection. Theavidity hypothesis asserts that differences in the strength of the signals received by thymocytes undergoing positive andnegative selection determine the outcome, with signalstrength dictated by the avidity of the TCR-MHC-peptide in-teraction. The differential-signaling hypothesis holds that the outcomes of selection are dictated by different signals, ratherthan different strengths of the same signal. The avidity hypothesis was tested with TAP-1 knockout mice transgenic for an /H9251/H9252TCR that recognized an LCM virus peptide-MHC complex. These mice were used to prepare fe-tal thymic organ cultures (Figure 10-8). The avidity of theTCR-MHC interaction was varied by the use of differentconcentrations of peptide. At low peptide concentrations, few MHC molecules bound peptide and the avidity of theTCR-MHC interaction was low. As peptide concentrationswere raised, the number of peptide-MHC complexes dis-played increased and so did the avidity of the interaction. Inthis experiment, very few CD8 /H11001cells appeared when peptide was not added, but even low concentrations of the relevantpeptide resulted in the appearance of significant numbers ofCD8 /H11001T cells bearing the transgenic TCR receptor. Increas- ing the peptide concentrations to an optimum range yieldedthe highest number of CD8 /H11001T cells. However, at higher con- centrations of peptide, the numbers of CD8/H11001T cells pro- duced declined steeply. The results of these experimentsshow that positive and negative selection can be achievedwith signals generated by the same peptide-MHC combina-tion. No signal (no peptide) fails to support positive selec-tion. A weak signal (low peptide level) induces positiveselection. However, too strong a signal (high peptide level)results in negative selection. The differential-signaling model provides an alternative explanation for determining whether a T cell undergoes posi-tive or negative selection. This model is a qualitative ratherthan a quantitative one, and it emphasizes the nature of thesignal delivered by the TCR rather than its strength. At thecore of this model is the observation that some MHC-peptidecomplexes can deliver only a weak or partly activating signalT-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 227 FIGURE 10-7Experimental demonstration that negative selection of thymocytes requires self-anti-gen plus self-MHC. In this experiment, H- 2 bmale and female transgenics were prepared carrying TCRtransgenes specific for H-Y antigen plus the D bmol- ecule. This antigen is expressed only in males. FACSanalysis of thymocytes from the transgenics showedthat mature CD 8 /H11001T cells expressing the transgene were absent in the male mice but present in the fe-male mice, suggesting that thymocytes reactive witha self-antigen (in this case, H-Y antigen in the malemice) are deleted during thymic selection.

In this model, pos- itive selection takes place when the TCRs of developing thy-mocytes encounter MHC-peptide complexes that deliverweak or partial signals to their receptors, and negative selec-tion results when the signal is complete. At this point it is no t possible to decide between the avidity model and the differen-tial-signaling model; both have experimental support. It maybe that in some cases, one of these mechanisms operates to thecomplete exclusion of the other. It is also possible that no sin-gle mechanism accounts for all the outcomes in the cellularinteractions that take place in the thymus and more than onemechanism may play a significant role. Further work is re-quired to complete our understanding of this matter. The differential expression of the coreceptor CD8 also can affect thymic selection. In an experiment in which CD8 ex-pression was artificially raised to twice its normal level, the concentration of mature CD8 /H11001cells in the thymus was one- thirteenth of the concentration in control mice bearing nor-mal levels of CD8 on their surface. Since the interaction of Tcells with class I MHC molecules is strengthened by partici-pation of CD8, perhaps the increased expression of CD8would increase the avidity of thymocytes for class I mole-cules, possibly making their negative selection more likely. Another important open question in thymic selection is how double-positive thymocytes are directed to CD4 /H110018/H11002or CD4/H110028/H11001T cells .Selection of CD4/H110018/H11001thy- mocytes gives class I MHC-restricted CD8/H11001T cells and class II-restricted CD4/H11001T cells. Two models have been proposed to explain the transformation of a double-positiveprecursor into one of two different single-positive lineages228 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 10-8Role of peptides in selection.

Varying the amount of added pep-tide revealed that low concentrations ofpeptide, producing low avidity of binding, re-sulted in positive selection and nearly normallevels of CD 4 /H11002CD8/H11001cells. High concentra- tions of peptide, producing high avidity ofbinding to the TCR, caused negative selection, and few CD 4 /H11002CD8/H11001T cells appeared. [Adapted from Ashton Rickardt et al.

The instructional model postulates that the multiple interactions between the TCR, CD8/H11001or CD4/H11001 coreceptors, and class I or class II MHC molecules instructthe cells to differentiate into either CD8 /H11001or CD4/H11001single- positive cells, respectively. This model would predict that aclass I MHC-specific TCR together with the CD8 coreceptorwould generate a signal that is different from the signal in-duced by a class II MHC-specific TCR together with theCD4 coreceptor. The stochastic model suggests that CD4 or CD8 expression is switched off randomly with no relation tothe specificity of the TCR. Only those thymocytes whoseTCR and remaining coreceptor recognize the same class ofMHC molecule will mature. At present, it is not possible tochoose one model over the other. TH-Cell Activation The central event in the generation of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses is the activation and clonal ex-pansion of T Hcells. Activation of T Ccells, which is generally similar to T H-cell activation, is described in Chapter 14. T H- cell activation is initiated by interaction of the TCR-CD3complex with a processed antigenic peptide bound to a classII MHC molecule on the surface of an antigen-presentingcell. This interaction and the resulting activating signals alsoinvolve various accessory membrane molecules on the T H cell and the antigen-presenting cell. Interaction of a T Hcell with antigen initiates a cascade of biochemical events that in-duces the resting T Hcell to enter the cell cycle, proliferatingand differentiating into memory cells or effector cells. Many of the gene products that appear upon interaction with anti-gen can be grouped into one of three categories dependingon how early they can be detected after antigen recognition(Table 10-2): IImmediate genes, expressed within half an hour of antigen recognition, encode a number of IL-2, IL-2R (IL-2 receptor), IL-3,IL-6, IFN- /H9253, and numerous other proteins ILate genes, expressed more than 2 days after antigen recognition, encode various adhesion molecules These profound changes are the result of signal-transduction pathways that are activated by the encounter between theTCR and MHC-peptide complexes. An overview of some ofthe basic strategies of cellular signaling will be useful back-ground for appreciating the specific signaling pathways usedby T cells. Signal-Transduction Pathways Have Several Features in Common The detection and interpretation of signals from the environ- ment is an indispensable feature of all cells, including those ofthe immune system. Although there are an enormous numberof different signal-transduction pathways, some commonthemes are typical of these crucial integrative processes:T-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 229 FIGURE 10-9 Proposed models for the role of the CD 4and CD 8coreceptors in thymic se- lection of double positive thymocytes leadingto single positive T cells.

Signals that cannot penetrate the cell membrane bind to receptors on the surface of thecell membrane. This group includes water-solublesignaling molecules and membrane-bound ligands(MHC-peptide complexes, for example). Hydrophobicsignals, such as steroids, that can diffuse through the cellmembrane are bound by intracellular receptors. ISignals are often transduced through G proteins, membrane-linked macromolecules whose activities arecontrolled by binding of the guanosine nucleotides GTPand GDP , which act as molecular switches. Bound GTPturns on the signaling capacities of the G protein;hydrolysis of GTP or exchange for GDP turns off the signal by returning the G protein to an inactive form.There are two major categories of G proteins. Small G proteins consist of a single polypeptide chain of about 21 kDa. An important small G protein, known as Ras,is a key participant in the activation of an importantproliferation-inducing signal-transduction cascadetriggered by binding of ligands to their receptor tyrosinekinases. Large G proteins are composed of /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253 subunits and are critically involved in many processes,including vision, olfaction, glucose metabolism, andphenomena of immunological interest such as leukocytechemotaxis.230 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 10-2 Time course of gene expression by T Hcells following interaction with antigen Time mRNA Ratio of activated to Gene product Function expression begins Location nonactivated cells IMMEDIATE c-Fos transcription factor NFAT Transcription factor 20min Nucleus 50 c-Myc Cellular oncogene 30min Nucleus 20 Cell membrane 10 VLA- Adhesion 5 7-14days Cell membrane /H11022100, ?, ?, SOURCE: Adapted from G.

IMany signal transduction pathways involve the signal-induced assembly of some components of the pathway.Molecules known as adaptor proteins bind specifically and simultaneously to two or more different moleculeswith signaling roles, bringing them together andpromoting their combined activity. ISignals are amplified by enzyme cascades. Each enzyme in the cascade catalyzes the activation of many copies of thenext enzyme in the sequence, greatly amplifying thesignal at each step and offering many opportunities tomodulate the intensity of a signal along the way. IThe default setting for signal-transduction pathways isOFF. In the absence of an appropriately presented signal, transmission through the pathway does not take place. Multiple Signaling Pathways Are Initiated by TCR Engagement The events that link antigen recognition by the T-cell recep- tor to gene activation echo many of the themes just reviewed.The key element in the initiation of T-cell activation is therecognition by the TCR of MHC-peptide complexes on antigen-presenting cells. As described in Chapter 9, the TCR consists of a mostly extracellular ligand-binding unit, a predominantly intracel-lular signaling unit, the CD3 complex, and the homodimer of/H9256(zeta) chains. Experiments with knockout mice have shown that all of these components are essential for signal transduc-tion. Two phases can be recognized in the antigen-mediatedinduction of T-cell responses: IInitiation . The engagement of MHC-peptide to clustering with CD4 or CD8 coreceptors as thesecoreceptors 10-10). Lck, a protein tyrosine kinaseassociated with the cytoplasmic tails of the coreceptors,is brought close to the cytoplasmic tails of the TCRcomplex and phosphorylates the immunoreceptortyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs, described inChapter 9). The phosphorylated tyrosines in the ITAMsof the zeta chain provide docking sites to which a protein tyrosine kinase called ZAP-70 attaches (step 2 in Figure10-10) and becomes active. ZAP-70 then catalyzes thephosphorylation of a number of membrane-associatedadaptor molecules (step 3), which act as anchor pointsfor the recruitment of several intracellular signaltransduction pathways. One set of pathways involves aform of the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), whichanchors to an adaptor molecule, is activated byphosphorylation and cleaves a membrane phospholipidto generate second messengers. Another set activatessmall G proteins. IGeneration of multiple intracellular signals .M a n y signaling pathways are activated as a consequence of thesteps that occur in the initiation phase, as shown to theright in Figure 10-10, and described below. We shall consider several of the signaling pathways re- cruited by T-cell activation, but the overall process is quitecomplex and many of the details will not be presented here.The review articles suggested at the end of this chapter pro-vide extensive coverage of this very active research area. Phospholipase C /H9253(PLC /H9253):PLC/H9253is activated by phosphoryla- tion and gains access to its substrate by binding to a mem-brane-associated adaptor protein (Figure 10-11a). PLC /H9253 hydrolyzes a phospholipid component of (IP 3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP rapid release of Ca2/H11001from the endoplas- mic reticulum and opens (Figure 10-11c). Ca 2/H11001:Calcium ion is involved in an unusually broad range of processes, including vision, muscle contraction, and manyothers. It is an essential element in many T-cell responses, in-cluding a pathway that leads to the movement of a majortranscription factor, NFAT, from the cytoplasm into the nu-cleus (Figure 10-11b). In the nucleus, NFAT supports thetranscription of genes required for the expression of the T-cell growth-promoting cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and others. Protein kinase C (PKC): This enzyme, which affects many pathways, causes the release of an inhibitory molecule fromthe transcription factor NF- /H9260B, allowing NF- /H9260B to enter the nucleus, where it promotes the expression of genes requiredfor T-cell activation (Figure 10-11c). NF- /H9260B is essential for a variety of T-cell responses and provides survival signals thatprotect T cells from apoptotic death. The Ras/MAP kinase pathway: Ras is a pivotal component of a signal-transduction pathway that is found in many celltypes and is evolutionarily conserved across a spectrum ofeukaryotes from yeasts to humans. Ras is a small G proteinwhose activation by GTP initiates a cascade of protein ki-nases known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPkinase) pathway. As shown in Figure 10-12, phosphorylationof the end product of this cascade, MAP kinase (also calledT-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 2318536d_ch10_221 8/27/02 1:37 PM Page 231 Mac 109 Mac 109:1254 _BJN:Goldsby et al. / Immunology 5e:VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 10-10 Overview of TCR-mediated signaling.

Phosphorylation of Fos byMAP kinase allows it to associate with Jun to form AP-1,which is an essential transcription factor for T-cell activatio n. Co-Stimulatory Signals Are Required for Full T-Cell Activation T-cell activation requires the dynamic interaction of multiple membrane molecules described above, but this interaction,by itself, is not sufficient to fully activate naive T cells. Nai ve T cells require more than one signal for activation and subse-quent proliferation into effector cells: ISignal 1, the initial signal, is generated by interaction of an antigenic peptide with the TCR-CD3 complex.T-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 233 IA subsequent antigen-nonspecific co-stimulatory signal,signal 2, is provided primarily by interactions between CD28 on the T cell and members of the B7 family onthe APC. There are two related forms of B7, B7-1 and B7-2 (Figure 10-13). These molecules are members of the immunoglobu-lin superfamily and have a similar organization of extracel-lular domains but markedly different cytosolic domains.Both B7 molecules are constitutively expressed on dendriticcells and induced on activated macrophages and activated Bcells. The for B7 are CD28 and CTLA-4 (also knownas CD152), both of are on T-cell mem-brane as disulfide-linked homodimers; and CTLA-4 are they act antagonistically. Signaling through FIGURE 10-11Signal-transduction path- ways associated with T-cell activation. (a) Phospholipase C /H9253(PLC) is activated by phosphorylation. Active PLC hydrolyzes aphospholipid component of the plasmamembrane to generate the second mes-sengers, DAG and IP 3. (b) Protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by DAG and Ca2/H11001. Among the numerous effects of PKC isphosphorylation of IkB, a cytoplasmic pro-tein that binds the transcription factor NF-/H9260B and prevents it from entering the nucleus. Phosphorylation of IkB releasesNF-/H9260B, which then translocates into the nucleus. (c) Ca 2/H11001-dependent activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin is a Ca2/H11001/calmod- ulin reticulum. Ca2/H11001binds the protein calmod- ulin, acti-vates the Ca 2/H11001/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Active calcine-urin removes a phosphate group fromNFAT, which allows this transcription fac-tor to co-stimulatory signal to T cell; signaling through CTLA-4 is inhibitory and down-regulatesthe activation of the T cell.

Even thoughthe peak surface levels of CTLA-4 are lower than those ofCD28, it still competes favorably for B7 molecules because ithas a significantly higher avidity for these molecules thanCD28 does. Interestingly, the level of CTLA-4 expression isincreased by CD28-generated co-stimulatory signals. Thisprovides regulatory braking via CTLA-4 in proportion to theacceleration received from CD28. Some of the importance ofCTLA-4 in the regulation of lymphocyte activation and pro-liferation is revealed by experiments with CTLA-4 knockoutmice. T cells in these mice proliferate massively, which leadsto lymphadenopathy (greatly enlarged lymph nodes),splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), and death at 3 to 4 weeks after birth. Clearly, the production of inhibitory signals byengagement of CTLA-4 is important in lymphocyte can block CD28 co-stimulation by competitive inhibition at the B7 binding site, an ability thatholds promise for clinical use in autoimmune diseases andtransplantation. As shown in Figure 10-14, an ingeniouslyengineered chimeric molecule has been designed to explorethe therapeutic potential of CTLA-4. The Fc portion ofhuman IgG has been fused to the B7-binding domain ofCTLA-4 to produce a chimeric molecule called CTLA-4Ig.The human Fc region endows the molecule with a longerhalf-life in the body and the presence of B7 binding domains8536d_ch10_221-247 8/28/02 3:58 PM Page 234 mac76 mac76:385_ reb:allows it to bind to B7. A promising clinical trial of CTLA-4 has been conducted in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, a T-cell-mediated autoimmune inflammatory skin disease.During the course of this trial, forty-three patients receivedfour doses of CTLA-4Ig, and 46% of this group experienceda 50% or greater sustained improvement in their skin condi-tion. Further studies of the utility of CTLA-4Ig are also beingpursued in other areas. Clonal Anergy Ensues If a Co-Stimulatory Signal Is Absent TH-cell recognition of an antigenic peptide-MHC complex sometimes results in a state of nonresponsiveness calledclonal anergy, marked by the inability of cells to proliferate in response to a peptide-MHC complex. Whether clonal ex-pansion or clonal anergy ensues is determined by the pres-ence or absence of a co-stimulatory signal (signal 2), such asthat produced by interaction of CD28 on T Hcells with B7 on antigen-presenting cells. Experiments with cultured cellsshow that, if a resting T Hcell receives the TCR-mediated sig- nal (signal 1) in the absence of a suitable co-stimulatory sig-nal, then the T Hcell will become anergic. Specifically, if resting T Hcells are incubated with glutaraldehyde-fixed APCs, which do not express B7 (Figure 10-15a), the fixedAPCs are able to present peptides together with class II MHCmolecules, thereby providing signal 1, but they are unable toprovide the necessary co-stimulatory signal 2.

Anergy can also be induced by in- cubating T Hcells with normal APCs in the presence of the Fab portion of anti-CD28, which blocks the interaction ofCD28 with B7 (Figure 10-15b). Two different control experiments demonstrate that fixed APCs bearing appropriate peptide-MHC complexes can de-liver an effective signal mediated by T-cell receptors. In oneexperiment, T cells are incubated both with fixed APCs bear-ing peptide-MHC complexes recognized by the TCR of the Tcells and with normal APCs, which express B7 (Figure 10-15d). The fixed APCs engage the TCRs of the T cells, andthe B7 molecules on the surface of the normal APCs cross-link the CD28 of the T cell. These T cells thus receive bothsignals and undergo activation. The addition of bivalentanti-CD28 to mixtures of fixed APCs and T cells also pro-vides effective co-stimulation (Figure10-15e). Well-controlled systems for anergy invitro have stimulated considerable interest in this phenome-non. However, more work is needed to develop good animal systems for establishing anergy and studying its role in vivo. Superantigens Induce T-Cell Activation by Binding the TCR and MHC II Simultaneously Superantigens are viral or bacterial proteins that bind simul- taneously to the V /H9252domain of a T-cell receptor and to the /H9251 chain of a class II MHC molecule. Both exogenous and en-dogenous superantigens have been identified. Crosslinkageof a T-cell receptor and class II MHC molecule by either typeof superantigen produces an activating signal that inducesT-cell activation and proliferation (Figure 10-16). Exogenous superantigens are soluble proteins secreted by bacteria. Among them are a variety of exotoxins secreted by gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcal enterotoxins,toxic-shock-syndrome Each these exogenous V /H9252sequences in T-cell receptors (Table 10-3) and crosslinks the TCR to a class II MHC molecule. Endogenous superantigens are cell-membrane proteins encoded by certain viruses that infect mammalian cells. Onegroup, encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV),can integrate into the DNA of certain inbred mouse strains;after integration, retroviral proteins are expressed on themembrane of the infected cells. These viral proteins, calledminor lymphocyte stimulating (Mls) determinants, bind particular V /H9252sequences in T-cell receptors and crosslink the TCR to a class II MHC molecule. Four Mls superantigens,originating in different MTV strains, have been identified. Because superantigens bind outside of the TCR antigen- binding cleft, any T cell expressing a particular V /H9252sequence will be activated by a corresponding superantigen. Hence,the activation is polyclonal and can affect a significant per-centage (5% is not unusual) of the total T Hpopulation. The massive activations that follow crosslinkage by a superanti-gen results in overproduction of T H-cell cytokines, leading to systemic toxicity. The food poisoning induced by staphy-8536d_ch10_221-247 8/28/02 3:58 PM Page 235 mac76 mac76:385_ the toxic shock induced by toxic- shock-syndrome toxin are two examples of the consequencesof cytokine overproduction induced by superantigens. Superantigens can also influence T-cell maturation in the thymus. A superantigen present in the thymus during thymicprocessing will induce the negative selection of all thymo-cytes bearing a TCR V /H9252domain corresponding to the super- antigen specificity. Such massive deletion can be caused byexogeneous or endogenous superantigens and is character-ized by the absence of all T cells whose receptors possess V /H9252 domains targeted by the superantigen. T-Cell Differentiation CD4/H11001and CD8/H11001T cells leave the thymus and enter the cir- culation as resting cells in the G 0stage of the cell cycle. There are about twice as many CD4/H11001T cells as CD8/H11001T cells in the periphery. T cells that have not yet encountered antigen(naive T cells) are characterized by condensed chromatin,very little cytoplasm, and little transcriptional activity. NaiveT cells continually recirculate between the blood and lymphsystems. During recirculation, naive T cells reside in sec- ondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. If a naive celldoes not encounter antigen in a lymph node, it exits throughthe efferent lymphatics, ultimately draining into the thoracicduct and rejoining the blood. It is estimated that each naive Tcell recirculates from the blood to the lymph nodes and backagain every 12-24 hours. Because only about 1 in 10 5naive T cells is specific for any given antigen, this large-scale recirc u- lation increases the chances that a naive T cell will encounterappropriate antigen. Activated T Cells Generate Effector and Memory T Cells If a naive T cell recognizes an antigen-MHC complex on an appropriate antigen-presenting cell or target cell, it will beactivated, initiating a primary response . About 48 hours after activation, the naive T cell enlarges into a blast cell and begi ns undergoing repeated rounds of cell division. As describedearlier, activation depends on a signal induced by engage-ment of the TCR complex and a co-stimulatory signal in-duced by the CD28-B7 interaction (see Figure 10-13).

Secretion of IL-2 and its subsequent binding to the high-affinity IL-2 receptor in-duces the activated naive T cell to proliferate and differenti-ate (Figure 10-17). T cells activated in this way divide 2-3times per day for 4-5 days, generating a large clone of prog-eny cells, which differentiate into memory or effector T-cellpopulations. The various effector T cells carry out specialized functions such as cytokine secretion and B-cell help (activated CD4 activity (CD8/H11001CTLs). The genera- tion and activity of CTL cells are described in detail in Chapte r 14. Effector cells are derived from both naive and memory cellsafter antigen activation. Effector cells are short-lived cells,whose life spans range from a few days to a few weeks. The ef-fector and naive populations express different cell-membranemolecules, which contribute to different recirculation patterns.

An expanded population of memory T cells appears to remain long after the populationof effector T cells has declined. In general, memory T cellsexpress many of the same cell-surface markers as effector Tcells; no cell-surface markers definitively identify them asmemory cells. Like naive T cells, most memory T cells are resting cells in the G 0stage of the cell cycle, but they appear to have less stringent requirements for activation than naive T cells do.For example, naive T Hcells are activated only by dendritic cells, whereas memory T Hcells can be activated by macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. It is thought thatthe expression of high levels of numerous adhesion mole-cules by memory T Hcells enables these cells to adhere to a broad spectrum of antigen-presenting cells. Memory cellsalso display recirculation patterns that differ from those ofnaive or effector T cells.A CD 4+CD25+Subpopulation of T cells Negatively Regulates Immune Responses Investigators first described T cell populations that could sup - press immune responses during the early 1970s. These cellswere called suppressor T cells (T s) and were believed to be CD8+T cells. However, the cellular and molecular basis of the observed suppression remained obscure, and eventually greatdoubt was cast on the existence of CD8 +suppressor T cells. Recent research has shown that there are indeed T cells thatsuppress immune responses. Unexpectedly, these cells haveturned out to be CD4 +rather than CD8+T cells. Within the population of CD4+CD25+T cells, there are regulatory T cells that can inhibit the proliferation of other T cell populations i n vitro. Animal studies show that members of the CD4+CD25+ population inhibit the development of autoimmune diseasessuch as experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease,experimental allergic encephalitis, and autoimmune diabetes.The suppression by these regulatory cells is antigen specificbecause it depends upon activation through the T cell recep-tor. Cell contact between the suppressing cells and their tar-gets is required. If the regulatory cells are activated by antige n but separated from their targets by a permeable barrier, nosuppression occurs. The existence of regulatory T cells thatspecifically suppress immune responses has clinical implica-tions. The depletion or inhibition of regulatory T cells fol-lowed by immunization may enhance the immune responsesto conventional vaccines. In this regard, some have suggestedthat elimination of T cells that suppress responses to tumorantigens may facilitate the development of anti-tumor immu-nity. Conversely, increasing the suppressive activity of regula-tory T cell populations could be useful in the treatment ofallergic or autoimmune diseases. The ability to increase theactivity of regulatory T cell populations might also be usefulin suppressing organ and tissue rejection. Future work on thisregulatory cell population will seek deeper insights into themechanisms by which members of CD4 +CD25+T cell popu- lations regulate immune responses. There will also be deter-mined efforts to discover ways in which the activities of thesepopulations can be increased to diminish unwanted immuneresponses and decreased to promote desirable ones. Antigen-Presenting Cells Have Characteristic Co-Stimulatory Properties Only professional antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells) are able to present antigen to-gether with class II MHC molecules and deliver the co-stim-ulatory signal necessary for complete T-cell activation thatleads to proliferation and differentiation. The principal co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cellsare (see Figure 10-13). Theprofessional antigen-presenting cells differ in their ability t o display antigen and also differ in their ability to deliver theco-stimulatory signal (Figure 10-18).238 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 10-17Activation of a T Hcell by both signal 1and co- stimulatory signal 2up-regulates expression of IL- 2and the high- affinity IL- 2receptor, leading to the entry of the T cell into the cell cycle and several rounds of proliferation. Some of the cells di fferenti- ate into effector cells, others into memory mac76:385_ reb:Dendritic cells constitutively express high levels of class I and class II MHC molecules as well as high levels of B7-1 andB7-2. For this reason, dendritic cells are very potent activa-tors of naive, memory, and effector T cells. In contrast, allother professional APCs require activation for expression ofco-stimulatory B7 molecules on their membranes; conse-quently, resting macrophages are not able to activate naive Tcells and are poor activators of memory and effector T cells.Macrophages can be activated by phagocytosis of bacteria orby bacterial products such as LPS or by IFN- /H9253,a T H1-derived cytokine. Activated macrophages and B7 mole-cules. Thus, activated macrophages are common activators ofmemory and effector T cells, but their effectiveness in acti-vating naive T cells is considered minimal. B cells also serve as antigen-presenting cells in T-cell acti- vation. Resting B cells express class II MHC molecules but failto express co-stimulatory B7 molecules. Consequently, rest-ing B cells cannot activate naive T cells, although they can ac-tivate the effector and memory T-cell populations. Uponactivation, B cells up-regulate their expression of class IIMHC molecules and begin expressing B7. These activated Bcells can now activate naive T cells as well as the memory andeffector populations.Cell Death and T-Cell Populations Cell death is an important feature of development in all multicellular organisms. During fetal life it is used to moldand sculpt, removing unnecessary cells to provide shape and form. It also is an important feature of lymphocytehomeostasis, returning T- and B-cell populations to their ap-propriate levels after bursts of antigen-induced proliferation.Apoptosis also plays a crucial role in the deletion of poten-tially autoreactive thymocytes during negative selection andin the removal of developing T cells unable to recognize self(failure to undergo positive selection). Although the induction of apoptosis involves different signals depending on the cell types involved, the actual deathof the cell is a highly conserved process amongst vertebratesand invertebrates. For example, T cells may be induced to dieby many different signals, including the withdrawal ofgrowth factor, treatment with glucocorticoids, or TCR sig-naling. Each of these signals engages unique signaling path-ways, but in all cases, the actual execution of the cell involvesthe activation of a specialized set of proteases known as cas- pases . The role of these proteases was first revealed by studies of developmentally programmed cell deaths in the nematodeT-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 239 FIGURE 10-18Differences in the properties of professional antigen-presenting cells affect their ability to present antige n and induce T-cell activation. Note that activation of effector and memory T cells does not require the co-stimulatory B 7molecule.Antigen uptake Class Effector T cellsMemory T cellsResting Resting Class MHCClass II II , where the death of cells was shown to be totally dependent upon the activity of a gene that encoded a cysteineprotease with specificity for aspartic acid residues. We nowknow that in mammals there are at least 14 cysteine proteasesor caspases, and all cell deaths require the activity of at least a subset of these molecules. We also know that essentially everycell in the body produces caspase proteins, suggesting thatevery cell has the potential to initiate its own death. Cells protect themselves from apoptotic death under nor- mal circumstances by keeping caspases in an inactive formwithin a cell. Upon reception of the appropriate death signal,certain caspases are activated by proteolytic cleavage and thenactivate other caspases in turn, leading to the activation of effec- tor caspases .This catalytic cascade culminates in cell death. Al- though it is not well understood how caspase activation directl y results in apoptotic death of the cell, presumably it is throughthe cleavage of critical targets necessary for cell survival. T cells use two different pathways to activate caspases (Figure 10-19). In peripheral T cells, antigen stimulation re-sults in proliferation of the stimulated T cell and productionof several cytokines including IL-2. Upon activation, T cellsincrease the expression of two key cell-surface proteins in-volved in T-cell death, Fas FasL, FADD (Fas-associated protein withdeath domain) is recruited and binds to Fas, followed by therecruitment of procaspase 8, an inactive form of caspase 8.The of with procaspase 8 results in cleavage of procaspase 8 to its active form; cas-pase 8 then initiates a proteolytic cascade that leads to thedeath of the cell. Outside of the thymus, most of the TCR-mediated apop- tosis of mature T cells is mediated by the Fas pathway.Repeated or persistent stimulation of peripheral T cells re-sults in the coexpression of both Fas and Fas ligand, followedby the apoptotic death of the cell. The Fas/FasL mediateddeath of T cells as a consequence of activation is called acti- vation-induced cell death (AICD) and is a major homeostatic mechanism, regulating the size of the pool of T cells and re-moving T cells that repeatedly encounter self antigens. The importance of Fas and FasL in the removal of acti- vated T cells is underscored by lpr/lpr mice, a naturally occur- ring mutation that results in non-functional Fas. When T cellsbecome activated in these mice, the Fas/FasL pathway is notoperative; the T cells continue to proliferate, producing IL-2and maintaining an activated state. These mice spontaneouslydevelop autoimmune disease, have excessive numbers of Tcells, and clearly demonstrate the consequences of a failure todelete activated T cells. An additional mutation, gld/gld , is also informative. These mice lack functional FasL and displaymuch the same abnormalities found in the lpr/lpr mice. Re- cently, humans with defects in Fas have been reported. As expected, these individuals display characteristics of autoim-mune disease. (See the Clinical Focus box.) Fas and FasL are members of a family of related recep- tor/ligands including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its240 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 10-19 Two pathways to apoptosis in T cells. (a) Acti- vated peripheral T cells are induced to express high levels of Fas and FasL. FasL induces the trimerization of Fas on a neighboring ce ll. FasL can also engage Fas on the same cell, resulting in a self-induced death signal. Trimerization of Fas leads to the recruit ment of FADD, which leads in turn to the cleavage of associated mole - cules 8cleaves procaspase 3, producing active caspase 3, which results in the death of the cell. Caspase 8can also cleave Bid to a truncated form that can activate the mitochondrial death pathway. (b) Other signal s, such as the engagement of the TCR by peptide-MHC complexes onan APC, result in the activation of the mitochondrial death pat hway. A key feature of this pathway is the release of AIF (apoptosis induc- ing factor) and cytochrome initiates the of procaspase 3, producing active caspase 3, which initiates the execution phase of apoptosis by proteolysis of substances whose cleavage commits the cell to ap op- tosis. [Adapted in part from S. H. Kaufmann and M. O. Hengartner, 2001. Trends Cell Biol. membrane-bound TNFR interacts with TNF to induceapoptosis. Also similar to Fas/FasL-induced apoptosis,TNF/TNFR-induced death is the result of the activation ofcaspase 8 followed by the activation of effector caspases suchas caspase 3. In addition to the activation of apoptosis through death receptor proteins like Fas and TNFR, T cells can die throughother pathways that do not activate procaspase 8. For exam-ple, negative selection in the thymus induces the apoptoticdeath of developing T cells via a signaling pathway that orig-inates at the TCR. We still do not completely understand whysome signals through the TCR induce positive selection andothers induce negative selection, but we know that thestrength of the signal plays a critical role. A strong, negativelyselecting signal induces a route to apoptosis in which mitochondria play a central role. In mitochondrially depen-dent apoptotic pathways, cytochrome c,which normally membrane, leaks into thecytosol. Cytochrome cbinds to a and undergoes anATP-dependent conformational of the oligomeric form of Apaf-1 to procaspase9 results in its transformation to active caspase 9. The com-plex of cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase 9, called some, procaspase 3 generating active caspase 3, which initiates a cascade of reactions that kills thecell (Figure 10-19). Finally, mitochondria also release an-other molecule, AIF (apoptosis inducing factor), which playsa role in the induction of cell death. Cell death induced by Fas/FasL is swift, with rapid activa- tion of the caspase cascade leading to cell death in 2-4 hours.On the other hand, TCR-induced negative selection appears to be a more circuitous process, requiring the activation of sev-eral processes including mitochondrial membrane failure, therelease of cytochrome c,and the formation of the apopto- some before caspases become involved. Consequently, TCR-mediated negative selection can take as long as 8-10 hours. An important feature in the mitochondrially induced cell death pathway is the regulatory role played by Bcl-2 familymembers. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL both reside in the mitochondr-ial membrane. These proteins are strong inhibitors of apop-tosis, and while it is not clear how they inhibit cell death, onehypothesis is that they somehow regulate the release of cy-tochrome c from the mitochondria. There are at least threegroups of Bcl-2 family members. Group I members are anti-apoptotic and include Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Group II and GroupIII members are pro-apoptotic and include Bax and Bak inGroup II and Bid and Bim in Group III. There is clear evi-dence that levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members playan important role in regulating apoptosis in lymphocytes.Bcl-2 family members dimerize, and the anti-apoptoticgroup members may control apoptosis by dimerizing withpro-apoptotic members, blocking their activity. As indicatedin 10-19, cleavage of Bid, catalyzed by caspase 8 gen-erated by the Fas pathway, can turn on the mitochondrial pathway. Thus signals initiated through Fas can also involvethe mitochondrial death pathway. While it is apparent there are several ways a lymphocyte can be signaled to die, all of these pathways to cell death con-verge upon the activation of caspases. This part of the cell-death pathway, the execution phase, is common to almost alldeath pathways known in both vertebrates and invertebrates,demonstrating that apoptosis is an ancient process that hasbeen conserved throughout evolution. Peripheral /H9253/H9254T Cells In 1986, a small population of peripheral-blood T cells was discovered that expressed CD3 but failed to stain with mon-oclonal antibody specific for the /H9251/H9252T-cell receptor, indicat- ing an absence of the /H9251/H9252heterodimer. Many of these cells eventually were found to express the /H9253/H9254receptor. gd T Cells Are Far Less Pervasive Than ab T Cells In humans, less than 5% of T cells bear the /H9253/H9254heterodimer, and the percentage of /H9253/H9254T cells in the lymphoid organs of mice has been reported to range from 1% to 3%. In additionto their presence in blood and lymphoid tissues, they also ap-pear in the skin, intestinal epithelium, and pulmonary epithe-lium. Up to 1% of the epidermal cells in the skin of mice are/H9253/H9254T cells. In general, /H9253/H9254T cells are not MHC-restricted, and most do not express the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 present onpopulations of /H9251/H9252T cells. Although the potential of the /H9253and /H9254TCR loci to generate diversity is great, very little diversity i s found in this type of T cell. In fact, as pointed out in Chapter9, most of the /H9253/H9254T cells in humans have an identical combi- nation of ( /H92539 and /H92542). /H9253/H9254T Nonpeptide Ligands Not all T cells are self-MHC restricted and recognize only peptide antigens displayed in the cleft of the self-MHC mol-ecule. Indeed, Chapters 2 and 8 describe /H9251/H9252TCR-bearing T cells (NK1-T cells and CD1-restricted T cells) that are not re-stricted by conventional MHC molecules. In one study, a /H9253/H9254 T-cell clone was found to bind directly to a herpes-virus pro-tein without requiring antigen processing and presentationtogether with MHC. Human /H9253/H9254T cells have been reported that display MHC-independent binding of a phospholipidderived from M. tuberculosis , the organism responsible for tuberculosis (see Chapter 9). This finding suggests that inmany cases the TCR receptors of /H9253/H9254T cells bind to epitopes in much the same way that the immunoglobulin receptors of B cells do. The fact that most human /H9253/H9254T cells all have the same specificity suggests that like other components ofthe innate immune system, they recognize and respond toT-Cell Maturation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 10 2418536d_ch10_221-247 8/29/02 10:23 AM Page 241 mac114 Mac 114: 2nd PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses amination of these cells by flow cytome- try and fluorescent antibody staining re-vealed an excess of double-negative Tcells (see illustration below). Also, likemany patients with Canale-Smith syn-drome, she has had cancer, breast can-cer at age 22and skin cancer at ages 22 and 41. Patient B: A man who was eventually di- agnosed with Canale-Smith syndromehad severe lymphadenopathy and spleno-megaly as an infant and He wastreated from age 4to age 12with corti- costeroids and the swelling of lymphoid tis-sues became milder during adolescenceand adulthood. At age 42, he died of liver cancer.Patient C: An 8-year-old boy, the son of patient B, was also afflicted with Canale-Smith syndrome and showed elevated T-cell counts and severe lymphadenopathyat the age of seven months. At age 2his spleen became so enlarged that it had tobe removed. He also developed he-molytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.However, although he continued to haveelevated T-cell counts, the severity of hishemolytic anemia and thrombocytope-nia have so far been controlled by treat-ment with methotrexate, a DNA- synthe-sis-inhibiting drug used for immunosup-pression and cancer chemotherapy. Recognition of the serious conse- quences of a failure to regulate the num-ber of lymphocytes, as exemplified bythese case histories, emerged from de-tailed study of several children whose enlarged lymphoid tissues attractedmedical attention. In each of these casesof Canale-Smith syndrome, examinationrevealed grossly enlarged lymph nodesthat were 1-2cm in girth and some- times large enough to distort the localanatomy. In four of a group of five chil-dren who were studied intensively, the The maintenance of appropriate numbers of various types of lymphocytesis extremely important to an effective immune system. One of the most im-portant elements in this regulation isapoptosis mediated by the Fas/FasL ligand system. The following excerptsfrom medical histories show what canhappen when this key regulatory mecha- nism fails.Patient A: A woman, now 43, has had a long history of immunologic imbalancesand other medical problems. By age 2, she was diagnosed with the Canale-Smith syndrome (CSS), a severe enlarge-ment of such lymphoid tissues as lymphnodes (lymphadenopathy) and spleen(splenomegaly). Biopsy of lymph nodesshowed that, in common with manyother CSS patients, she had greatly in-creased numbers of lymphocytes. Shehad reduced numbers of platelets(thrombocytopenia) and, because herred blood cells were being lysed, she wasanemic (hemolytic anemia). The reduc-tion in numbers of platelets and the lysisof red blood cells could be traced to theaction of circulating antibodies that re-acted with these host components. Atage 21, she was diagnosed with grossly enlarged pelvic lymph nodes that had tobe removed. Ten years later, she wasagain found to have an enlarged abdom-inal mass, which on surgical removalturned out to be a half-pound lymph-node aggregate. She has continued tohave mild lymphadenopathy and, typicalof these patients, the lymphocyte popu-lations of enlarged nodes had elevatednumbers of T cells ( 87% as opposed to a normal range of 48%-67% T cells).

While almost all of the T cells in the control subject are CD 4/H11001or CD 8/H11001, the CSS patient shows high numbers of double-negative T cells ( 43%), which express neither CD4nor CD 8. The percentage of each category of T cells is indicated in th e quadrants.

Such mutations result in the pro- duction of Fas protein that lacks biologi-cal activity but still competes withnormal Fas molecules for interactionswith essential components of the Fas-mediated death pathway. Other muta-tions have been found in the extracellulardomain of Fas, often associated withmilder forms of CSS or no disease at all. A number of research groups have conducted detailed clinical studies ofCSS patients, and the following generalobservations have been made:IThe cell populations of the blood andlymphoid tissues of CSS patientsshow dramatic elevations ( 5-fold to as much as 20-fold) in the numbers of lymphocytes of all sorts, including Tcells, B cells, and NK cells. IMost of the patients have elevated levels of one or more classes of im-munoglobulin (hyper-gammaglobulin-emia). IImmune hyperactivity is responsiblefor such autoimmune phenomena as the production of autoantibodiesagainst red blood cells, resulting in he-molytic anemia, and a depression inplatelet counts due to the activity ofanti-platelet auto-antibodies. These observations establish the impor- lymphocyte populations in lympho-cyte Such death is neces-sary because the immune response toantigen results in a sudden and dramaticincrease in the populations of respond-ing clones of lymphocytes and temporar-ily distorts the representation of theseclones in the repertoire. In the absenceof cell death, the periodic stimulation oflymphocytes that occurs in the normalcourse of life would result in progres-sively increasing, and ultimately unsus-tainable, lymphocyte levels. As theCanale-Smith syndrome demonstrates,without the essential culling lympho-cytes by apoptosis, severe and life-threat-ening disease can result.spleens were so massive that they had to be removed. Even though the clinical picture in Canale-Smith syndrome can vary fromperson to person, with some individualssuffering severe chronic affliction andothers only sporadic episodes of illness,there is a common feature, a failure ofactivated lymphocytes to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis. Isolation and se-quencing of Fas genes from a number ofpatients and more than 100controls re- veals that CSS patients are heterozygous(fas /H11001//H11002) at the faslocus and thus carry one copy of a defective fasgene. A com- parison of Fas-mediated cell death in Tcells from normal controls who do notcarry mutant Fas genes with death in-duced in T cells from CSS patients,shows a marked defect in Fas-induceddeath (see illustration above). Character-ization of the Fas genes so far seen inCSS patients reveals that they have mu-tations in or around the region encodingthe death-inducing domain (the \"deathdomain\") of this protein (see illustrationAnti-Fas antibody (ng/ml)Percentage of T cells killed204060 Normal controls Patient A Patient B 16 80 400Fas-mediated killing takes place when Fas is crosslinked by Fas L, its normal ligand, or by treatment with anti-Fas antibody, which artificially crossli nks Fas molecules.

Thus they may play a role as first lines of de-fense against certain pathogens, expressing effector functionsthat help control infection and secreting cytokines that pro-mote an adaptive immune response by /H9251/H9252T cells and B cells. SUMMARY IProgenitor T cells from the bone marrow enter the thymus and rearrange their TCR genes. In most cases these thymo-cytes rearrange /H9251/H9252TCR genes and become /H9251/H9252T cells.A small minority rearrange /H9253/H9254TCR genes and become /H9253/H9254T cells. IThe earliest thymocytes lack detectable CD4 and CD8 and are referred to as double-negative cells. develop-ment, the majority of CD4/H11002CD8/H11001/H9251/H9252T cells. IPositive selection in the thymus eliminates T cells unable to recognize self-MHC and is the basis of MHC restriction.Negative selection eliminates thymocytes bearing high-affinity receptors for self-MHC alone or self-antigen plus self-MHC and produces self-tolerance. ITH-cell activation is initiated by interaction of the TCR- CD3 complex with a peptide-MHC complex on an anti-gen-presenting cell. Activation also requires the activity ofaccessory molecules, including the coreceptors CD4 andCD8. Many different intracellular signal-transductionpathways are activated by the engagement of the TCR. IT-cells that express CD4 recognize antigen combined witha class II MHC molecule and generally function as T Hcells; T cells that express CD8 recognize antigen combined witha class I MHC molecule and generally function as T Ccells. IIn addition to the signals mediated by the T-cell receptorand its associated accessory molecules (signal 1), activa-tion of the T Hcell requires a co-stimulatory signal (signal 2) provided by the antigen-presenting cell. The co-stimu-latory signal is commonly induced by interaction betweenmolecules of the B7 family on the membrane of the APCwith CD28 on the T Hcell. Engagement of CTLA-4, a close relative of CD28, by B7 inhibits T-cell activation. ITCR clonal anergy. The presence or absenceof the co-stimulatory signal (signal 2) determines whetheractivation results in clonal expansion or clonal anergy. INaive T cells are resting cells (G 0) that have not encountered antigen. Activation of naive cells leads to the generation of ef-fector and memory T cells. Memory T cells, which are moreeasily activated than naive cells, are responsible for secondaryresponses. Effector cells are short lived and perform helper,cytotoxic, or delayed-type hypersensitivity functions. IThe T-cell repertoire is shaped by apoptosis in the thymusand periphery. I/H9253/H9254T cells are not MHC restricted. Most in humans bind free antigen, and most have the same specificity. They mayfunction as part of the innate immune system.References Ashton-Rickardt, P .

He then challenged the re-constituted mouse with LCM virus and removed its spleencells. These spleen cells were then incubated with LCM-in-fected target cells with different MHC haplotypes, and thelysis of the target cells was monitored.

Y ou first stain the sample with goat anti-CD3 (primary antibody) and then with rabbit FITC-labeled anti-goat Ig(secondary antibody), which emits a green color. Analysisof the stained sample by flow cytometry indicates that70% of the cells are stained.

In many vertebrates, including humans and mice, the bone marrow generates B cells. This process is an orderly sequence of Ig-gene rearrangements, whichprogresses in the absence of antigen. This is the antigen-independent phase of B-cell development. A mature B cell leaves the bone marrow expressing mem- brane-bound immunoglobulin (mIgM and mIgD) with asingle antigenic specificity. These naive B cells, which have not encountered antigen, circulate in the blood and lymphand are carried to the secondary lymphoid organs, most no-tably the spleen and lymph nodes (see Chapter 2). If a B cellis activated by the antigen specific to its membrane-boundantibody, the cell proliferates (clonal expansion) and differen-tiates to generate a population of antibody-secreting plasmacells and memory B cells. In this activation stage, affinity maturation is the progressive increase in the average affinity of the antibodies produced and class switching is the change in the isotype of the antibody produced by the B cell from /H9262 to /H9253,/H9251,o r /H9280. Since B cell activation and differentiation in the periphery require antigen, this stage comprises the antigen-dependent phase of B-cell development. Many B cells are produced in the bone marrow through- out life, but very few of these cells mature. In mice, the size ofthe recirculating pool of B cells is about 2 /H1100310 8cells. Most of these cells circulate as naive B cells, which have short lifespans (half lives of less than 3 days to about 8 weeks) if theyfail to encounter antigen or lose in the competition withother B cells for residence in a supportive lymphoid environ-ment. Given that the immune system is able to generate a to-tal antibody diversity that exceeds 10 9, clearly only a small fraction of this potential repertoire is displayed at any timeby membrane immunoglobulin on recirculating B cells. In-deed, throughout the life span of an animal, only a smallfraction of the possible antibody diversity is ever generated.Some aspects of B-cell developmental processes have been described in previous chapters. The overall pathway,beginning with the earliest distinctive B-lineage cell, is de-scribed in sequence in this chapter. Figure 11-1 presents anoverview of the major events in humans and mice. Most ofthis chapter applies to humans and mice, but important departures from these developmental pathways have beenshown to occur in some other vertebrates. Finally, this chap-ter will consider the regulation of B-cell development at var-ious stages. B-Cell Maturation The generation of mature B cells first occurs in the embryoand continues throughout life. Before birth, the yolk sac,fetal liver, and fetal bone marrow are the major sites of B-cellmaturation; after birth, generation of mature B cells occursin the bone marrow. chapter 11Progenitor B Cells Proliferate in Bone Marrow B-cell development begins as lymphoid stem cells differenti- ate into the earliest distinctive B-lineage cell\u2014the progeni- tor cell phosphatase called CD45R (sometimes called B220in mice). Pro-B cells proliferate within the bone marrow, fill-ing the extravascular spaces between large sinusoids in theshaft of a bone. Proliferation and differentiation of pro-B cells into precursor B cells (pre-B cells) requires the micro- environment provided by the bone-marrow stromal cells. Ifpro-B cells are removed from the bone marrow and culturedin vitro, they will not progress to more mature B-cell stagesunless stromal cells are present. The stromal cells play twoimportant roles: they interact directly with pro-B and pre-Bcells, and they secrete various cytokines, notably IL-7, thatsupport the developmental process.248 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses +Ag (~10%)Naive B cellANTIGEN-INDEPENDENT PHASE PHASE (activation and differentiation) FIGURE 11-1Overview of B-cell development. During the anti- gen-independent maturation phase, immunocompetent B cellsexpressing membrane IgM and IgD are generated in the bonemarrow. Only about 10% of the potential B cells reach maturity and exit the bone marrow. Naive B cells in the periphery die withina few days unless they encounter soluble protein antigen and ac-tivated T Hcells. Once activated, B cells proliferate within sec- ondary lymphoid organs. Those bearing high-affinity mIg differ-entiate into plasma cells and memory B cells, which may expressdifferent isotypes because of class switching. The numbers citedrefer to B-cell development in the mouse, but the overall princi-ples apply to humans as well.At the earliest developmental stage, pro-B cells require di- rect contact with stromal cells in the bone marrow. This in-teraction is mediated by several cell-adhesion molecules,including VLA-4 on the pro-B cell and its ligand, the stromal cell (Figure 11-2). After initial contact ismade, a receptor on the pro-B cell called c-Kit interacts witha stromal-cell surface molecule known as stem-cell interaction activates c-Kit, which is a tyrosine kinase, and the pro-B cell begins to divide and differentiateinto a pre-B cell and begins expressing a receptor for IL-7.The IL-7 secreted by the stromal cells drives the maturationprocess, eventually inducing down-regulation of the adhe-sion molecules on the pre-B cells, so that the proliferatingcells can detach from the stromal cells. At this stage, pre-Bcells no longer require direct contact with stromal cells butcontinue to require IL-7 for growth and maturation. Ig-Gene Rearrangment Produces Immature B Cells B-cell maturation depends on rearrangement of the immuno- globulin DNA in the lymphoid stem cells. The mechanisms of Ig-gene rearrangement were described in Chapter 5. Firstto occur in the pro-B cell stage is a heavy-chain D H-to-J H gene rearrangement; this is followed by a V H-to-D HJH rearrangement (Figure 11-3). If the first heavy-chain re-arrangement is not productive, then V H-DH-JHrearrange-ment continues on the other chromosome. Upon completion of heavy-chain rearrangement, the cell is classified as a pre-Bcell. Continued development of a pre-B cell into an imma-ture B cell requires a productive light-chain gene rearrange-ment. Because of allelic exclusion, only one light-chain isotypeis expressed on the membrane of a B cell. Completion of aproductive light-chain rearrangement commits the now im-mature B cell to a particular antigenic specificity determinedby the cell's heavy-chain VDJ sequence and sequence. Immature B cells express mIgM (membrane IgM)on the cell surface. As would be expected, the recombinase enzymes RAG-1 and RAG-2, which are required for both heavy-chain andlight-chain gene rearrangements, are expressed during thepro-B and V H-DH- JHcoding joints, is active during the pro-B cell stage and ceases to be active early in the pre-B-cell stage. Because TdTexpression is turned off during the part of the pre-B-cellstage when light-chain rearrangement occurs, N-nucleotidesare not usually found in the V L-JLcoding joints. The bone-marrow phase of B-cell development culmi- nates in the production of an IgM-bearing immature B cell. Atthis stage of development the B cell is not fully functional, andantigen induces death or unresponsiveness (anergy) ratherthan division and differentiation. Full maturation is signaledB-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 249 are required for matura- tion of progenitor B cells into precursor B cells. Pro-B cells bind tostromal cells by means of an interaction between VCAM- 1on the stromal cell and VLA- 4on the pro-B cell. This interaction promotes the binding of c-Kit on the pro-B cell to stem cell factor (SCF) on thestromal cell, which triggers a signal, mediated by the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Kit, that stimulates the pro-B cell to express receptors forIL-7. IL-7released from the stromal cell then binds to the IL- 7recep- tors, inducing the pro-B cell to mature into a pre-B cell. Proliferationand differentiation evenutally produces immature B cells.by the co-expression of IgD and IgM on the membrane. This progression involves a change in RNA processing of theheavy-chain primary transcript to permit production of twomRNAs, one encoding the membrane form of the /H9262chain and the other encoding the membrane form of the /H9254chain (see Figure 5-19). Although IgD is a characteristic cell-surfacemarker of mature naive B cells, its function is not clear. How-ever, since immunoglobulin /H9254knockout mice have essentially normal numbers of fully functional B cells, IgD is not essen-tial to either B-cell development or antigen responsiveness.The Pre-B-Cell Receptor Is Essential for B-Cell Development As we saw in Chapter 10, during one stage in T-cell develop- ment, the /H9252chain of the T-cell receptor associates with pre- T/H9251to form the pre-T-cell receptor (see Figure 10-1). A parallel situation occurs during B-cell development. In thepre-B cell, the membrane /H9262chain is associated with the sur- rogate light chain, a complex consisting of two proteins: a V-like sequence called Vpre-B and a C-like sequence called250 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses FIGURE 11-3Sequence of events and characteristics of the stages in B-cell maturation in the bone marrow. The pre-B cell expresses amembrane immunoglobulin consisting of a heavy (H) chain and sur-rogate light chains, Vpre-B and /H92615. Changes in the RNA processing of heavy-chain transcripts following the pre-B cell stage lead to syn-thesis of both membrane-bound IgM and IgD by mature B cells. RAG- 1/2= two enzymes encoded recombination-activating deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase. A number of B-cell-associated transcription factors are important at various stages of B-cell some are indicated here.IgM IgDIgM VL JL MATURE genes + Heavy chain \u00b5 \u00b5 + STEM CELL Germ line Germ line others or CD25 mIgM mIgDIgMPeriphery antigen-dependentBone B CELL Surrogate Vpre-B and 5 Germ-line and Surrogate light chain of pre-BCRIg-/Ig-/H92615,which associate noncovalently to form a light-chain-like structure. The membrane-bound complex of /H9262heavy chain and sur- rogate light chain appears on the pre-B cell associated with theIg-/H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimer to form the pre-B-cell receptor (Figure 11-4). Only pre-B cells that are able to express membrane-bound /H9262heavy chains in association with surrogate light chains are able to proceed along the maturation pathway. There is speculation that the pre-B-cell receptor recog- nizes a not-yet-identified ligand on the stromal-cell thereby a signal to the pre-B cell thatprevents V Hto D HJHrearrangement of the other heavy-chain allele, thus leading to allelic exclusion. Following the estab-lishment of an effective pre-B-cell receptor, each pre-B cellundergoes multiple cell divisions, producing 32 to 64 descen-dants. Each of these progeny pre-B cells may then rearrangedifferent light-chain gene segments, thereby increasing theoverall diversity of the antibody repertoire. The critical role of the pre-B-cell receptor was demon- strated with knockout mice in which the gene encoding the /H92615 protein of the receptor was disrupted. B-cell development inthese mice was shown to be blocked at the pre-B stage, whichsuggests that a signal generated through the receptor is neces-sary for pre-B cells to proceed to the immature B-cell stage. Knockout Experiments Identified Essential Transcription Factors As described in Chapter 2, many different transcription fac- tors act in the development of hematopoietic cells. Nearly adozen of them have so far been shown to play roles in B-celldevelopment. Experiments in which particular transcriptionfactors are knocked out by gene disruption have shown that four such factors, E2A, early B-cell factor (EBF), B-cell- specific activator protein (BSAP), and Sox-4 particularly for B-cell development (see Figure 11-3). Micethat lack E2A do not express RAG-1, are unable to makeD HJHrearrangements, and fail to express /H92615, a critical com- ponent of the surrogate light chain. A similar pattern is seenin EBF-deficient mice. These findings point to importantroles for both of these transcription factors early in B-cell development, and they may play essential roles in the earlystages of commitment to the B-cell lineage. Knocking out thePax-5 gene, whose product is the transcription factor BSAP , also results in the arrest of B-cell development at an earlystage. Binding sites for BSAP are found in the promoter re-gions of a number of B-cell-specific genes, including Vpre-B and /H92615,in a number of Ig switch regions, and in the Ig heavy- chain enhancer. This indicates that BSAP plays a role beyondthe early stages of B-cell development. This factor is also ex-pressed in the central nervous system, and its absence resultsin severe defects in mid-brain development. Although the ex-act site of action of Sox-4 is not known, it affects early stagesof B-cell activation. While Figure 11-3 shows that all of thesetranscription factors affect development at an early stage,some of them are active at later stages also. Cell-Surface Markers Identify Development Stages The developmental progression from progenitor to mature B cell is typified by a changing pattern of surface markers (seeFigure 11-3). At the pro-B stage, the cells do not display theheavy or light chains of antibody but they do express CD45R,B-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 251 Immature B cell or Crosslinking by antigen Activation DeathPre-B cell Crosslinking by stromal-cell ligandPro-B cell 5 Stops V H DHJH (allelic exclusion) ?

The pre-B-cell receptorcontains a surrogate light chain consisting of a Vpre-B polypeptideand a /H92615polypeptide, which are noncovalently associated. The im- mature B cell no longer expresses the surrogate light chain and in-stead expresses the /H9260or /H9261 light chain together with the /H9262heavy chain.which is a form of the protein tyrosine phophatase found on leukocytes, and the signal-transducing molecules Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252, which are found in association with the membrane forms ofantibody in later stages of B-cell development. Pro-B cellsalso (part of the B-cell CD43(leukosialin), and CD24, a molecule also known as heat-stable antigen (HSA) on the surface. At this stage, c-Kit, a re-ceptor for a growth-promoting ligand present on stromal cells,is also found on the surface of pro-B cells. As cells progressfrom the pro-B to the pre-B stage, they express many of thesame markers that were present during the pro-B stage; how-ever, they cease to express c-Kit and CD43 begin to ex-press CD25, the /H9251chain of the IL-2 receptor. The display of the pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) is a salient feature of thepre-B cell stage. After rearrangement of the light chain, sur-face immunoglobulin containing both heavy and light chainsappears, and the cells, now classified as immature B cells, losethe pre-BCR and no longer express CD25. Monoclonal anti-bodies are available that can recognize all of these antigenicmarkers, making it possible to recognize and isolate the vari-ous stages of B-cell development by the techniques of im-munohistology and flow cytometry described in Chapter 6. B-1B Cells Are a Self-Renewing B-Cell Subset There is a subset of B cells, called B-1 B cells, that arise before B-2 B cells, the major group of B cells in humans and mice. Inhumans and mice, B-1 B cells compose about 5% of the totalB-cell population. They appear during fetal life, express sur-face IgM but little or no IgD, and are marked by the display ofCD5. However, CD5 is not an indispensable component of theB-1 lineage, it does not appear on the B-1 cells of rats, and micethat lack a functional CD5 gene still produce B-1 cells. In ani-mals whose B-2 B cells are the major B-cell population, B-1cells are minor populations in such secondary tissues as lymphnodes and spleen. Despite their scarcity in many lymphoidsites, they are the major B-cell type found in the peritoneum. Although there is not a great deal of definitive informa- tion on the function of B-1 cells, several features set themapart from the B-2 B cells of humans and mice. During fetallife, B-1 cells arise from stem cells in bone marrow. However,in postnatal life this population renews itself by the prolifer-ation of some B-1 cells in sites outside the bone marrow to form additional naive B-1 cells. The B-1 population respondspoorly to protein antigens but much better to carbohydrateones. Most of its members are IgM-bearing cells, and thispopulation undergoes much less somatic hypermutation andclass switching than the B-2 set of B cells does. Consequently,the antibodies produced by a high proportion of B-1 cells areof rather low affinity. Self-Reactive B Cells Are Selected Against in Bone Marrow It is estimated that in the mouse the bone marrow produces about 5 /H11003107B cells/day but only 5 /H11003106(or about 10%) are actually recruited into the recirculating B-cell pool. Thismeans that 90% of the B cells produced each day die withoutever leaving the bone marrow. Some of this loss is attribut-able to negative selection and subsequent elimination (clonal deletion) of immature B cells that express auto-antibodies against self-antigens in the bone marrow. It has long been established that the crosslinkage of mIgM on immature B cells, demonstrated experimentally by treat-ing immature B cells with antibody against the /H9262constant re- gion, can cause the cells to die by apoptosis within the bonemarrow. A similar process is thought to occur in vivo whenimmature B cells that express self-reactive mIgM bind to self-antigens in the bone marrow. For example, D. A. Nemazeeand K. Burki introduced a transgene encoding the heavy andlight chains of an IgM antibody specific for K k,a n H - 2kclass I MHC molecule, into H-2d and H-2d/kmice (Figure 11-5a,b). Since class I MHC molecules are expressed on the membraneof all nucleated cells, the endogenous H-2 kand H-2d MHC molecules would be present on bone-marrow stromalcells in the transgenic mice. In the H-2 d mice, which do not express Kk, 25%-50% of the mature, peripheral B cells ex- pressed the transgene-encoded anti-Kkboth as a membrane antibody and as secreted antibody. In contrast, in the H-2d/k mice, which express Kk, no mature, peripheral B cells ex- pressed the transgene-encoded antibody to H-2k(Table 11-1). These results suggest that there is negative selection againstany immature B cells expressing auto-antibodies on theirmembranes because these antibodies react with self-antigen252 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 11-1 Expression of transgene encoding IgM antibody to H- 2kclass I MHC molecules EXPRESSION OF TRANSGENE Experimental animal Number of animals tested As membrane Ab As secreted Ab ( /H9262g/ml) Nontransgenics 13 (-) < 0.3 H-2dtransgenics 7 (+) 93.0 H-2d/ktransgenics 6 (-) < 0.3 SOURCE: Adapted from D.

Self-Reactive B Cells May Be Rescued by Editing of Light-Chain Genes Later work using the transgenic system described by Nemazee and Burki showed that negative selection of immature B cellsdoes not always result in their immediate deletion (Figure 11-5c). Instead, maturation of the self-reactive cell is arrestedwhile the B cell \"edits\" the light-chain gene of its receptor.In this case, the H-2 d/ktransgenics produced a few mature B cells that expressed mIgM containing the /H9262chain encoded in the transgene, but different, endogenous light chains. Oneexplanation for these results is that when some immature B cells bind a self-antigen, maturation is arrested; the cellsup-regulate RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression and begin furtherB-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 253 Kd(b) H-2d transgenics 25-50% of mature B cells express anti -Kk (c) H-2d/k transgenics A few mature B cells with newlight chains no longer bind K stromal Kd FIGURE 11-5Experimental evidence for negative selection (clonal deletion) of self-reactive B cells during maturation in the bone mar-row. The presence or absence of mature peripheral B cells expressinga transgene-encoded IgM against the H- 2class I molecule K k was determined in H- 2d/k mice (a) and H- 2d mice (b). In the H- 2d/k trans- genics, the immature B cells recognized the self-antigen Kk and were deleted by negative selection. In the H- 2d transgenics, the immature B cells did not bind to a self-antigen and consequently went on to mature, so that 25%-50% of the splenic B cells expressed the trans- gene-encoded anti-Kkas membrane Ig. More detailed analysis of the H-2d/ktransgenics revealed a few peripheral B cells that expressed the transgene-encoded /H9262chain but a different light chain (c). Apparently, a few immature B cells underwent light-chain editing, so they nolonger bound the K k molecule and consequently escaped negative se- lection. [Adapted from D. A. Nemazee and K. Burki, 1989, Nature 337: 562; S. L. JEM 177: 1009.]rearrangement of their endogenous light-chain DNA. Some of these cells succeed in replacing the /H9260light chain of the self- antigen reactive antibody with a /H9261chain encoded by endoge- nous /H9261-chain gene segments. As a result, these cells will begin to express an \"edited\" mIgM with a different light chain and aspecificity that is not self-reactive. These cells escape negativeselection and leave the bone marrow. B-Cell Activation and Proliferation After export of B cells from the bone marrow, activation, pro-liferation, and differentiation occur in the periphery and re-quire antigen. Antigen-driven activation and clonal selectionof naive B cells leads to generation of plasma cells and mem-ory B cells. In the absence of antigen-induced activation,naive B cells in the periphery have a short life span, dyingwithin a few weeks by apoptosis (see Figure 11-1). Thymus-Dependent and Thymus- Independent Antigen Have DifferentRequirements for Response Depending on the nature of the antigen, B-cell activation pro- ceeds by two different routes, one dependent upon T Hcells, the other not. The B-cell response to thymus-dependent (TD) an- tigens requires direct contact with T Hcells, not simply expo- sure to T H-derived cytokines. Antigens that can activate B cells in the absence of this kind of direct participation by T Hcells are known as thymus-independent (TI) antigens. TI antigens are divided into types 1 and 2, and they activate B cells by differentmechanisms. Some bacterial cell-wall components, includinglipopolysaccharide (LPS), function as thymus-independent Type 2 thymus-independent (TI-2) antigens (mito- gens); that is, they are able to activate B cells regardless of their antigenic specificity. At high concentrations, some TI-1antigens will stimulate proliferation and antibody secretionby as many as one third of all B cells. The mechanism bywhich TI-1 antigens activate B cells is not well understood.When B cells are exposed to lower concentrations of TI-1antigens, only those B cells specific for epitopes of the antigenwill be activated. These antigens can stimulate antibody pro-duction in nude mice (which lack a thymus and thus aregreatly deficient in T cells), and the response is not greatlyaugmented by transferring T cells into these athymic antigen is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria.At low concentrations, LPS stimulates the production ofantibodies specific for LPS. At high concentrations, it is apolyclonal B-cell activator.TI-2 antigens activate B cells by extensively crosslinking the mIg receptor. However, TI-2 antigens differ from TI-1antigens in three important respects. First, they are not B-cellmitogens and so do not act as polyclonal activators. Second,TI-1 antigens will activate both mature and immature B cells,but TI-2 antigens activate mature B cells and inactivate im-mature B cells. Third, although the B-cell response to TI-2antigens does not require direct involvement of T Hcells, cytokines derived from T Hcells are required for efficient B-cell proliferation and for class switching to isotypes otherthan IgM. This can be shown by comparing the effect of TI-2antigens in mice made T-cell-deficient in various ways. Innude mice, which lack thymus-derived T cells but do containa few T cells that arise from other sites that probably lie in theintestine, TI-2 antigens do elicit B-cell responses. TI-2 anti-gens do not induce antibody production in mice that cannotexpress either /H9251/H9252or /H9253/H9254TCRs because the genes encoding the TCR /H9252and /H9254chains have been knocked out. Administration of a few T cells to these TCR-knockout mice restores theirability to elicit B-cell responses to TI-2 antigens. The humoral response to thymus-independent is different from the response to thymus-dependent antigens(Table 11-2). The response to TI antigens is generally weaker,no memory cells are formed, and IgM is the predominant antibody secreted, reflecting a low level of class switching.These differences highlight the important role played by T H cells in generating memory B cells, affinity maturation, andclass switching to other isotypes. Two Types of Signals Drive B Cells into and Through the Cell Cycle Naive, or resting, B cells are nondividing cells in the G 0stage of the cell cycle. Activation drives the resting cell into the cell cy-cle, progressing through G 1into the S phase, in which DNA is replicated. The transition from G 1to S is a critical restriction point in the cell cycle. Once a cell has reached S, it completesthe cell cycle, moving through G 2and into mitosis (M). Analysis of the progression of lymphocytes from G 0to the S phase revealed similarities with the parallel sequence in fi-broblast cells. These events could be grouped into two cate-gories, competence signals and progression signals. Compe-tence signals drive the B cell from G 0into early G 1,r e n d e r i n g the cell competent to receive the next level of signals. Pro-gression signals then drive the cell from G 1into S and ulti- mately to cell division and differentiation. Competence isachieved by not one but two distinct signaling events, whichare designated signal 1 and signal 2. These signaling events are generated by different pathways with thymus-independentand thymus-dependent antigens, but both pathways includesignals multivalent antigen binds and cross-links mIg (Figure 11-6). Once the B cell has acquired an ef-fective competence signal in early activation, the interactionof cytokines and possibly other ligands with the B-cell mem-brane receptors provides progression signals.254 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell ResponsesTransduction of Activating Signals Involves Ig-/H9251/Ig-/H9252Heterodimers For many years, immunologists questioned how engagement of the Ig receptor by antigen could activate intracellular sig-naling pathways. All isotypes of mIg have very short cyto-plasmic tails. Both mIgM and mIgD on B cells extend into thecytoplasm by only three amino acids; the mIgA tail consistsof 14 amino acids; and the mIgG and mIgE tails contains 28amino acids. In each case, the cytoplasmic tail is too short tobe able to generate a signal by associating with intracellularsignaling molecules, such as tyrosine kinases and G proteins.The discovery that membrane Ig is associated with the disul-fide-linked heterodimer Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252, forming the B-cell recep- tor(BCR), solved this longstanding puzzle. Though it was originally thought that two Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimers associ- ated with one mIg to form the B-cell receptor, careful bio-chemical analysis has shown that only one Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252het-erodimer associates with a single mIg molecule to form the receptor complex. (Figure 11-7). Thus the BCR is function-ally divided mole-cule and the signal-transducing Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252heterodimer. A similar functional division marks the pre-BCR, which trans-duces signals via a complex consisting of an Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252het- rodimer and /H9262heavy chains combined with the surrogate light chain (see Figure 11-4). The Ig- /H9251chain has a long cyto- plasmic tail containing 61 amino acids; the tail of the Ig- /H9252 chain contains 48 amino acids. The cytoplasmic tails of bothIg-/H9251and Ig- /H9252contain the 18-residue motif immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM; see Figure 11-7) which has already been described in severalmolecules of the T-cell-receptor complex (see Figure 10-11).Interactions with the cytoplasmic tails of Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252trans- duce the stimulus produced by crosslinking of mIg moleculesinto an effective intracellular signal. In the BCR and the TCR, as well as in a number of recep- tors for the Fc regions are mediated by a multimeric complex ofproteins that is functionally compartmentalized. The ligand-binding portions of these complexes (mIg in the case of theBCR) is on the surface of the cell, and the signal-transducingportion is mostly or wholly within the cell. As is true of theTCR, signaling from the BCR is mediated by protein tyrosinekinases (PTKs). Furthermore, like the TCR, the BCR itselfhas no PTK activity; this activity is acquired by recruitmentof a number of different kinases, from nearby locations withinthe cell, to the cytoplasmic tails of the signal. Phosphorylationof tyrosines within the ITAMs of the BCR by receptor associ-ated PTKs is among the earliest events in B-cell activationand plays a key role in bringing other critical PTKs to theBCR and in their activation. The antigen-mediated crosslink-ing of BCRs initiates a number of signaling cascades that ulti-mately result in the cell's responses to the crosslinking of itssurface immunoglobulin by antigen. The crosslinking of BCRsresults in the induction of many signal-transduction pathwaysB-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 255 TABLE 11-2 Properties of thymus-dependent and thymus-independent antigens TI ANTIGENS Property TD antigens Type 1 Type 2 Chemical nature Soluble protein Bacterial cell-wall Polymeric protein antigens; components (e.g., LPS) capsular polysaccharides Humoral response Isotype switching Yes No LimitedAffinity maturation Yes No NoImmunologic memory Yes No NoPolyclonal activation No Yes (high doses) No 1 22(a) TI-1 antigen (b) TD antigen B cell B cellCD40/CD40LTH cell 1 FIGURE 11-6An effective signal for B-cell activation involves two distinct signals induced by membrane events.

IRecruitment of other signal-transduction pathways:Signals from the BCR and TCR result in the productionof the second messengers IP 3and DAG. IP 3causes of Ca2+from intracellular stores, DAG activates PKC. A third important set of signalingpathways are those governed by the small G proteins Rasand Rac that are also activated by signals receivedthrough the TCR or BCR. IChanges in gene expression: One of the important outcomes of signal-transduction processes set in motionwith engagement of the BCR or the TCR is thegeneration or translocation to the nucleus of activetranscription factors that stimulate or inhibit thetranscription of specific genes. Failures in signal transduction can have severe conse- quences for the immune system. The Clinical Focus on X-linked agammaglobulinemia describes the effect of defec-tive signal transduction on the development of B cells. The B-Cell-Coreceptor Complex Can Enhance B-Cell Responses Stimulation through antigen receptors can be modified sig- nificantly by signals through coreceptors. Recall that co-stimulation through CD28 is an essential feature of effectivepositive stimulation of T lymphocytes, while signalingthrough CTLA-4 inhibits the response of the T cell.

The CR2 compo-nent is a receptor of C3d, a breakdown product of thecomplement system, which is an important effector mecha-nism for destroying invaders (Chapter 13); note that the in-volvement of C3d in the pathway for coreceptor activityreveals different arms of the immune system interacting witheach other. CR2 also functions as a receptor for a membranemolecule and the transmembrane protein TAPA-1. whichis constitutively associated with the B-cell receptor in resting B cells, delivers a negative signal that makes B-cells more difficultto activate. As shown in Figure 11-9, the CR2 component ofthe coreceptor complex binds to complement-coated antigenthat has been captured by the mIg on the B cell. This crosslinksthe coreceptor to the BCR and allows the CD19 component ofthe coreceptor to interact with the Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252component of the BCR. CD19 contains six tyrosine residues in its long cytoplas-mic tail and is a major substrate of the protein tyrosine kinaseactivity that is mediated by crosslinkage of the BCR. Phospho-rylation of CD19 permits it to bind a number of signalingmolecules, including the protein tyrosine kinase Lyn.

In one experimental in vitro system, forexample, 10 4molecules of mIgM had to be engaged by anti- gen for B-cell activation to occur when the coreceptor wasnot involved. But when CD19/CD2/TAPA-1 coreceptor wascrosslinked to the BCR, only 10 2molecules of mIgM had to be engaged for B-cell activation. Another striking experimenthighlights the role played by the B-cell coreceptor. Mice wereimmunized with either unmodified lysozyme or a hybridprotein in which genetic engineering was used to join hen'segg lysozyme to C3d. The fusion protein bearing 2 or 3 copiesof C3d produced anti-lysozyme responses that were 1000 to10,000 times greater than those to lysozyme alone. Perhapscoreceptor phenomena such as these explain how naive B cells that often express mIg with low affinity for antigen areable to respond to low concentrations of antigen in a primaryresponse. Such responses, even though initially of low affin-ity, can play a significant role in the ultimate generation ofhigh-affinity antibody. As described later in this chapter, re-sponse to an antigen can lead to affinity maturation, result-ing in higher average affinity of the B-cell population. Finally,two experimental observations indicate that the CD19 com-ponent of the B-cell coreceptor can play a role independentof CR2, the complement receptor. In normal mice, artificallycrosslinking the BCR with anti-BCR antibodies results in the258 PART II Generation P P PIg-/Ig- FIGURE 11-9The B-cell molecules: TAPA- 1(CD81), CR 2(CD21), and CD 19.

The failure ofthese efforts to induce antibody responsesprompted Bruton to determine whetherthe patient could mount antibody re-sponses when challenged with other anti-gens. Surprisingly, immunization withdiphtheria and typhoid vaccine prepara-tions did not humoral responses patient. Electrophoretic analysis of thepatient's serum althoughnormal amounts of albumin and other typ-ical serum proteins were present, gammaglobulin, the major antibody fraction of serum, was absent. Having traced the immunodeficiency to a lack of antibody,Bruton tried a bold new treatment. He ad-ministered monthly doses of human im-mune serum globulin. The patient's ex-perience of a fourteen-month period bacterial sepsis established the useful-ness of the immunoglobulin replacementfor the treatment of immunodeficiency. Though initially called Bruton's agam- maglobulinemia, this hereditary immun-odeficiency disease was renamed X-linkedagammaglobulinemia, or X-LA, after thediscovery that the responsible gene lieson the X chromosome. The disease hasthe following clinical features: IBecause this defect is X-linked,almost all afflicted individuals aremale. ISigns of immunodeficiency mayappear as early as 9months after birth, when the supply ofX-linked agammaglobu- linemia is a genetically determined im-munodeficiency disease characterized bythe inability to synthesize all classes ofantibody. It was discovered in 1952 by O. C. Bruton in what is still regarded asan outstanding example of research inclinical immunology.

On the other hand, treat-ment of B cells from mice in which CD19 has been knockedout with anti-BCR antibody fails to induce these pathways.Furthermore, CD19 knockout mice make greatly diminishedantibody response to most antigens. THCells Play Essential Roles in Most B-Cell Responses As noted already, activation of B cells by soluble protein anti- gens requires the involvement of T Hcells. Binding of antigen to B-cell mIg does not itself induce an effective competencesignal without additional interaction with membrane mole-cules on the T Hcell. In addition, a cytokine-mediated pro- gression is required for B-cell proliferation. Figure 11-10 out-lines the probable sequence of events in B-cell activation by a thymus-dependent (TD) antigen. This process is consid-erably more complex than activation induced by thymus-independent (TI) antigens. FORMATION OF T-B CONJUGATE After binding of antigen by mIg on B cells, the antigen is in-ternalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and processedwithin the endocytic pathway into peptides. Antigen bindingalso initiates signaling through the BCR that induces the B cell to up-regulate a number of cell-membrane molecules,including class II MHC molecules and the co-stimulatoryligand B7 (see Figure 11-10a). Increased expression of bothof these membrane proteins enhances the ability of the B cellto function as an antigen-presenting cell in T H-cell activa- tion. B-cells could be regarded as helping their helpers be-cause the antigenic peptides produced within the endocyticprocessing pathway associate with class II MHC moleculesand are presented on the B-cell membrane to the T Hcell, in- ducing its activation. It generally takes 30-60 min after inter-nalization of antigen for processed antigenic peptides to bedisplayed on the B-cell membrane in association with class IIMHC molecules. Because a B cell recognizes and internalizes antigen specif- ically, by way of its membrane-bound Ig, a B cell is able topresent antigen to T Hcells at antigen concentrations that are 100 to 10,000 times lower than what is required for pre-sentation by macrophages or dendritic cells. When antigenconcentrations are high, macrophages and dendritic cells are effective antigen-presenting cells, but, as antigen levelsdrop, B cells take over as the major presenter of antigen to T Hcells. Once a T Hcell recognizes a processed antigenic peptide displayed by a class II MHC molecule on the membrane of azx B-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 259 make antibody. Studies of the cell popula- tions in bone marrow traced the lack of Bcells to failures in B-cell development. Thesamples displayed a ratio of pro-B cells topre-B cells 10times normal, suggesting inhibition of the transition from the pro-to the pre-B-cell stage. The presence ofvery few mature B cells in the marrow indi-cated a more profound blockade in the de-velopment of B cells from pre-B cells. In the early 1990 s, the gene responsi- ble for X-LA was cloned. The normal coun-terpart of this gene encodes a proteintyrosine kinase that has named Bru-ton's tyrosine honor of theresourceful and insightful physician whodiscovered X-LA and devised a treatmentfor it. Parallel studies in mice have shownthat the absence of Btk causes a syn-drome known as xid, an immunodefi- ciency disease that is essentially identicalto its human counterpart, X-LA. Btk hasturned out to play important roles in B-cellsignaling. For example, crosslinking of theB-cell receptor results in the phosphoryla- tion of a tyrosine residue in the catalyticdomain of activates C- /H9253 2(PLC- /H92532); in vitro studies of cell cultures in which Btk has been knocked out showcompromised PLC- /H9253 2activation. PLC- DAG. As men- tioned earlier, a in- tracellular Ca2+, and DAG is an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Thus, Btk plays apivotal role in activating a network of in-tracellular signals vital to the function ofmature B cells and earlier members of theB-cell lineage. Research has shown that itbelongs to a family of PTKs known as Teckinases; its counterpart in T cells is Itk.The insights gained from studies of X-LA,xid, and Btk are impressive examples ofhow the study of pathological states canclarify the workings of normal cells.maternal antibody acquired in utero has decreased belowprotective levels.

IAlthough infection by many virusesis no more severe in these patientsthan in normal individuals, long-term antiviral immunity is usuallynot induced.

Studies of this disease at the cellular and molecular level provide insights intothe workings of the immune system. Ascarcity of B cells in the periphery ex-plained the inability of X-LA patients toB cell, the two cells interact to form a T-B conjugate (Figure 11-11). Micrographs of T-B conjugates reveal that T H cells in antigen-specific conjugates have reorganized theGolgi apparatus and the microtubular-organizing center to-ward the junction with the B cell. This structural adjustmentfacilitates the release of cytokines toward the antigen-specificB cell. CONTACT-DEPENDENT HELP MEDIATED BY CD 40/CD 40L INTERACTION Formation of a T-B conjugate not only leads to the directional release of T H-cell cytokines, but also to the up-regulation ofCD40L (CD154), a T H-cell membrane protein that then in- teracts with CD40 on B cells to provide an essential signal forT-cell-dependent B-cell activation. CD40 belongs to the tu-mor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cell-surface proteins andsoluble cytokines that regulate cell proliferation and pro-grammed cell death by apoptosis. CD40L belongs to the TNFreceptor (TNFR) family. Interaction of CD40L with CD40 onthe B cell delivers a signal (signal 2) to the B cell that, in concertwith the signal generated by mIg crosslinkage (signal 1), drivesthe B cell into G 1(see Figure 11-10c). The signals from CD40 are transduced by a number of intracellular signaling path-ways, ultimately resulting in changes in gene expression. Stud-260 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses Antigen crosslinks mIg, generating signal , which leads to increased expression of class II MHC and co-stimulatory B7.

The cell-cycle phase of the interacting B cell is indicated on the right.ies have shown that although CD40 does not have kinase ac- tivity, its crosslinking is followed by the activation of proteintyrosine kinases such as Lyn and Syk. Crosslinking of CD40also results in the activation of phospholipase C and the subse-quent generation of the second messengers IP 3and DAG, and the activation of a num ber of transcription factors. Ligation of CD40 also results in its association with members of theTNFR-associated factor (TRAF) family. A consequence of thisinteraction is the activation of the transcription factor NF-6B. Several lines of evidence have identified the CD40/CD40L interaction as the mediator of contact-dependent help. Therole of an inducible T H-cell membrane protein in B-cell acti- vation was first revealed by experiments in which naive B cells were incubated with antigen and plasma membranesprepared from either activated or resting T H-cell clones. Only the membranes from the activated T Hcells induced B-cell proliferation, suggesting that one or more molecules ex-pressed on the membrane of an activated T Hcell engage receptors on the B cell to provide contact-dependent help.Furthermore, when antigen-stimulated B cells are treatedwith anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies in the absence of T H cells, they become activated and proliferate. Thus, engage-ment of CD40, whether by antibodies to CD40 or by CD40L,is critical in providing signal 2 to the B cell. If appropriate cy-tokines are also added to this experimental system, then theproliferating B cells will differentiate into plasma cells. Con-versely, antibodies to CD40L have been shown to block B-cellactivation by blocking the CD40/CD40L interaction. SIGNALS PROVIDED BY T H-CELL CYTOKINES Although B cells stimulated with membrane proteins fromactivated T Hcells are able to proliferate, they fail to dif-ferentiate unless cytokines are also present; this finding sug- gests that both a membrane-contact signal and cytokine signals are necessary to induce B-cell proliferation and dif-ferentiation. As noted already, electron micrographs of T-Bconjugates reveal that the antigen-specific interaction be-tween a T Hand a B cell induces a redistribution of T H-cell membrane proteins and cytoskeletal elements that results in the polarized release of cytokines toward the interactingB cell. Once activated, the B cell begins to express membrane re- ceptors for various cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, andothers. These receptors then bind the cytokines produced by the interacting T Hcell. The signals produced by these cytokine-receptor interactions support B-cell proliferationand can induce differentiation into plasma cells and memoryB cells, class switching, and affinity maturation. Each of theseevents is described in a later section. Mature Self-Reactive B Cells Can Be Negatively Selected in the Periphery Because some self-antigens do not have access to the bone marrow, B cells expressing mIgM specific for such antigenscannot be eliminated by the negative-selection process in thebone marrow described earlier. T o avoid autoimmune re-sponses from such mature self-reactive B cells, some processfor deleting them or rendering them inactive must occur inperipheral lymphoid tissue. A transgenic system developed by C. Goodnow and his coworkers has helped to clarify the process of negative selec-tion of mature B cells in the periphery.

Goodnow then asked what effect HEL,which is expressed in the periphery but not in the bone mar-row, would have upon the development of B cells expressingthe anti-HEL transgene. The Goodnow double-transgenic system has yielded sev- interesting findings concerning negative selection ofB cells (Table 11-3). He found that double-transgenic mice expressing high levels of HEL (10 -9M) continued to have mature, peripheral B cells bearing anti-HEL membrane anti-body, but these B cells were functionally nonresponsive; thatis, they were anergic. The flow-cytometric analysis of B cells from double-transgenic mice showed that, while large num-bers of anergic anti-HEL cells were present, they expressedIgM at levels about 20-fold lower than anti-HEL single trans-genics (Figure 11-12b). Further study demonstrated that thedouble transgenics had both surface IgM and IgD, indicatingthat the anergy was induced in mature rather than immatureB cells. When these mice were given an immunizing dose ofHEL, few anti-HEL plasma cells were induced and the serumanti-HEL titer was low.

They first produced a transgene consisting ofthe class I K bgene linked to a liver-specific promoter, so that the class I Kbmolecule could be expressed only in the liver. Transgenic mice expressing an anti-Kbantibody on their B cells also were produced, and the two groups of transgenicmice were then mated (Figure 11-13a). In the resulting double-transgenic mice, the immature B cells expressinganti-K bmIgM would not encounter class I Kbmolecules in the bone marrow. Flow-cytometric analysis of the B cells in the double transgenics showed that immature B cellsexpressing the transgene-encoded anti-K bcells were present in the bone marrow but not in the peripheral lymphoidorgans (Figure 11-13b). In the previous experiments ofNemazee and Burki, the class I MHC self-antigen (H-2 k) was expressed on all nucleated cells, and immature B cellsexpressing the transgene-encoded antibody to this class Imolecule were selected against and deleted in the bone mar-row (see Figure 11-5a). In their second system, however, theclass I self-antigen (K b) was expressed only in the liver, so that negative selection and deletion occurred at the matureB-cell stage in the periphery.B-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 263 TABLE 11-3Expression of anti-HEL transgene by mature peripheral B cells in single and double-transgenic mice Membrane Anti-HEL Anti-HEL Experimental group HEL * serum * Anti-HEL single transgenics High High Anti-HEL/HEL single transgenics (Group 1) 10-9M + Low Low *Experimental animals were immunized with hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL).

Primary and Secondary Responses Differ Significantly The kinetics and other characteristics of the humoral re- sponse differ considerably depending on whether the hu-moral response results from activation of naive lymphocytes(primary response) or memory lymphocytes (secondary re-sponse). In both cases, activation leads to production of se-creted antibodies of various isotypes, which differ in theirability to mediate specific effector functions (see Table 4-2). The first contact of an exogenous antigen with an individ- ual generates a primary humoral response, characterized bythe production of antibody-secreting plasma cells and mem-ory B cells. As Chapter 3 showed, the kinetics of the primaryresponse, as measured by serum antibody level, depend onthe nature of the antigen, the route of antigen administra-tion, the presence or absence of adjuvants, and the species orstrain being immunized. In all cases, however, a primary response to antigen is characterized by a lag phase, during which naive B cells un-dergo clonal selection, subsequent clonal expansion, and dif-ferentiation into memory cells or plasma cells (Figure 11-14). The lag phase is followed by a logarithmic increase in serumantibody level, which reaches a peak, plateaus for a variabletime, and then declines. The duration of the lag phase varieswith the nature of the antigen. Immunization of mice withan antigen such as sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) typically re-sults in a lag phase of 3-4 days. Eight or nine successive celldivisions of activated B cells during days 4 and 5 then gener-ate plasma and memory cells. Peak plasma-cell levels are at-tained at day 4-5; peak serum antibody levels are attained byaround day 7-10. For soluble protein antigens, the lag phaseis a little longer, often lasting about a week, peak plasma-celllevels are attained by 9-10 days, and peak serum titers arepresent by around 14 days. During a primary humoral re-sponse, IgM is secreted initially, often followed by a switch toan increasing proportion of IgG. Depending on the persis-tence of the antigen, a primary response can last for variousperiods, from only a few days to several weeks. The memory B cells formed during a primary response stop dividing and enter the G 0phase of the cell cycle. These cells have variable life spans, with some persisting for the lifeof the individual. The capacity to develop a secondary hu-moral response (see Figure 11-14) depends on the existenceof this population of memory B cells as well as memory T cells. Activation of memory cells by antigen results in a sec-ondary antibody response that can be distinguished from theprimary response in several ways (Table 11-4). The secon-dary response has a shorter lag period, reaches a greater mag-264 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses VISUALIZING CONCEPTS Time after immunization1\u00b0 Ag100 IgGTotal IgM FIGURE isotype of serum antibody following primary ( 1\u00b0) and secondary ( 2\u00b0) immunization with anti- gen.

The secondary response is also char- acterized by secretion of antibody with a higher affinity forthe antigen, and isotypes other than IgM predominate. A major factor in the more rapid onset and greater mag- nitude of secondary responses is the fact that the populationof memory B cells specific for a given antigen is considerablylarger than the population of corresponding naive B cells.Furthermore, memory cells are more easily activated thannaive B cells. The processes of affinity maturation and classswitching are responsible for the higher affinity and differentisotypes exhibited in a secondary response. The higher levelsof antibody coupled with the overall higher affinity providean effective host defense against reinfection. The change inisotype provides antibodies whose effector functions are par-ticularly suited to a given pathogen. The existence of long-lived memory B cells accounts for a phenomenon called \"original antigenic sin,\" which was firstobserved when the antibody response to influenza vaccineswas monitored in adults. Monitoring revealed that immu-nization with an influenza vaccine of one strain elicited anantibody response to that strain but, paradoxically, alsoelicited an antibody response of greater magnitude to an-other influenza strain that the individual had been exposedto during childhood. It was as if the memory of the first anti-gen exposure had left a life-long imprint on the immune sys-tem. This phenomenon can be explained by the presence of amemory-cell population, elicited by the influenza strain en-countered in childhood, that is activated by cross-reactingepitopes on the vaccine strain encountered later. This processthen generates a secondary response, characterized by anti-bodies with higher affinity for the earlier viral strain. T Helper Cells Play a Critical Role in the Humoral Response to Hapten-CarrierConjugates As Chapter 3 described, when animals are immunized with small organic compounds (haptens) conjugated with largeproteins (carriers), the conjugate induces a humoral immune response consisting of antibodies both to hapten epitopesand to unaltered epitopes on the carrier protein. Hapten-carrier conjugates provided immunologists with an ideal sys-tem for studying cellular interactions of the humoral re-sponse, and such studies demonstrated that the generation |of a humoral antibody response requires recognition ofthe antigen by both T Hcells and B cells, each recognizing dif- ferent epitopes on the same antigen. A variety of differenthapten-carrier conjugates have been used in immunologicresearch (Table 11-5). One of the earliest findings with hapten-carrier conju- gates was that a hapten had to be chemically coupled to alarger carrier molecule to induce a humoral response to thehapten. If an animal was immunized with both hapten andcarrier separately, very little or no hapten-specific antibodywas generated. A second important observation was that, inorder to generate a secondary antibody response to a hapten,B-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 265 TABLE 11-4 Comparison of primary and secondary antibody responses Property Primary response Secondary response Responding B cell Naive (virgin) B cell Memory B cell Lag period following antigen Generally 4-7days Generally 1-3days administration Time of peak response 7-10days 3-5days Magnitude of peak antibody Varies depending on antigen Generally 100-1000 times higher response than primary response Isotype produced IgM predominates early in the response IgG predominatesAntigens Thymus-dependent and thymus- Thymus-dependent independent Antibody hapten-carrier conjugates used in immunologic research Hapten-carrier globulinthe animal had be again immunized with the same hapten- carrier conjugate used for the primary immunization. If thesecondary immunization was with the same hapten but con-jugated to a different, unrelated carrier, no secondary anti-hapten response occurred. This phenomenon, called thecarrier effect, could be circumvented by priming the animal separately with the unrelated carrier. Similar experiments conducted with a cell-transfer system showed that cells immunized against the hapten and cells im-munized against the carrier were distinct populations. Inthese studies, one mouse was primed with the DNP-BSAconjugate and another was primed with the unrelated carrierBGG, which was not conjugated to the hapten. In one exper-iment, spleen cells from both mice were mixed and injectedinto a lethally irradiated syngeneic recipient. When thismouse was challenged with DNP conjugated to the unrelatedcarrier BGG, there was a secondary anti-hapten response toDNP (Figure 11-15a). In a second experiment, spleen cellsfrom the BGG-immunized mice were treated with anti-T-cellantiserum (anti-Thy-1) and complement to lyse the T cells.When this T-cell-depleted sample was mixed with the DNP-BSA-primed spleen cells and injected into an irradiatedmouse, no secondary anti-hapten response was observedupon immunizing with DNP-BGG (Figure 11-15b). How-ever, similar treatment of the DNP-BSA-primed spleen cellswith anti-Thy-1 and complement did not abolish the sec-ondary anti-hapten response to DNP-BGG (Figure 11-15c).Later experiments, were used to CD4 +or CD8+T cells, showed that the CD4+T-cell subpopulation was responsible for the carrier effect. These ex-periments demonstrate that the response of hapten-primed B cells to the hapten-carrier conjugate requires the presenceof carrier-primed CD4 +THcells specific for carrier epitopes. (It is important to keep in mind that the B-cell response is notlimited to the hapten determinant; in fact some B cells do reactto epitopes on the carrier; however, the assay can be conductedin such a manner as to detect only anti-hapten responses.) The experiments with hapten-carrier conjugates revealed that both T Hcells and B cells must recognize antigenic deter- minants on the same molecule for B-cell activation to occur.This feature of the T- and B-cell interaction in the humoralresponse is called associative, or linked, recognition. Theconclusions drawn from hapten-carrier experiments apply tothe humoral response to antigens in general and support therequirement for T-cell help in B-cell activation described ear-lier in this chapter. In Vivo Sites for Induction of Humoral Responses In vivo activation and differentiation of B cells occurs in de- fined anatomic sites whose structure places certain restric-tions on the kinds of cellular interactions that can take place.266 PART II Generation of are X-irradiated syngeneic with cells and BGG-primed mice and chal-lenged with DNP-BGG generated a secondary anti-DNP response.(b) Removal of T cells from the BGG-primed spleen cells, by treat-ment with anti-Thy- 1antiserum, abolished the secondary anti-DNP response. (c) Removal of T cells from the DNP-BSA-primed spleencells had no effect on the secondary response to DNP. These exper-iments show that carrier-primed cells are T cells and hapten-primedcells are B cells.When an antigen is introduced into the body, it becomes concentrated in various peripheral lymphoid organs. Blood-borne antigen is filtered by the spleen, whereas antigen fromtissue spaces drained by the lymphatic system is filtered byregional lymph nodes or lymph nodules. The following de-scription focuses on the generation of the humoral responsein lymph nodes. A lymph node is an extremely efficient filter capable of trapping more than 90% of any antigen carried into it by theafferent lymphatics. Antigen or antigen-antibody complexesenter the lymph nodes either alone or associated with antigen-transporting cells (e.g., Langerhans cells or dendritic cells)and macrophages. As antigen percolates through the cellulararchitecture of a node, it will encounter one of three types ofantigen-presenting cells: interdigitating dendritic cells dendritic cells in the follicles and ger-minal centers. Antigenic challenge leading to a humoral immune response involves a complex series of events, whichtake place in distinct microenvironments within a lymphnode (Figure 11-16). Slightly different pathways may operateduring a primary and secondary response because much ofthe tissue antigen is complexed with circulating antibody in asecondary response. Once antigen-mediated B-cell activation takes place, small foci of proliferating B cells form at the edges of the T-cell-richzone. These B cells differentiate into plasma cells secretingIgM and IgG isotypes. Most of the antibody produced duringa primary response comes from plasma cells in these foci. (A similar sequence of events takes place in the spleen, where ini-tial B-cell activation takes place in the T-cell-rich periarteriallymphatic sheath, PALS; see Figure 2-19). A few days after the formation of foci within lymph nodes, a few activated B cells, together with a few T Hcells, are thought to migrate from the foci to primary follicles. Thesefollicles then develop into secondary follicles, which provide aspecialized microenvironment favorable for interactionsbetween B cells, activated T Hcells, and follicular dendritic cells. Note that although they share the highly branched mor-phology of dendritic cells derived from bone marrow, follicu-lar dendritic cells do not arise in bone marrow, do not expressclass II MHC molecules, and do not present antigen to CD4 + T cells. Follicular dendritic cells have long extensions, alongwhich are arrayed Fc receptors and complement receptors.These receptors allow follicular dendritic cells to retain andpresent antigen-antibody complexes for long periods of time,even months, on the surface of the cell. Activated B cells(together with some activated T Hcells) may migrate towards the center of the secondary follicle, forming a germinal center. Germinal Centers and Antigen- Induced B-Cell Differentiation Germinal centers arise within 7-10 days after initial exposure to a thymus-dependent antigen. During the first stage ofgerminal-center formation, activated B cells undergo intenseproliferation. These proliferating B cells, known as centro-blasts, appear in human germinal centers as a well-defineddark zone (Figure 11-17). Centroblasts are distinguished by their large size, expanded cytoplasm, diffuse chromatin, andabsence or near absence of surface Ig. Centroblasts eventuallygive rise to centrocytes, which are small, nondividing B cellsthat now express membrane Ig. The centrocytes move fromthe dark zone into a region containing follicular dendriticcells called the light zone, where some centrocytes make con- tact with antigen displayed as antigen-antibody complexeson the surface of follicular dendritic cells. Three importantB-cell differentiation events take place in germinal centers:affinity maturation, class switching, and formation of plasmacells and memory B cells. In general, affinity maturation andmemory-cell formation require germinal centers. Howeversome class switching and significant plasma-cell formationoccur outside germinal centers. Affinity Maturation Is the Result of Repeated Mutation and Selection The average affinity of the antibodies produced during the course of the humoral response increases remarkably duringthe process of affinity maturation, an effect first noticed byH.

Antigen-stimulated B cells migrate into germinal centers,where they reduce expression of surface Ig and undergo rapid celldivision and mutation of rearranged immunoglobulin V regiongenes within the dark zone. Subsequently, division stops and theB cells migrate to the light zone and increase their expression ofsurface Ig. At this stage they are called centrocytes. Within thelight zone centrocytes must interact with follicular dendritic cellsand T helper cells to survive. Follicular dendritic cells bind antigen-antibody complexes along their long extensions and the centro-cytes must compete with each other to bind antigen. B cells bear- ing high-affinity membrane immunoglobulin (antibodies shownin blue) are most likely to compete successfully. Those that failthis antigen-mediated selection (antibodies shown in black) dieby apoptosis. B cells that pass antigen selection and receive a sec-ond survival signal from T Hcells differentiate into either memory B cells or antibody-secreting plasma cells. The encounter with T H cells may also induce class switching. A major outcome of thegerminal center is to generate higher affinity B cells (Ka 2) from B cells of lower affinity ( Ka 1). with the hapten-carrier complex DNP-BGG. The affinity of the serum anti-DNP antibodies produced in response to theantigen was then measured at 2, 5, and 8 weeks after immu-nization. The average affinity of the anti-DNP antibodies in-creased about 140-fold from 2 weeks to 8 weeks. Subsequentwork has shown that affinity maturation is mainly the resultof somatic hypermutation. THE ROLE OF SOMATIC HYPERMUTATION Monitoring of antibody genes during an immune responseshows that extensive mutation of the Ig genes that respond tothe infection takes place in B cells within germinal centers. Adirect demonstration that germinal centers are the sites ofsomatic hypermutation comes from the work of G. Kelsoeand his colleagues. These workers compared the mutationfrequencies in B cells isolated from germinal centers withthose from areas of intense B-cell activation outside the ger-minal centers. T o do so, they prepared thin sections of spleentissue from animals immunized with the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) conjugated with chicken gammaglobulin as a carrier. This system is convenient because theinitial response to this hapten is dominated by a particularheavy-chain gene rearrangement and the use of a /H9253light chain (in mice, >95% of antibodies bear /H9260light chains). Con- sequently, antibodies against the idiotype of this antibodycan be used to readily distinguish responding B cells. Usingantibodies to the idiotype and immunohistological stainingtechniques, these workers identified B cells bearing anti-NP antibody in germinal centers and nongerminal-center foci ofB-cell activation present in thin sections cut from the spleensof recently immunized mice. They isolated these B cells bymicrodissection, used PCR to amplify the immunoglobulingenes of each individual cell, and then cloned and sequencedthe immunoglobulin genes. Many mutations were found inthe immunoglobulin genes obtained from B cells in germinalcenters, few in the genes obtained from activated B cells innongerminal-center foci. When the mutated sequences of thecollection of B cells from germinal centers was examined, itwas apparent that many of the cells had sequences that weresufficiently similar that they were likely to be related by com-mon descent from the same precursor cell. Detailed analysisof the sequences allowed these workers to build genealogictrees in which one could clearly see the descent of progenyfrom progenitors by progressive somatic hypermutation. The introduction of point mutations, deletions, and in- sertions into the rearranged immunoglobulin genes is strik-ingly focused. Figure 11-18 shows that the overwhelmingmajority of these mutations occur in a region that extendsfrom about 0.5 kb 5 /H11032to about 1.5 kb 3 /H11032of the V(D)J segments of rearranged immunoglobulin genes. Although the hyper-mutation process delivers mutations throughout the V re-gion, antigen-driven selection results in the eventual emer-gence of immunoglobulin genes in which the majority of themutations lie within the three complementarity-determiningregions (CDRs). It has been estimated that the mutation rateB-Cell Generation, Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 269Frequency of mutation (%)4.0 3.63.22.82.42.01.61.20.80.40.0 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 2000 0200400 Promoter L V(D)J C region600 of somatic de- with the distance from the rearranged V(D)J gene. Experi-mental measurement of the mutation frequency shows that few ifany mutations are seen upstream of the promoter of the rearrangedgene. Mutations do not extend into the portion of the gene encoding the constant region becaue there are no mutations at positions morethan about 1.5kb 3/H11032 of the rearranged gene. [Adapted from Gearhart, inFundamental Immunology, 3rd ed., 1993, p. 877.]during somatic mutation is approximately 10-3/base pair/ division, which is a millionfold greater than the normal mu-tation rate for other genes of humans or mice cells. Since theheavy- and light-chain V(D)J segments total about 700 basepairs, this rate of mutation means that, for every two cell divisions it undergoes, a centroblast will acquire a mutationin either the heavy- or light-chain variable regions. The ex-tremely high rates and precise targeting of somatic hypermu-tation are remarkable features that are unique to the immunesystem. Determining the molecular basis of this extraordi-nary process remains a challenge in immunology. Because somatic mutation occurs randomly, it will gener- ate a few cells with receptors of higher affinity and many cellswith receptors of unchanged or lower affinity for a particularantigen. Therefore, selection is needed to derive a populationof cells that has increased affinity. The germinal center is thesite of selection. B cells that have high-affinity receptors forthe antigen are likely to be positively selected and leave thegerminal center; those with low affinity are likely to undergonegative selection and die in the germinal center. THE ROLE OF SELECTION Somatic hypermutation of heavy- and light-chain variable-region genes occurs when centroblasts proliferate in the darkzone of the germinal center. Selection takes place in the lightzone, among the nondividing centrocyte population. Themost important factor influencing selection is the ability ofthe membrane Ig molecules on the centrocyte to recognizeand bind antigen displayed by follicular dendritic cells(FDCs). Because the surfaces of FDCs are richly endowedwith both Fc receptors and complement receptors, antigencomplexed with antibody or antigen that has been bound byC3 fragments generated during complement activation (seeChapter 13) can bind to FDCs by antibody or C3 bridges. Acentrocyte whose membrane Ig binds and undergoes cross-linking by FDC-bound antigen receives a signal that is essen-tial for its survival. Those that fail to receive such signals die.However, centrocytes must compete for the small amounts ofantigen present on FDCs;. Because the amount of antigen islimited, centrocytes with receptors of high affinity are morelikely to be successful in binding antigen than those of loweraffinity (see Figure 11-17). While antigen binding is necessary for centrocyte sur- vival, it is not sufficient. A centrocyte must also receive sig-nals generated by interaction with a CD4 +THcell to survive. An indispensable feature of this interaction is the engage-ment of CD40 on the B cell (centrocyte) by CD40L on thehelper T cell. It is also necessary that processed antigen onclass II MHC molecules of the B cell interact with the TCR ofthe collaborating T H-cell. Centrocytes that fail to receive ei- ther the T H-cell or the antigen-membrane Ig signal undergo apoptosis in the germinal center. Indeed, one of the strikingcharacteristics of the germinal center is the extensive celldeath by apoptosis that takes place there. This is clearly evi-dent in the presence of condensed chromatin fragments, in-dicative of apoptosis, in tingible-body macrophages, removes cells by phagocy- tosis from lymphoid tissues. CLASS SWITCHING Antibodies perform two important activities: the specificbinding to an antigen, which is determined by the V Hand VLdomains; and participation in various biological effector functions, which is determined by the isotype of the heavy-chain constant domain. As described in Chapter 5, classswitching allows any given V Hdomain to associate with the constant region of any isotype. This enables antibody speci-ficity to remain constant while the biological effector activi-ties of the molecule vary. A number of cytokines affect thedecision of what Ig class is chosen when an IgM-bearing cellundergoes the class switch (Figure 11-19). The role of cyto-kines in class switching is explored further in Chapter 12. As noted earlier, the humoral response to thymus- dependent antigens is marked by extensive class switching toisotypes other than IgM, whereas the antibody response to thy-mus-independent antigens is dominated by IgM. In the case ofthymus-dependent antigens, membrane interaction betweenCD40 on the B cell and CD40L on the T Hcell is essential for the induction of class switching. The importance of the CD40/CD40L interaction is illustrated by the X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder in which T Hcells fail to express CD40L. Patients with this disorder produce IgMbut not other isotypes. Such patients fail to generate memory-cell populations, fail to form germinal centers, and their anti-bodies fail to undergo somatic hypermutation. Memory B Cells and Plasma Cells are Generated in Germinal Centers After B cells are selected in the germinal center for those bearing high-affinity mIg for antigen displayed on folliculardendritic cells, some B cells differentiate into plasma cellsand others become memory B cells (see Figure 11-17). Whilegerminal centers are important sites of plasma-cell genera-tion, these Ig-secreting cells are fomed in other sites as well.Plasma cells generally lack detectable membrane-bound im-munoglobulin and instead synthesize high levels of secretedantibody (at rates as high as 1000 molecules of Ig per cell persecond). Differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cellsrequires a change in RNA processing so that the secretedform of the heavy chain rather than the membrane form issynthesized. In addition, the rate of transcription of heavy-and light-chain genes is significantly greater in plasma cellsthan in less-differentiated B cells. Several authors have sug-gested that the increased transcription by plasma cells mightbe explained by the synthesis of higher levels of transcriptionfactors that bind to immunoglobulin enhancers. Some mech-anism also must coordinate the increase in transcription ofheavy-chain and light-chain genes, even though these genesare on different chromosomes. As indicated above, B cells that survive selection in the light zone of germinal centers also differentiate into memory270 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responsescells. Some properties of naive and memory B cells are sum- marized in Table 11-6. Except for membrane-bound immuno-globulins, few membrane molecules have been identified thatdistinguish naive B cells from memory B cells. Naive B cellsexpress only IgM and IgD; as a consequence of class switch-ing, however, memory B cells express additional isotypes, in-cluding IgG, IgA, and IgE. Regulation of B-Cell Development A number of transcription factors that regulate expression ofvarious gene products at different stages of B-cell develop-ment have been identified. Activation, and Differentiation CHAPTER 11 271 IgMPlasma cells Activated B cell (centroblast)IgE 11-19 The interactions of numerous cytokines with B cells generate signals required for proliferation and class switching duringthe differentiation of B cells into plasma cells. Binding of the prolifera-tion cytokines, which are released by activated T Hcells, provides theprogression signal needed for proliferation of activated B cells. Similar or identical effects may be mediated by cytokines beyond the onesshown. Class switching in the response to thymus-dependent antigensalso requires the CD 40/CD40L interaction, which is not shown here.

For example,in knockout mice that carry a disrupted Ikaros gene, there is a general failure of lymphocyte development, and pro-B cellsfail to develop in the bone marrow. One of the most critical B-cell transcription factors, B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP), which has been pre- viously mentioned (see Figure 11-3), appears to function as amaster B-cell regulator. It is expressed only by B-lineage cellsand influences all the cell stages during B-cell maturation.Moreover, recent evidence indicates that BSAP also influ-ences the final differentiation events leading to the formationof memory B cells and plasma cells. The latter are the only B-lineage cells that do not express BSAP . BSAP genes,including the /H92615 and Vpre-B genes of the surrogate light chain, the J-chain gene of polymeric IgM, and the 3 /H11032/H9251heavy- chain enhancer region, one of the two enhancers that lie 3 /H11032of the /H9251gene in heavy-chain germ-line DNA. In addition, BSAP binds to various immunoglobulin heavy-chain switch sitesand to several genes involved in B-cell activation. The heavy-chain 3 /H11032/H9251enhancer (E 3/H11032/H9251) contains binding sites for several transcription factors in addition to BSAP .Binding of BSAP to E 3/H11032/H9251appears to influence B-cell develop- ment by preventing the binding of other transcription fac-tors. For example, when BSAP levels are high, this factorappears to block binding of NF- /H9251P to the 3 /H11032/H9251enhancer, thereby blocking transcription of the heavy-chain gene andpromoting formation of memory B cells. When BSAP levelsare low, NF- /H9251P can bind to E 3/H11032/H9251. As a result, transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene is increased, leadingto formation of plasma cells. Regulation of the Immune Effector Response Upon encountering an antigen, the immune system can either develop an immune response or enter a state of unresponsive-ness called tolerance. The development of immunity or toler- ance, both of which involve specific recognition of antigen byantigen-reactive T or B cells, must be carefully regulated sincean inappropriate response\u2014whether it be immunity to self-antigens or tolerance to a potential pathogen\u2014can have seri-ous and possibly life-threatening consequences. Regulation of the immune response takes place in both the humoral and the cell-mediated branch. Every time an antigenis introduced, important regulatory decisions determine thebranch of the immune system to be activated, the intensity ofthe response, and its duration. Chapter 12 describes the im-portance of the cytokines to the orchestration of appropriate immune responses. In addition to cytokines, other regulatorymechanisms may also play important immunoregulatoryroles. Greater knowledge about these regulatory events, whichare still not well understood, may allow the deliberate manip-ulation of immune responses, selectively up-regulating desir-able responses and down-regulating undesirable ones. Different Antigens Can Compete with Each Other The immunologic history of an animal influences the quality and quantity of its immune response. A naive animal re-sponds to antigen challenges very differently from a previ-ously primed animal. Previous encounter with an antigenmay have rendered the animal tolerant to the antigen or mayhave resulted in the formation of memory cells. In somecases, the presence of a competing antigen can regulate theimmune response to an unrelated antigen. This antigenic competition is illustrated by injecting mice with a compet- ing antigen a day or two before immunization with a testantigen. For example, the response to horse red blood cells(HRBCs) is severely reduced by prior immunization withsheep red blood cells (SRBCs) and vice versa (Table 11-7). Al-though antigenic competition is a well-established phenom-enon, its molecular and cellular basis is not understood. The Presence of Antibody Can Suppress the Response to Antigen Like many biochemical reactants, antibody exerts feedback inhibition on its own production. Because of antibody-mediated suppression, certain vaccines (e.g., those for measlesand mumps) are not administered to infants before the age of1 year. The level of naturally acquired maternal IgG, which thefetus acquires by transplacental transfer, remains high forabout 6 months after birth. If an infant is immunized with272 PART II Generation of B-Cell and T-Cell Responses TABLE 11-7Antigenic competition between SRBCs (DAY 8)* Ag1 Ag2 PPC/ 106 (day 0) (day 3) Test spleen cells None HRBC HRBC 205 description of the plaque assay.measles or mumps vaccine while this maternal antibody is still present, the humoral response is low and the production ofmemory cells is inadequate to confer long-lasting immunity. Ifan animal is immunized with a specific antigen and is injectedwith preformed antibody to that same antigen just before orwithin a few days after antigen priming, the immune responseto the antigen is reduced as much as 100-fold. There are two explanations for antibody-mediated sup- pression. One is that the circulating antibody competes withantigen-reactive B cells for antigen inhibiting the clonal ex-pansion of the B cells. The second explanation is that bindingof antigen-antibody complexes by Fc receptors on B cells re-duces signalling by the B-cell-receptor complex. As the antibody response proceeds, antibody feedback produces inhibition of the response. As more secreted IgGmolecules become involved in antigen-antibody complexes,the Ig portions of these complexes become bound to Fc /H9253re- ceptors present on the B cell membane and the antigen of thecomplex binds the Ig of B-cell receptors. This crosslinkingbrings Fc /H9253receptors into close association with activated B-cell-receptor complexes, allowing phosphatases bound tothe cytoplasmic tails of the Fc receptor to dephosphorylatesites in the BCR complex that are necessary to maintain B-cell activation. As a consequence, the activity of the B cell isprogressively down-regulated as the amount of IgG bound toantigen increases. Evidence for such competition betweenpassively administered antibody and antigen-reactive B cellscomes from studies in which it took over 10 times more low-affinity anti-DNP antibody than high-affinity anti-DNPantibody to induce comparable suppression. Furthermore,the competition for antigen between passively administered antibody and antigen-reactive B cells drives the B-cell re-sponse toward higher-affinity antibody. Only the high-affinityantigen-reactive cells can compete successfully with the pas-sively administered antibody for the available antigen. SUMMARY IB cells develop in bone marrow and undergo antigen-induced activation and differentiation in the periphery.Activated B cells can give rise to antibody-secreting plasmacells or memory B cells. IDuring B-cell development, sequential Ig-gene rearrange-ments transform a pro-B cell into an immature B cell ex-pressing mIgM with a single antigenic specificity. Furtherdevelopment yields mature naive B cells expressing bothmIgM and mIgD. IWhen a self-reactive BCR is expressed in the bone marrow,negative selection of the self-reactive immature B cells oc-curs. The selected cells are deleted by apoptosis or undergoreceptor editing to produce non-self-reactive mIg. B cellsreactive with self-antigens encountered in the peripheryare rendered anergic.IIn the periphery, the antigen-induced activation and dif-ferentiation of mature B cells generates an antibody re-sponse. The antibody response to proteins and most otherantigens requires T Hcells. These are thymus-dependent or simply T-dependent (TD) responses. Responses to someantigens, such as certain bacterial cell-wall products (e.g.,LPS) and polymeric molecules with repeating epitopes, donot require T Hcells and are independent (TI) antigens. The vast majority of antigens are dependent. IB-cell activation is the consequence of signal-transductionprocess triggered by engagement of the B-cell receptor thatultimately leads to many changes in the cell, includingchanges in the expression of specific genes. IB- and T-cell activation share many parallels, including:compartmentalization of function within receptor sub-units; activation by membrane-associated protein tyrosinekinases; assembly of large signaling complexes with of sev-eral signal-transduction intensify the activating re-sulting from crosslinkage of mIg. This may be particularlyimportant during the primary response to low concentra-tions of antigen. IActivation induced by TD antigens requires contact-dependent help delivered by the interaction between CD40on B cells and CD40L on activated T Hcells. The CD40/ CD40L interaction is essential for B-cell survival, the for-mation of germinal centers, the generation of memory-cellpopulations, and somatic hypermutation. IThe properties of the primary and secondary antibody re-sponses differ. The primary response has a long lag period, alogarithmic rise in antibody formation, a short plateau, andthen a decline. IgM is the first antibody class produced, fol-lowed by a gradual switch to other classes, such as IgG. Thesecondary response has a shorter lag time, a more rapid log-arithmic phase, a longer plateau phase, and a slower declinethan the primary response. Mostly IgG and other isotypesare produced in the secondary response rather than IgM,and the average affinity of antibody produced is higher.

The complex inter- actions among these cells are mediated by a group of pro-teins collectively designated cytokines to denote their role in cell-to-cell Cytokines are low-molecular-weight regulatory proteins or glycoproteins secreted bywhite blood cells and various other cells in the body inresponse to a number of stimuli. These proteins assist in reg-ulating the development of immune effector cells, and somecytokines possess direct effector functions of their own. This chapter focuses on the biological activity of cyto- kines, the structure of cytokines and their receptors, signaltransduction by cytokine receptors, the role of cytokineabnormalities in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, andtherapeutic uses of cytokines or their receptors. The impor-tant role of cytokines in the inflammatory response isdescribed in Chapter 15. Properties of Cytokines Cytokines bind to specific receptors on the membrane oftarget cells, triggering signal-transduction pathways thatultimately alter gene expression in the target cells (Figure 12-1a). The susceptibility of the target cell to a particularcytokine is determined by the presence of specific mem-brane receptors. In general, the cytokines and their receptorsexhibit very high affinity for each other, with dissociationconstants ranging from 10 -10to 10-12M. Because their af- finities are so high, cytokines can mediate biological effectsat picomolar concentrations. A particular cytokine may bind to receptors on the mem- brane of the same cell that secreted it, exerting autocrine action; it may bind to receptors on a target cell in close prox-imity to the producer cell, exerting paracrine action; in a few cases, it may bind to target cells in distant parts of the body,exerting endocrine action (Figure 12-1b). Cytokines regu- late the intensity and duration of the immune response bystimulating or inhibiting the activation, proliferation, and/or differentiation of various cells and by regulating the secre-tion of antibodies or other cytokines. As described later,binding of a given cytokine to responsive target cells gener-ally stimulates increased expression of cytokine receptorsand secretion of other cytokines, which affect other targetcells in turn. Thus, the cytokines secreted by even a smallnumber of lymphocytes activated by antigen can influencethe activity of numerous cells involved in the immune response. For example, cytokines produced by activated T H cells can influence the activity of B cells, T Ccells, natural killer cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and hematopoieticstem cells, thereby activating an entire network of interact-ing cells. Cytokines exhibit the attributes of pleiotropy, redun- dancy, synergy, antagonism, and cascade induction, whichpermit them to regulate cellular activity in a coordinated,interactive way (Figure 12-2). A given cytokine that has different biological effects on different target cells has apleiotropic action. Two or more cytokines that mediate sim-ilar functions are said to be redundant; redundancy makes itdifficult to ascribe a particular activity to a single cytokine.Cytokine synergism occurs when the combined effect of twocytokines on cellular activity is greater than the additive chapter 12effects of the individual cytokines. In some cases, cytokines exhibit antagonism; that is, the effects of one cytokine inhibitor offset the effects of another cytokine. Cascade inductionoccurs when the action of one cytokine on a target cellinduces that cell to produce one or more other cytokines,which in turn may induce other target cells to produce othercytokines. The term cytokine encompasses those cytokines secreted by lymphocytes, substances formerly known lympho- kines, and those secreted by monocytes and macrophages, substances formerly known as monokines. Although these other two terms continue to be used, they are misleadingbecause secretion of many lymphokines and monokines isnot limited to lymphocytes and monocytes as these termsimply, but extends to a broad spectrum of cells and types.For this reason, the more inclusive term cytokine is preferred. Many cytokines are referred to as interleukins, a name indicating that they are secreted by some leukocytes and actupon other leukocytes. Interleukins 1-25 have been identi-fied. There is reason to suppose that still other cytokines willbe discovered and that the interleukin group will expandfurther. Some cytokines are known by common names,including the interferons and tumor necrosis factors. Re-cently gaining prominence is yet another another subgroupof cytokines, the chemokines, a group of low-molecular- weight cytokines that affect chemotaxis and other aspects of leukocyte behavior. These molecules play an importantrole in the inflammatory response and are described inChapter 15. Because cytokines share many properties with hormones and growth factors, the distinction between these threeclasses of mediators is often blurred. All three are secretedsoluble factors that elicit their biological effects at picomolarconcentrations by binding to receptors on target cells.Growth factors tend to be produced constitutively, whereascytokines and hormones are secreted in response to discretestimuli, and secretion is short-lived, generally ranging from afew hours to a few days. Unlike hormones, which generallyact long range in an endocrine fashion, most cytokines actover a short distance in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Inaddition, most hormones are produced by specialized glandsand tend to have a unique action on one or a few types of tar-get cell. In contrast, cytokines are often produced by, andbind to, a variety of cells. The activity of cytokines was first recognized in the mid- 1960s, when supernatants derived from in vitro cultures oflymphocytes were found to contain factors that could regulateproliferation, differentiation, and maturation of allogeneicCytokines CHAPTER 12 277 Gene activation Biological cellAutocrine action 12-1(a) Overview of the induction and function of cytokines. (b) Most cytokines exhibit autocrine and/or paracrineaction; fewer exhibit endocrine action.immune-system cells. Soon after, it was discovered that pro- duction of these factors by cultured lymphocytes was inducedby activation with antigen or with nonspecific mitogens. Bio-chemical isolation and purification of cytokines was ham-pered because of their low concentration in culture super-natants and the absence of well-defined assay systems for individual cytokines. A great advance was made with thedevelopment of gene-cloning techniques during the 1970sand 1980s, which made it possible to produce pure cytokinesby expressing the protein from cloned genes.

The derivation of monoclonal antibodies specific foreach of the more important cytokines has made it possible todevelop rapid quantitative immunoassays for each of them(Figure 12-3). Cytokines Belong to Four Structural Families Once the genes encoding various cytokines had been cloned, sufficient quantities of purified preparations became avail-able for detailed studies on their structure and function.Cytokines generally have a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Structural studies have shown that the cytokinescharacterized so far belong to one of four groups: the hematopoietin family, the interferon family, the chemokinefamily, or the tumor necrosis factor family. The structures of two members of the hematopoietin family, IL-2 and IL-4, are depicted in Figure 12-4. Althoughthe amino acid sequences of these family members differconsiderably, all of them have a high degree of /H9251-helical structure and little or no /H9252-sheet structure.

Biol. 3:573.]share a similar polypeptide fold, with four /H9251-helical regions (A-D) in which the first and second helices and the third andfourth helices run roughly parallel to one another and areconnected by loops. Cytokines Have Numerous Biological Functions Although a variety of cells can secrete cytokines, the two principal producers are the T Hcell and the macrophage. Cytokines released from these two cell types activate anentire network of interacting cells (Figure 12-5). Among thenumerous physiologic responses that require cytokine in-volvement are development of cellular and humoral im-mune responses, induction of the inflammatory response,regulation of hematopoiesis, control of cellular proliferationand differentiation, and the healing of wounds. Although the immune response to a specific antigen may include the pro-duction of cytokines, it is important to remember thatcytokines act in an antigen-nonspecific manner. That is, theyaffect whatever cells they encounter that bear appropriatereceptors and are in a physiological state that allows them to respond. Cytokines are involved in a staggeringly broad array of biological activities including innate immunity, adaptiveimmunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. Altogether, thetotal number of proteins with cytokine activity easily exceeds100 and research continues to uncover new ones. Table 12-1summarizes the activities of some cytokines and places theminto functional groups. An expanded list of cytokines can befound in the Appendix. It should be kept in mind that mostof the listed functions have been identified from analysis of280 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms VISUALIZING CONCEPTS Inflammation Macrophage Resting TH cell Adaptive immunity Cytokine promotion of macrophage activationCytokine promotionof T H cell differentiation Hemato- poiesis Cytokine promotion of activation, differentiation, proliferation, or celldeath of T cells, B cells, macrophages,dendritic cells, NK cells, andother leukocytes.

Invivo, however, cytokines rarely, if ever, act alone. Instead, atarget cell is exposed to a milieu containing a mixture ofcytokines, whose combined synergistic or antagonistic ef-fects can have very different consequences. In addition,cytokines often induce the synthesis of other cytokines, re-sulting in cascades of activity. The nonspecificity of cytokines seemingly conflicts with the established specificity of the immune system. What keepsthe nonspecific cytokines from activating cells in a nonspe-cific fashion during the immune response? One way in whichspecificity is maintained is by careful regulation of the ex-pression of cytokine receptors on cells. Often cytokine recep-tors are expressed on a cell only after that cell has interactedwith antigen. In this way cytokine activation is limited toantigen-activated lymphocytes. Another means of maintain- ing specificity may be a requirement for direct interactionbetween the cytokine-producing cell and the target cell totrigger cytokine secretion, thus ensuring that effective concen-trations of the cytokine are released only in the vicinity of theintended target. In the case of the T Hcell, a major producer of cytokines, close cellular interaction occurs when the T-cellreceptor recognizes an antigen-MHC complex on an appro-priate antigen-presenting cell, such as a macrophage, den-dritic cell, or B lymphocyte. Cytokines secreted at the junctionof these interacting cells reach high enough local concentra-tions to affect the target APC but not more distant cells. Inaddition, the half-life of cytokines in the bloodstream or otherextracellular fluids into which they are secreted is usually veryshort, ensuring that they act for only a limited period of timeand thus over a short distance.Cytokines CHAPTER 12 281 TABLE 12-1 Functional groups of selected cytokines1 Cytokine * Secreted by ** Targets and effects SOME phase proteins) Tumor Necrosis Macrophages (induction of acute phase loss of muscle, body fat (cachexia); induction of death in many cell 12(IL-12) Macrophages, dendritic cells H1subset) Interleukin 6(IL-6) Macrophages, endothelial cells Liver (induces acute phase proteins); influences adaptive immunity (proliferation and antibody secretion of B cell lineage) Interferon /H9251(IFN- /H9251) Macrophages Induces an antiviral state in most nucleated cells; increases MHC (This is a family of molecules) I expression; activates NK cells Interferon /H9252(IFN- /H9252) Fibroblasts MHC class I expression; activates NK cells OF ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY T cells T-cell proliferation; can promote AICD. and proliferation; Interleukin 4(IL-4)T H2cells; mast cells Promotes isotype switch to IgE Interleukin 5(IL-5)T H2cells Eosinophil activation and generation Interleukin 25(IL-25) Unknown Induces secretion of T H2cytokine profile Transforming growth T cells, macrophages, Inhibits T-cell proliferation and effector functions; inhibits MHC class I and class II molecules; increases antigen presentation 1Many cytokines play roles in more than one functional category. *Only the major cell types providing cytokines for the indicated activity are listed; other cell types may also have the capacit y to synthesize the given cytokine. **Also note that activated cells generally secrete greater amounts of cytokine than unactivated cells.Cytokine Receptors As noted already, to exert their biological effects, cytokines must first bind to specific receptors expressed on the mem-brane of responsive target cells. Because these receptors areexpressed by many types of cells, the cytokines can affect adiverse array of cells. Biochemical characterization of cyto-kine receptors initially progressed at a very slow pace becausetheir levels on the membrane of responsive cells is quite low.As with the cytokines themselves, cloning of the genes encod-ing cytokine receptors has led to rapid advances in the iden-tification and characterization of these receptors. Cytokine Receptors Fall Within Five Families Receptors for the various cytokines are quite diverse struc-turally, but almost all belong to one of five families of recep-tor proteins (Figure 12-6): IImmunoglobulin superfamily receptors IClass I cytokine receptor family (also known as thehematopoietin receptor family) IClass II cytokine receptor family (also known as theinterferon receptor family) ITNF receptor family IChemokine receptor family Many of the cytokine-binding receptors that function in the immune and hematopoietic systems belong to the class Icytokine receptor family. The members of this receptor familyhave conserved amino acid sequence motifs in the extracellu-lar domain consisting of four positionally conserved cysteineresidues (WSXWS, whereX is the nonconserved amino acid). The receptors for all thecytokines classified as hematopoietins belong to the class Icytokine receptor family, which also is called the hematopoi-etin receptor family. The class II cytokine receptors possessthe conserved CCCC motifs, but lack the WSXWS motif pre-sent in class I cytokine receptors. Initially only the threeinterferons, /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253, were thought to be ligands for these receptors. However, recent work has shown that the IL-10receptor is also a member of this group. Another feature common to most of the hematopoietin (class I cytokine) and the class II cytokine receptor families is282 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms RECEPTOR FAMILY LIGANDS (a) Immunoglobulin superfamily receptors IL-1M-CSFC-KitS S S S S (hematopoietin) FIGURE 12-6Schematic diagrams showing the structural features that define the five types of receptor proteins to which most cytokinesbind.

C refers to conserved cysteine.multiple subunits, often including one subunit that binds specific cytokine molecules and another that mediates signaltransduction. Note, however, that these two functions are notalways confined to one subunit or the other. Engagement ofall of the class I and class II cytokine receptors studied to datehas been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of thereceptor through the activity of protein tyrosine kinasesclosely associated with the cytosolic domain of the receptors. Subfamilies of Class I Cytokine Receptors Have Signaling Subunits in Common Several subfamilies of class I cytokine receptors have been identified, with all the receptors in a subfamily having anidentical signal-transducing subunit. Figure 12-7 schemati-cally receptor subfamilies,named after GM-CSF, IL-2, and IL-6. The explains redundancy bysome cytokines. Consider the GM-CSF receptor IL-5, and GM-CSF (seeFigure 12-7a). Each of these cytokines binds to a unique low-affinity, cytokine-specific receptor consisting of an /H9251subunit only. All three low-affinity subunits can associate noncova-lently with a common signal-transducing /H9252subunit. The re- sulting dimeric receptor not only exhibits increased affinityfor the cytokine but also can transduce a signal across after the cytokine stemcells and progenitor cells, activate monocytes, and inducemegakaryocyte differentiation. three of these cytokinesinduce eosinophil proliferation and basophil degranulationwith release of histamine. Since the receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF share a common signal-transducing /H9252subunit, each of these cyto- kines would be expected to transduce a similar activation sig-nal, accounting for the redundancy among their biologicaleffects (Figure 12-8b). In fact, all three cytokines induce thesame of protein phosphorylation. Furthermore,IL-3 and GM-CSF exhibit antagonism; IL-3 binding has beenshown to be inhibited by GM-CSF, and conversely, binding Cytokines CHAPTER 12 283 GM-CSF subfamilies of class I cytokine receptors. All members of a subfamily have a common sig-nal-transducing subunit (blue), but a unique cytokine-specific subunit.In addition to the conserved cysteines (double black lines) and WSXWSmotifs (red lines) that characterize class I cytokine receptors, immu-noglobulin-like domains are present in some of munol. 14:179.]of GM-CSF has been shown to be inhibited by IL-3. Since the signal-transducing /H9252subunit is shared between the re- ceptors for these two cytokines, their antagonism is due tocompetition for a limited number of /H9252subunits by the cytokine-specific /H9251subunits of the receptors (Figure 12-8c). A similar situation is found among the IL-6 receptor sub- family, which includes the receptors for IL-6, IL-11, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and ciliaryneurotrophic (see Figure this case,a common signal-transducing subunit one or two different cytokine-specific subunits. LIFand OSM, which must share certain structural features, bothbind to the same /H9251subunit. As expected, the cytokines that bind to receptors in this subfamily display overlapping bio-logical activities: IL-6, OSM, and LIF induce synthesis ofacute-phase proteins by liver hepatocytes and differentiationof myeloid leukemia cells and platelet pro-duction. The presence of gp130 in all receptors of the IL-6subfamily explains their common signaling pathways as wellas the binding competition for limited gp130 molecules thatis observed among these cytokines. A third signal-transducing subunit defines the IL-2 recep- tor which includes for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7,IL-9, and IL-15 (see Figure 12-7c). The IL-2 and the IL-15receptors are consisting of cytokine-specific/H9251chain two /H9253\u2014responsible for signal as the sig- nal-transducing subunit in the other receptors in this sub-family, which are all dimers. Recently, it has been shown thatcongenital X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) results from a defect in the /H9253-chain gene, which maps to the X chromosome. The immunodeficiencies ob-served in this disorder are due to the loss of all the cytokinefunctions mediated by the IL-2 subfamily receptors. The IL- 2R Is One of the Most Thoroughly Studied Cytokine Receptors Because of the central role of IL-2 and its receptor in the clonal proliferation of T cells, the IL-2 receptor has receivedintensive study. As noted in the previous section, the com-plete trimeric receptor comprises three distinct subunits\u2014the /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253chains. The /H9252and /H9253chains belong to the class I cytokine receptor family, containing the characteristic CCCCand WSXWS motifs, whereas the /H9251chain has a quite different structure and is not a member of this receptor family (seeFigure 12-7c). The IL-2 receptor occurs in three forms that ferent (Figure 12-9). Because the /H9251 chain is expressed only by activated T cells, it is often referredto as the TAC (T-cell activation) antigen.

Signal trans- duction by the IL-2 receptor requires both the /H9252and /H9253 chains, but only the trimeric receptor containing the /H9251chain as well binds IL-2 with high affinity. Although the /H9253chain appears to be constitutively expressed on most lymphoidcells, expression of the /H9251 and /H9252chains is more restricted and is markedly enhanced after antigen has activated restinglymphocytes. This phenomenon ensures that only antigen-activated CD4 +and CD8+T cells will express the high- affinity IL-2 receptor and proliferate in response to physio-logic levels of IL-2. Activated T cells express approximately 5 /H1100310 3high-affinity receptors and ten times as many low- affinity receptors. NK cells express the /H9252and /H9253subunits con- stitutively, accounting for their ability to bind IL-2 with anintermediate affinity and to be activated by IL-2. Engaged Cytokine Receptors Activate Signaling Pathways While some important cytokine receptors lie outside the class I and class II families, the majority are included withinthese two families. As mentioned previously, class I and classII cytokine receptors lack signaling motifs (e.g., intrinsictyrosine kinase domains). Y et, early observations demon-strated that one of the first events after the interaction of a cytokine with one of these receptors is a series of pro-tein tyrosine phosphorylations. While these results were ini-tially puzzling, they were explained when a unifying modelemerged from studies of the molecular events triggered bybinding of interferon gamma (IFN- /H9253) to its receptor, a mem- ber of the class II family. IFN- /H9253was originally discovered because of its ability to induce cells to block or inhibit the replication of a wide vari-ety of viruses. Antiviral activity is a property it shares withIFN- /H9251and IFN- /H9252. However, unlike these other interferons, IFN- /H9253plays a central role in many immunoregulatory processes, including the regulation of mononuclear phago-cytes, B-cell switching to certain IgG classes, and the supportor inhibition of the development of T H-cell subsets. The dis- covery of the major signaling pathway invoked by interactionof IFN- /H9253with its receptor led to the realization that signal transduction through most, if not all, class I and class IIcytokine receptors involves the following steps, which are thebasis of a unifying signaling model (Figure 12-10). IThe cytokine receptor is composed of separate subunits,an /H9251chain required for cytokine binding and for signal transduction and a /H9252chain necessary for signaling but with only a minor role in binding. IDifferent inactive protein tyrosine kinases are associatedwith different subunits of the receptor. The /H9251chain of the receptor is associated with a novel family of proteintyrosine kinases, the Janus kinase (JAK) *family. The association of the JAK and the receptor subunit occursspontaneously and does not require the binding ofcytokine. However, in the absence of cytokine, JAKs lackprotein tyrosine kinase activity. ICytokine twoseparate cytokine receptor subunits and activation of thereceptor-associated JAKs. The ability of IFN- /H9253,w h i c h binds to a class II cytokine receptor, to bring about theassociation of the ligand-binding chains of its receptorhas been directly demonstrated by x-ray crystallographicstudies, as shown in Figure 12-11.

Signal transduction is mediated by the /H9252and /H9253chains, but all three chains are required for high-affinity binding of IL- 2. *The Roman god Janus had two faces. Kinases of the Janus family have two sites, a binding site at which they link with the cytokine receptor subunit and acatalytic site that, when activated, has protein tyrosine kinase activity. Some bio-chemists, wearied by the multitude of different protein kinases that have beendiscovered, claim JAK means Just Another Kinase.complex. Members of a family of transcription factors known as STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) bind to these phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Specific STATs (see Table 12-2) play essentialroles in the signaling pathways of a wide variety ofcytokines. The binding of STATs to receptor subunits ismediated by the joining of the SH2 domain on the STAT with the docking site created by the JAK-mediatedphosphorylation of a particular tyrosine on receptorsubunits. IAfter undergoing JAK-mediated phosphorylation, STATtranscription factors translocate from receptor docking sites at the membrane to the nucleus, where they initiatethe transcription of specific genes. While docked to receptor subunits, STATs undergo JAK-catalyzedphosphorylation of a key tyrosine. This is followed bythe dissociation of the STATs from the receptor subunitsand their dimerization. The STAT dimers thentranslocate into the nucleus and induce the expression of genes containing appropriate regulatory sequences intheir promoter regions. In addition to IFN- /H9253, a number of other class I and class II ligands have been shown to cause dimerization of their re-ceptors. An important element of cytokine specificity derivesfrom the exquisite specificity of the match between cytokinesand their receptors. Another aspect of cytokine specificity isthat each particular cytokine (or group of redundant cyto-kines) induces transcription of a specific subset of genes in agiven cell type; the resulting gene products then mediate thevarious effects typical of that cytokine. The specificity ofcytokine effects is then traceable to three factors. First, par-ticular cytokine receptors start particular JAK-STAT path-ways. Second, the transcriptional activity of activated STATs286 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms Dimerization of receptor Activation of JAK family tyrosine kinases,phosphorylation of receptor Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT by JAK kinase Dimerization of STAT DNA Specific gene transcriptionPPP P P P P P PPSTATSH2JAKCytokine FIGURE 12-10 General model of signal transduction mediated by most class I and class II cytokine receptors. Binding of a cytokine in-duces dimerization of the receptor subunits, which leads activa-tion of receptor-subunit-associated JAK JAKs phosphorylate vari-ous tyrosine residues, resulting in the creation of docking sites forSTATs on the receptor and the activation of the one or more STAT tran-scription factors. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocateto the nucleus, where they activate transcription of specific genes. FIGURE 12-11 The complex between IFN- /H9253and the ligand-binding chains of its receptor. This model is based on the x-ray crystallo-graphic analysis of a crystalline complex of interferon- /H9253(violet and blue) bound to ligand-binding /H9251chains of the receptor (green and yellow). Note that IFN- /H9253is shown in its native dimeric form; each member of the dimer engages the /H9251chain of an IFN- /H9253receptor, thereby bringing about receptor dimerization and signal transduc-tion.

Walter, University of Alabama.]is specific because a particular STAT homodimer or het- erodimer will only recognize certain sequence motifs andthus can interact only with the promoters of certain genes.Third, only those target genes whose expression is permittedby a particular cell type can be activated within that variety of cell. That is, in any given cell type only a subset of thepotential target genes of a particular STAT may be permittedexpression. For example, IL-4 induces one set of genes in T cells, another in B cells, and yet a third in eosinophils. Cytokine Antagonists A number of proteins that inhibit the biological activity ofcytokines have been reported. These proteins act in one oftwo ways: either they bind directly to a cytokine receptor butfail to activate the cell, or they bind directly to a cytokine,inhibiting its activity. The best-characterized inhibitor is theIL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which binds to the IL-1receptor but has no activity. Binding of IL-1Ra to the IL-1receptor blocks binding of both IL-1 /H9251and IL-1 /H9252,t h u s accounting for its antagonistic properties. Production ofIL-1Ra has been thought by some to play a role in regulatingthe intensity of the inflammatory response. It has beencloned and is currently being investigated as a potential treat-ment for chronic inflammatory diseases. Cytokine inhibitors are found in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid. These soluble antagonists arise from enzy-matic cleavage of the extracellular domain of cytokine recep-tors. Among the soluble cytokine receptors that have been those -6, - /H9251,T N - /H9252, and LIF. Of these, the soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), which isreleased in chronic T-cell activation, is the best characterized. A segment containing the amino-terminal 192 amino acidsof the /H9251subunit is released by proteolytic cleavage, forming a 45-kDa soluble IL-2 receptor. The shed receptor can bindIL-2 and prevent its interaction with the membrane-boundIL-2 receptor. The presence of sIL-2R has been used as a clin-ical marker of chronic T-cell activation and is observed in anumber of diseases, including autoimmunity, transplant re-jection, and AIDS. Some viruses also produce cytokine-binding proteins or cytokine mimics. The evolution of such anti-cytokine strate-gies by microbial pathogens is good biological evidence ofthe importance of cytokines in organizing and promoting ef-fective anti-microbial immune responses. The poxviruses, forexample, have been shown to encode a soluble TNF-bindingprotein and a soluble IL-1-binding protein. Since both TNFand IL-1 exhibit a broad spectrum of activities in the inflam-matory response, these soluble cytokine-binding proteinsmay prohibit or diminish the inflammatory effects of thecytokines, thereby conferring upon the virus a selective ad-vantage. Epstein-Barr virus produces an IL-10-like molecule(viral IL-10 or IL-10, suppresses T H1-type cell-mediated re- (see the next section), which are effective againstmany intracellular parasites such as viruses. Molecules pro-duced by viruses that mimic cytokines allow the virus tomanipulate the immune response in ways that aid the sur-vival of the pathogen. This is an interesting and powerfulmodification some viruses have undergone in their continu-ing struggle to overcome the formidable barrier of hostimmunity.

TABLE Leporipoxvirus Several by T H1 and T H2Subsets The immune response to a particular pathogen must induce an appropriate set of effector functions that can eliminate thedisease agent or its toxic products from the host. For exam-ple, the neutralization of a soluble bacterial toxin requiresantibodies, whereas the response to an intracellular virus or to a bacterial cell requires cell-mediated cytotoxicity ordelayed-type hypersensitivity. A large body cytokine-secretion patterns amongT H-cell subsets as determinants of the type of immune response made to a particular antigenic challenge. CD4+THcells exert most of their helper functions through secreted cytokines, which either act on the cells thatproduce them in an autocrine fashion or modulate the re-sponses of other cells through paracrine pathways. AlthoughCD8 +CTLs also secrete cytokines, their array of cytokines generally is more restricted than that of CD4+THcells. As briefly discussed in Chapter 10, two CD4+TH-cell subpopu- lations designated T H1 and T H2, can be distinguished in vitro by the cytokines they secrete. Both subsets secrete IL-3 andGM-CSF but differ in the other cytokines they produce(Table 12-4). T H1 and T H2 cells are characterized the fol- lowing functional differences: IThe T H1 (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity andactivation of T Ccells) and for the production of opsonization-promoting IgG antibodies (i.e. antibodiesthat bind to the high-affinity Fc receptors of phagocytesand interact with the complement system). This subset is also associated with the promotion of excessiveinflammation and tissue injury. IThe T H2 subset stimulates eosinophil activation and differentiation, provides help to B cells, and promotesthe production of relatively large amounts of IgM, IgE,and noncomplement-activating IgG isotypes. The T H2 subset also supports allergic reactions. The differences in the cytokines secreted by T H1 and T H2 cells determine the different biological functions of these twosubsets. A defining cytokine of the T H1 subset, IFN- /H9253,a c t i - vates macrophages, stimulating these cells to increase micro-bicidal activity, up-regulate the level of class II MHC, andsecrete cytokines such as IL-12, which induces H1 H1 cells also induces antibody-class switching to IgG classes (such asIgG2a in the mouse) /H9252and IFN- /H9253are and it is their secretion that accounts forthe association of T H1 cells with inflammatory phenomena such as delayed hypersensitivity (Chapter 16). T H1 cells pro- duce IL-2 and IFN- /H9253cytokines that differentia-tion of cytotoxic T Ccells from CD8+precursors. This pattern cytokine production makes the T H1 subset partic- ularly suited to respond to viral infections and intracellularpathogens. Finally, IFN- /H9253inhibits the expansion of the T H2 population. The secretion of IL-4 and IL-5 by cells of the T H2 subset in- duces production of IgE and supports eosinophil-mediatedattack on helminth (roundworm) infections. IL-4 promotes apattern of class switching that produces IgG that does notactivate the complement pathway (IgG1 in mice, for exam-ple). IL-4 also increases the extent to which B cells switchfrom IgM to IgE. This effect on IgE production meshes witheosinophil differentiation and activation by IL-5, becauseeosinophils are richly endowed with Fc /H9280receptors, which bind IgE. Typically, roundworm infections induce T H2 re- sponses and evoke anti-roundworm IgE antibody. The anti-body bound to the worm binds to the Fc receptors ofeosinophils, thus forming an antigen-specific bridge betweenthe worm and the eosinophils. The attack of the eosinophilon the worm is triggered by crosslinking of the Fc /H9280-bound IgE. Despite these beneficial actions of IgE, it is also the Ig288 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 12-4Cytokine secretion and principal functions IL-13 -+ + FUNCTIONS Help for total antibody production + ++ Help for IgE production - ++Help for IgG 2a production ++ R.

Because the T H1 and T H2 subsets were originally identi- fied in long-term in vitro cultures of cloned T-cell lines, someresearchers doubted that they represented true in vivo sub-populations. They suggested instead that these subsets mightrepresent different maturational stages of a single lineage.Also, the initial failure to locate either subset in humans ledsome to believe that T H1, T H2, and other subsets of T helper cells did not occur in this species. Further research correctedthese views. In many in vivo systems, the full commitment ofpopulations of T cells to either the T H1 or T H2 phenotype often signals the endpoint of a chronic infection or allergy.Hence it was difficult to find clear T H1 or T H2 subsets in studies employing healthy human subjects, who would notbe at this stage of a response. Experiments with transgenicmice demonstrated conclusively that T H1 and T H2 cells arise independently. Furthermore, it was possible to demonstrateT H1 or T H2 populations in T cells isolated from humans dur- ing chronic infectious disease or chronic episodes of allergy.It is also important to emphasize that many helper T cells donot show either a T H1 or a T H2 profile; individual cells have shown striking heterogeneity in the T H-cell population. One of the best described of these is the T H0 subset, which secretes IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, as well as IL-3 and GM-CSF. Numerous reports of studies in both mice and humans now document that the in vivo outcome of the immuneresponse can be critically influenced by the relative levels ofT H1-like or T H2-like activity. Typically, the T H1 profile of cytokines is higher in response to intracellular pathogens,and the T H2 profile is higher in allergic diseases and hel- minthic infections. The Development of T H1and T H2Subsets Is Determined by the Cytokine Environment The cytokine environment in which antigen-primed T Hcells differentiate determines the subset that develops (Figure 12-12). In particular, IL-4 is essential for the development ofa T H2 response, and IFN- /H9253, IL-12, and IL-18 all are impor- tant in the physiology of the development of T H1 cells. The source of IL-12, one of the key mediatiors of T H1 differentia- tion, is typically macrophages or dendritic cells activated by an encounter with intracellular bacteria, with bacterialproducts such as LPS, or with a number of other intracellularparasites. T H1 development is also critically dependent on IFN- /H9253, which induces a number of changes, including the up-regulation of IL-12 production by macrophages and den-dritic cells, and the activation of the IL-12 receptor on acti-vated T cells, which it accomplishes by up-regulating expres-sion of the /H9252chain of the IL-12 receptor. At the beginning of an immune response, IFN- /H9253is generated by stimulation of T cells and can also come from activated NK cells.Y et anothercytokine, IL-18, promotes proliferation and IFN- /H9253produc-tion by both developing and fully differentiated T H1 cells and by NK cells. So a regulatory network of cytokines posi-tively controls the generation of T H1 cells. The critical role played by each of these cytokines and their receptors hasbeen demonstrated in a series of experiments in which eitherthe cytokine or its receptor has been knocked out. Mice inwhich the genes for any of these critical components havebeen knocked out fail to generate populations of T H1 cells. Just as T H1 cells require IL-12 and IFN- /H9253, the generation of T H2 cells depends critically on IL-4. Exposing naive helper cells to IL-4 at the beginning of an immune response causesthem to differentiate into T H2 cells. In fact, this influence of IL-4 is predominant in directing T Hcells to the T H2 route. Provided a threshold level of IL-4, T H2 development isCytokines CHAPTER 12 289 Macrophage or dendriticcell Positive T Hsubsets. Antigen-activated naive CD 4+T cell produces IL- 2 and proliferates. If it proliferates in an IL- 12dominated environment, it generates a population of T H1cells that secretes a characteristic profile of cytokines including interferon /H9253. A positive feedback loop is established when IFN- /H9253secreted by the expanding T H1population stimulates dendritic cells or macrophages to produce more IL- 12. If the environment is dominated by IL- 4, a T H2population emerges and secretes a profile of cytokines that promotes eosinophil activa-tion and the synthesis of certain antibody classes. Key cytokines pro-duced by each subset positively regulate the subset that produces itand negatively regulate the other subset. [Adapted from J. Rengarajan, S. Szabo, and L. Glimcher, Today 21:479.]greatly favored over T H1 even if IL-12 is present. The critical role of signals from IL-4 in T H2 development is shown by the observation that knocking out the gene that encodes IL-4prevents the development of this T-cell subset. Additionalevidence supporting the central role of IL-4 comes from anexperiment that interrupted the IL-4 signal-transductionpathway. Like so many other cytokines, IL-4 uses a pathwaythat involves JAK and STAT proteins. The Stat6 transcriptionfactor is the one activated in signaling by IL-4. Consequently,in mice in which the gene for Stat6 has been disrupted (Stat6knockouts), IL-4 mediated processes are severely inhibited orabsent. The observation that Stat6 knockout mice have veryfew T H2 cells confirms the importance of IL-4 for the differ- entiation of this subset. Cytokine Profiles Are Cross-Regulated The critical cytokines produced by T H1 and T H2 subsets have two characteristic effects on subset development. First, theypromote the growth of the subset that produces them; sec-ond, they inhibit the development and activity of the oppo-site subset, an effect known as cross-regulation, (see Figure 12-12). instance, IFN- /H9253(secreted by the T H1 subset) preferentially inhibits proliferation of the T H2 subset, and IL-4 and IL-10 (secreted by the T H2 subset) down-regulate secretion of of the dif- by both macrophages and dendritic cells. Simi-larly, these cytokines have opposing effects on target cellsother than T Hsubsets. /H9253secreted by the T H1 subset pro- motes production by B cells but inhibits IgG1 and IgEproduction. On the other hand, IL-4 secreted by the T H2 sub- set promotes production of IgG1 and IgE and suppressesproduction of IgG2a. The phenomenon of cross-regulationexplains the observation that there is often an inverse rela-tionship between antibody production and cell-mediatedimmunity; that is, when antibody production is high, cell-mediated immunity is low, and vice versa. Furthermore,recent research has shown that IL-4 and IFN- /H9253make mem- bers of the T-cell subset that releases them less responsive tothe cytokine that directs differentiation of the other T-cellsubset. Thus, IL-4 enhances T H2 cell development by making THcells less susceptible to the cytokine signals that cause these cells to enter a differentiation pathway that would leadto T H1 development. On the other hand, as explained below, IFN- /H9253up-regulates the expression of a key regulatory mole- cule that favors the differentiation and activity of T H1 cells. Recent work has given insight into the molecular basis for the cytokine-mediated cross-regulation by which onesubset promotes its own expansion and development whileinhibiting the development of the opposite subset. Two tran-scription factors, T-Bet and GATA-3, are key elements de-termining subset commitment and cross-regulation. The ex-pression of T-Bet drives cells to differentiate into T H1 cells and suppresses their differentiation along the T H2 pathway. Expression of GATA-3 does the opposite, promoting the de-velopment of naive T cells into T H2 cells while suppressing their differentiation into T H1 cells. As shown in Figure 12-13, the expression of T-Bet versus GATA-3 is determined by thecytokines IFN- /H9253and IL-4. In the presence of IFN- /H9253, T cells up- regulate the expression of T-Bet down-regulate GATA-3.This IFN- /H9253receptor/Stat1-dependent process shifts the production of IFN- /H9253, the signature cytokine of T H1 cells, and other cytokines typical of the T H1 set. On the other hand, in a process that involves the IL-4 receptor andStat6, IL-4 induces the cell to produce IL-4 and other T H2 cytokines. Further study has revealed that the up-regulationof T-Bet Consequently,cytokine signals that induce one of these transcription fac-tors set in motion a chain of events that repress the other.

Signals through the TCR and cytokine receptors determine whether the cellwill produce the T H1-promoting transcription factor, T-Bet, or the TH2-promoting transcription factor, GATA- 3. Experimental evidence supports a model in which exposure of cells bearing receptors forIFN-/H9253to IFN- /H9253induces the formation of T-Bet, which up-regulates of IFN- /H9253and represses the expression of GATA- 3.

This interference is thought to result from the demonstrated ability of IL-10 todown-regulate the expression of class II MHC molecules onthese antigen-presenting cells. IL-10 has other potent immu-nosuppressant effects on the monocyte-macrophage lineage,such as suppressing the production of nitric oxide and otherbactericidal metabolites involved in the destruction of path-ogens, and also suppressing the production of macrophage serve to further diminish the biologic consequences of T H1 activation. The T H1/TH2Balance Determines Disease Outcomes The progression of some diseases may depend on the balance between the T H1 and T H2 subsets. In humans, a well-studied example of this phenomenon is leprosy, which is caused byMycobacterium leprae, an intracellular pathogen that can sur- of macrophages. Leprosy is not asingle clinical entity; rather, the disease presents as a spec-trum of clinical responses, with two major forms of disease,tuberculoid and lepromatous, at each end of the spectrum.In tuberculoid leprosy, a cell-mediated immune response forms granulomas, resulting in the destruction of most of themycobacteria, so that only a few organisms remain in the tissues. Although skin and peripheral nerves are damaged,tuberculoid leprosy progresses slowly and patients usuallysurvive. In lepromatous leprosy, the cell-mediated response is depressed and, instead, humoral antibodies are formed,sometimes resulting in hypergammaglobulinemia. The myco-bacteria are widely disseminated in macrophages, often reach-ing numbers as high as 10 10per gram of tissue. Lepromatous leprosy progresses into disseminated infection of the boneand cartilage with extensive nerve damage. The development of lepromatous or tuberculoid leprosy depends on the balance of T H1 and T H2 cells (Figure 12-14). In tuberculoid leprosy, the immune response is characterizedby a T H1-type response with delayed-type hypersensitivity and a cytokine profile consisting high IL-2, IFN- /H9253, and TNF- /H9252. a T H2-type im- mune response, with high levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. Thiscytokine profile explains the diminished cell-mediated im-munity and increased production of serum antibody in lep-romatous leprosy. There is also evidence for changes in T H-subset activity in AIDS. Early in the disease, T H1 activity is high, but as AIDS progresses, some workers have suggested, there may be a shiftfrom a T H1-like to a T H2-like response. In addition, some pathogens may influence the activity of the T Hsubsets. The Epstein-Barr virus, for instance, produces vIL-10, which hasIL-10-like activity and, like cellular IL-10, tends to suppress TH1 activity by cross-regulation. Some researchers have spec- ulated that vIL-10 may reduce the cell-mediated response tothe Epstein-Barr virus, thus conferring a survival advantageon the virus. Cytokine-Related Diseases Defects in the complex regulatory networks governing theexpression of cytokines and cytokine receptors have beenimplicated in a number of diseases. This section describesseveral diseases resulting from overexpression or underex-pression of cytokines or cytokine receptors. Bacterial Septic Shock Is Common and Potentially Lethal The role of cytokine overproduction in pathogenesis can be illustrated by bacterial septic shock. This condition maydevelop a few hours after infection by certain gram-negativebacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis. of bacterial septic shock, which is often fatal,include a drop in blood pressure, fever, diarrhea, and wide-spread blood clotting in various organs. This condition afflictsabout 500,000 Americans annually and causes more than70,000 deaths. The annual cost for treating bacterial septicshock is estimated to be in excess of $5 billion. Bacterial septic shock apparently develops because bacte- rial /H9251to levels that cause septic shock. InCytokines CHAPTER 12 291 FIGURE 12-14 Correlation between type of leprosy and relative TH1or T H2activity. Messenger RNA isolated from lesions from tu- berculoid and lepromatous leprosy patients was analyzed by South-ern blotting using the cytokine probes indicated. Cytokines producedby T H1cells predominate in patients, by T H2cells predominate in the lepromatous patients. [From P. levels of TNF- /H9251were found in patients who died of meningitis than in those who recovered.Furthermore, a condition resembling bacterial septic shockcan be produced by injecting mice with recombinant TNF- /H9251 in the absence of gram-negative bacterial infection. Severalstudies offer some hope that neutralization of TNF- /H9251or IL-1 activity with monoclonal antibodies or antagonists may pre-vent this fatal shock from developing in these bacterial infec-tions. In one study, monoclonal antibody to TNF- /H9251protected animals from endotoxin-induced shock. Another study hasshown that injection of a recombinant IL-1 receptor antago-nist (IL-1Ra), which prevents binding of IL-1 to the IL-1receptor, resulted in a three-fold reduction in mortality. It is hoped that these experimental results will lead to clinicallyuseful products for the treatment of bacterial septic shock in humans. Bacterial Toxic Shock Is Caused by Superantigens A variety of microorganisms produce toxins that act as super- antigens. As Chapter 10 described, superantigens bind simul- taneously to a class II MHC molecule and to the V /H9252domain of the T-cell receptor, activating all T cells bearing a particular V /H9252 domain (Figure 10-16). Because of their unique binding abil-ity, superantigens can activate large numbers of T cells irre-spective of their antigenic specificity. Although less than 0.01% of T cells respond to a given conventional antigen, between 5% and 25% of T cells canrespond to a given superantigen. The large proportion ofT cells responsive to a particular superantigen results fromthe limited number of TCR V /H9252genes carried in the germ line. Mice, for example, have about 20 V /H9252genes. Assuming that each V /H9252gene is expressed with equal frequency, then each superantigen would be expected to interact with 1 in 20 T cells, or 5% of the total T-cell population. A number of bacterial superantigens have been implicated as the causative agent of several diseases such as bacterial toxicshock and food poisoning. Included among these bacterialsuperantigens are several enterotoxins, exfoliating large number of T cells activated by these superantigens results in excessiveproduction of cytokines. The toxic-shock syndrome toxin,for example, has been shown to induce extremely high levelsof TNF and IL-1. As in bacterial septic shock, these elevatedconcentrations of cytokines can induce systemic reactionsthat include fever, widespread blood clotting, and shock. Cytokine Activity Is Implicated in Lymphoid and Myeloid Cancers Abnormalities in the production of cytokines or their recep- tors have been associated with some types of cancer. For ex-ample, abnormally high levels of IL-6 are secreted by cardiac myxoma cells (a benign heart tumor), myeloma and plasma-cytoma cells, and cervical and bladder cancer cells. In myeloma cells, IL-6 appears to operate in an autocrine man-ner to stimulate cell proliferation. When monoclonal anti-bodies to IL-6 are added to in vitro cultures of myeloma cells,their growth is inhibited. In addition, transgenic mice thatexpress high levels of IL-6 have been found to exhibit a mas-sive, fatal plasma-cell proliferation, called plasmacytosis.Although these plasma cells are not malignant, the high rateof plasma-cell proliferation possibly contributes to the devel-opment of cancer. Chagas' Disease Is Caused by a Parasite The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which is characterized by severe immunesuppression. The ability of T. cruzi to mediate immune sup- pression can be observed by culturing peripheral-blood Tcells in the presence and in the absence of T. cruzi and then evaluating their immune reactivity. Antigen, mitogen, oranti-CD3 monoclonal antibody normally can activate peri-pheral T cells, but in the presence of T. cruzi, T cells are not activated by any of these agents. The defect in these lympho-cytes has been traced to a dramatic reduction in the expres-sion of the 55-kDa /H9251subunit of the IL-2 receptor. As noted earlier, the IL-2 receptor contains /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253 subunits. The specific for cytokine binding (see Figure 12-9). Co-culturing of T cells /H9251subunit, a 90% decrease in the level of the /H9251subunit. Although the mechanism by which T. cruzi suppresses expression of the /H9251subunit is still unknown, the suppression can be induced across a filter that prevents contact betweenthe lymphocytes and protozoa. This finding suggests that adiffusible factor mediates suppression. Such a factor, onceisolated, might have numerous clinical applications for regu-lating the level of activated T cells in leukemias and autoim-mune diseases. Therapeutic Uses of Cytokines and Their Receptors The availability of purified cloned cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors offers the prospect of specific clinicaltherapies to modulate the immune response. A few cyto-kines\u2014notably, interferons (see Clinical Focus)\u2014and colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, have proven to be ther-apeutically useful. However, despite the promise of cytokinesas powerful mediators of immune and other biological292 PART III Immune Effector MechanismsCytokines CHAPTER 12 293 responses, not many have made their way into clinical prac- tice. A number of factors are likely to raise difficulties inadapting cytokines for safe and effective routine medical use.One of these is the need to maintain effective dose levels overa clinically significant period of time. During an immuneresponse, interacting cells produce sufficiently high concen-trations of cytokines in the vicinity of target cells, but achiev-ing such local concentrations when cytokines must be ad-ministered systemically for clinical treatment is difficult. Inaddition, cytokines often have a very short half-life, so thatcontinuous administration may be required. For example,recombinant human IL-2 has a half-life of only 7-10 minwhen intravenously. Finally, cytokines are ex-tremely potent biological response modifiers and they cancause unpredictable and undesirable side effects. The side ef-fects from administration of recombinant IL-2, for instance,range from mild (e.g., fever, chills, diarrhea, and weight gain)to serious, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, shock, respi-ratory distress, and coma. Despite these difficulties, the pro-mise of cytokines for clinical medicine is great and efforts todevelop safe and effective cytokine-related strategies con-tinue, particularly in areas such as inflammation, cancertherapy, and modification of the immune response duringorgan transplantation, infectious disease, and allergy.Some specific examples of various approaches being ex- plored include cytokine receptor blockade and the use ofcytokine analogs and cytokine-toxin conjugates. For instance,proliferation of activated T Hcells and activation of T Ccells can be blocked by anti-TAC, a monoclonal antibody thatbinds to the /H9251subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (Fig- ure 12-15a, left panel). Administration of anti-TAC has pro-longed the survival of heart transplants in rats. Similarresults have been obtained with IL-2 analogs that retain theirability to bind the IL-2 receptor but have lost their biologicalactivity (Figure 12-15a, right panel). Such analogs various toxins (e.g., the /H9252chain of diphtheria toxin) have been shown to diminish re- jection of kidney and heart transplants in animals. Such con-jugates containing IL-2 selectively bind to and kill activatedT Hcells (Figure 12-15b).

Subsequently, many cytokines havebeen shown to play essential roles in hematopoiesis (seeTable 12-5). During hematopoiesis, cytokines act as develop- mental signals that direct commitment of progenitor cellsinto and through particular lineages. As shown in Figure 12-16, a myeloid progenitor in the presence erythropoietin294 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms IIFN-/H9251(also known by its trade names Roferon and Intron-A) hasbeen used for the treatment ofhepatitis C and hepatitis B. It hasalso found a number of differentapplications in cancer therapy. Atype of B-cell leukemia known ashairy-cell leukemia (because the cellsare covered with fine, hairlikecytoplasmic projections) respondswell to IFN- /H9251. Chronic myelogenous leukemia, a disease characterized byincreased numbers of granulocytes,begins with a slowly developingchronic phase that changes to anaccelerated phase and terminates ina blast phase, which is usuallyresistant to treatment. IFN- /H9251is an effective treatment for this leukemiain the chronic phase ( 70% response rates have been reported) and somepatients (as many as 20% in some studies) undergo completeremission. Kaposi's sarcoma, thecancer most often seen in AmericanAIDS patients, also responds totreatment with IFN- /H9251, and there are reports of a trend toward longersurvival and fewer opportunisticinfections in patients treated withthis agent. IFN- /H9253has also been used, with varying degrees ofsuccess, to treat a variety ofmalignancies that include non-Hodgkin's T-cell of above have beenobtained in clinical studies that usedIFN-/H9251alone. Future clinical trials in which IFN- /H9251is used in combinations with other agents may improve theeffectiveness of this interferon incancer therapy. IIFN-/H9252has emerged as the first drug capable of producing clinicalimprovement in multiple sclerosis(MS). Young adults are the primarytarget of this autoimmune neurologicdisease, in which nerves in the centralnervous system (CNS) undergodemyelination. This results inprogressive neurologic dysfunction,which leads to significant and, inmany cases, severe disability. Thisdisease is often characterized byperiods of nonprogression andremission alternating with periods ofrelapse. Treatment with IFN- /H9252 provides longer periods of remissionand reduces the severity of relapses.Furthermore, magnetic-resonance-imaging studies of CNS damage intreated and untreated patientsrevealed MS-induced damagewas less in a group of IFN- /H9252-treated patients than in untreated ones. IIFN-/H9253has found application in the clinic as an agent for the treatment ofchronic granulomatous disease(CGD). This disease is hereditary andquite rare. Its central feature is aserious impairment of the ability ofphagocytic cells to kill ingestedmicrobes. Patients with CGD arebeset with recurring infections by anumber of bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and others) and fungi such as Aspergillus and Candida. Before interferon therapy, standard treatment for thedisease was attempts to avoidinfection, aggressive administration ofInterferons are an extraordinary group of proteins whoseantiviral activity led to their discoveryalmost 50years ago. Subsequent studies showed that interferons have othereffects, including the capacity to inducecell differentiation, to inhibit proliferationby some cell types, to inhibit angiogene-sis, and to function in various immu-noregulatory roles. Their effects on theimmune system are important and dra-matic. Interferons induce increases in theexpression of class I and class II MHCmolecules, and augment NK-cell activity.Increased class I expression increasesthe display of antigen to CD 8 +cells, a class that includes most of the T Cpopu- lation. This enhanced display of antigennot only makes the antigen-presentingcells more effective in inducing cytotoxicT-cell populations, it also makes thembetter targets for attack by T Ccells. In addition to up-regulating class I MHCexpression of many cell types, IFN- /H9253in- creases the expression of class II MHCmolecules on such antigen-presentingcells as macrophages and dendritic cells.This better presenters ofantigen to T Hcells. IFN- /H9253 is also a potent of macrophage activation andgeneral promoter of inflammatory re-sponses. Cloning of the genes that en-code all three types of interferon, IFN- /H9251, IFN-/H9252, and IFN- /H9253, has made it possible for the biotechnology industry to producelarge amounts of all of these interferonsat costs that make their clinical use prac-tical. Some clinical uses of each type ofinterferon are described here:CLINICAL FOCUS Therapy with Interferonswould proceed down a pathway that leads to the production of erythrocytes; suitable concentrations of a group of cyto-kines including IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-1, and IL-6 will cause it differentiation pathways that lead to the generation ofmonocytes, neutrophils, and other leukocytes of the myeloid group. The participation of leukocytes in immune responsesoften results in their death and removal. However, both adap-tive and innate immune responses generate cytokines thatCytokines CHAPTER 12 295 osteopetrosis, ( not osteoporosis) a life-threatening congenital disordercharacterized by overgrowth of bone which results in blindness and deafness. Another problempresented by this disease is that thebuildup of bone reduces the amountof space available for bone marrowand the decrease in hematopoiesisresults in fewer red blood cells andanemia. The decreased generationof white blood cells causes anincreased susceptibility to infection. The use of interferons in clinical prac- tice is likely to expand as more is learnedabout their effects in combination with other therapeutic agents. Although, incommon with other cytokines, interfer-ons are powerful modifiers of biologicalresponses, fortunately, the side effectsaccompanying their use are muchmilder. Typical side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever,chills, and fatigue. These symptoms canlargely be managed with acetaminophen(Tylenol) and diminish in intensity dur-ing continued treatment. Although inter-feron toxicity is usually not severe, seri-ous manifestations such as anemia anddepressed platelet and white-blood-cellcounts have been seen. antibiotics, and surgical drainage of abscesses. A failure to generatemicrobicidal oxidants (H 2O2, superoxide, and others) is the basisof CGD, and the administration ofIFN-/H9253significantly reverses this defect. Therapy of CGD patients withIFN-/H9253significantly reduces the incidence of infections. Also, theinfections that are contracted are lesssevere and the average number ofdays spent by patients in the hospitalgoes down.

The steps at which a number of cytokines participate in hema-topoiesis is shown in Figure 12-16. SUMMARY ICytokines are low-molecular-weight proteins that are pro-duced and secreted by a variety of cell types. They playmajor roles in the induction and regulation of the cellularinteractions involving cells of the immune, inflammatoryand hematopoietic systems. IThe biological activities of cytokines exhibit synergy, antagonism, and, in some instances,cascade induction. IThere are over 200 different cytokines, most of fallinto one of the following families: hematopoietins, inter-ferons, chemokines, and tumor necrosis factors. ICytokines act by binding to cytokine receptors, most ofwhich can be classified as immunoglobulin superfamilyreceptors, class I cytokine receptors, class II cytokine recep-tors, members of the TNF receptor family, and chemokinereceptors. IA cytokine can only act on a cell that expresses a receptorfor it. The activity of particular cytokines is directed to spe-cific cells by regulation of the cell's profile of cytokinereceptors.ICytokine-induced multimerization of class I and class I cyto-kine receptors activates a JAK/STAT signal-transductionpathway. IAntigen stimulation of T Hcells in the presence of certain cytokines can lead to the generation of subpopulations ofhelper T cells known as T H1 and T H2. Each subset displays characterisic and different profiles of cytokine secretion. IThe cytokine profile of T H1 cells supports sponses that involve the marshalling of phagocytes, CTLs,and NK cells to eliminate intracellular pathogens. T H2 cells produce cytokines that support production of particularimmunoglobulin isotypes and IgE-mediated responses. ITherapies based on cytokines and cytokine receptors haveentered clinical practice. References Abbas, A., K. M. Murphy, and A. Sher. 1996. Functional diversity of helper T lymphocytes.

Thus we have a system that straddles in-nate and acquired immunity, contributing to each in a vari-ety of ways. After initial activation, the various complement compo- nents interact, in a highly regulated cascade, to carry out anumber of basic functions (Figure 13-1) including: ILysis of cells, and viruses IOpsonization, which promotes phagocytosis ofparticulate antigens IBinding to specific complement receptors on cells ofthe immune system, triggering specific cell functions,inflammation, and secretion of immunoregulatorymolecules IImmune clearance, which removes immune complexesfrom the circulation and deposits them in the spleen andliver chapter 13 IThe Functions of Complement IThe Complement Components IComplement Activation IRegulation of the Complement System IBiological Consequences of Complement Activation IComplement DeficienciesThe Complement System T of the humoral branch of the immune system.Research on complement began in the 1890s, when Jules Bordet at the Institut Pasteur in Paris showedthat sheep antiserum to the bacterium Vibrio cholerae caused lysis of the bacteria and that heating the antiserumdestroyed its bacteriolytic activity. Surprisingly, the abilityto lyse the bacteria was restored to the heated serum byadding fresh serum that contained no antibodies directedagainst the bacterium and was unable to kill the bacteriumby itself. Bordet correctly reasoned that bacteriolytic activ-ity requires two different substances: first, the specific an-tibacterial antibodies, which survive the heating process,and a second, heat-sensitive component responsible for thelytic activity. Bordet devised a simple test for the lytic ac-tivity, the easily detected lysis of antibody-coated red bloodcells, called hemolysis. Paul Ehrlich in Berlin indepen- dently carried out similar experiments and coined the termcomplement, defining it as \"the activity of blood serum that completes the action of antibody.\" In ensuing years, re-searchers discovered that the action of complement was the result of interactions of a large and complex group ofproteins. This chapter describes the complement components and their activation pathways, the regulation of the complementsystem, the effector functions of various complement com-ponents, and the consequences of deficiencies in them. AClinical Focus section describes consequences of a defect inproteins that regulate complement activity. The Functions of Complement Research on complement now includes more than 30 solu-ble and cell-bound proteins. The biological activities ofthis system affect both innate and acquired immunity andreach far beyond the original observations of antibody-mediated lysis of bacteria and red blood cells. Structuralcomparisons of the proteins involved in complement path-ways place the origin of this system in primitive organismspossessing the most rudimentary innate immune systems.By contrast, the realization that interaction of cellular Poly-C 9ComplexART TO COME The Complement Components The proteins and glycoproteins that compose the complement system are synthesized mainly by liver hepatocytes, althoughsignificant amounts are also produced by blood monocytes, tis-sue macrophages, and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal andgenitourinary tracts. These components constitute 5% (byweight) of the serum globulin fraction. Most circulate in theserum in functionally inactive forms as proenzymes, or zymo- gens, which are inactive until proteolytic cleavage, which re- moves an inhibitory fragment and exposes the active site. Thecomplement-reaction sequence starts with an enzyme cascade. Complement components are designated by numerals (C1-C9), by letter symbols (e.g., factor D), or by trivialnames (e.g., homologous restriction factor). Peptide frag-ments formed by activation of a component are denoted bysmall letters. In most cases, the smaller fragment resultingfrom cleavage of a component is designated \"a\" and the largerfragment designated \"b\" (e.g., C3a, C3b; C2 C2a is the larger cleavage fragment). The largerfragments bind to the target near the site of activation, andthe smaller fragments diffuse from the site and can initiatelocalized inflammatory responses by binding to specific re-ceptors. The complement fragments interact with one an-other to form functional complexes. Those complexes thathave enzymatic activity are designated by a bar over the num-ber or symbol (e.g., C4b2a, C3bBb). Complement Activation Figure 13-2 on page 301 outlines the pathways of comple-ment activation. The early steps, culminating in formation of300 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms C5b, can occur by the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, or the lectin pathway. The final steps that lead to a membrane attack are the same in all pathways. The Classical Pathway Begins with Antigen-Antibody Binding Complement activation by the classical pathway commonly begins with the formation of soluble antigen-antibody com-plexes (immune complexes) or with the binding of antibodyto antigen on a suitable target, such as a bacterial cell. IgM andcertain subclasses of IgG (human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3) canactivate stage ofactivation involves C1, C2, C3, and C4, which are present inplasma in functionally inactive forms. Because the compo-nents were named in order of their discovery and before theirfunctional roles had been determined, the numbers in theirnames do not always reflect the order in which they react. The formation of an antigen-antibody complex induces conformational changes in the Fc portion of the IgM mole-cule that expose a binding site for the C1 component of thecomplement system. C1 in serum is a macromolecular com-plex consisting of C1q and two molecules each of C1r andC1s, held together in a complex (C1qr 2s2) stabilized by Ca2/H11001 ions. The C1q molecule is composed of 18 polypeptide chains that associate to form six collagen-like triple helicalarms, the tips of which bind to exposed C1q-binding sites inthe C H2 domain of the antibody molecule (Figure 13-3, on page 302). Each C1r and C1s monomer contains a catalyticdomain and an interaction domain; the latter facilitates in-teraction with C1q or with each other. Each C1 molecule must bind by its C1q globular heads to at least two Fc sites for a stable C1-antibody interaction to FIGURE 13-1 The multiple activities of the complement system. Serum complement proteins and membrane-bound complementreceptors partake in antibody-dependent or pathways;opsonization or uptake of particulate antigens, including bacteria, byphagocytes; activation of inflammatory responses; and clearance of circulating immune complexes by cells in the liver and spleen.Soluble complement proteins are schematically indicated by a trian-gle and receptors by a semi-circle; no attempt is made to differenti-ate among individual components of the complement system Phagocyte OF IMMUNE COMPLEXESoccur. When pentameric IgM is bound to antigen on a target surface it assumes the so-called \"staple\" configuration, inwhich at least three binding sites for C1q are exposed. Circu-lating IgM, however, exists as a planar configuration in whichthe C1q-binding sites are not exposed (Figure 13-4, on page302) and therefore cannot activate the complement cascade.An IgG molecule, on the other hand, contains only a singleC1q-binding site in the C H2 domain of the Fc, so that firm C1q binding is achieved only when two IgG molecules are within30-40 nm of each other on a target surface or in a complex,The Complement System CHAPTER 13 301 providing two attachment sites for C1q. This difference ac-counts for the observation that a single molecule of IgMbound to a red blood cell can activate the classical complementpathway and lyse the red blood cell while some 1000 mole-cules of IgG are required to assure that two IgG molecules areclose enough to each other on the cell surface to initiate C1qbinding. The intermediates in the classical activation pathway are depicted schematically in Figure 13-5 (page 303). Binding ofC1q to Fc binding sites induces a conformational change in FIGURE 13-2 Overview of the complement activation pathways. The classical pathway is initiated when C 1binds to antigen-antibody complexes. The alternative pathway is initiated by binding of spon-taneously generated C 3b to activating surfaces such as microbial cell walls. The lectin pathway is initiated by binding of the serum proteinMBL to the surface of a pathogen. All three pathways generate C 3 and C 5convertases and bound C 5b, which is converted into a mem-brane-attack complex (MAC) by a common sequence of terminal reactions. Hydrolysis of C 3is the major amplification step in all path- ways, generating large amounts of C 3b, which forms part of C 5con- vertase. C 3b also can diffuse away from the activating surface and bind to immune complexes or foreign cell surfaces, where it func-tions as pathway Alternative pathwayLectin pathway Major amplification step Membrane attack complex Spontaneous, slow, small amounts (text continues on page 304)302 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms (b) FIGURE 13-3 Structure of the C 1macromolecular complex.

The completed membrane-attack complex (MAC, bottom right) forms a large pore in the membrane.Poly-C935 C5b binds C6, initiating C4 C2. C4 binds the surface near protease enzyme, three polypeptide /H9251,/H9252, and /H9253. C4 is activated when C1 1s/H33526hydrolyzes a small fragment (C4a) from the amino terminus of the /H9251chain, exposing a binding site on the larger fragment (C4b). The C4b fragment attachesto the target surface in the vicinity of C1, and the C2 proen-zyme then attaches to the exposed binding site on C4b, wherethe C2 is then cleaved by the neighboring C1 1s /H33526; the smaller fragment (C2b) diffuses away. The resulting C4b2a /H33526/H33526 complex is called C3 convertase, referring to its role in converting theC3 into an active form. The smaller fragment from C4 cleav-age, C4a, is an anaphylatoxin, or mediator of inflammation,which does not participate directly in the complement cas-cade; the anaphylatoxins, which include the smaller frag-ments of C4, C3, and C5 are described below. The native C3 component consists of two polypeptide chains, /H9251and /H9252. Hydrolysis of a short fragment (C3a) from the the over 200 molecules of C3b, resulting in tremendousamplification at this step of the sequence. Some of the C3bbinds to C4b2a /H33526/H33526 to form conformation, that ponent cleave C5 into C5a, away, and C5b,which attaches to C6 and initiates formation of the membrane-attack complex in a sequence described later. Some of theC3b generated by C3 convertase activity does not associatewith C4b2a /H33526/H33526; instead it diffuses away and then coats immune complexes and particulate antigens, functioning as an opsoninas described in the Clinical Focus. C3b may also bind directlyto cell membranes.The Alternative Pathway Is Antibody-Independent The alternative pathway generates bound C5b, the same product that the classical pathway generates, but it does sowithout the need for antigen-antibody complexes for initia-tion. Because no antibody is required, the alternative path-way is a component of the innate immune system. Thismajor pathway of complement activation involves fourserum proteins: C3, factor B, factor D, and properdin. The al-ternative pathway is initiated in most cases by cell-surfaceconstituents that are foreign to the host (Table 13-1). For ex-ample, both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria havecell-wall constituents that can activate the alternative path-way. The intermediates in the alternative pathway for gener-ating C5b are shown schematically in Figure 13-7 (page 306). In the classical pathway, C3 is rapidly cleaved to C3a and C3b by the enzymatic activity C3 convertase. In the al-ternative pathway, serum C3, which contains an unstablethioester bond, is subject to slow spontaneous hydrolysis toyield C3a and C3b. The C3b component can bind to foreignsurface antigens (such as those on bacterial cells or viral par-ticles) or even to the host's own cells (see Figure 13-6c). Themembranes of most mammalian cells have high levels ofsialic acid, which contributes to the rapid inactivation ofbound C3b molecules on host cells; consequently this bind-ing rarely leads to further reactions on the host cell mem-brane. Because many foreign antigenic surfaces (e.g., bac-terial cell walls, yeast cell walls, and certain viral envelopes)have only low levels of sialic acid, C3b bound to these sur-faces remains active for a longer time. The C3b present on thesurface of the foreign cells can bind another serum proteincalled factor B to form a complex stabilized by Mg 2/H11001.B i n d - ing to C3b exposes a site on factor B that serves as the sub-304 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms FIGURE 13-6 Hydrolysis of C 3by C 3convertase C 4b2a (a) Native C3.

The C3 3bBb /H33526/H33526 generated in the alternative pathway unhydrolyzed C3 to generate more C3b autocatalytically.As a result, the initial steps are repeated and amplified, so that more than 2 /H1100310 6molecules of C3b can be deposited on an antigenic surface in less than 5 minutes.

The nonenzy- matic C3b component binds C5, and the Bb component subsequently hydrolyzes the bound C5 to generate C5a andC5b (see Figure 13-7); the latter binds to the antigenic surface. The Lectin Pathway Originates With Host Proteins Binding Microbial Surfaces Lectins are proteins that recognize and bind to specific car- bohydrate targets. (Because the lectin that activates comple-ment binds to mannose residues, some authors this the MBLectin pathway or mannan-binding lectin pathway.)The lectin pathway, like the alternative pathway, does not de-pend on antibody for its activation. However, the mechanismis more like that of the classical pathway, because after initia-tion, it proceeds, through the action of C4 and C2, to pro-duce a C5 convertase (see Figure 13-2). The lectin pathway activated the binding of man- nose-binding lectin (MBL) to mannose residues on glyco-proteins the surface of microorganismsincluding certain Salmonella, Listeria, and Neisseria strains, as well as Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. MBL is an acute phase protein produced in inflammatory responses. Its function in the complement pathway is similarto that of C1q, which it resembles in structure. After MBLbinds to the surface of a cell or pathogen, MBL-associatedserine proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2, bind to MBL. formed by this association causes cleavage andactivation of C4 and C2. The MASP-1 and -2 proteins havestructural similarity to C1r and C1s and mimic their activi-ties. This means of activating the C2-C4 components toform a C5 convertase without need for specific antibodybinding represents an important innate defense mechanismcomparable to the alternative pathway, but utilizing the ele-ments of the classical pathway except for the C1 proteins. The Three Complement Pathways Converge at the Membrane-Attack Complex The terminal sequence of complement activation involves C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9, macromolecular structure called the membrane-attack complex (MAC). This complex forms a large channel through the membrane of the target cell, enabling ions andsmall molecules to diffuse freely across the membrane. The end result of activating the classical, alternative, or lectin pathways is production of an active C5 C5, which contains two of C5 to the nonenzymatic C3b com- ponent of the convertase, the amino terminus of the /H9251chain is cleaved. This generates the small C5a fragment, which dif-fuses away, and the large C5b fragment, which binds to thesurface of the target cell and provides a binding site for thesubsequent components of the membrane-attack complex(see Figure 13-5, step 5). The C5b component is extremely la-bile and becomes inactive within 2 minutes unless C6 bindsto it and stabilizes its activity. Up to this point, all the complement reactions take place on the hydrophilic surface of membranes or on immunecomplexes in the fluid phase. As C5b6 binds to C7, the result-ing complex undergoes a hydrophilic-amphiphilic structuraltransition that exposes hydrophobic regions, which serve asbinding sites for membrane phospholipids. If the reactionoccurs on a target-cell membrane, the hydrophobic bindingsites enable the C5b67 complex to insert into the phospho-lipid bilayer. If, however, the reaction occurs on an immuneThe Complement System CHAPTER 13 305 TABLE 13-1Initiators of the alternative pathway of complement activation PATHOGENS AND PARTICLES OF MICROBIAL ORIGIN Many strains of gram-negative bacteria Lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative strains of gram-positive bacteriaTeichoic from gram-positive cell and yeast cell walls (zymosan)Some viruses and cellsSome tumor cells (Raji) Parasites (trypanosomes) NONPATHOGENS Human IgG, IgA, and IgE in and guinea pig IgG , in Immunobiology of the Complement System, Academic Press.complex or other noncellular activating surface, then the hy- drophobic binding sites cannot anchor the complex and it isreleased. Released C5b67 complexes can insert into the mem-brane of nearby cells and mediate \"innocent-bystander\" lysis.Regulator proteins normally prevent this from occurring, butin certain diseases cell and tissue damage may result from in-nocent-bystander lysis. A hemolytic disorder resulting fromdeficiency in a regulatory protein is explained in the ClinicalFocus section and an autoimmune process in which immune306 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms complexes mediate tissue damage will be considered inChapter 20. Binding of C8 to membrane-bound C5b67 induces a con- formational change in C8, so that it too undergoes a hy-drophilic-amphiphilic structural transition, exposing ahydrophobic region, which interacts with the plasma mem-brane. The C5b678 complex creates a small pore, 10 \u00c5 in di-ameter; formation of this pore can lead to lysis of red bloodcells but not of nucleated cells.

Cleavage generates C3bBb, which has C3 convertase activity Binding of +C3C3b C3a in the for- mation of bound C 5b by the alternative pathway of complement activation. The C 3bBb complex is stabilized by binding of prop-erdin. Conversion of bound C 5b to the membrane-attack complex occurs by the same sequence of reactions as in the classical path-way (see Figure 13-5).the MAC is the binding and polymerization of C9, a per- forin-like molecule, to the C5b678 complex. As many as 10-17 molecules of C9 can be bound and polymerized by a single C5b678 complex. During polymerization, the C9 molecules undergo a hydrophilic-amphiphilic transition, sothat they too can insert into the membrane. The completedMAC, which has a tubular form and functional pore size of70-100 \u00c5, consists of a C5b678 complex surrounded by apoly-C9 complex (Figure 13-8). Since ions and small mole-cules can diffuse freely through the central channel of theMAC, the cell cannot maintain its osmotic stability and iskilled by an influx of water and loss of electrolytes.Regulation of the Complement System Because many elements of the complement system are capa- ble of attacking host cells as well as foreign cells and microor-ganisms, elaborate regulatory mechanisms have evolved torestrict complement activity to designated targets. A generalmechanism of regulation in all complement pathways is theinclusion of highly labile components that undergo sponta-neous inactivation if they are not stabilized by reaction withother components. In addition, a series of regulatory pro-teins can inactivate various complement components (Table13-2). For example, the C1 inhibitor (C1Inh)can form a complex with C1r 2s2, causing it to dissociate from C1q and preventing further activation of C4 or C2 (Figure13-9a(1)). The reaction catalyzed by the C3 convertase enzymes of the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways is the major amplifi-cation step in complement activation, generating hundreds ofmolecules of C3b. The C3b generated by these enzymes has thepotential to bind to nearby cells, mediating damage to thehealthy cells by causing their opsonization by phagocytic cellsbearing C3b receptors or by induction of the membrane-attack complex. Damage to normal host cells is prevented be-cause C3b undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis by the time it hasdiffused nm away from the C4b2a /H33526/H33526 or C33bBb/H33526/H33526 convertase en- zymes, so that it can no longer bind to its target site. The po-tential destruction of healthy host cells by C3b is furtherlimited by a family of related proteins that regulate C3 conver-tase activity in the classical and alternative pathways. Theseregulatory proteins all contain repeating amino acid sequences(or motifs) of about 60 residues, termed short consensus repeats (SCRs). All these proteins are encoded at a single location onchromosome 1 in humans, known as the regulators of comple- ment activation (RCA) gene cluster. In the classical and lectin pathways, three structurally dis- tinct RCA proteins act similarly to prevent assembly of C3convertase (Figure 13-9a(2)). These regulatory proteins in-clude soluble C4b-binding protein (C4bBP) and two mem-brane-bound proteins, complement receptor type 1 (CR1)and membrane cofactor protein (MCP). Each of these regu-latory proteins binds to C4b and prevents its association withC2a. Once C4bBP , CR1, or MCP is I, cleaves the C4b into bound C4dand soluble C4c (Figure 13-9a(3)). A similar regulatory se-quence operates to prevent assembly of the C3 convertaseC33bBb /H33526/H33526 in the alternative pathway. In this case CR1, MCP , or a regulatory component called factor H binds to C3b and pre-vents its association with factor B (Figure 13-9a(4)). OnceCR1, MCP , or factor H is bound to C3b, factor I cleaves theC3b into a bound iC3b fragment and a soluble C3f fragment.Further cleavage of iC3b by factor I releases C3c and leavesC3dg bound to the membrane (Figure 13-9a(5)). The mole-cular events involved in regulation of cell-bound C4b andC3b are depicted in Figure 13-10 (page 310).The Complement System CHAPTER 13 307 (a) FIGURE 13-8 (a) Photomicrograph of poly-C 9complex formed by in vitro polymerization of C 9.

Immunol. 11:75.](b) Several RCA proteins also act on the assembled C3 con- vertase, causing it to dissociate; these include the previouslymentioned C4bBP , CR1, and factor H. In addition, decay-accelerating (DAF or CD55), which is a glycoprotein an-chored covalently to a glycophospholipid protein,has the ability to dissociate C3 convertase. The consequencesof DAF deficiency are described in the Clinical Focus section.Each of these RCA proteins accelerates decay (dissociation) ofC3 convertase by releasing the component with from convertase (Figure 13-9b). Regulatory proteins also operate at the level of the mem- brane-attack complex. The potential release of the C5b67complex poses a threat of innocent-bystander lysis to healthycells. A number of serum proteins counter this threat bybinding to released C5b67 and preventing its insertion intothe membrane of nearby cells. A serum protein called S pro-tein can bind to C5b67, inducing a hydrophilic transition and thereby preventing insertion of C5b67 into the mem-brane of nearby cells (Figure 13-9c(1)). Complement-mediated lysis of cells is more effective if the complement is from a species different from that of thecells being lysed. This phenomenon depends on two mem-brane proteins that block MAC formation. These two pro-teins, present on the membrane of many cell types, arehomologous restriction factor (HRF) and membrane inhibitor lysis to C8, preventing assembly of poly-C9 and inser-tion into the plasma membrane (Figure 13-9c(2)). However,this inhibition occurs only if the complement componentsare from the same species as the target cells. For this reason,MIRL and HRF are said to display homologous restriction,for which the latter was named. As discussed in Chapter 21,homologous restriction poses a barrier to the use of organsfrom other species for clinical transplantation.308 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 13-2 Proteins that regulate the complement system Type of Pathway Protein protein affected Immunologic function C1inhibitor (C 1Inh) Soluble Classical Serine protease C 1r2s2 to dissociate from C 1q C4b-binding protein Soluble Classical and lectin Blocks formation of C 3convertase by (C4bBP) * binding C 4b; cofactor for cleavage of C4b by factor I Factor H * Soluble Alternative Blocks formation of C 3convertase by binding C 3b; cofactor for cleavage of C3b by factor I Complement-receptor Block formation of C 3convertase by type 1 (CR1) * Membrane Classical, alternative, binding C 4b or C 3b; cofactor for Membrane-cofactor bound I-catalyzed (MCP) * C 3b C3bBb Decay-accelerating Membrane Classical, alternative, Accelerates dissociation of C 4b2a and factor (DAE or CD 55)* bound and lectin C 3bBb (classical and alternative C 3 convertases) Factor-I Soluble Classical, alternative, Serine protease: cleaves C 3b and lectin using C 4bBP, CR 1, factor H, DAE, or MCP as cofactor S protein Soluble Terminal Binds soluble C 5b67and prevents its insertion into cell membrane Homologous restriction factor (HRF) Membrane Terminal Bind to C 5b678on autologous cells, Membrane inhibitor of bound blocking binding carboxypeptidase N removal of C-terminal Arg *An RCA (regulator of complement activation) protein.

The MAC mediates cell lysis, whileother complement components or split products participatein the inflammatory response, opsonization of antigen,viral neutralization, and clearance of immune complexes(Table 13-3, page 312). Many of the biological activities of the complement sys- tem depend on the binding of complement fragments tocomplement receptors, which are expressed by various cells.In addition, some complement receptors play an importantrole in regulating complement activity by binding biologi-cally active complement components and degrading theminto inactive products. The complement receptors and theirprimary ligands, which include various complement compo-nents and their proteolytic breakdown products, are listed inTable 13-4 (page 312).The Membrane-Attack Complex Can Lyse a Broad Spectrum of Cells The membrane-attack complex formed by complement acti- vation can lyse gram-negative bacteria, parasites, viruses,erythrocytes, and nucleated cells. Because the alternative andlectin pathways of activation generally occur without an ini-tial antigen-antibody interaction, these pathways serve as im-portant innate immune defenses against infectious micro-organisms. The requirement for an initial antigen-antibodyreaction in the classical pathway supplements these nonspe-cific innate defenses with a more specific defense mecha-nism. In some instances, the requirement for antibody in theactivating event may be supplied by so-called natural anti-bodies, which are raised against common components ofubiquitous microbes. The importance of cell-mediated immunity in host de- fense against viral infections has been emphasized in previ-ous chapters. Nevertheless, antibody and complement doplay a role in host defense against viruses and are oftencrucial in containing viral spread during acute infectionand in protecting against reinfection.

The viral envelope is largely derived fromthe plasma membrane of infected host cells and is there-fore susceptible to pore formation by the membrane-attack complex. Among the pathogenic viruses lysis by complement-mediated lysis are herpesviruses,orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and retroviruses. complement system is generally quite effective in lysing gram-negative bacteria (Figure 13-11). However,some gram-negative have mechanisms for evading complement-mediated damage (Table 13-5). For example, a few gram-negative bac- teria can develop resistance to complement-mediated lysisthat correlates with the virulence of the organism. In Es- cherichia coli and Salmonella, resistance to complement is as- sociated with the smooth bacterial phenotype, which ischaracterized by the presence of long polysaccharide sidechains in the cell-wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component.It has been proposed that the increased LPS in the wall of re-sistant strains may prevent insertion of the MAC into thebacterial membrane, so that the complex is released from thebacterial cell rather than forming a pore. Strains of NeisseriaThe Complement System CHAPTER 13 311 plement-mediated cell lysis, but act at different stages of the process. DAF in-hibits cell lysis by causing dissociationand inactivation of the C 3convertases of the classical, lectin, and alternative path-ways (see Figure 13-9b). MIRL acts later in the pathway by binding to the C 5b678 complex, which inhibits C 9binding and prevents formation of the pores that de-stroy the cell under attack. Both proteinsare expressed on erythrocytes as well asa number of other hematopoetic celltypes. Deficiency in these proteins leadsto highly increased sensitivity of hostcells to the lytic effects of the host's com-plement activity. PNH, the clinical con-sequence of deficiency in DAF and MIRL,is a chronic disease with a mean sur-vival time between 10and 15years. The most common causes of mortality inPNH are venous thrombosis affectinghepatic veins and progressive bone-marrow failure. An obvious question about this rare but serious disease concerns the factthat two different proteins are involvedin its pathogenesis. The simultaneousoccurrence of a genetic defect in each ofthem would be rarer than the 1in 100,000 incidence of PNH. The answer is that neither protein itself is defective inPNH; the defect lies in a posttransla-tional modification of the peptide anchorthat binds them to the cell membrane.While most proteins that are expressedon the surface of cells have hydrophobicsequences that traverse the lipid bilayerin the cell membrane, some proteins arebound by glycolipid anchors (glycosylphosphatidylinositol, or GPI) attached toamino acid residues in the protein. With-out the ability to form GPI anchors, pro-teins that attach in this manner will beabsent from the cell surface, includingboth DAF and MIRL. The defect identified in PNH lies early in the enzymatic path to formation of aGPI anchor and resides in the pig-a gene (phosphatidylinositol glycan comple-mentation class A gene). Transfection ofcells PNH patients with an intactpig-a gene restored cells' resistance to host complement lysis. pig-a sequences in different defects inthis X-linked gene, indicating somaticrather than genetic origin of the defect.This description of PNH underscoresthe fact that the complement system is apowerful defender of the host but also adangerous one. Complex systems of reg-ulation are necessary to protect hostcells from the activated complementcomplexes generated to lyse intruders. Common conditions associated with deficiency in the comple-ment components include increasedsusceptibility to bacterial infections andsystemic lupus erythematosus which isrelated to the inability to clear immunecomplexes. Deficiency in the proteinsthat regulate complement activity cancause equally serious disorders. An ex-ample is paroxymal nocturnal PNH, lead-ing to chronic hemolytic anemia, pancy-topenia (loss of of all thrombosis (formation ofblood clots). The name PNH derivesfrom the presence of hemoglobin in theurine, most commonly observed in thefirst urine passed after a night's sleep.The cause of PNH is a general defect insynthesis of cell-surface proteins, whichaffects the expression of two regulatorsof complement, DAF (decay acceleratingfactor or CD 55) and MIRL (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis or CD 59). DAF and MIRL are cell-surface pro- teins that function as inhibitors of com-CLINICAL FOCUS Paroxymal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria: a Defect inRegulation of Complement Lysis312 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 13-3 Summary of biological effects mediated by complement products Effect Complement product mediating * Cell lysis C5b-9, the membrane-attack complex (MAC) Inflammatory response Degranulation of mast cells and basophilsC3a,C4a, and and induction Bb of their spreading Release of neutrophils from bone marrow C 3c Release of hydrolytic enzymes from neutrophils C 5a Increased expression of complement receptors C 5a type 1and 3(CR1and CR 3) on phagocytosis Viral neutralization C 3b, C Solubilization and clearance of immune complexes C 3b *Boldfaced component is most important in mediating indicated effect.

Some evidence suggests that the membrane pro-teins of resistant Neisseria strains undergo noncovalent in- teractions with the MAC that prevent its insertion into theouter membrane of the bacterial cells. These examples ofresistant gram-negative bacteria are the exception; mostgram-negative bacteria are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis.Gram-positive bacteria are generally resistant to comple- ment-mediated lysis because the thick peptidoglycan layer intheir cell wall prevents insertion of the MAC into the innermembrane. Although complement activation can occur onthe cell membrane of encapsulated bacteria such as Strepto- coccus pneumoniae, the capsule prevents interaction between C3b deposited on the membrane and the CR1 on phagocyticcells. Some bacteria possess an elastase that inactivates C3aand C5a, preventing these split products from inducing aninflammatory response. In addition to these mechanisms of evasion, various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans con-tain proteins that can interrupt the complement cascade ontheir surfaces, thus mimicking the effects of the normal com-plement regulatory proteins C4bBP , CR1, and DAF.Lysis of nucleated cells requires formation of multiple membrane attack complexes, whereas a single MAC can lysea red blood cell. Many nucleated cells, including the majorityof cancer cells, can endocytose the MAC.

An unfortunate con- sequence of this effect is that complement-mediated lysis byantibodies specific for tumor-cell antigens, which offers a po-tential weapon against cancer, may be rendered ineffective byendocytosis of the MAC (see Chapter 22). Cleavage Products of Complement Components Mediate Inflammation The complement cascade is often viewed in terms of the fi- nal outcome of cell lysis, but various peptides generatedduring formation of the MAC play a decisive role in the de-velopment of an effective inflammatory response (see Table13-3). The smaller fragments resulting from complementcleavage, C3a, C4a, and C5a, called anaphylatoxins, bind to receptors on mast cells and blood basophils and induce de-granulation, with release of histamine and other pharmaco-logically active mediators. The anaphylatoxins also inducesmooth-muscle contraction and increased vascular perme-ability. Activation of the complement system thus results ininfluxes of fluid that carries antibody and phagocytic cellsto the site of antigen entry. The activities of these highly re-active anaphylatoxins are regulated by a serum proteasecalled cleaves an Arg residuefrom the terminus of the molecules, yielding so-calleddes-Arg forms. The des-Arg forms of C3a and C4a are com- pletely inactive while that of C5a retains about 10% of itschemotactic activity and 1% of its ability to cause smoothmuscle contraction.C3a, C5a, and C5b67 can each induce adhere to vascular endothelial cells, ex-travasate through the endothelial lining of the capillary, andmigrate toward the site of complement activation in the tis-sues. C5a is most potent in mediating these processes, effec-tive in picomolar quantities. The role of complement inleukocyte chemotaxis is discussed more fully in Chapter 15. C3b and C 4b Binding Facilitates Opsonization C3b is the major opsonin of the complement system, al- though C4b and iC3b also have opsonizing activity. The am-plification that occurs with C3 activation results in a coatingof C3b on immune complexes and particulate antigens.Phagocytic cells, as well as some other cells, express comple-ment receptors (CR1, CR3, and CR4) that bind Antigen coated with C3b binds to cellsbearing CR1. If the cell is a phagocyte (e.g., a neutrophil,monocyte, or macrophage), phagocytosis will be cells variousagents, including C5a has been shown to in-crease the number of CR1s from 5000 on resting phagocytesto 50,000 on activated cells, greatly facilitating their phagocy-tosis of C3b-coated antigen. Recent studies indicate thatcomplement fragment C3b acts as an adjuvant when coupledwith protein antigens. C3b targets the antigen directly to thephagocyte, enhancing the initiation of antigen processingand accelerating specific antibody production.314 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms FIGURE 13-12 (a) Schematic representation of the roles of C 3b and antibody in opsonization.

Nemerow, 1986, in Immunobiology of the Complement System, C3b Phagocytosis NucleusIgG(a) virusparticleThe Complement System Also Neutralizes Viral Infectivity For most viruses, the binding of serum antibody to the re- peating subunits of the viral structural proteins creates par-ticulate immune complexes ideally suited for complementactivation by the classical pathway. Some viruses (e.g., retro-viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, Newcastle disease virus, andrubella virus) can activate the alternative, lectin, or even theclassical pathway in the absence of antibody. The complement system mediates viral neutralization by a number of mechanisms. Some degree of neutralization isachieved through the formation of larger viral aggregates,simply because these aggregates reduce the net number of in-fectious viral particles. Although antibody plays a role in theformation of viral aggregates, in vitro studies show that theC3b component facilitates aggregate formation in the pres-ence of as little as two molecules of antibody per virion. Forexample, polyoma virus coated with antibody is neutralizedwhen serum containing activated C3 is added. The binding of antibody and/or complement to the sur- face of a viral particle creates a thick protein coating that canbe visualized by electron microscopy (Figure 13-13). Thiscoating neutralizes viral infectivity by blocking attachmentto susceptible host cells. The deposits of antibody and com-plement on viral particles also facilitate binding of the viralparticle to cells possessing Fc or type 1 complement receptors(CR1). In the case of phagocytic cells, such binding can befollowed by phagocytosis and intracellular destruction of theingested viral particle. Finally, complement is effective inlysing most, if not all, enveloped viruses, resulting in frag-mentation of the envelope and disintegration of the nucleo-capsid.The Complement System Clears Immune Complexes from Circulation The importance of the complement system in clearing im- mune complexes is seen in patients with the autoimmune dis-ease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These individualsproduce large quantities of immune complexes and suffer tis-sue damage as a result of complement-mediated lysis and theinduction of type II or type III hypersensitivity (see Chapter16). Although complement plays a significant role in the devel-opment of tissue damage in SLE, the paradoxical finding isthat deficiencies in C1, C2, an to SLE; indeed, 90% of individuals who completely lackC4 develop SLE. The complement deficiencies are thought tointerfere with effective solubilization and clearance of immunecomplexes; as a result, these complexes persist, leading to tissuedamage by the very system whose deficiency was to blame. The coating of soluble immune complexes with C3b is thought to facilitate their binding to CR1 on erythrocytes. Al-though red blood cells express lower levels of CR1 (~5 /H1100310 2 per cell) than granulocytes do (~5 /H11003104per cell), there are about 103red blood cells for every white blood cell; therefore, erythrocytes account for about 90% of the CR1 in the blood.For this reason, erythrocytes play an important role in bindingC3b-coated immune complexes and carrying these complexesto the liver and spleen. In these organs, immune complexes arestripped from the red blood cells and are phagocytosed,thereby preventing their deposition in tissues (Figure 13-14).In SLE patients, deficiencies in C1, C2, and C4 each contributeto reduced levels of C3b on immune complexes and hence in-hibit their clearance. The lower levels of CR1 expressed on theerythrocytes of SLE patients also may interfere with the properbinding and clearance of immune complexes.The Complement System CHAPTER 13 315 FIGURE 13-13 Electron micrographs of negatively stained prepara- tions of Epstein-Barr virus.

Theseorganisms are gram-positive and therefore resistant to the lyticeffects of the MAC. Nevertheless, the early complement com-ponents ordinarily prevent recurrent infection by mediating alocalized inflammatory response and opsonizing the bacteria.Deficiencies in factor D and properdin\u2014early components ofthe alternative pathway\u2014appear to be associated with Neisseria infections but not with immune-complex disease. Patients with C3 deficiencies have the most severe clinical manifestations, reflecting the central role of C3 in activationof C5 and formation of the MAC. The first patient identifiedwith a C3 deficiency was a child suffering from frequent se-vere bacterial infections and initially diagnosed as havingagammaglobulinemia. After tests revealed normal immuno-globulin levels, a deficiency in C3 was discovered. This casehighlights the critical function of the complement system inconverting a humoral antibody response into an effective de-fense mechanism. The majority of patients with C3 deficiencyhave recurrent bacterial infections and may have immune-complex diseases. Individuals with homozygous deficiencies in the compo- nents involved in the MAC develop recurrent meningococcaland gonococcal infections caused by Neisseria species. In normal individuals, these gram-negative bacteria are gener-ally susceptible to complement-mediated lysis have immune-complex disease, which suggests thatthey produce enough C3b to clear immune complexes. Inter-estingly, a deficiency in C9 results in no clinical symptoms,suggesting that the entire MAC is not always necessary forcomplement-mediated lysis. Congenital deficiencies of complement regulatory proteins have also been reported. The C1 inhibitor (C1Inh) regulatesactivation of the classical pathway by preventing excessive C4and C2 activation by C1. Deficiency of C1Inh is an autosomaldominant condition with a frequency of 1 in 1000. The defi-ciency gives rise to a condition called hereditary angioedema,which manifests clinically as localized edema of the tissue, of-ten following trauma, but sometimes with no known cause.The edema can be in subcutaneous tissues or within the bowel,where it causes abdominal pain, or in the upper respiratorytract, where it causes obstruction of the airway.

SUMMARY IThe complement system comprises a group of serum pro-teins, many of which exist in inactive forms. IComplement activation occurs by the classical, alternative,or lectin pathways, each of which is initiated differently. IThe three pathways converge in a common sequence ofevents that leads to generation of a molecular complex thatcauses cell lysis. IThe classical pathway is initiated by antibody binding to acell target; reactions of IgM and certain IgG subclasses ac-tivate this pathway. IActivation of the alternative and pathways is anti-body-independent. These pathways are initiated by reac-tion of complement proteins with surface molecules ofmicroorganisms. IIn addition to its key role in cell lysis, the complement sys-tem mediates opsonization of bacteria, activation of in-flammation, and clearance of immune complexes. IInteractions of complement proteins and protein frag-ments with receptors on cells of the immune system con-trol both innate and acquired immune responses. IBecause of its ability to damage the host organism, thecomplement system requires complex passive and activeregulatory mechanisms. IClinical consequences of inherited complement deficien-cies range from increases in susceptibility to infection totissue damage caused by immune complexes. References Ahearn, J. M., and D. T.

The effectors of the humoral branch are secreted antibodies, highly specific moleculesthat can bind and neutralize antigens on the surface of cellsand in the extracellular spaces. The primary domain of anti-body protection lies outside the cell. If antibodies were theonly agents of immunity, pathogens that managed to evadethem and colonize the intracellular environment wouldescape the immune system. This is not the case. The princi-pal role of cell-mediated immunity is to detect and eliminatecells that harbor intracellular pathogens. Cell-mediated im-munity also can recognize and eliminate cells, such as tumorcells, that have undergone genetic modifications so that theyexpress antigens not typical of normal cells. Both antigen-specific and -nonspecific cells can contri- bute to the mediate delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). The discussion of DTH reactionsand the role of CD4 +T cells in their orchestration appears in Chapter 16. Nonspecific cells include NK cells and non-lymphoid cell types such as macrophages, neutrophils, andeosinophils. The activity of both specific and nonspecificcomponents usually depends on effective local concentra-tions of various cytokines. T cells, NK cells, and macrophagesare the most important sources of the cytokines that organizeand support cell-mediated immunity. Finally, although hu-moral and cell-mediated immunity have many distinctivefeatures, they are not completely independent. Cells such as macrophages, NK cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils canuse antibodies as receptors to recognize and target cells forkilling. Also, chemotactic peptides generated by the activa-tion of complement in response to antigen-antibody com-plexes can contribute to assembling the cell types required fora cell-mediated response. In the preceding chapters, various aspects of the humoral and cell-mediated effector responses have been assay of cytotoxicity.Effector Responses The importance of cell-mediated immunity becomes evidentwhen the system is defective. Children with DiGeorge syn-drome, who are born without a thymus and therefore lack theT-cell component of the cell-mediated immune system, gen-erally are able to cope with infections of extracellular bacteria,but they cannot effectively eliminate intracellular pathogens.Their lack of functional cell-mediated immunity results inrepeated infections with viruses, intracellular bacteria, andfungi. The severity of the cell-mediated immunodeficiency inthese children is such that even the attenuated virus present ina vaccine, capable of only limited growth in normal individu-als, can produce life-threatening infections. Cell-mediated immune responses can be divided into two major categories according to the different effector popula-tions that are mobilized. One group comprises effector cells chapter 14that have direct cytotoxic activity. These effectors eliminate foreign cells and altered self-cells by mounting a cytotoxicreaction that lyses their target. The various cytotoxic effectorcells can be grouped into two antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as natural killer (NK) cells and macro-phages. The target cells to which these effectors are directedinclude allogeneic cells, malignant cells, virus-infected cells,and chemically conjugated cells. other group is effector CD4 +T cells that mediates delayed- type hypersensitivity reactions (see Chapter 16). The nextsection reviews the general properties of effector T cells andhow they differ from naive T cells. General Properties of Effector T Cells The three types of effector T cells\u2014CD4+,TH1 and T H2 cells, and CD8+CTLs\u2014exhibit several properties that set them apart from naive helper and cytotoxic T cells (Table 14-1). Inparticular, effector cells are characterized by their less strin-gent activation requirements, increased expression of cell-adhesion molecules, and production of both membrane-bound and soluble effector molecules. The Activation Requirements of T Cells Differ T cells at different stages of differentiation may respond with different efficiencies to signals mediated by the T-cell recep-tor and may consequently require different levels of a secondset of co-stimulatory signals. As described in Chapter 10,activation of naive T cells and their subsequent proliferationand differentiation into effector T cells require both a pri-mary signal, delivered when the TCR complex and CD4 or CD8 coreceptor interact with a foreign peptide-MHCmolecule complex, and a co-stimulatory signal, delivered byinteraction between particular membrane molecules on theT cell and the antigen-presenting cell. In contrast, antigen-experienced effector cells and memory cells (as opposed tonaive T cells) are able to respond to TCR-mediated signals with little, if any co-stimulation. The reason for the different activation requirements of naive and activated T cells is an area of continuing research,but some clues have been found. One is that many popula-tions of naive and effector T cells express different isoformsof CD45, designated CD45RA and CD45RO, which are pro-duced by alternative splicing of the RNA transcript of theCD45 gene. This membrane molecule mediates TCR signaltransduction by catalyzing of and Fyn, activat-ing these kinases and triggering subsequent steps in T-cellactivation (see figures 10-10 and 10-11). The CD45RO iso-form, which is expressed on effector T cells, associates withthe TCR complex and its coreceptors, CD4 and CD8, muchbetter than does the CD45RA isoform, which is expressed bynaive T cells. Memory T cells have both isoforms, but theCD45RO is predominant. As a result, effector and memory T cells are more sensitive to TCR-mediated activation by apeptide-MHC complex. They also have less stringent re-quirements for co-stimulatory signals and therefore are ableto respond to peptide-MHC complexes displayed on targetcells or antigen-presenting cells that lack the co-stimulatoryB7 molecules. Cell-Adhesion Molecules Facilitate TCR-Mediated Interactions CD2 and the integrin LFA-1 are cell-adhesion molecules on the surfaces of T cells that bind, respectively, to LFA-3 andICAMs ( intracellular cell-adhesion molecules) on antigen- presenting cells various target cells (see Figure 9-13). Thelevel of LFA-1 and CD2 is twofold to fourfold higher oneffector T cells than on naive T cells, enabling the effector T cells to bind more effectively to antigen-presenting cellsand to various target cells that express low levels of ICAMs orLFA-3. As Chapter 9 showed, the initial interaction of an effector T cell with an antigen-presenting cell or target cell is weak,allowing the TCR to scan the membrane for specific peptides320 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 14-1 Comparison of naive and effector T cells Property Naive T cells Effector T cells Co-stimulatory signal (CD 28-B7interaction) Required for activation Not required for activation CD45isoform CD 45RA CD 45RO Cell-adhesion molecules (CD 2and Low HEVs *in secondary lymphoid tissue Tertiary lymphoid tissues; inflammatory sites *HEV = high endothelial venules, sites in blood vessel used by lymphocytes for extravasation.presented by self-MHC molecules. If no peptide-MHC com- plex is recognized by the effector cell, it will disengage fromthe APC or target cell. Recognition of a peptide-MHC com-plex by the TCR, however, produces a signal that increases theaffinity of LFA-1 for ICAMs on the APC or target-cell membrane, prolonging the interaction between the cells.For example, T H1 effector cells remain bound to macro- II MHC complexes; T H2 ef- fector cells remain bound to cells that display peptide-classII MHC complexes; and CTL effector cells bind cells that display peptide-class I MHCcomplexes. Effector T Cells Express a Variety of Effector Molecules Unlike naive T cells, effector T cells express certain effector molecules, which may be membrane bound or soluble (Table14-2). The membrane-bound molecules belong to the tumornecrosis factor (TNF) family of membrane proteins the CD40 on T H2 cells. Each of the effector T-cell populations also secretes distinct panels of solubleeffector molecules. CTLs secrete cytotoxins /H9253and /H9252.A s described in Chapter 12, the T H1 and T H2 subsets secrete largely nonoverlapping sets of cytokines. Each of these membrane-bound and secreted molecules plays an important role in various T-cell effector Fas ligand, perforins, CD40 ligand and soluble IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 all play a role inB-cell activation by the T H2 cell. Cytotoxic T Cells Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs, are generated by immuneactivation of T cytotoxic (T C) cells. These effector cells have lytic capability and are critical in the recognition and elimi-nation of altered self-cells (e.g., virus-infected cells andtumor cells) and in graft-rejection reactions. In general, CTLs are CD8 +and are therefore class I MHC restricted, al- though in rare instances CD4+class II-restricted T cells have been shown to function as CTLs. Since virtually all nucleatedcells in the body express class I MHC molecules, CTLs canrecognize and eliminate almost any altered body cell. The CTL-mediated immune response can be divided into two phases, reflecting different aspects of the response. Thefirst phase activates and differentiates naive T Ccells into functional effector CTLs. In the second phase, effector CTLsrecognize antigen-class I MHC complexes on specific targetcells, which leads them to destroy the target cells. Effector CTLs Are Generated from CTL Precursors Naive T Ccells are incapable of killing target cells and are there- fore referred to as CTL precursors (CTL-Ps) to denote theirfunctionally immature state. Only after a CTL-P has been acti-vated will the cell differentiate into a functional CTL withcytotoxic activity. Generation of CTLs from CTL-Ps appears torequire at least three sequential signals (Figure 14-1): IAn antigen-specific signal 1 transmitted by the TCRcomplex upon recognition of a peptide-class I MHCmolecule complex IA co-stimulatory signal transmitted by the CD28-B7interaction of the CTL-P and the antigen-presenting cell IA signal induced by the interaction of IL-2 with thehigh-affinity IL-2 receptor, resulting express IL-2 or IL-2 receptors, do not proliferate, and do not display cytotoxic activity. Anti-gen activation induces a CTL-P to begin expressing the IL-2receptor and to a lesser extent IL-2, the principal cytokinerequired for proliferation and differentiation of activatedCTL-Ps into effector CTLs. In some cases, the amount ofIL-2 secreted by an antigen-activated CTL-P may be suffi-cient to induce its own proliferation and differentiation; thisCell-Mediated Effector Responses CHAPTER 14 321 TABLE 14-2 Effector molecules produced by effector T IL-5,IL-6,IL-10,IL-13,GM-CSF (low) CD 40ligandis particularly true of memory CTL-Ps, which have lower activation requirements than naive cells do (Figure 14-2a). In general, though, most activated CTL-Ps require addi- tional IL-2 produced by proliferating T H1 cells to proliferate and differentiate into effector CTLs. The fact that the IL-2receptor is not expressed until after a CTL-P has been acti-vated by antigen plus a class I MHC molecule favors theclonal expansion and acquisition of cytotoxicity by only theantigen-specific CTL-Ps. The proliferation and differentiation of both antigen- activated T H1 cells and CTL-Ps depend on IL-2. In IL-2 knockout mice, the absence of IL-2 has been shown to abol-ish CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. After clearance of antigen,the level of IL-2 declines, which induces T H1 cells and CTLs to undergo programmed cell death by apoptosis. In this way,the immune response is rapidly terminated, lessening the likelihood of nonspecific tissue damage from the inflamma-tory response. The role of T H1 cells in the generation of CTLs from naive CTL-Ps is not completely understood, and it is unlikely that aT H1 cell and CTL-P interact directly. However, IL-2 and co- stimulation are important in the transformation of naiveCTL-Ps into effector cells, and T H1 cells can be mediators in the provision of these essential requirements. As shown in Figure 14-2b, the interaction of helper cells with antigen-presenting cells can result in production of IL-2 by the T H1 cell. The paracrine action of this cytokine on nearby naiveCTL-Ps whose TCRs are engaged can cause them to prolifer-ate and differentiate into active CTLs. Additionally, T H1 can induce the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on the322 PART III CTLs. Upon interaction I MHC complexes on appropriate target cells, CTL-Ps be-gin to express IL- 2receptors (IL- 2R) and lesser amounts of IL- 2. Prolif- eration and differentiation of antigen-activated CTL-Ps generally requireadditional IL- 2secreted by T H1cells resulting from antigen activation and proliferation of CD 4+T cells. In the subsequent effector phase, CTLs destroy specific target cells.surface of antigen-presenting cells. In this manner, T H1 cells help CTL-P division and differentiation by causing the gen-eration of adequate levels of co-stimulation. CD8+CTLs Can Be Tracked with MHC Tetramer Technology MHC tetramers are laboratory-generated complexes of four MHC class I molecules bound to a specific peptide andlinked to a fluorescent molecule. A given MHC-tetramer - peptide complex binds only CD8 +T cells that have TCRs specific for the particular peptide-MHC complex that makesup the tetramer. Thus, when a particular tetramer is added toa cell population containing T cells (spleen cells or lymph-node cells, for example), cells that bear TCRs specific for the tetramer become fluorescently labeled (Figure 14-3). Using flow cytometry, it is then possible to determine theproportion of cells in a population that have TCRs specificfor a particular antigen by counting the number of fluores-cently labeled cells in a cell population. This very sensitiveapproach can detect antigen-specific T cells even when theirfrequency in the CD8 +population is as low as 0.1%. Further- more, one can directly measure the increase in antigen-specific CD8 +T cells in response to exposure to pathogens such as viruses or cancer-associated antigens. In a relatedapplication, researchers infected mice with vesicular virus (VSV) and systematically examined the specific for a VSV-derived peptide-MHC com- plex throughout the entire body. This study demonstratedthat during acute infection with VSV , the distribution ofCell-Mediated require help from T Hcells. (a) Antigen-activated memory CTL-Ps appear to secrete suf- ficient IL- 2to stimulate their own proliferation and differentiation into effec- tor CTLs. They also may not require the CD 28-B7co-stimulatory signal foractivation. (b) A T Hcell may provide the IL- 2necessary for proliferation of an antigen-activated naive CTL-P when it binds to the same APC as theCTL-P. Also, T Hcells may alter the behavior of APCs in a number of ways, such as increasing the display of co-stimulatory molecules by the APC.VSV-specific CD8+cells is far from uniform (Figure 14-4); large populations of antigen-specific cells are not limited tothe lymphoid system, but can be found in the liver and kid-ney, too. CTLs Kill Cells in Two Ways The effector phase of a CTL-mediated response involves acarefully orchestrated sequence of events that begin with theembrace of the target cell by the attacking cell (Figure 14-5).Long-term cultures of CTL clones have been used to identifymany of the membrane molecules and membrane eventsinvolved in this process. As described below, studies withmouse strains carrying mutations that affect the ability of CTLs to induce death have led to the identification of thenecessary molecules. The primary events in CTL-mediated death are conjugate formation, membrane attack, CTL destruction (Figure 14-6). When antigen-specific CTLsare incubated with appropriate target cells, the two cell typesinteract and undergo conjugate formation. Formation of aCTL -target cell conjugate is followed within several minutes by a Ca 2+-dependent, energy-requiring step in which the CTL programs the target cell for death. The CTL then disso-ciates from the target cell and goes on to bind to another tar-get cell. Within a variable period of time (up to a few hours)after CTL dissociation, the target cell dies by apoptosis. Eachof the steps in this process has been studied in detail withcloned CTLs. The TCR-CD3 membrane complex on a CTL recognizes antigen in association with class I MHC molecules on a tar-get cell. After this antigen-specific recognition, the integrin324 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms MHC tissues and organs 19%Liver Kidney 41% 28%Mesenteric (HLA-A 1bound to an HIV- derived peptide, for is withfluorescently labeled Streptavidin. Four biotinylated MHC-peptide com-plexes bind to the high affinity binding sites of Streptavidin to form atetramer. Addition of the tetramer to a population of T cells results inexclusive binding of the fluorescent tetramer to those CD 8 +T cells with TCRs complementary to the peptide-MHC complexes of the tetramer.This results in the labeling of the subpopulation of T cells that are spe-cific for the target antigen, making them readily detectable by flow cy-tometry.

Antigen-mediated CTL activation converts LFA-1from a low-avidity state to a high-avidity state (Figure 14-7).Because of this phenomenon, CTLs adhere to and form conju-gates only with appropriate target cells that display antigenicpeptides associated with class I MHC molecules. LFA-1 per- sists in the high-avidity state for only 5 -10 min after antigen- mediated activation, and then it returns to the low-aviditystate. This downshift in LFA-1 avidity may facilitate dissocia-tion of the CTL from the target cell. Electron microscopy of cultured CTL clones reveals the presence of intracellular electron-dense storage granules.These granules have been isolated by fractionation and shownto mediate target-cell damage by themselves. Analysis of revealed 65-kDa monomers a granules appear,bearing newly expressed perforin monomers. Immediately after formation of a CTL -target cell conju- gate, the Golgi stacks and storage granules reorient within thecytoplasm of the CTL to concentrate near the junction withthe target cell (Figure 14-8). Evidence suggests that perforinmonomers and the granzyme proteases are then released fromthe granules by exocytosis into the junctional space betweenthe two cells. As the perforin monomers contact the target-cellmembrane, they undergo a conformational change, exposingan amphipathic domain that inserts into the target-cell the monomers then polymerize (in the presence ofCell-Mediated Effector Responses CHAPTER 14 325 FIGURE 14-5Scanning electron micrograph of tumor-cell attack by a CTL.

A large number of perforin pores are visible on the target-cell membrane in the region of conju-gate formation (Figure 14-9b). Interestingly, perforin exhibitssome sequence homology with the terminal C9 componentof the complement system, and the membrane pores formedby perforin are similar to those observed in complement-mediated lysis. The importance of perforin to CTL-mediatedkilling is demonstrated by perforin-deficient knockout mice,which are unable to eliminate lymphocytic choriomeningitisvirus (LCMV) even though they mount a significant CD8 + immune response to the virus. Pore formation in the cell membrane of the target is one way that perforin mediates granzyme entry; another is theperforin-assisted pathway. Many target cells have a moleculeknown as the mannose 6-phosphate receptor on their sur-face that also binds to granzyme B. Granzyme B/mannose 6-phosphate receptor complexes are internalized and appearinside vesicles. In this case, perforin is necessary for releas-ing granzyme B from the vesicle into the cytoplasm of thetarget cell. Once it enters the cytoplasm of the target cell, granzyme B initiates a cascade of reactions that result in the fragmenta-tion of the target-cell DNA into oligomers of 200 bp; this type of DNA fragmentation is typical of apoptosis. Sincegranzymes are proteases, they cannot directly mediate DNAfragmentation. Rather, they activate an apoptotic pathwaywithin the target cell. This apoptotic process does not requiremRNA or protein synthesis in either the CTL or the targetcell. Within 5 min of CTL contact, target cells begin to exhibitDNA fragmentation. Interestingly, viral DNA within infectedtarget cells has also been shown to be fragmented during thisprocess. This observation shows that CTL-mediated killingnot only kills virus-infected cells but can also destroy theviral DNA in those cells. It has been suggested that the rapidonset of DNA fragmentation after CTL contact may preventcontinued viral replication and assembly in the period beforethe target cell is destroyed. 326 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms 50CTLs bound to of antigen activation on the ability of CTLs to bind to the intercellular cell-adhesion molecule ICAM- 1. mouse CTLs were with anti-CD 3antibodies.

Immunol. 136: 377].Some potent CTL lines have been shown to lack perforin and granzymes. In these cases, cytotoxicity is mediated byFas. As described in Chapter 10, this transmembrane protein,which is a member of the TNF-receptor family, can deliver adeath signal when crosslinked by its natural ligand, a mem-ber of the tumor necrosis family called Fas ligand (see Figure10-19). Fas ligand (FasL) is found on the membrane of CTLs,and the interaction of FasL with Fas on a target cell triggersapoptosis. Key insight into the role of perforin and the Fas-FasL sys- tem in CTL-mediated cytolysis came from experiments withmutant mice. These experiments used two types of mutantmice, the perforin knockout mice mentioned above and astrain of mice known as lpr (Figure 14-10). Mice that arehomozygous for the lpr mutation express little or no Fas and,consequently, cells from these mice cannot be killed by inter-action with Fas ligand. If lymphocytes from normal H-2 b mice are incubated with killed cells from H-2kmice, anti- H-2kCTLs are generated. These H-2bCTLs will kill target cells from normal H-2kmice or from H-2kanimals that are homozygous for the lpr mutation. Incubation of H-2b cells of perforin knockout mice with killed cells from H-2kmice resulted in CTLs that killed wild-type target cells but failed toinduce lysis in target cells from H-2 kmice homozygous for the lpr mutation. The results of these experiments taken together with other studies allowed the investigators to make the following inter-pretation. CTLs raised from normal mice can kill target cells by a perforin-mediated mechanism, by a mechanism involv-ing engagement of target-cell Fas with Fas ligand displayedon the CTL membrane, or, in some cases perhaps, by a com-bination of both mechanisms. Such CTLs can kill target cellsthat lack membrane Fas by using the perforin mechanismalone. On the other hand, CTLs from perforin-knockoutmice can kill only by the Fas-FasL mechanism. Consequently,CTLs from perforin-knockout mice can kill Fas-bearing nor-mal target cells but not lpr cells, which lack Fas. These work-ers also concluded that all of the CTL-mediated killing theyobserved could be traced to the action of perforin-dependentkilling, Fas-mediated killing, or a combination of the two. Noother mechanism was detected. This experiment taken together with a number of other studies shows that two mechanisms are responsible for initi-ating all CTL-mediated apoptotic death of target cells: IDirectional delivery of cytotoxic proteins (perforin and granzymes) that are released from CTLs and entertarget cells IInteraction of the membrane-bound Fas ligand on CTLs with the Fas receptor on the surface of target cells Either of these initiating events results in the activation of a signaling pathway that culminates in the death of the target cellCell-Mediated Effector Responses CHAPTER 14 327 (a) (b) Nucleus this model, a rise in intracellular Ca2+triggered by CTL- target cell interaction ( 1) induces exocytosis, in which the granules fuse with the CTL cell membrane ( 2) and release monomeric perforin into the small space between the two cells ( 3).

A feature of cell death by apopto- sis is the involvement of the caspase family of cysteine pro-teases, which cleave after an aspartic acid residue. The namecaspase incorporates all of these elements ( cysteine, aspartate prote ase). Normally, caspases inactive proenzymes \u2014procaspases \u2014that require proteolytic cleavage for conversion to the active forms. More than a dozen differentcaspases have been found, each with its own specificity. Cleav-age of a procaspase produces an active initiator caspase, whichcleaves other procaspases, thereby activating their proteolyticactivity. The end result is the systematic and orderly disassem-bly of the cell that is the hallmark of apoptosis. CTLs use granzymes and Fas ligand to initiate caspase cas- cades in their targets. The granzymes introduced into the tar-get cell from the CTL mediate proteolytic events that activatean initiator caspase. Similarly, the engagement of Fas on a tar-get cell by Fas ligand on the CTL causes the activation of an ini- tiator caspase in the target cell. Fas is associated with a proteinknown as FADD ( Fas-associated protein with death domain), which in turn associates with a procaspase form of caspase 8.Upon Fas crosslinking, and Fas-mediated pathways is theactivation of dormant death pathways that are present in thetarget cell.

Normal unim- munized mice and mice with unrelated tumors served asnegative controls. Much to the consternation of the investi-gators, the controls showed significant lysis of the tumorcells, too. Characterization of this nonspecific tumor-cellkilling revealed that a population of large granular lympho-cytes was responsible. The cells, which were named naturalkiller (NK) cells for their nonspecific cytotoxicity, make up5%-10% of the recirculating lymphocyte population. These cells are involved in immune defenses against viruses andtumors. Because NK cells produce a number of immunolog-ically important cytokines, they play important roles in im-mune regulation and influence both innate and adaptiveimmunity. In particular, IFN- /H9253production by NK cells can affect the participation of macrophages in innate immunityby activation of the phagocytic and microbicidal activities.IFN- /H9253derived from NK cells can influence the T H1 versus TH2 commitment of helper T cell populations by its in- hibitory effects on T H2 expansion, and stimulate T H1 devel- opment via induction of IL-12 by cells. The Chediak-Higashi syndrome described in theClinical Focus illustrates the disastrous consequences of alack of NK cells. NK cells are involved in the early response to infection with certain viruses and intracellular bacteria. NK activity isstimulated by IFN- /H9251, IFN- /H9252, and IL-12. In the course of a viral infection, the level of these cytokines rapidly rises, fol-lowed closely by a wave of NK cells that peaks in about 3 days(Figure 14-12). NK cells are the first line of defense againstvirus infection, controlling viral replication during the timerequired for activation, proliferation, and differentiation ofCTL-P cells into functional CTLs at about day 7. The impor-tance of NK cells in defense against viral infections is illus-trated by the case of a young woman who completely lackedthese cells. Even though this patient had normal T- and B-cellcounts, she suffered severe varicella virus infections and alife-threatening cytomegalovirus infection. NK Cells and T Cells Share Some Features NK cells are lymphoid cells derived from bone marrow that share a common early progenitor with T cells, but theirdetailed lineage remains to be worked out. They expresssome membrane markers that are found on monocytes andgranulocytes, as well as some that are typical of T cells. Dif-ferent NK cells express different sets of membrane molecules.It is not known whether this heterogeneity reflects subpopu-lations of NK cells or different stages in their activation ormaturation. Among the membrane molecules expressed byNK cells are CD2, the 75-kDa /H9252subunit of the IL-2 receptor, and, on almost all NK cells, CD16 (or Fc /H9253RIII), a receptor for the Fc region of IgG. Cell depletion with monoclonal anti-CD16 antibody removes almost all NK-cell activity fromperipheral blood.Despite some similarities of NK cells to T lymphocytes, they do not develop exclusively in the thymus. Nude mice,which lack a thymus and have few or no T cells, have func-tional NK-cell populations. Unlike T cells and B cells, NK cellsdo not undergo rearrangement of receptor genes. This isdemonstrated by the observation that NK cells develop in micein which the recombinase genes RAG-1 or RAG-2 have been knocked out. Furthermore, while no T or B cells are found inSCID mice, functional populations of NK cells can be readilydemonstrated. The power of NK cells and other protectivemechanisms of innate immunity to protect animals totallylacking in adaptive immunity is nicely illustrated by the familyof RAG-1 knockout mice shown in Figure 14-13. Killing by NK Cells Is Similar to CTL-Mediated Killing Natural killer cells appear to kill tumor cells and virus- infected cells by processes similar to those employed by CTLs.NK cells bear FasL on their surface and readily induce death inFas-bearing target cells. The cytoplasm of NK cells containsnumerous granules containing perforin and granzymes. Un-like CTLs, which need to be activated before granules appear,NK cells are constitutively cytotoxic, always having large gran-ules in their cytoplasm. After an NK cell adheres to a target330 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms 0 Days after viral infection12NK cells Virus titerIFN- + IFN- Virus-specific CTLs 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 FIGURE 14-12 Time course of viral infection. IFN- /H9251and IFN- /H9252 (dashed curve) are released from virus-infected cells soon after infec-tion. These cytokines stimulate the NK cells, quickly leading to a risein the NK-cell population (blue curve) from the basal level. NK cellshelp contain the infection during the period required for generationof CTLs (black curve). Once the CTL population reaches a peak, thevirus titer (blue area) rapidly decreases.cell, degranulation occurs with release of perforin and gran- zymes at the junction of the interacting cells. The roles of per-forin and granzymes in NK-mediated killing of target cells byapoptosis are believed to be similar to their roles in the CTL-mediated process. Despite these similarities, NK cells differ from CTLs in sev- eral significant ways. First, NK cells do not express antigen-specific T-cell receptors or CD3. In addition, recognition oftarget cells by NK cells is not MHC restricted; that is, in manycases the same levels of NK-cell activity are observed withsyngeneic and allogeneic tumor cells. Moreover, althoughprior priming enhances CTL activity, NK-cell activity doesnot increase after a second injection with the same tumorcells. In other words, the NK-cell response generates no im-munologic memory. NK Cells Have Both Activation and Inhibition Receptors Given that NK cells do not express antigen-specific receptors, the mechanism by which NK cells recognize altered self-cellsand distinguish them from normal body cells baffled immu-nologists for years. The solution to the problem emergedwith the realization that NK cells employ two different cate-gories of receptors, one that delivers inhibition signals to NKcells, and another that delivers activation signals. Initially, itwas thought that there were two receptors, one that activatedand another that inhibited NK cells \u2014the so-called two- receptor model. It is now clear that there are many differentcell-surface receptors for activation signals and a number of different kinds for inhibitory ones. Consequently, it is moreappropriate to think in terms of an opposing-signals model rather than a two-receptor model. It is the balance between activating signals and inhibitory signals that is believed toenable NK cells to distinguish healthy cells from infected orcancerous ones. It is important to be aware that additionalNK-activating signals can be delivered by soluble factors.These include as /H9251and /H9252interferons, TNF- exact nature of the membrane-bound receptors on NK cells that produce activation is not completely clear. Anti-body crosslinking of many molecules found on the surface ofNK cells can activate these cells artificially, but the naturalligands for many of these putative activation receptors (ARs)are not known. Some of the candidate ARs are members ofa class of carbohydrate-binding proteins known as C-type lectins, so named because they have calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains. is an exampleof a C-type lectin found on NK cells that has activation prop-erties. In addition to lectins, other molecules on NK cellsmight be involved in activation, including CD2 (receptor LFA-3), and the CD16. Although CD16 is responsible for antibody-mediatedrecognition and killing of target cells by NK cells, it is proba-bly not involved in non-antibody-dependent killing. In addi-tion to the molecules already mentioned, three additionalproteins, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, appear to play signifi-cant roles in the activation of human NK cells. Clues to the sources of inhibitory signals came from stud- ies of the killing of tumor cells and virus-infected cells by NKcells. It was noticed that the preferential killing of mousetumor cells compared with normal cells correlated with alack of expression of MHC molecules by the tumor cells.Experiments with human cells showed that NK cells lysed aB-cell line that was MHC deficient because it had been trans-formed by Epstein-Barr virus. However, when this cell linewas transformed with human HLA genes so that it expressedhigh levels of MHC molecules, NK cells failed to lyse it. Theseobservations led to the idea that NK cells target for killingcells that have aberrant MHC expression. Since many virus-infected and tumor cells have reduced MHC expression, thismodel made good physiological sense. Vindication of thisproposal has come from the discovery of receptors on NKcells that produce inhibitory signals when they recognizeMHC molecules on potential target cells. These inhibitoryreceptors on the NK cell then prevent NK-cell killing, prolif-eration, and cytokine release. Two major groups of inhibitory receptors have been found on NK cells. One of these is a family of C-type-lectin- inhibitory receptors (CLIR), and the other is a group of Ig- superfamily -inhibitory receptors (ISIR) known as the killer- cell-inhibitory receptors (KIR). Even though these groups are chemically quite different, they are together referred to as the inhibitory-receptor superfamily (IRS). In humans, theCell-Mediated Effector Responses CHAPTER 14 331 FIGURE 14-13 Family of RAG- 1KO mice. These mice have no adaptive immunity because they lack T and B cells. However, NK cellsand other mechanisms of innate immunity provide sufficient pro-tection against infection that, if maintained in clean conditions, thesemice can reproduce and raise healthy offspring. However, they aremore susceptible to infection than normal mice and have reducedlifespans. [From the laboratory of R. A. Goldsby.]C-type-lectin -inhibitory receptor is CD94/NKG2, a disulfide- bonded heterodimer made up of two glycoproteins, one ofwhich is CD94 and the other a member of the NKG2 family.The CD94/NKG2 receptors recognize HLA-E on potentialtarget cells. Because HLA-E is not transported to the surfaceof a cell unless it has bound a peptide derived from HLA-A,HLA-B, or HLA-C, the amount of HLA-E on the surface serves as indicator of the overall level of class I MHC biosyn-thesis in the cells. These inhibitory CD94/NKG2 receptorsare thus not specific for a particular HLA allele and will sendinhibitory signals to the NK cell, with the net result thatkilling of potential target cells is inhibited if they are express-332 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms humans, display the huge cytoplasmic granules that are a morphological hall-mark of the disease. Studies of the diseasein beige mice complement those in hu-mans, and have led to the conclusion thatsevere defects in the formation, fusion, ortrafficking of intracellular vesicles proba-bly underlie its devastating pathology. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only effective therapy for the defec-tive natural killer activity, aberrant macro-phage activation, and susceptibility tobacterial infections that plague those af-flicted with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.However, this is a risky and complex ther-apy. A look at the experience of 10CHS children who underwent BMT for theirdisease is informative. BMT is best donewith marrow from a donor whose HLA type is identical to that of the recipient. Un-fortunately, it may be difficult or impossibleto obtain HLA-matched bone marrow, and3of the patients had to settle for HLA-non- identical marrow. After a median interval of6.5years post-transplantation, 6of the 7 patients who had received marrow fromHLA-identical donors were alive, but only 1 of the 3recipients of HLA-nonidentical marrow survived. The clinical picture in thesurvivors was markedly im proved. They were no longer hypersusceptible to bacte- rial infection, displayed significant NK-cellactivity, and did not suffer from uncon-trolled and pathological macrophage acti-vation. However, the improved byBMT. HLA-identical BMT is thus acceptedas a curative treatment for Chediak-Higashi syndrome, but reliance on HLA-nonidentical transplantation is experimen-tal and carries very high risk. The Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare inherited disorder thatinflicts a diversity of maladies on thoseafflicted by it. Identifying features of thedisease include progressive neurologicaldysfunction, an increased tendency todevelop leukemia and lymphoma, anddepigmentation of hair, skin and eyes.Almost 90% of those afflicted have severe immunological deficiency, dis-playing defective natural-killer-cell func-tion and deficits in neutrophil activity.These abnormalities in the leukocytepopulation are reflected in a greatlyheightened susceptibility to infection,traceable in part to neutrophils that aredeficient in chemotactic and bactericidalactivities, and to dysfunctional popula-tions of natural killer cells. The result is agreatly shortened life span; manyChediak-Higashi patients succumb tothe disease in childhood. Microscopicexamination of leukocytes from CHSpatients reveals giant lysozomes that arecharacteristic of this disease. Only those homozygous for a mutant form of a gene known as CHS- 1/LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator) develop Chediak-Higashi syndrome. A corre-sponding mutation has been found inbeige mice and the mouse analogue ofhuman CHS- 1/LYST. The mouse and hu- man homologues both encode a verylarge polypeptide of 2,186 amino acids. Beige mice display a pattern of symptomsvery much like those seen in humans, andtheir granulocytes, like those of afflictedCLINICAL FOCUS Chediak-Higashi Syndrome A neutrophil with the giant lysozomes characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

In contrast, KIR receptors, of which more than 50 family members have been found, arespecific for one or a limited number of polymorphic prod-ucts of particular HLA loci. Unlike B and T cells, NK cells arenot limited to expressing a single KIR, but may express sev-eral, each specific for a different MHC molecule or for a set ofclosely related MHC molecules. For example, individualclones of human NK cells expressing a CD94/NKG2 receptorand as many as six different KIR receptors have been found.Because signals from inhibitory receptors have veto powerover signals from activating receptors, a negative signal fromany inhibitory receptor, whether of the CD94/NKG2 or KIRtype, can block the lysis of target cells by NK cells. Thus, cellsexpressing normal levels of unaltered MHC class I moleculestend to escape all forms of NK-cell -mediated killing. In the opposing-signals model of NK-cell regulation that is emerging from studies of NK cells (Figure 14-14), activat-ing receptors engage ligands on the target cell. These ligandsmay be abnormal patterns of glycosylation on the surface oftumor or virus-infected cells. Recognition of these determi-nants by ARs on NK cells would signal NK cells to kill the tar-get cells. Ligand engagement by NKR-P1-type lectin recep-tors, or a number of other ARs, such as CD16, or in somecases CD2, generates signals that direct the NK cell to kill the target cell. Any of these killing signals can be overriddenby a signal from inhibitory receptors. As we have alreadyseen, members of the inhibitory superfamily of receptors(ISRs) provide a signal that decisively overrides activationsignals when these inhibitory receptors detect normal levelsof MHC class I expression on potential target cells. This pre-vents the death of the target cell. It also prevents NK-cell pro-liferation and the TNF- /H9251. The overall consequence of the opposing- signals model is to spare cells that express critical indicatorsof normal self, the MHC class I molecules, and to kill cellsthat lack indicators of self (absence of normal levels of class I MHC). Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity A number of cells that potential express mem- brane receptors for the Fc region of the antibody molecule.When antibody is specifically bound to a target cell, thesereceptor-bearing cells can bind to the antibody Fc region,and thus to the target cells, and subsequently cause lysis ofthe target cell. Although these cytotoxic cells are nonspecificfor antigen, the specificity of the antibody directs them tospecific target cells. This type of cytotoxicity is referred to asantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Among the cells that cells, ma- crophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils.Antibody-dependent cell-mediated killing of cells infected with themeasles virus can be observed in vitro by adding anti-measlesantibody together with macrophages to a culture of measles- infected cells. Similarly, cell-mediated killing of helminths,such as schistosomes or blood flukes, can be observed in vitroby incubating larvae (schistosomules) with antibody to theschistosomules together with eosinophils. Target-cell killing by ADCC appears to involve a number of different cytotoxic mechanisms, but not complement-mediated lysis (Figure 14-15). When macrophages, neutro-phils, or eosinophils bind to a target cell by way of the Fcreceptor, they become more active metabolically; as a result,the lytic enzymes in their cytoplasmic lysosomes or granulesincrease. Release of these lytic enzymes at the site of the Fc-mediated contact may result in damage to the target cell. Inaddition, activated monocytes, macrophages, and NK cellshave been shown to secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF),which may have a cytotoxic effect on the bound target cell.Since both NK cells and eosinophils contain perforin in cyto-plasmic granules, their target-cell killing also may involveperforin-mediated membrane damage similar to the mecha-nism described for CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.Cell-Mediated Effector Responses CHAPTER 14 No model of how cytotoxic activity of NK cells is restricted to altered self-cells. An activation receptor (AR) onNK cells interacts with its ligand on normal and altered self-cells, in-ducing an activation signal that results in killing. However, engagementof inhibitory NK cell receptors such as KIR and CD 94/NKG 2by class I MHC molecules delivers an inhibitory signal that counteracts the acti-vation signal. Expression of class I molecules on normal cells thus pre-vents their destruction by NK cells. Because class I expression is oftendecreased on altered self-cells, the killing signal predominates, leadingto their destruction.Experimental Assessment of Cell- Mediated Cytotoxicity Three experimental systems have been particularly useful for measuring the activation and effector phases of cell-mediatedcytotoxic responses. The mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) is an in vitro system for assaying T H-cell proliferation in a cell- mediated response; function; and the graft-versus- host reaction (GVH) in experimental animals provides an in vivo system for studying cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Co-Culturing T Cells with Foreign Cells Stimulates MLR During the 1960s, early in the history of modern cellular immunology, it was observed that when rat lymphocyteswere cultured on a monolayer of mouse fibroblast cells, therat lymphocytes proliferated and destroyed the mouse fibro-blasts. In 1970 it was discovered that functional CTLs couldalso be generated by co-culturing allogeneic spleen the mixed-lymphocyte reaction TheT lymphocytes in an MLR undergo extensive blast transfor-mation and cell proliferation. The degree of proliferation canbe assessed by adding [ 3H] thymidine to the culture medium and monitoring uptake of label into DNA in the course ofrepeated cell divisions.Both populations of allogeneic T lymphocytes proliferate in an MLR unless one population is rendered unresponsiveby treatment with mitomycin C or lethal x-irradiation (Fig-ure 14-16). In the latter system, called a one-way MLR, theunresponsive population provides stimulator cells that ex-press alloantigens foreign to the responder T cells. Within24-48 h, the responder T cells begin dividing in response to the alloantigens of the stimulator cells, and by 72 -96 h an expanding population of functional CTLs is generated. Withthis experimental system, functional CTLs can be generatedentirely in vitro, after which their activity can be assessedwith various effector assays. The significant role of T Hcells in the one-way MLR can be demonstrated by use of antibodies to the T H-cell membrane marker CD4. molecules on the stimulatorcells and proliferate in response to these differences. Removalof the CD4 +TH cells from the responder population with plus complement abolishes the MLR and preventsgeneration of CTLs. In addition to T Hcells, accessory cells such as macrophages also are necessary for the MLR to pro-ceed. When adherent cells (mostly macrophages) are removedfrom the stimulator population, the proliferative response inthe MLR is abolished and functional CTLs are no longer gen-erated. It is now known that the function of these macro-phages is to activate the class II MHC -restricted T Hcells, whose proliferation is measured in the MLR. In the absenceof T H-cell activation, there is no proliferation. CTL Activity Can Be Demonstrated by CML Development of the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay was a major experimental advance that contributed to un-derstanding of the mechanism of target-cell killing by CTLs.In this assay, suitable target cells are labeled intracellularlywith chromium-51 ( 51Cr) by incubating the target cells with Na 251CrO 4. After the 51Cr diffuses into a cell, it binds to cytoplasmic proteins, reducing passive diffusion of thelabel out of the cell. When specifically activated CTLs areincubated for 1 -4 h with such labeled target cells, the cells lyse and the 51Cr is released. The amount of51Cr released correlates directly with the number of target cells lysed by the CTLs. By means of this assay, the specificity of CTLsfor allogeneic cells, tumor cells, virus-infected cells, andchemically modified cells has been demonstrated (Figure14-17). The T cells responsible for CML were identified by tively depleting different T-cell means ofantibody-plus-complement general, the activity ofCTLs exhibits class I MHC restriction. That is, they can killonly target cells that present antigen associated with syn-geneic class I MHC molecules.

Becausethe donor and recipient are not genetically identical, thegrafted lymphocytes begin to attack the host, and the host 's compromised state prevents an immune response against thegraft. In humans, GVH reactions often develop after trans-plantation of bone marrow into patients who have had radi-ation exposure or who have leukemia, immunodeficiencydiseases, or autoimmune anemias. The clinical manifesta-tions of the GVH reaction include diarrhea, skin lesions,jaundice, spleen enlargement, and death. Epithelial cells ofthe skin and gastrointestinal tract often become necrotic,causing the skin and intestinal lining to be sloughed. Experimentally, GVH reactions develop when immuno- competent lymphocytes are transferred into an allogeneicneonatal or x-irradiated animal. The recipients, especiallyneonatal ones, often exhibit weight loss.

Spleen enlargement results fromproliferation of both CD4 +and CD8+T-cell populations. NK cells also have been shown to play a role in the GVH reaction,and these cells may contribute to some of the skin lesions andintestinal-wall damage observed. SUMMARY IThe cell-mediated branch of the cells: T cells mediate DTHreactions (discussed in Chapter 17). Compared with naiveT Hand T Ccells, the effector cells are more easily activated, express higher levels of cell-adhesion molecules, exhibitdifferent trafficking patterns, and produce both solubleand membrane effector molecules. IThe first phase of the CTL-mediated immune responseinvolves the activation and differentiation of T Ccells, called CTL precursors (CTL-Ps). IAntigen-specific CD8+ populations andtracked by labeling with MHC tetramers. IThe second phase of CTL-mediated response of CTL cytoplasmic granules toward the target release, formation of pores in the target-cell mem-brane, dissociation of CTL from the target, and the deathof the target cell. ICTLs induce cell death via two mechanisms: the perforin-granzyme pathway and the Fas/FasL macrophages) can alsokill target cells. Many of these cells bind to the Fc region of antibody on target cells and subsequently release lyticenzymes, perforin, or TNF, which damage the target-cellmembrane, a antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). INK cells lysis of and virus-infectedcells by perforin-induced pore formation, a mechanismsimilar to one of those employed by CTLs.IThe expression of relatively high levels of class I MHCmolecules on normal cells protects them against NKcell-mediated killing. NK cell killing is regulated by the balance between positive signals generated by the engage-ment of activating receptors (NKR-P1 and others) andnegative signals from inhibitory receptors (CD94/NKG2and the KIR family).

This is espe-cially true of lymphocytes, which circulate continually in the blood and lymph and, in common withother types of leukocytes, migrate into the tissues at sites ofinfection or tissue injury. This recirculation not only in-creases the chance that lymphocytes specific for a particularantigen will encounter that antigen but also is critical todevelopment of an inflammatory response. Inflammation is a complex response to local injury or other trauma; it ischaracterized by redness, heat, swelling, and pain. Inflam-mation involves various immune-system cells and numer-ous mediators. Assembling and regulating inflammatoryresponses would be impossible without the controlledmigration of leukocyte populations. This chapter covers themolecules and processes that play a role in leukocyte migra-tion, various molecules that mediate inflammation, and thecharacteristic physiologic changes that accompany inflam-matory responses. Lymphocyte Recirculation Lymphocytes are capable of a remarkable level of recircula-tion, continually moving through the blood and lymph tothe various lymphoid organs (Figure 15-1). After a brieftransit time of approximately 30 min in the bloodstream,nearly 45% of all lymphocytes are carried from the blooddirectly to the spleen, where they reside for approximately 5 h. Almost equal numbers (42%) of lymphocytes exit fromthe blood into various peripheral lymph nodes, where theyreside for about 12 h. A smaller number of lymphocytes(10%) migrate to tertiary extralymphoid tissues by crossingbetween endothelial cells that line the capillaries. These tis-sues normally have few, if any, lymphoid cells but can importthem during an inflammatory response. The most immuno-logically active tertiary extralymphoid tissues are those thatinterface with the external environment, such as the skin and various mucosal epithelia of the gastrointestinal, pul-monary, and genitourinary tracts. The of continual lymphocyte recirculation allows maximal numbers of antigenically committed lymphocytes to encounter antigen. An individual lymphocyte may make acomplete circuit from the blood to the tissues and lymphand back again as often as 1-2 times per day. Since only about one in 10 5lymphocytes recognizes a particular anti- gen, it would appear that a large number of T or B cells mustcontact antigen on a given antigen-presenting cell within ashort time in order to generate a specific immune response.The odds of the small percentage of lymphocytes committedto a given antigen actually making contact with that antigenwhen it is present are elevated by the extensive recircula-tion of lymphocytes. The likelihood of such contacts is profoundly increased also by factors that regulate, organize,and direct the circulation of lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. Cell-Adhesion Molecules The vascular endothelium serves as an important \"gate-keeper,\" regulating the movement of blood-borne molecules chapter 15 FPO Lymphocytes Attached to the Surface of a High-Endothelial Venuleand leukocytes into the tissues. In order for circulating leuko- cytes to enter inflamed tissue or peripheral lymphoid organs,the cells must adhere to and pass between the endothelialcells lining the walls of blood vessels, a process called extra- vasation. Endothelial cells express leukocyte-specific cell- adhesion molecules of these membrane pro- teins are expressed constitutively; others are expressed only in response to local concentrations of cytokines producedduring an inflammatory response. Recirculating lympho-cytes, monocytes, that the vascular endothelium, enabling these cells toextravasate into the tissues. In addition to their role in leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, CAMs on leukocytes also serve to increasethe strength of the functional interactions between cells ofthe immune system. Various adhesion molecules have beenshown to contribute to the interactions between T Hcells and APCs, T Hand B cells, and CTLs and target cells.A number of endothelial and leukocyte CAMs have been cloned and characterized, providing new details about theextravasation process. Most of these CAMs belong to fourfamilies of proteins: the selectin family, the fam-ily, (Ig) 15-2). SELECTINS selectin family of membrane glycoproteins has a distal lectin-like domain that enables these molecules to bind to specific carbohydrate groups. Selectins interactprimarily with sialylated carbohydrate moieties, which areoften linked to mucin-like molecules. The selectin familyincludes three molecules, designated L, E, and P . Most cir-culating leukocytes express on vascular endothelial cells.Selectin molecules are for the initial stickiness ofleukocytes to vascular endothelium. MUCINS The mucins are a group of serine- and threonine- rich proteins that are heavily glycosylated. Their extendedstructure allows them to present sialylated carbohydrate selectins. certain endothelialcells nodes. Another mucin-like molecule (PSGL-1)found on ing of an /H9251 and a /H9252chain) that are expressed by leukocytes and facilitate both adherence to the vascular endothelium andother cell-to-cell interactions. The integrins are grouped to which /H9252subunit they contain. Differ- ent integrins are expressed by different populations of leuko-cytes, allowing these cells to bind to different CAMs thatbelong to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed alongthe vascular endothelium. As described later, some integrinsmust be activated before they can bind with high affinity totheir ligands.

Included in this group are VCAM, which are ex-pressed on vascular bind to variousintegrin molecules. An important cell-adhesion moleculecalled MAdCAM-1 has both Ig-like domains and mucin-likedomains. This molecule is expressed on mucosal endothe-lium and directs lymphocyte entry into mucosa. It binds to integrins by its immunoglobulin-like domain and to selectinsby its mucin-like domain.Leukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 339 marrowEpithelial h) (?)

Althoughmost lymphocytes circulate, appear to contain lympho-cytes that do not. [Adapted from A. Ager, 1994, Trends Cell Biol. 4:326.]Neutrophil Extravasation As an inflammatory response develops, various cytokines and other inflammatory mediators act upon the local bloodvessels, inducing increased expression of endothelial CAMs.The vascular endothelium is then said to be activated, or inflamed. Neutrophils are generally the first cell type to bind to inflamed endothelium and extravasate into the tissues. T oaccomplish this, neutrophils must recognize the inflamedendothelium and adhere strongly enough so that they are notswept away by the flowing blood. The bound neutrophilsmust then penetrate the endothelial layer and migrate intothe underlying tissue. Monocytes and eosinophils extravasateby a similar process, but the steps have been best establishedfor the neutrophil, so we focus on neutrophils here. The process of neutrophil extravasation can be divided into four sequential steps: (1) rolling, (2) activation by chemoat-tractant stimulus, (3) arrest and adhesion, and (4) transendo-thelial migration (Figure 15-3a). In the first step, neutrophilsattach loosely to the endothelium by a low-affinity selectin-carbohydrate interaction. During an inflammatory response,cytokines and other mediators act upon the local endothe-lium, inducing expression of adhesion molecules of the selec-tin family. These E- and P-selectin molecules bind to mucin-like cell-adhesion molecules on the neutrophil membrane or with a lactosaminoglycan called sialyl Lewis 15-3b). This interaction neutrophil briefly to theendothelial cell, but the shear force of the circulating bloodsoon detaches the neutrophil. Selectin molecules on anotherendothelial cell again the neutrophil; isrepeated so that the neutrophil tumbles end-over-end alongthe endothelium, a type of binding called rolling. As the neutrophil rolls, it is activated by various chemoat- tractants; these are either permanent features of the endo- thelial cell surface or secreted locally by cells involved in theinflammatory response. Among the chemoattractants aremembers of a large family of chemoattractive cytokines calledchemokines. Two chemokines involved in the activation process interleukin 8 (IL-8) and macrophage inflamma-tory protein (MIP-1 /H9252). However, not the chemokine group. Other chemoattractants areplatelet-activating the C5b67 and various N-formyl peptides pro- duced by the breakdown of bacterial proteins during an infec-tion. Binding of these chemoattractants to receptors on theneutrophil membrane triggers an activating signal mediatedby G proteins associated with the receptor. This signal inducesa conformational change in the integrin molecules in the neu-340 Immune Effector Mechanisms of CAM families Fibrinonectin-type the general structures of the four families of cell-adhesion molecules (a) and a list of repre-sentative molecules in each family (b).

MAdCAM- 1contains both mucin-like and domains and can bind to both selectins and integrins.trophil membrane, increasing their affinity for the Ig-super- family adhesion molecules on to the endothelial cell, enabl-ing the cell to adhere firmly to the endothelial cell. Subsequently, the neutrophil migrates through the vessel wall into the tissues. The steps in transendothelial migrationand how it is directed are still largely unknown; they may bemediated by further activation by chemoattractants and sub-sequent integrin-Ig-superfamily interactions or by a separatemigration Extravasation Various subsets of lymphocytes exhibit sites and secondary lymphoid organs.The recirculation of lymphocytes thus is carefully controlledto ensure that appropriate populations of B and T cells arerecruited into different tissues. As with neutrophils, extrava-sation of lymphocytes involves interactions among a number of cell-adhesion molecules (Table 15-1). The overall processis similar to what happens during neutrophil extravasationand comprises the same four stages of contact and rolling,activation, arrest and adhesion, and, finally, transendothelialmigration. High-Endothelial Venules endothelium in postcapillary venules of various lymphoid organs are of special-ized cells with a plump, (\"high\") called high-endothelial venules, orHEVs (Figure 15-4a, b). Their cells contrast sharply in appearance with theflattened endothelial cells that line the rest of the capillary.Each of the secondary lymphoid organs, with the exceptionof the spleen, contains HEVs. When frozen sections of lymphnodes, Peyer's patches, or tonsils are incubated with lympho-cytes and washed to remove unbound cells, over 85% of theLeukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 341 Endothelium(a) Rolling Activation Arrest/ adhesionTransendothelial migration 1 SS SS FIGURE 15-3 (a) The four sequential but overlapping steps in neutrophil ex-travasation.

Go to www.whfreeman.com/immunology Animation Leukocyte Extravasation bound cells are found adhering to HEVs, even though HEVs account for only 1%-2% of the total area of the frozen sec-tion (Figure 15-4c). It has been estimated that as many as 1.4 /H1100310 4lympho- cytes extravasate every second through HEVs into a singlelymph node. The development and maintenance of HEVs inlymphoid organs is influenced by cytokines produced in re-sponse to antigen capture. For example, HEVs fail to developin animals raised in a germ-free environment. The role ofantigenic activation of lymphocytes in the maintenance ofHEVs has been demonstrated by surgically blocking the af-ferent lymphatic vasculature to a node, so that antigen entryto the node is blocked. Within a short period of time, theHEVs show impaired function and eventually revert to amore flattened morphology. High-endothelial venules express a vascular endothelial cells, HEVs expressCAMs of selectin in a tissue-specific manner. These tissue-specific adhe-sion molecules have been called vascular addressins (V As) because they serve to direct the extravasation of differentpopulations of recirculating lymphocytes to particular lym-phoid organs. Lymphocyte Homing Is Directed by Receptor Profiles and Signals The general process of lymphocyte extravasation is similar to neutrophil extravasation. An important feature distinguish-ing the two processes is that different subsets of lymphocytesmigrate differentially into different tissues. This process iscalled trafficking, or homing. The different trafficking pat- terns of lymphocyte subsets are mediated by unique combi-342 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 15-1 Some interactions between cell-adhesion molecules implicated in leukocyte extravasation * Ligands on Step involving Receptor on cells Expression endothelium interactionMain function CLA or ESL- 1 Effector T cells E-selectin Tethering/rolling Homing to lymph MAdCAM- migration into inflamed tertiary sites LFA- 1(/H9251L/H92522) Leukocyte ICAM- MAdCAM- to gut via migration inflamed to thymus; nonmucosal sites *Most endothelial and leukocyte CAMs belong to four groups of proteins as shown in Figure 15-2.

See Figures 15-3a and 15-7 for an illustration of steps in the extravasation process.nations of adhesion molecules and chemokines; receptors that direct the circulation of various populations of lympho-cytes to particular lymphoid and inflammatory tissues arecalled homing receptors. Researchers have identified a num- ber of lymphocyte and endothelial cell-adhesion moleculesthat participate in the interaction of lymphocytes with HEVsand with endothelium at tertiary sites or sites of inflamma-tion (see Table 15-1). As is described later, in the section onchemokines, these molecules play a major role in determin-ing the heterogeneity of lymphocyte circulation patterns. Naive Lymphocytes Recirculate to Secondary Lymphoid Tissue A naive lymphocyte is not able to mount an immune re- sponse until it has been activated to become an effector cell.Activation of a naive cell occurs in specialized microenviron-ments within secondary lymphoid tissue (e.g., peripherallymph nodes, Peyer's patches, tonsils, and spleen). Within these microenvironments, dendritic cells capture antigenand present it to the naive lymphocyte, resulting in its activa-tion. Naive cells do not exhibit a preference for a particulartype of secondary lymphoid tissue but instead circulateindiscriminately to secondary lymphoid tissue throughoutthe body by recognizing adhesion molecules on HEVs. The initial attachment of naive lymphocytes to HEVs is generally mediated by the binding of the homing receptor L-selectin to adhesion molecules such as GlyCAM-1 andCD34 on HEVs (Figure 15-5a). The trafficking pattern ofnaive cells is designed to keep these cells constantly recircu-lating through secondary lymphoid tissue, whose primaryfunction is to trap blood-borne or tissue-borne antigen. Once naive lymphocytes encounter antigen trapped in a secondary lymphoid tissue, they become activated and en-large into lymphoblasts. Activation takes about 48 h, andduring this time the blast cells are retained in the paracorticalLeukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 343 Lymphocytes passingacrossthe wallBasement membraneHigh endothelium(a) (b) (c) FIGURE lymph- node postcapillary venule with high endothelium.

During this phase, called the shut-down phase, the antigen-specific lympho-cytes cannot be detected in the circulation (Figure 15-6).Rapid proliferation and differentiation of naive cells occursduring the shut-down phase. The effector and memory cellsthat are generated by this process then leave the lymphoid tis-sue and begin to recirculate. Effector and Memory Lymphocytes Adopt Different Trafficking Patterns The trafficking patterns of effector and memory lympho- cytes differ from those of naive lymphocytes. Effector cellstend to home to regions of infection by recognizing inflamedvascular endothelium and chemoattractant molecules thatare generated during the inflammatory response. Memorylymphocytes, on the other hand, home selectively to the typeof tissue in which they first encountered antigen. Presumablythis ensures that a particular memory cell will return to thetissue where it is most likely to reencounter a subsequentthreat by the antigen it recognizes. Effector and memory cells express increased levels of cer- tain cell-adhesion molecules, such as LFA-1, that interactwith tertiary extralymphoid tissue (suchas and mucosal epithelia) and at sites of inflammation,allowing effector and memory cells to enter these sites. Naivecells lack corresponding cell-adhesion molecules and do nothome to these sites. Inflamed endothelium expresses a num- ber of adhesion molecules, P-selectin andthe Ig-superfamily molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, thatbind to the receptors expressed at high levels on memory andeffector cells.344 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms (a) Naive homing receptors and vascular addres- sins involved in selective trafficking of naive and effector T cells. (a) NaiveT cells tend to home to secondary lymphoid tissues through their HEVregions. The initial interaction involves the homing receptor L-selectinand mucin-like cell-adhesion molecules such as CD 34or GlyCAM- 1ex-pressed on HEV cells. (b, c) Various subsets of effector T cells express high levels of particular homing receptors that allow them to home to endothelium in particular tertiary extralymphoid tissues. The initialinteractions in homing of effector T cells to mucosal and skin sites areillustrated. 2468 Days following antigen exposureShut-down phaseAntigen-specific T cells in efferent lymph FIGURE 15- 6 T-cell activation in the paracortical region of a lymph node results in the brief loss of lymphocyte recirculation. During thisshut-down phase, antigen-specific T cells cannot be leavingthe node in the efferent lymph.Unlike naive lymphocytes, subsets memory and effector populations exhibit tissue-selective homing behavior.Such tissue specificity is imparted not by a single adhesionreceptor but by different combinations of adhesion molecules.For example, a mucosal homing subset lamina propria venules (see Figure 15-5b). How-ever, these cells avoid direction to secondary lymphoid tissuesbecause they have low levels of the L-selectin that would facil-itate their entry into secondary lymphoid tissue. A second sub-set of memory/effector cells displays preferential homing tothe skin. This subset also expresses low levels of butdisplays high levels of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen bind to E-selectin and ICAMs on dermalvenules of the skin (see Figure 15-5c). Although effector andmemory cells that express reduced levels of L-selectin do nottend to home through HEVs into peripheral lymph nodes,they can enter peripheral lymph nodes through the afferentlymphatic vessels. Adhesion-Molecule Interactions Play Critical Roles in Extravasation The extravasation of lymphocytes into secondary lymphoid tissue or regions of inflammation is a multistep process in-volving a cascade of adhesion-molecule interactions similarto those involved in neutrophil emigration from the blood-stream. Figure 15-7 depicts the typical interactions in ex- travasation of naive T cells across HEVs into lymph nodes.The first step is usually a selectin-carbohydrate interactionsimilar to that seen with neutrophil adhesion. Naive lympho-cytes initially bind to HEVs by L-selectin, which serves as ahoming receptor that directs the lymphocytes to particulartissues expressing a mucin-like CD34 GlyCAM-1. Lymphocyte than that of neutrophils. Although the ini-tial selectin-carbohydrate interaction is quite weak, the slowrate of blood flow in postcapillary venules, particularly inregions of HEVs, reduces the likelihood that the shear forceof the flowing blood will dislodge the tethered lymphocyte. In the second step, an integrin-activating stimulus is medi- ated by chemokines that are either localized on the endothelialsurface or secreted locally. The thick glycocalyx covering of theHEVs may function to retain these soluble chemoattractantfactors on the HEVs. If, as some have proposed, HEVs secretelymphocyte-specific chemoattractants, it would explain whyneutrophils do not extravasate into lymph nodes at the HEVseven though they express L-selectin. Chemokine binding to G-protein-coupled receptors on the lymphocyte leads to acti-vation of integrin molecules on the membrane, as occurs inneutrophil extravasation. Once activated, the integrin mole-cules interact with Ig-superfamily adhesion molecules (e.g.,ICAM-1), so the lymphocyte adheres firmly to the endothe-lium. The molecular mechanisms involved in the final step,transendothelial migration, are poorly understood.Leukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 L-selectinNaive in extravasation of a naive T cell through a high- endothelial venule into a lymph node. Extravasation of lymphocytes in-cludes the same basic steps as neutrophil extravasation but some of thecell-adhesion molecules differ. Activation of the integrin LFA- 1, induced by chemokine binding to the lymphocyte, leads to firm adhesion fol-lowed by migration between the endothelial cells into the tissue.Chemokines\u2014Key Mediators of Inflammation Chemokines are a superfamily of small polypeptides, most of which contain 90-130 amino acid residues. They selectively,and often specifically, control the adhesion, chemotaxis, andactivation of many types of leukocyte populations and sub-populations. Consequently, they are major regulators of leu-kocyte traffic. Some chemokines are primarily involved ininflammatory processes, others are constitutively expressedand play important homeostatic or developmental roles.\"Housekeeping\" chemokines are produced in lymphoid or-gans and tissues or in non-lymphoid sites such as skin, wherethey direct normal trafficking of lymphocytes, such as deter-mining the correct positioning of leukocytes newly generatedby hematopoiesis and arriving from bone marrow. The thy-mus constitutively expresses chemokines, and normal B celllymphopoiesis is also dependent on appropriate chemokineexpression. Chemokine-mediated effects are not limited tothe immune system. Mice that lack either the chemokineCXCL12 (also called SDF-1) or its receptor (see Table 15-2)show major defects in the development of the brain and theheart. Members of the chemokine family have also beenshown to play regulatory roles in the development of bloodvessels (angiogenesis), and wound healing. The inflammatory chemokines are typically induced in response to infection. Contact with pathogens or the action ofproinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- /H9251, up-regulate the expression cytokines at sites of developinginflammation. Chemokines cause leukocytes to move intovarious tissue sites by inducing the adherence of these cells tothe vascular endothelium. After migrating into tissues, leuko-cytes are attracted toward high localized concentrations ofchemokines resulting in the targeted recruitment of phago-cytes and effector lymphocyte populations to inflammatorysites. The assembly of leukocytes at sites of infection, orches-trated by chemokines, is an essential part of mounting anappropriately focused response to infection. More than 50 chemokines and at least 15 chemokine re- ceptors have been described (Table 15-2).The chemokinespossess four conserved cysteine residues and based on theposition of two of the four invariant cysteine residues, almostall fall into one or the other of two distinctive subgroups: IC-C subgroup chemokines, in which the conserved subgroup chemokines, in which the conserved cysteines are separated by some other amino acid (X). Chemokine action is mediated by receptors whose poly- peptide chain traverses the membrane seven times. There aretwo of receptors, CC receptors the between and their receptors is of high affin- ity ( K a> 109) and high specificity. However, as Table 15-2 shows, most receptors bind more than one chemokine. Forexample, CXCR2 recognizes at least six different chemokines,and many chemokines can bind to more than one receptor.

Baggiolini, 1998, Nature 392: 565.]production of distinctive profiles of chemokines by destina- tion tissues and sites provide rich opportunities for the dif-ferential regulation of activities of different leukocyte popu-lations. Indeed, differences in patterns of chemokine-receptorexpression occur within leukocyte populations as well as be-tween different ones. Recall that T H1 and T H2 subsets of T H cells can be distinguished by their different patterns of cyto-kine production. These subsets also display different profilesof chemokine receptors. T H2 cells express CCR3 and -4, and a number of other receptors not expressed by T H1 cells. On the other hand, T H1 cells express CCR1, -3, and -5, but most TH2 cells do not. Other Mediators of Inflammation In addition to chemokines, a variety of other mediators released by cells of the innate and acquired immune sys-tems trigger or enhance specific aspects of the inflammatoryresponse. They are released by tissue mast cells, bloodplatelets, and a variety of leukocytes, including neutrophils,monocytes/macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, and lym-phocytes. In addition contains fourinterconnected mediator-producing systems: the kinin sys-tem, the clotting system, the fibrinolytic system, and thecomplement system. The first three systems share a commonintermediate, Hageman factor, as illustrated in Figure 15-10.When tissue damage occurs, these four systems are activatedto form a web of interacting systems that generate a numberof mediators of inflammation. The Kinin System Is Activated by Tissue Injury The kinin system is an enzymatic cascade that begins when a plasma clotting factor, called Hageman factor, is activatedfollowing tissue injury. The activated Hageman factor thenactivates prekallikrein to form kallikrein, which cleaveskininogen to produce bradykinin (see Figure 15-10). This inflammatory mediator is a potent basic peptide that in-creases vascular permeability, causes vasodilation, inducespain, and induces contraction of smooth muscle. Kallikreinalso acts directly on the complement system by cleaving C5into C5a and C5b. The that induces mast-cell degranulation, result-ing in the release of a number of inflammatory mediatorsfrom the mast cell. The Clotting System Yields Fibrin-Generated Mediators of Inflammation Another enzymatic cascade that is triggered by damage to blood vessels yields large quantities of thrombin. Thrombinacts on soluble fibrinogen in tissue fluid or plasma pro-duce insoluble strands of fibrin and fibrinopeptides. Theinsoluble fibrin strands crisscross one another to form a clot, which serves as a barrier to the spread of infection. The clot-ting system is triggered very rapidly after tissue injury to pre-vent bleeding and limit the spread of invading pathogensinto the bloodstream. The fibrinopeptides act as Plasmin- Generated Mediators of Inflammation Removal of the fibrin clot from the injured tissue is achieved by the fibrinolytic system. The end product of this pathway is the enzyme plasmin, which is formed by the conversion a potent proteolytic enzyme, breaksdown that for neutrophils. Plasmin also contributes to the in-flammatory response by activating the classical complementpathway.

Binding of the ana- phylatoxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) to receptors on the of tissue mast cells induces degranulation with tovascular cells, extravasate through the endothe-lial lining of the capillary, and migrate toward the site ofcomplement activation in the tissues. Activation of the com-plement system thus results in influxes of fluid that carryantibody and phagocytic cells to the site of antigen entry. Some Lipids Act as Inflammatory Mediators Following membrane perturbations, phospholipids in the membrane of several cell types (e.g., macrophages, monocytes,neutrophils, and mast cells) are degraded into arachidonicacid and lyso-platelet-activating factor (Figure 15-11). Thelatter is subsequently converted into platelet-activating factor(PAF), which causes platelet activation and has many inflam-matory effects, including eosinophil chemotaxis and the acti-vation and degranulation of neutrophils and eosinophils. Metabolism of arachidonic produces prostaglandins and by produce large quantities of PGE2 moderate of PGE2; mastcells constrictionof vessels. Arachidonic acid is also metabolized by the lipoxygenase pathway to yield the four leukotrienes: LTB4, LTC4, LTE4. Three of these (LTC4, and LTE4) together makeup what was formerly called substance of ana- phylaxis (SRS-A); these mediators potent chemoattractant of neutrophils.The leukotrienes are produced by a variety of cells, includingmonocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Some Cytokines Are Important Inflammatory Mediators A number of cytokines play a significant role in the develop- ment of an acute or chronic inflammatory response. IL-1,IL-6, TNF- /H9251, IL-12, and many chemokines exhibit redundant and pleiotropic effects that together contribute to the inflam-matory response. Some of the effects mediated by IL-1, IL-6,and TNF- /H9251are listed in Table 15-3. In addition, IFN- /H9253con- tributes to the inflammatory response, acting later in the acuteresponse and contributing in a major way to chronic inflam-mation by attracting and activating macrophages. IL-12 in-duces the differentiation of the proinflammatory T H1 subset. The role of several of these inflammatory cytokines in thedevelopment of acute and chronic inflammation will bedescribed more fully in the next section.Leukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 349 Arachidonic generates important mediators of inflammation, including thromboxane, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF).The Inflammatory Process Inflammation is a physiologic response to a variety of stimuli such as infections and tissue injury. In general, an acuteinflammatory response has a rapid onset and lasts a shortwhile. Acute inflammation is generally accompanied by a sys-temic reaction known as the acute-phase response, which ischaracterized by a rapid alteration in the levels of severalplasma proteins. In some diseases persistent immune activa-tion can result in chronic inflammation, which often haspathologic consequences. Neutrophils Play an Early and Important Role in Inflammation In the early stages of an inflammatory response, the predom- inant cell type infiltrating the tissue is the neutrophil. Neu-trophil infiltration into the tissue peaks within the first 6 h ofan inflammatory response, with production of neutrophilsin the bone marrow increasing to meet this need. A normaladult produces more than 10 10neutrophils per day, but dur- ing a period of acute inflammation, neutrophil productionmay increase as much as tenfold. The neutrophils leave the bone marrow and circulate within the blood. In response to mediators of acute inflam-mation, vascular endothelial cells increase increased of E-selectin. The express sialyl aand sialyl Lewisx, which bind to E- and P-selectin.As described earlier, this binding mediates the attachment or tethering of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium,allowing the cells to roll in the direction of the blood flow.During this time, chemokines such as IL-8 or other chemoat-tractants act upon the neutrophils, triggering a G-protein-mediated activating signal that leads to a conformationalchange in the integrin adhesion molecules, resulting in neu-trophil adhesion and subsequent transendothelial migration(see Figure 15-3). Once in tissues, the activated neutrophils also express in- creased levels of receptors for chemoattractants and conse-quently exhibit chemotaxis, migrating up a gradient of chemoattractant. Among the mediators thatare chemotactic methionyl pep-tides, are also chemotactic for neutrophils. Activated neu-trophils express increased levels of Fc receptors for antibodyand receptors for complement, enabling these cells to bindmore effectively to antibody- or complement-coated patho-gens, thus increasing phagocytosis. The activating signal also stimulates metabolic pathways to a respiratory burst, which produces reactive oxygen interme- diates and reactive nitrogen intermediates (see Chapter 2). Release of some of these reactive intermediates and the releaseof mediators phospholipases, play animportant role in killing various pathogens. These substancesalso contribute to the tissue damage that can result from aninflammatory response. The accumulation of dead cells andmicroorganisms, together with accumulated fluid and variousproteins, makes up what is known as pus. Inflammatory Responses May Be Localized or Systemic Infection or tissue injury induces a complex cascade of non- specific events, known as the inflammatory response, thatprovides early protection by restricting the tissue damage tothe site of infection or tissue injury. The acute inflammatoryresponse involves both localized and systemic responses. LOCALIZED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE The hallmarks of a localized acute inflammatory response, firstdescribed almost 2000 years ago, are swelling ( tumor ), ( dolor ), and loss of function. Within minutes after tissue injury, there is an increase in vasculardiameter (vasodilation), resulting in an increase in the volumeof blood in the area and a reduction in the flow of blood. Theincreased blood volume heats the tissue and causes it to redden.Vascular permeability also increases, leading to leakage of fluidfrom the blood vessels, particularly at postcapillary venules.This results in an accumulation of fluid (edema) in the tissue and, in some instances, extravasation of leukocytes, contribut-350 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 15-3Redundant and pleiotropic effects of IL- 1, TNF- /H9251, and 6 Effect IL- 1 TNF- /H9251 IL-6 Endogenous pyrogen fever + + + Synthesis of acute-phase proteins by liver + + + Increased vascular permeability + + +Increased adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium + + - Fibroblast proliferation + + -Platelet production + - +Chemokine induction (e.g., IL- 8) + + - Induction of IL- 6 ++ - T-cell activation + + +B-cell activation + + +Increased immunoglobulin synthesis - - +ing to the swelling and redness in the area. When fluid exudes from the bloodstream, the kinin, clotting, and fibrinolytic sys-tems are activated (see Figure 15-10). Many of the vascularchanges that occur early in a local response are due to the directeffects of plasma enzyme mediators such as bradykinin and fib-rinopeptides, which induce vasodilation and increased vascu-lar permeability. Some of the vascular changes are due to theindirect effects of the complement anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a,and Histamine is inflam-mation, causing vasodilation and smooth-muscle contraction.The permeability associated with the acute in-flammatory response.Within a few hours of the onset of these vascular changes, neutrophils adhere to the endothelial cells, and migrate out of the blood into the tissue spaces (Figure 15-12). Theseneutrophils phagocytose invading pathogens and release mediators that contribute of inflammation. Macrophages ar-rive about 5-6 hours after an inflammatory response begins.These macrophages are activated cells that exhibit increasedphagocytosis and increased release of mediators and cyto-kines that contribute to the inflammatory response. Activated tissue macrophages secrete three cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- /H9251) that induce many of the localized and Leukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 351 VISUALIZING ICAM-1LymphocyteNeutrophil 15-12 Overview of the cells and mediators involved in a local acute inflammatory response.

All three cytokines act locally,inducing coagulation vascular TNF- induce increased increased expressionof ICAM-1 mono-cytes, and lymphocytes recognize these adhesion moleculeson the walls of blood vessels, adhere, and then move throughthe vessel wall into the tissue spaces. IL-1 and TNF- /H9251also act on macrophages and endothelial cells to induce productionof the chemokines that contribute to the influx of neutro-phils by increasing their adhesion to vascular endothelialcells and by TNF- /H9251activate and increased re-lease of lytic enzymes into the tissue spaces. A local acute inflammatory response can occur without the overt involvement of the immune system. Often, how-ever, cytokines released at the site of inflammation facilitateboth the adherence of immune-system cells to vascular en-dothelial cells and their migration through the vessel wallinto the tissue spaces. The result is an influx of lymphocytes,neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and mastcells to the site of tissue damage, where these cells participatein clearance of the antigen and healing of the tissue. The duration and intensity of the local acute inflamma- tory response must be carefully regulated to control tissuedamage and facilitate the tissue-repair mechanisms that arenecessary for healing. TGF- /H9252has been shown to play an im- portant role in limiting the inflammatory response. It alsopromotes accumulation and proliferation of fibroblasts andthe deposition of an extracellular matrix that is required forproper tissue repair. Clearly, the processes of leukocyte adhesion are of great im- portance in the inflammatory response. A failure of properleukocyte adhesion can result in disease, as exemplified byleukocyte-adhesion deficiency (see Clinical Focus on page 358). SYSTEMIC ACUTE-PHASE RESPONSE The local inflammatory response is accompanied by a sys-temic response known as the acute-phase response (Figure 15-13). This response is marked by the induction of fever,increased synthesis of hormones such as ACTH and hydro-cortisone, increased production of white blood cells (leuko-cytosis), and production of a large number of acute-phase proteins in the liver. The increase in body temperature inhibits the growth of a number of pathogens and appears toenhance the immune response to the pathogen. C-reactive protein is a prototype acute-phase protein whose serum level increases 1000-fold during an acute-phaseresponse. It is composed of five identical polypeptides held together by noncovalent interactions. C-reactive proteinbinds to a wide variety of microorganisms and activates com-plement, resulting in deposition of the opsonin C3b on thesurface of microorganisms. Phagocytic cells, which expressC3b receptors, can then readily phagocytose the C3b-coatedmicroorganisms. Many systemic acute-phase effects are due to the com- bined action of IL-1, TNF- /H9251and IL-6 (see Figure 15-13). Each of these cytokines acts on the hypothalamus to induce afever response. Within 12-24 h of the onset of an acute-phaseinflammatory response, increased levels of IL-1, TNF- /H9251and IL-6 (as well as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and onco-statin M (OSM)) induce production proteinsby and GM-CSF). CSFs stimulatehematopoiesis, resulting in transient increases in the numberof white blood cells needed to fight the infection. The redundancy in the ability of at least five cytokines (TNF- /H9251, IL-1, IL-6, LIF, and OSM) to induce production of acute-phase proteins by the liver results from the inductionof a common transcription factor, NF-IL6, after each of thesecytokines interacts with its receptor. Amino-acid sequencingof cloned NF-IL6 revealed that it has a high degree ofsequence identity with C/EBP , a aleucine-zipper domain and a basic DNA-binding domain,and both proteins bind to the same nucleotide sequence inthe promoter or enhancer of the genes encoding liverproteins. C/EBP , which production of albuminand transthyretin, is expressed constitutively by hepatocytes.As an inflammatory response develops and the cytokinesinteract with their respective receptors on liver hepatocytes,expression of NF-IL6 increases and that of C/EBP decreases(Figure 15-14b). The inverse relationship between these twotranscription factors accounts for the observation that serumlevels of proteins such as albumin and transthyretin declinewhile those of acute-phase proteins increase during an in-flammatory response. Chronic Inflammation Develops When Antigen Persists Some microorganisms are able to evade clearance by the immune system, for example by possessing cell-wall compo-nents that enable them to resist phagocytosis. Such organ-isms often induce a chronic inflammatory response, result-ing in significant tissue damage. Chronic inflammation alsooccurs in a number of autoimmune diseases in which self-antigens continually activate T cells. Finally, chronic inflam-mation also contributes to the tissue damage and wastingassociated with many types of cancer. The accumulation and activation of macrophages is the hallmark of chronic inflammation. Cytokines released by the352 PART III Immune Effector Mechanismschronically activated macrophages also stimulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. A type of scar tissuedevelops at sites of chronic inflammation by a process calledfibrosis, a wound-healing reaction that can interfere with nor- mal tissue function. Chronic inflammation may also lead toformation of a granuloma, a tumor-like mass consisting of a central area of activated macrophages surrounded by activatedlymphocytes. The center of the granuloma often containsmultinucleated giant cells formed by the fusion of activatedmacrophages. These giant cells typically are surrounded bylarge modified macrophages that resemble epithelial cells IFN- /H9253and TNF- /H9251, play a central role in the development of chronic inflammation. T H1 cells, NK cells, and T C cells release IFN- /H9253, while activated macro- phages secrete TNF- (IFN- /H9251 and IFN- /H9252) are released from virus-infected cells and confer antiviral protection on neighboring cells. Exactly which inter-feron is produced depends on the type of cell infected. IFN- /H9251 is produced by leukocytes, IFN- /H9252, often called fibroblastLeukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER VISUALIZING CONCEPTS Prostaglandins organs and mediators involved in a systemic acute-phase response. IL- 1, IL-6, and TNF- /H9251, which are produced by activated macrophages at the site of inflamma-tion, are particularly important in mediating acute-phase effects. LIF = leukemia inhibitory factor; OSM M.interferon, is made largely by fibroblasts. IFN- /H9253is produced exclusively by T cells and NK cells. However, IFN- /H9253has a number of pleiotropic distinguish it from IFN- /H9251 and IFN- /H9252and contribute to the inflammatory response (Fig- ure 15-15). One of the most striking effects of IFN- /H9253is its abil- ity to activate macrophages. Activated macrophages exhibitincreased expression of class II MHC molecules, production, and increased microbicidal activity com-pared with nonactivated macrophages; thus, they are moreeffective in antigen presentation and killing of intracellularmicrobial pathogens. In a chronic inflammatory response,however, the large numbers of activated macrophages releasevarious hydrolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen and nitrogenintermediates, which are responsible for much of the damage to surrounding tissue. One of the principal cytokines secreted by activated macro- phages is TNF- /H9251. The activity of this cytokine was first ob- served around the turn of the century by the surgeon WilliamColey. He noted that when cancer patients developed certainbacterial infections, the tumors would become necrotic. In thehope of providing a cure for cancer, Coley began to inject can-cer patients with supernatants derived from various bacterialcultures. These culture supernatants, called \"Coley's toxins,\"did induce hemorrhagic necrosis in the tumors but had nu-merous undesirable side effects, making them unsuitable forcancer therapy. Decades later, the active component of Coley'stoxin was shown to be a lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) com-ponent of the bacterial cell wall. This endotoxin does not itselfinduce tumor necrosis but instead induces macrophages toproduce TNF- /H9251. This cytokine has a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells but not on normal cells (Figure 15-16a). Potentialimmunotherapeutic approaches using TNF- /H9251for the treat- ment of cancer are examined in Chapter 22. Several lines of evidence indicate that TNF- /H9251also contri- butes to much of the tissue wasting that characterizes chronicinflammation. For example, mice carrying a TNF- /H9251 trans- gene become severely wasted (Figure 15-16b). In studies byA. Cerami and coworkers, rabbits were found to lose nearlyhalf of their body mass within 2 months of being infectedwith trypanosomes. These workers subsequently discoveredthat a macrophage-derived factor was responsible for theprofound wasting; they cachetin. Cloning ofthe genes for TNF- /H9251and cachetin revealed that they were the same protein. Activation of macrophages by IFN- /H9251promotes increased transcription of the TNF- /H9251gene and increases the stability of TNF- /H9251mRNA. synergistically inflammatory response. Both cytokines together in-duce much greater increases in ICAM-1, E-selectin, and class IMHC molecules than either cytokine alone. The increase inintercellular adhesion molecules facilitates the recruitment oflarge numbers of cells in a chronic inflammatory response. CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES Recent studies suggest that regions of plump endothelial cellsresembling HEVs appear along the vasculature in tertiary extralymphoid sites of chronic infection. These HEV-like re-gions, which appear to be sites of lymphocyte extravasa-tion into the inflamed tissue, express several mucins (e.g., MAdCAM-1, and CD34) notably IFN- /H9253and TNF- /H9251, that are associated with chronic inflammation may play a rolein the induction of HEV-like regions along the vasculature. These HEV-like regions have been observed in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases in humans, including354 PART III 15-14 Comparison of the structure and function of C/EBP and NF-IL 6. (a) Both transcription factors are dimeric proteins con- taining a leucine-zipper domain (light orange) and a basic DNA-binding domain (blue). (b) C/EBP is expressed constitutively in liver hepatocytes and promotes transcription of albumin and transthyretingenes. During an inflammatory response, binding of IL- 1, IL-6, TNF- /H9251, LIF, or OSM to receptors on liver hepatocytes induces production ofNF-IL 6, which promotes transcription of the genes encoding various acute-phase proteins. Concurrently, C/EBP levels decrease and the lev-els of albumin and transthyretin consequently decrease.Leukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 355 Proliferation Production of IL-4 and IL-5 Expression of class II MHC molecules Microbicidal activity Cytotoxic activity Differentiation Antibody production ( IgG2a; IgE and IgG1)CD4+ TH2 cell B cell ) Summary of pleiotropic activity of interferon gamma (IFN- /H9253).

In 1979 , a paper entitled \"Delayed sep- aration of the umbilical cord, widespreadinfections, and defective neutrophil mo- bility\" appeared in Lancet, a British med- ical journal. This was the first in a seriesof reports that have appeared over theyears describing patients afflicted with a rare autosomal recessive disease inwhich the first indication is quite oftenomphalitis, a swelling and reddeningaround the stalk of the umbilical cord. Although no more susceptible to virus infections than normal controls, those afflicted with this disorder suffer recur-rent and often chronic bacterial infec-tions, and sites where one would expectto find pus are instead pus-free. This ob-servation is particularly striking becausethe patients are not deficient in granulo-cytes; in fact, they typically have greatly el-evated numbers of granulocytes in thecirculation. Detailed immunological work-ups of these patients showed that Ig levels were in the normal range and thatthey had nearly normal B-, T-, and NK-cellfunction. However, examination of leuko-cyte migration in response to tissue dam-age revealed the root cause of the diseasein these patients.

Allergies, autoim-mune diseases, microbial infections, transplants, and burnsmay initiate a chronic inflammatory response. Various thera-peutic approaches are available for reducing long-term in-flammatory responses and thus the complications associatedwith them. Antibody Therapies Reduce Leukocyte Extravasation Because leukocyte extravasation is an integral part of the inflammatory response, one approach for reducing inflam-mation is to impede this process. Theoretically, one way toreduce leukocyte extravasation is to block the activity of var-ious adhesion molecules with antibodies. In animal models,for example, antibodies to the integrin LFA-1 have been used to reduce neutrophil buildup in inflammatory tissue. Anti-bodies to ICAM-1 have also been used, with some success, inpreventing the tissue necrosis associated with burns and inreducing the likelihood of kidney-graft rejection in animalmodels. The results with antibodies specific for these ad-hesins have been so encouraging that a combination of anti-bodies (anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1) was used in clinicaltrials on human kidney-transplant patients. A combinationof two anti-adhesins had to be used because failure to blockboth LFA-1 and ICAM-1 results in rejection. Corticosteroids Are Powerful Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The corticosteroids, which are cholesterol derivatives, include prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. These po-tent anti-inflammatory agents exert various effects that resultin a reduction in the numbers and activity of immune-systemcells. They are regularly used in anti-inflammatory therapy.Leukocyte Migration and Inflammation CHAPTER 15 357 has been named leukocyte-adhesion de- ficiency (LAD). Bacterial infections in these patients can be treated with antibiotics, but they recur. Furthermore, there are antibiotic-resistant strains of many pathogenic bac-teria, and LAD patients must live underthis microbial Sword of Damocles, neverknowing when the life-saving thread of an-tibiotics will fail. If a suitable bone-marrowdonor can be found (almost always a closerelative), however, there is a curative strat-egy. The LAD patient's hematopoietic sys-tem is destroyed, perhaps by treatmentwith cytotoxic chemicals, and then bone-marrow transplantation is performed. Ifsuccessful, this procedure provides the pa-tient with leukocytes that have normal lev-els of functional integrin and display thefull range of migratory capacities. This disease is not limited to humans. A strikingly similar version known as bo-vine leukocyte adhesion disease (BLAD)occurs in cattle. The cause of BLAD inthese animals is identical to the cause ofLAD in human patients\u2014the lack of afunctional integrin subunit. What is dif-ferent in some dairy herds is the inci-dence of the disease; though rare inhumans, it can occur at economically im- portant frequencies in cattle. This is aconsequence of the high degree of in-breeding that exists in populations ofdairy cattle. Typically, dairy herds are siredby the artificial insemination of semenfrom very few bulls. As a consequence of this practice, by the 1980 s, almost 1in 20dairy bulls could be traced back to a single Holstein bull who happened to beheterozygous for BLAD. Such a high fre-quency of this recessive trait in the sirepopulation dramatically raised the fre-quency of this disease in dairy herds. Dur-ing the early 1990 s, in some countries, the incidence of the BLAD gene was ashigh as 10% in a number of dairy herds. The gene for bovine CD 18has been cloned, which has allowed the design of aPCR-based assay for the aberrant formsof this gene. It is now possible to rou-tinely screen sires and recipients for theBLAD allele. As a result, bulls that are car-riers of the BLAD gene have been identi-fied and eliminated from the breedingpool. This has led to a dramatic reductionin the frequency of new BLAD cases aswell as in the overall frequency of theBLAD allele in dairy-herd populations.skin from a small area of the arm; the cell populations that move into the abradedarea are then sampled by capturingsome of those cells on a glass coverslipplaced onto the wounded skin. A seriesof glass coverslips is sequentially placed,incubated, and removed over a period of several hours. Typically, each coverslipis left in place for two hours, and the pro-cedure is repeated four times over aneight-hour period. Examination of thecoverslips under a microscope revealswhether leukocytes have adhered to the coverslips. In normal individuals, theresponse of the immune system to tis-sue injury is to deliver leukocytes to thedamaged area, and one finds these cellson the coverslips. However, in the pa-tients described here, the coverslipswere largely negative for leukocytes. Ex-amination of white blood cells in thesepatients revealed an absence of CD 18, an essential component of a number ofintegrins. A key element in the migrationof leukocytes is integrin-mediated celladhesion, and these patients suffer froman inability of their leukocytes to undergoadhesion-dependent migration into sitesof inflammation. Hence, this syndromeCorticosteroid treatment causes a decrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes as the result either of steroid-induced lysis of lymphocytes (lympholysis) or of alterationsin lymphocyte-circulation patterns. Some species (e.g., ham-ster, mouse, rat, and rabbit) are particularly sensitive to corticosteroid-induced lympholysis. In these animals, corti-costeroid treatment at dosages as low as 10 -7M causes such widespread lympholysis that the weight of the thymus isreduced by 90%; the spleen and lymph nodes also shrink visibly. Immature thymocytes in these species appear to beparticularly sensitive to corticosteroid-mediated killing. Inrodents, corticosteroids induce programmed cell death ofimmature thymocytes, whereas mature thymocytes are resis-tant to this activity. Within 2 h following in vitro incubationwith corticosteroids, immature thymocytes begin to showthe characteristic morphology of apoptosis, and 90% of thechromatin is degraded into the characteristic nucleosome lad-der by 24 h after treatment. The steps involved in the inductionof apoptosis by corticosteroids remain to be determined. Inhumans, guinea pigs, and monkeys, corticosteroids do not in-duce apoptosis but instead affect lymphocyte-circulation pat-terns, causing a decrease in thymic weight and a marked de-crease in the number of circulating lymphocytes. Like other steroid hormones, the corticosteroids are lipo- philic and thus can cross the plasma membrane and bind toreceptors in the cytosol. The resulting receptor-hormone com-plexes are transported to the nucleus, where they bind to spe-cific regulatory DNA sequences, regulating transcription up ordown. The corticosteroids have been shown to induce in-creased transcription of the NF- /H9260B inhibitor (I- /H9260B). this prevents the translo- cation of NF- /H9260B into the nucleus and consequently prevents NF-/H9260B activation of a number of genes, including genes in- volved in T-cell activation and cytokine production. Corticosteroids also reduce both the phagocytic and killing ability of macrophages and neutrophils, and this effect maycontribute to their anti-inflammatory action. In addition, theyreduce chemotaxis, so that fewer inflammatory cells are at-tracted to the site of T H-cell activation. In the presence of cor- ticosteroids, expression of class II MHC molecules and IL-1production by macrophages is dramatically reduced; suchreductions would be expected to lead to corresponding reduc-tions in T H-cell activation. Finally, corticosteroids also stabilize the lysosomal membranes of participating leukocytes, so thatdecreased levels of lysosomal enzymes are released at the site ofinflammation. NSAIDs Combat Pain and Inflammation Since the time of Hippocrates, extracts of willow bark havebeen used for relief of pain. The active ingredient, salicylate,which is found in aspirin, is just one of many nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are the most fre-quently used medication for treating pain and inflammation.Clinically, NSAIDs have been shown to be effective for treat-ment of many acute and chronic inflammatory reactions. The major mechanism by which these drugs exert anti-inflamma-tory effects is by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase pathway thatproduces prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonicacid. The reduction limits theincrease in vascular permeability and neutrophil chemotaxisin the inflammatory response. As shown in Figure 15-17, thecyclooxygenase pathway is mediated by two enzymes, cyclo-oxygenase 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-1 & Cox-2). Although NSAIDs such as aspirin, Tylenol, ibuprofen, Naproxen, and others are routinely prescribed for the treat-ment of ailments as diverse as arthritis, sprains, tissue injury,and back pain, the duration of their use is limited by gas-trointestinal side effects that include unease and abdominalpain and in more serious cases bleeding or perforation of thestomach or upper GI tract. Investigation of the mechanism ofNSAIDs has provided a basis for the beneficial and deleteri-ous effects of many NSAIDS. Studies have shown that,although most NSAIDs inhibit both Cox-1 and Cox-2, it isthe inhibition of Cox-2 that is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs. On the other hand, inhibi-358 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms Diverse physical, SAIDSArachidonic acid 2 Maintenance of integrity gastrointestinal 2by A variety of agents trigger the release of arachidonic acid from the cellmembrane by the action of phospholipase A 2.

The action of these highlytargeted drugs is shown in Figure 15-17. SUMMARY ILymphocytes undergo constant recirculation between theblood, lymph, lymphoid organs, and tertiary extralymphoidtissues, increasing the chances that the small number oflymphocytes specific for a given antigen (about 1 in 10 5 cells) will actually encounter that antigen. IMigration of leukocytes into inflamed tissue or into lym-phoid organs requires interaction between cell-adhesionmolecules (CAMs) on the vascular endothelium and thoseon the circulating cells. IMost CAMs fall into one of four protein families: theselectins, the mucin-like family, integrins, or and mucin-like CAMs interact with eachother, and members of each family are expressed on bothleukocytes and endothelial cells.

Generally, these effector molecules induce a localizedinflammatory response that eliminates antigen without extensively damaging the host's tissue. Under certain cir-cumstances, however, this inflammatory response can havedeleterious effects, resulting in significant tissue damage oreven death. This inappropriate immune response is termedhypersensitivity or allergy. Although the word hypersensi- tivity implies an increased response, the response is not always heightened but may, instead, be an inappropriate im-mune response to an antigen. Hypersensitive reactions maydevelop in the course of either humoral or cell-mediatedresponses. The ability of the immune system to respond inappro- priately to antigenic challenge was recognized early in thiscentury. Two French scientists, Paul Portier and CharlesRichet, investigated the problem of bathers in the Mediter-ranean reacting violently to the stings of Portuguese Man ofWar jellyfish. Portier and Richet concluded that the localizedreaction of the bathers was the result of toxins. T o counteractthis reaction, the scientists experimented with the use ofisolated jellyfish toxins as vaccines. Their first attempts metwith disastrous results. Portier and Richet injected dogs withthe purified toxins, followed later by a booster of toxins.Instead of reacting to the booster by producing antibodiesagainst the toxins, the dogs immediately reacted with vomit-ing, diarrhea, asphyxia, and, in some instances, death. Clear-ly this was an instance where the animals \"overreacted\" tothe antigen. Portier and Richet coined the term anaphylaxis, loosely translated from Greek to mean the opposite ofprophylaxis, to describe this overreaction. Richet was subse- quently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicinein 1913 for his work on anaphylaxis. We currently refer to anaphylactic reactions within the humoral branch initiated by antibody or antigen-antibodycomplexes as immediate hypersensitivity, because the symp- toms are manifest within minutes or hours after a sensitizedrecipient encounters antigen. Delayed-type hypersensitiv- ity (DTH) is so named in recognition of the delay of symp- toms until days after exposure. This chapter examines themechanisms and consequences of the four primary types ofhypersensitive reactions. Gell and Coombs Classification Several forms of hypersensitive reaction can be distin-guished, reflecting differences in the effector molecules gen-erated in the course of the reaction. In immediate hypersen-sitive reactions, different antibody isotypes induce differentimmune effector molecules. IgE antibodies, for example,induce mast-cell with release of histamineand other biologically active molecules. IgG and IgM anti-bodies, on the other hand, induce hypersensitive reactionsby activating complement. The effector molecules in thecomplement reactions are the membrane-attack complexand such split products C3a, C4a, and hypersensitivity reactions, the effector various cytokines secreted by activated T Hor TC cells. chapter 16As it became clear that several different immune mecha- nisms give rise to hypersensitive reactions, P . G. H. Gell andR. R. A. Coombs proposed a classification scheme in whichhypersensitive reactions are divided into four types. Threetypes of hypersensitivity occur within the humoral branchand are mediated by antibody or antigen-antibody complexes:IgE-mediated (type I), antibody-mediated (type II), and im-mune complex-mediated (type III). A fourth type of hyper-sensitivity depends on reactions within the cell-mediatedbranch, and is termed delayed-type hypersensitivity, or DTH(type IV). Each type involves distinct mechanisms, cells, andmediator molecules (Figure 16-1). This classification schemehas served an important function in identifying the mecha-nistic differences among various hypersensitive reactions,but it is important to point out that secondary effects blur the boundaries between the four categories. IgE-Mediated (Type I) Hypersensitivity A type I hypersensitive reaction is induced by certain types ofantigens referred to as allergens, and has all the hallmarks of a normal humoral response. That is, an allergen induces ahumoral antibody response by the same mechanisms asdescribed in Chapter 11 for other soluble antigens, resultingin the generation of antibody-secreting plasma cells andmemory cells. What distinguishes a type I hypersensitiveresponse from a normal humoral response is that the plasma362 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms VISUALIZING CONCEPTS Type I IgE-Mediated Hypersensitivity Ag induces crosslinking of IgE bound to mast cells andbasophils with release ofvasoactive mediators Typical manifestations include systemic anaphylaxis andlocalized anaphylaxis such ashay fever, asthma, hives, food allergies, eczemaTypical manifestations include blood transfusion reactions,erythroblastosis fetalis, andautoimmune hemolyticanemiaTypical manifestations include contact dermatitis, meditates cell destruction via complementactivation or ADCCAg-Ab complexes deposited in various tissues inducecomplement activation andan ensuing inflammatory response mediated by massive infiltration of neutrophilsSensitized T H1 cells release cytokines that activatemacrophages or T C cells mediate direct cellular damageIgG-Mediated Cytotoxic HypersensitivityImmune IgE Fc receptor DegranulationC3bC3bC3bAntigen Immune complex activation Immune complex CC Neutrophil Activated macrophageCytokinesSensitized TDTHADCC Cytotoxic cell Surface antigen Targetcell FIGURE 16-1The four types of hypersensitive responses.cells secrete IgE.

There Are Several Components of Type I Reactions As depicted in Figure 16-2, several components are critical to development of type I hypersensitive reactions. This sectionwill consider these components first and then describe themechanism of degranulation. ALLERGENS The majority of humans mount significant IgE responsesonly as a defense against parasitic infections. After an indi-vidual has been exposed to a parasite, serum IgE levels in-crease and remain high until the parasite is successfully cleared from the body. Some persons, however, may have anabnormality called atopy, a hereditary predisposition to the development of immediate hypersensitivity reactions againstcommon environmental antigens. The IgE regulatory defectssuffered by atopic individuals allow nonparasitic antigens tostimulate inappropriate IgE production, leading to tissue-damaging type I hypersensitivity. The term allergen refers specifically to nonparasitic antigens capable of stimulatingtype I hypersensitive responses in allergic individuals. The abnormal IgE response of atopic individuals is at least partly genetic\u2014it often runs in families. Atopic individuals haveabnormally high levels of circulating IgE and also more thannormal numbers of circulating eosinophils. These individualsare more susceptible to allergies such as hay fever, eczema, andasthma. The genetic propensity to atopic responses has beenmapped to several candidate loci. One locus, on chromosome5q, is linked to a region that encodes a variety of cytokines,including IL-3, IL-4, GM-CSF. A secondlocus, 11q, is linked to a region that encodes the/H9252chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor. It is known that inher- ited atopy is multigenic and that other loci probably also areinvolved. Indeed, as information from the Human GenomeProject is analyzed, other candidate genes may be revealed.Hypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 363 Sensitized mast cell Memory cell Plasma cellB cell TH cellAllergen CD4 IL-4 Allergen- mechanism underlying a type I hypersensi- tive reaction. Exposure to an allergen activates B cells to form IgE-secreting plasma cells. The secreted IgE molecules bind to IgE-specific Fc receptors on mast cells and blood basophils. (Many mol-ecules of IgE with various specificities can bind to the IgE-Fc recep-tor.) Second exposure to the allergen leads to crosslinking of the bound IgE, triggering the release of pharmacologically active media-tors, vasoactive amines, from mast cells smooth-muscle contraction, increased vascular perme-ability, and vasodilation.Most allergic IgE responses occur on mucous membrane surfaces in response to allergens that enter the body by eitherinhalation or ingestion. Of the common allergens listed inTable 16-1, few have been purified and characterized. Thosethat have include the allergens from rye grass pollen, ragweedpollen, codfish, birch pollen, timothy grass pollen, and beevenom. Each of these allergens has been shown to be a multi-antigenic system that contains a number of allergenic com-ponents. Ragweed pollen, a major allergen in the UnitedStates, is a case in point. It has been reported that a squaremile of ragweed yields 16 tons of pollen in a single season.Indeed, all regions of the United States are plagued by rag-weed pollen as well as pollen from trees indigenous to theregion. The pollen particles are inhaled, and their toughouter wall is dissolved by enzymes in the mucous secretions,releasing the allergenic substances. Chemical fractionation ofragweed has revealed a variety of substances, most of whichare not allergenic but are capable of eliciting an IgM or IgGresponse. Of the five fractions that are allergenic (i.e., able toinduce an IgE response), two evoke allergenic reactions inabout 95% of ragweed-sensitive individuals and are calledmajor allergens; these are designated the E and K fractions.The other three, called Ra3, Ra4, and Ra5, are minor allergensthat induce an allergic response in only 20% to 30% of sensi-tive subjects. Why are some pollens (e.g., ragweed) highly allergenic, whereas other equally abundant nettle) arerarely allergenic? No single physicochemical property seemsto distinguish the highly allergenic E and K fractions of rag-weed from the less allergenic Ra3, Ra4, and Ra5 the nonallergenic fractions. Rather, allergens as a groupappear to possess diverse properties. Some allergens, includ-ing foreign serum and egg albumin, are potent antigens; such as plant pollens, are weak antigens. Although mostallergens are small proteins or protein-bound substances having a molecular weight between 15,000 and 40,000, at-tempts to identify some common chemical property of theseantigens have failed. It appears that allergenicity is a conse-quence of a complex series of interactions involving not onlythe allergen but also the dose, the sensitizing route, some-times an adjuvant, and\u2014most important, as noted above\u2014the genetic constitution of the recipient. REAGINIC ANTIBODY (I GE) As described in Chapter 4, the existence of a human serumfactor that reacts with allergens was first demonstrated by K. Prausnitz and H. Kustner in 1921. The local wheal andflare response that occurs when an allergen is injected into asensitized individual is called the P-K reaction. Because theserum components responsible for the P-K reaction dis-played specificity for allergen, they were assumed to be anti-bodies, but the nature of these P-K antibodies, or reagins, was not demonstrated for many years. Experiments conducted by K. and T. Ishizaka in the mid- 1960s showed that the biological activity of reaginic antibodyin a P-K test could be neutralized by rabbit antiserum againstwhole atopic human sera but not by rabbit antiserum specificfor the four human immunoglobulin classes known at thattime (IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgD) (Table 16-2). In addition, whenrabbits were immunized with sera from ragweed-sensitiveindividuals, the rabbit antiserum could inhibit (neutralize) apositive ragweed P-K test even after precipitation of the rabbitantibodies specific for the human IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgD iso-types. The Ishizakas called this new isotype IgE in reference tothe E antigen of ragweed that they used to characterize it. Serum IgE levels in normal individuals fall within the range of 0.1-0.4 /H9262g/ml; even the most severely allergic indi- viduals rarely have IgE levels greater than 1 /H9262g/ml. These low levels made physiochemical studies of IgE difficult; it was notuntil the discovery of an IgE myeloma by S. G. O. Johanssonand H. Bennich in 1967 that extensive chemical analysis ofIgE could be undertaken. IgE was found to be composed oftwo heavy /H9280and two light chains with a combined molecular weight of 190,000. The higher molecular weight as comparedwith IgG (150,000) is due to the presence of an additionalconstant-region domain (see Figure 4-13). This additionaldomain (C H4) contributes to an altered conformation of the Fc portion of the molecule that enables it to bind to glyco-protein receptors on the surface of basophils and mast cells.Although the half-life of IgE in the serum is only 2-3 days,once IgE has been bound to its receptor on mast cells andbasophils, it is stable in that state for a number of weeks. MAST CELLS AND BASOPHILS The cells that bind IgE were identified by incubating humanleukocytes and tissue cells with either 125I-labeled IgE mye- loma protein or 125I-labeled anti-IgE. In both cases, autoradi- ography revealed that the labeled probe bound with highaffinity to blood basophils and tissue mast cells. Basophils are364 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 16-1Common allergens associated with type I hypersensitivity Proteins Foods Foreign serum NutsVaccines Seafood Eggs Plant pollens Peas, beans Rye grass MilkRagweedTimothy grass Insect productsBirch trees Bee venom Wasp venom Drugs Ant venom Penicillin Cockroach calyxSulfonamides Dust mitesLocal anestheticsSalicylates Mold spores Animal hair and dandergranulocytes that circulate in the blood of most vertebrates; in humans, they account for 0.5%-1.0% of the circulatingwhite blood cells. Their granulated cytoplasm stains withbasic dyes, hence the name basophil. few mitochondria, membrane-boundgranules scattered throughout that containpharmacologically active mediators (see Figure 2-10c). Mast-cell precursors are formed in the bone marrow dur- ing hematopoiesis and are carried to virtually all vascularizedperipheral tissues, where they differentiate into mature cells.Mast cells are found throughout connective tissue, particu-larly near blood and lymphatic vessels. Some tissues, includ-ing the skin and mucous membrane surfaces of the respira-tory and gastrointestinal tracts, contain high concentrationsof mast cells; skin, for example, contains 10,000 mast cells permm 3. Electron micrographs of mast cells reveal numerous membrane-bounded granules distributed throughout thecytoplasm, which, like those in basophils, contain pharmaco-logically active mediators (Figure 16-3). After activation, thesemediators are released from the granules, resulting in the clin-ical manifestations of the type I hypersensitive reaction. Mast cell populations in different anatomic sites differ sig- nificantly in the types and amounts of allergic mediators theycontain and in their sensitivity to activating stimuli andcytokines. Mast cells also secrete a large variety of cytokinesthat affect a broad spectrum of physiologic, immunologic,and pathologic processes (see Table 12-1). IgE-BINDING Fc RECEPTORS The reaginic activity of IgE depends on its ability to bind to a receptor specific for the Fc region of the /H9280heavy chain.

Satir, 1977, J. designated Fc /H9280RI and Fc /H9280RII, which are expressed by different cell types and differ by 1000-fold in their affinity for IgE. HIGH-AFFINITY RECEPTOR (FC /H9280RI) Mast cells and baso- phils express Fc /H9280RI, which binds IgE with a high affinity ( KD = 1-2 /H1100310-9M). The high affinity of this receptor enables it to bind IgE despite the low serum concentration of IgE (1 /H1100310 -7). Between 40,000 and 90,000 Fc /H9280RI molecules have been shown to be present on a human basophil. The Fc /H9280RI receptor contains four polypeptide and two identical disulfide-linked /H9253chains (Figure 16-4a). The external region of the /H9251chain contains two domains of 90 amino acids that are homologous with theimmunoglobulin-fold structure, placing the molecule in theimmunoglobulin superfamily (see Figure 4-19). Fc /H9280RI inter- C H3/C H3 and C H4/C H4 domains of the IgE molecule via the two Ig-like domains of the /H9251chain. The /H9252 chain spans the plasma membrane four times and is thoughtto link the /H9251chain to the /H9253homodimer. The disulfide-linked /H9253chains extend a considerable distance into the cytoplasm. Each /H9253chain has a conserved sequence in its cytosolic do- main known as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activa-tion motif (ITAM). As described earlier, two other mem-brane receptors that have this motif are CD3 and the asso- ciated /H9256chains of the T-cell receptor complex (see Figure 10-10) and the Ig- /H9251/Ig-/H9252chains associated with membrane immunoglobulin on B cells (see Figure 11-7). The ITAMmotif on these three receptors interacts with protein tyrosinekinases to transduce an activating signal to the cell. Allergen-mediated crosslinkage of the bound IgE results in aggrega-tion of the Fc /H9280RI receptors and rapid of Fc /H9280RI in anaphylaxis is confirmed by experiments conducted in mice that lack Fc /H9280RI. These mice have normal levels of mast cells but are resistant to localized and systemicanaphylaxis. LOW-AFFINITY RECEPTOR (FC /H9280RII) The other IgE recep- tor, designated Fc /H9280RII (or CD23), is specific for the C H3/ CH3 domain of IgE and has a lower affinity for IgE (K D= 1 /H1100310-6M) than does Fc /H9280RI (Figure 16-4b). The Fc /H9280RII receptor appears to play a variety of roles in regulating theintensity of the IgE response. Allergen crosslinkage of IgEbound to Fc /H9280RII has been shown to activate B cells, alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils. When this receptor is blockedwith monoclonal antibodies, IgE secretion by B cells isdiminished.

Interest-ingly, atopic individuals have higher levels of CD23 on theirlymphocytes and macrophages and higher levels of individuals. events that mediate degranulation of mastcells and blood basophils have many features in common.For simplicity, this section presents a general overview ofmast-cell degranulation mechanisms without calling atten-tion to the slight differences between mast cells and baso-phils. Although mast-cell degranulation generally is initiatedby allergen crosslinkage of bound IgE, a number of otherstimuli can also initiate the process, including the anaphyla-toxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) and various drugs. This sectionfocuses on the biochemical events that follow allergencrosslinkage of bound IgE. RECEPTOR CROSSLINKAGE IgE-mediated degranulation begins when an allergen cross-links IgE that is bound (fixed) to the Fc receptor on the sur-face of a mast cell or basophil. In itself, the binding of IgE toFc/H9280RI apparently has no effect on a target cell. It is only after allergen crosslinks the fixed IgE-receptor complex that de-granulation proceeds. The importance of crosslinkage is in-dicated by the inability of monovalent allergens, which can-not crosslink the fixed IgE, to trigger degranulation. Experiments have revealed that the essential step in de- granulation is crosslinkage of two or more Fc or without bound IgE. Although crosslinkage isnormally effected by the interaction of fixed IgE with diva-lent or multivalent allergen, it also can be effected by a vari-ety of experimental means that bypass the need for allergenand in some cases even for IgE (Figure 16-5). Intracellular Events Also Regulate Mast-Cell Degranulation the /H9252and Fc resulting in the phosphorylation of tyrosines within theITAMs of the /H9253subunit as well as phosphorylation of resi- dues on the /H9252subunit and on phospholipase C. These phos- phorylation events induce the production of a number ofsecond messengers that mediate the process of degranulation(Figure 16-6). Within 15 s after crosslinkage of Fc /H9280RI, methylation of various membrane phospholipids is observed, resulting in anincrease in membrane fluidity and the formation of Ca 2+ channels. An increase of Ca2+reaches a peak within 2 min of Fc/H9280RI crosslinkage (Figure 16-7). This increase is due both to the uptake of extracellular Ca2+and to a release of Ca2+fromintracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (see Figure 16-6). The Ca2+increase eventually leads to the formation of arachidonic acid, which is converted into two classes ofpotent mediators: prostaglandins and leukotrienes (see Fig- ure 16-6). The increase of Ca 2+also promotes the assembly of microtubules and the contraction of microfilaments, bothof which are necessary for the movement of granules to theplasma membrane. The importance of the Ca 2+increase in mast-cell degranulation is highlighted by the use of drugs,such as disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium), thatblock this influx as a treatment for allergies. Concomitant with phospholipid methylation and Ca 2+in- crease, there is a transient increase in the activity of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, with a rapid peak of its reaction cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), reached Fc /H9280RI (see Figure 16-7).

The consequent swelling of the granules facilitates their fusion with the plasma mem-brane, releasing their contents. The increase in cAMP is tran-sient and is followed by a drop in cAMP to levels below base-line (see Figure 16-7). This drop in cAMP appears to benecessary for degranulation to proceed; when cAMP levels areincreased by certain drugs, the degranulation process isblocked. Several of these drugs are given to treat allergic disor-ders and are considered later in this section.Several Pharmacologic Agents Mediate Type I Reactions The clinical manifestations of type I hypersensitive reactions are related to the biological effects of the mediators releasedduring mast-cell or basophil degranulation. These mediatorsare pharmacologically active agents that act on local tissuesas well as on populations of secondary effector neutrophils, T as an amplifying terminaleffector mechanism, much as the complement system serves368 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms Swollen (PKC), which with Ca2+is necessary for microtubular assembly and the fusion of the granules with the plasma membrane. IP 3is a po- tent mobilizer of (PE). Eventually, PE is methylated to phos-phatidylcholine the phospholipid methyl transferase enzymes Iand II (PMT I and II). ( 4) The accumulation of PC on the exterior sur-face of the plasma membrane causes an increase in membrane fluidity and facilitates the formation of Ca 2+channels. The resulting influx of Ca2+ activates phospholipase A 2, which promotes the breakdown of PC into lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso PC) and arachidonic acid. (5) Arachidonic acid is converted into potent mediators: the leuko- trienes and prostaglandin D 2. (6) Fc/H9280RI crosslinkage also activates the membrane adenylate cyclase, leading to a transient increase of cAMPwithin 15s. A later drop in cAMP levels is mediated by protein kinase and is required for degranulation to proceed. ( 7) cAMP-dependent pro- tein kinases are to phosphorylate the granule-membrane pro-teins, thereby changing the permeability of the granules to water andCa 2+. The consequent swelling of the granules facilitates fusion with the plasma membrane and release of the mediators.as an amplifier and effector of an antigen-antibody interac- tion. When generated in response to parasitic infection, thesemediators initiate beneficial defense processes, includingvasodilation and increased vascular permeability, whichbrings an influx of plasma and inflammatory cells to attackthe pathogen. On the other hand, mediator release inducedby inappropriate antigens, such as allergens, results in unnec-essary increases in vascular permeability and inflammationwhose detrimental effects far outweigh any beneficial effect. The mediators can be classified as either primary or sec- ondary (Table 16-3). The primary mediators are producedbefore degranulation and are stored in the granules. either are synthe-sized after target-cell activation or are released by the break-down of membrane phospholipids during the degranulationprocess. platelet-activatingfactor, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, bradykinins, and variouscytokines. The differing manifestations of type I hypersensi-tivity in different species or different tissues partly reflectvariations in the primary and secondary mediators present.The main biological effects of several of these mediators aredescribed briefly in the next sections. HISTAMINE Histamine, which is formed by decarboxylation of the aminoacid histidine, is a major component of mast-cell granules,accounting for about 10% of granule weight. Because it isstored\u2014preformed\u2014in the granules, its biological effects areobserved within minutes of mast-cell activation. Once re-leased from mast cells, histamine initially binds to specificreceptors on various target cells. Three types of histamine re- ceptors\u2014designated H 1,H 2, and H 3\u2014have been identified; these receptors have different tissue distributions and medi-ate different effects when they bind histamine. Most of the biologic effects of histamine in allergic reac- tions are mediated by the binding of histamine to H 1recep- tors. This binding induces contraction of intestinal and bron-chial smooth muscles, increased permeability of venules, andincreased mucus increases vasopermeability and dilation and stimulates exocrine glands. Binding of hista-mine H cells and basophils suppresses As secondary mediators, the leukotrienes and prostaglandinsare not formed until the mast cell undergoes degranulationand the enzymatic breakdown of phospholipids in theplasma membrane. An ensuing enzymatic generatesthe prostaglandins and the leukotrienes (see Figure 16-6). Ittherefore takes a longer time for the biological effects of thesemediators to become apparent. Their effects are more pro-nounced and longer lasting, however, than those of histamine.The leukotrienes mediate bronchoconstriction, increased vas-cular permeability, and mucus production. Prostaglandin D 2 causes bronchoconstriction. The contraction of human bronchial and tracheal smooth muscles appears at first to be mediated by histamine, but,within 30-60 s, further contraction is mediated by the leuko-trienes and prostaglandins. Being active at nanomole levels,the leukotrienes are as much as 1000 times more potent asHypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 36945Ca uptake, Ca2+ uptake Anti-IgE FabHistamine release 123 5 8 1 0 min[3H] incorporation, cpm \u00d7 10-3/106 FIGURE Kinetics of major bio- chemical events that follow crosslinkageof bound IgE on cultured human ba-sophils with F(ab /H11032) 2fragments of anti- IgE.

In humans, the leukotrienes are thought to con-tribute to the prolonged bronchospasm and buildup of mu-cus seen in asthmatics. CYTOKINES Adding to the complexity of the type I reaction is the varietyof cytokines released from mast cells and eosinophils. Someof these may contribute to the clinical manifestations of typeI hypersensitivity. Human mast cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,and TNF- /H9251These cytokines alter the local microenviron- ment, eventually leading to the recruitment of inflammatorycells such as neutrophils and eosinophils. IL-4 increases IgEproduction by B cells. IL-5 is especially important in therecruitment and activation of eosinophils. The high concen-trations of TNF- /H9251secreted by mast cells may contribute to shock in systemic anaphylaxis. (This effect may parallel therole of TNF- /H9251in bacterial septic shock and toxic-shock syn- drome described in Chapter 12.) Type I Reactions Can Be Systemic or Localized The clinical manifestations of type I reactions can range from life-threatening conditions, such as systemic anaphylaxis andasthma, to hay fever and eczema, which are merely annoying. SYSTEMIC ANAPHYLAXIS Systemic anaphylaxis is a shock-like and often fatal statewhose onset occurs within minutes of a type I hypersensitivereaction. This was the response observed by Portier and Richet in dogs after antigenic challenge. Systemic anaphy-laxis can be induced in a variety of experimental animals andis seen occasionally in humans. Each species exhibits charac-teristic symptoms, which reflect differences in the distribu-tion of mast cells and in the biologically active contents oftheir granules. The animal model of choice for studying sys-temic anaphylaxis has been the guinea pig. Anaphylaxis canbe induced in guinea pigs with ease, and its symptoms closelyparallel those observed in humans. Active sensitization in guinea pigs is induced by a single injection of a foreign protein such as egg albumin. After anincubation period of about 2 weeks, the animal is usuallychallenged with an intravenous injection of the same pro-tein. Within 1 min, the animal becomes restless, its respira-tion becomes labored, and its blood pressure drops. As thesmooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and bladdercontract, the guinea pig defecates and urinates. Finally bron-chiole constriction results in death by asphyxiation within2-4 min of the injection. These events all stem from the sys-temic vasodilation and smooth-muscle contraction broughton by mediators released in the course of the reaction. Post-mortem examination reveals that massive edema, shock, andbronchiole constriction are the major causes of death. Systemic anaphylaxis in humans is characterized by a sim- ilar sequence of events. A wide range of antigens have beenshown to trigger this reaction in susceptible humans, includ-ing the venom from bee, wasp, hornet, and ant stings; drugs,such as penicillin, insulin, and antitoxins; and seafood andnuts. If not treated quickly, these reactions can be fatal. Epi-nephrine is the drug of choice for systemic anaphylactic reac-tions. Epinephrine counteracts the effects of mediators Immune Effector Mechanisms TABLE 16-3 Principal mediators involved in type I Mediator split products SECONDARY Platelet-activating factor Platelet aggregation and degranulation; contraction of pulmonary substance of anaphylaxis, SRS-A) Increased vascular permeability; contraction of pulmonary smooth Table 12-1)as histamine and the leukotrienes by relaxing the smooth muscles and reducing vascular permeability. Epinephrinealso improves cardiac output, which is necessary to preventvascular collapse during an anaphylactic reaction. In addi-tion, epinephrine increases cAMP levels in the mast cell,thereby blocking further degranulation. LOCALIZED ANAPHYLAXIS (ATOPY) In localized anaphylaxis, the reaction is limited to a specifictarget tissue or organ, often involving epithelial surfaces atthe site of allergen entry. The tendency to manifest localizedanaphylactic reactions is inherited and is called atopy. Atopic allergies, which afflict at least 20% of the population in devel-oped countries, include a wide range of IgE-mediated disor-ders, including allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, atopicdermatitis (eczema), and food allergies. ALLERGIC RHINITIS The most common atopic disorder, affecting 10% of the U.S. population, is allergic rhinitis, com-monly known as hay fever. This results from the reaction ofairborne allergens with sensitized mast cells in the conjuncti-vae and nasal mucosa to induce the release of pharmacologi-cally mediators from mast cells; these mediators thencause localized and increased capillary watery exudation of the con-junctivae, nasal mucosa, and upper respiratory tract, as wellas sneezing and coughing. ASTHMA Another common manifestation of localized ana- phylaxis is asthma. In some cases, airborne or blood-borneallergens, such as pollens, dust, fumes, insect products, orviral antigens, trigger an asthmatic attack (allergic asthma);in other cases, an asthmatic attack can be induced by exerciseor cold, apparently independently of allergen stimulation(intrinsic asthma). Like hay fever, asthma is triggered bydegranulation of mast cells with release of mediators, butinstead of occurring in the nasal mucosa, the reaction devel-ops in the lower respiratory tract. The resulting contractionof the bronchial smooth muscles leads to bronchoconstric-tion. secretion, inflammationcontribute to the bronchial constriction and to airway ob-struction. Asthmatic patients may have abnormal levels ofreceptors for neuropeptides. For example, asthmatic patientshave been reported to have increased expression of receptorsfor substance P , a peptide that contracts smooth muscles, anddecreased expression of receptors for vasoactive intestinalpeptide, which relaxes smooth muscles. Most clinicians view asthma as primarily an inflammatory disease. The asthmatic response can be divided into early andlate responses (Figure 16-8). The early response occurs withinminutes of allergen exposure and primarily involves hista-mine, leukotrienes (LTC 4), and prostaglandin (PGD 2). The effects of these mediators lead to bronchoconstriction, vaso-dilation, and some buildup of mucus. The late response oc-curs hours later these mediators is to increase endothelial cell adhesion aswell as to recruit inflammatory cells, including eosinophilsand neutrophils, into the bronchial tissue. The neutrophils and eosinophils are capable of causing significant tissue injury by releasing toxic enzymes, oxygenradicals, and cytokines. These events lead to occlusion of thebronchial lumen with mucus, proteins, and cellular debris;sloughing of the epithelium; thickening of the basementmembrane; fluid buildup (edema); and hypertrophy of thebronchial smooth muscles. A mucus plug often forms andadheres to the bronchial wall. The mucus plug contains clus-ters detached epithelial-cell fragments, eosinophils, spirals of bronchial tissue known as Cursch-mann's spirals. Asthma is increasing in prevalence in theUnited States, particularly among children in inner-city envi-ronments (see Clinical Focus on page 376). FOOD ALLERGIES Various foods also can induce localized anaphylaxis in allergic individuals. Allergen crosslinking ofIgE on mast cells along the upper or lower gastrointestinaltract can induce localized smooth-muscle contraction andvasodilation and thus such symptoms as vomiting or diar-rhea. Mast-cell degranulation along the gut can increase thepermeability of mucous membranes, so that the allergenenters the bloodstream. Various symptoms can ensue, de-pending on where the allergen is deposited. For example,some individuals develop asthmatic attacks after ingestingcertain foods. Others develop atopic urticaria, commonlyknown as hives, when a food allergen is carried to sensitizedmast cells in the skin, causing swollen (edematous) red (ery-thematous) eruptions; this is the wheal and mentioned earlier. ATOPIC DERMATITIS Atopic dermatitis (allergic eczema) is an inflammatory disease of skin that is frequently associatedwith a family history of atopy. The disease is observed mostfrequently in young children, often developing during in-fancy. Serum IgE levels are often elevated. The allergic individ-ual develops skin eruptions that are erythematous and filledwith pus. Unlike a delayed-type hypersensitive reaction, whichinvolves T H1 cells, the skin lesions in atopic dermatitis have TH2 cells and an increased number of eosinophils. Late-Phase Reactions Induce Localized Inflammatory Reactions As a type I hypersensitive reaction begins to subside, media- tors released during the course of the reaction often inducelocalized inflammation called the late-phase reaction. Dis-tinct from the late response seen in asthma, the late-phasereaction begins to develop 4-6 h after the initial type I reac-tion and persists for 1-2 days. The reaction is characterized byinfiltration of neutrophils, lymph-ocytes, and basophils. response be mediated partly by cytokines released from mast cells.Hypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 371372 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms Mast cell Recruitment of inflammatory cells Epithelial injury EosinophilsPGD2LTC4 EARLY RESPONSE (minutes) LATE RESPONSE (hours)Curschmann's spiralsBroncho- constrictionVasodilationHistamine FIGURE 16-8The early and late inflammatory responses in asthma. The immune cells involved in the early and late responses are repre-sented at the top. The effects of various mediators on an airway, repre- sented in cross section, are illustrated in the center.Both TNF- /H9251and IL-1 increase the expression of cell-adhesion cells, thus facilitating that char-acterizes the late-phase a principal role in the late-phase reac- tion, accounting for some 30% of the cells that accumulate.Eosinophil chemotactic factor, released by mast cells duringthe initial reaction, attracts large numbers of eosinophils tothe affected site. Various cytokines released at the site, includ-ing IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, contribute to the growth the eosinophils. Eosinophils express Fc receptors for IgG and IgE isotypes and bind directly to antibody-coated allergen. Much as in mast-cell degranula-tion, binding of antibody-coated antigen activates eosino-phils, leading may play a in parasitic infections. However, in response to allergens,these mediators contribute to extensive tissue damage in thelate-phase reaction. The influx of eosinophils in the late-phase response has been shown to contribute to the chronicinflammation of the bronchial mucosa that characterizespersistent asthma. Neutrophils are another major participant in late-phase reactions, accounting for another 30% of the inflammatorycells. Neutrophils are attracted to the area of a type I reactionby neutrophil chemotactic factor, released from degranulat-ing mast cells. In addition, a variety of cytokines released atthe site, including IL-8, have been shown to activate neu-trophils, resulting in release of their granule contents, includ-ing lytic enzymes, platelet-activating factor, and leukotrienes. Type I Responses Are Regulated by Many Factors As noted earlier, the antigen dose, mode of antigen presenta- tion, and genetic constitution of an animal influence the levelof the IgE response induced by an antigen (i.e., its allergenic-ity). Breeding experiments with mice have shown that thisgenetic variation is not linked to the MHC. A genetic compo-nent also has been shown to influence susceptibility to type Ihypersensitive reactions in humans. If both parents are aller-gic, there is a 50% chance that a child will also be allergic;when only one parent is allergic, there is a 30% chance that achild will manifest some kind of type I reaction. The effect of antigen dosage on the IgE response is illus- trated by immunization of BDF1 mice. Repeated low doses of an appropriate antigen induce a persistent IgE response in these mice, but higher antigen doses result in transient IgE production and a shift toward IgG. The mode of antigenpresentation also influences the development of the IgE re-sponse. For example, immunization of Lewis-strain rats withkeyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) plus aluminum hydrox-ide gel or Bordetella pertussis as an adjuvant induces a strong IgE response, whereas injection of KLH with complete Fre-und's adjuvant produces a largely IgG response. Infection ofmice nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis induces an IgE response. Forexample, Nb-infected mice develop higher levels of IgE spe-cific for an unrelated antigen than do uninfected control mice. The relative levels of the T H1 and T H2 subsets also are key to the regulation of type I hypersensitive responses. T H1 cells reduce the response, whereas T H2 cells enhance it. Cytokines secreted by T H2 cells\u2014namely, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10\u2014 stimulate the type I response in several ways. IL-4 enhancesclass switching to IgE and regulates the clonal expansion ofIgE-committed B cells; IL-3, IL-5 enhance eosinophil matu-ration, activation, accumulation. In contrast, T H1 cells produce IFN- /H9253which inhibits the type I response. The pivotal role of IL-4 in regulation of the type I response was demonstrated in experiments by W. E. Paul and co-workers. When these researchers activated normal, unprimedB cells in vitro with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide(LPS), only 2% of the cells expressed membrane IgG1 andonly 0.05% expressed membrane IgE. However, when un-primed B cells were incubated with LPS plus IL-4, the per-centage of cells expressing IgG1 increased to 40%-50% andthe percentage expressing IgE increased to 15%-25%. In anattempt to determine whether IL-4 plays a role in regulatingIgE production in vivo, Paul primed Nb-infected mice withthe harmless antigen TNP-KLH in the presence and absenceof monoclonal antibody to IL-4. The antibody to IL-4 re-duced the production of IgE specific for TNP-KLH in theseNb-infected mice to 1% of the level in control animals. Further support for the role of IL-4 in the IgE response comes from the experiments of K. Rajewsky and coworkerswith IL-4 knockout mice. These IL-4-deficient mice wereunable to mount an IgE response to helminthic antigens.Furthermore, increased levels of CD4 +TH2 cells and in- creased levels of IL-4 have been detected in atopic allergen-specific CD4 +T cells from added to an autologous culture, theB cells synthesize IgE, whereas allergen-specific CD4 +T cells from nonatopic individuals do not support IgE production. In contrast to IL-4, IFN- /H9253decreases IgE production, sug- gesting that the balance of IL-4 and IFN- /H9253may determine the amount of IgE produced (Figure 16-9). Since IFN- /H9253is se- creted by the T H1 subset and IL-4 by the T H2 subset, the rela- tive activity of these subsets may influence an individual'sresponse to allergens. According to this proposal, atopic andnonatopic individuals would exhibit qualitatively differenttype I responses to an allergen: the response in atopic individ-uals would involve the T H2 subset and result in production of IgE; the response in nonatopic individuals would involve theT H1 subset and result in production of IgM or IgG. T o test this hypothesis, allergen-specific T cells were cloned fromatopic and nonatopic individuals. The cloned T cells from theHypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 373atopic individuals were predominantly of the T H2 phenotype (secreting IL-4), whereas the cloned T cells from nonatopic in-dividuals were predominantly of the T H1 phenotype (secret- ing IFN- /H9253). Needless to say, there is keen interest in down- regulating IL-4 as a possible treatment for allergic individuals. Several Methods Are Used to Detect Type I Hypersensitivity Reactions Type I hypersensitivity is commonly identified and assessed by skin testing. Small amounts of potential allergens areintroduced at specific skin sites either by intradermal injec-tion or by superficial scratching. A number of tests can beapplied to sites on the forearm or back of an individual at onetime. If a person is allergic to the allergen, local mast cellsdegranulate and the release of histamine and other mediatorsproduces a wheal and flare within 30 min (Figure 16-10). Theadvantage of skin testing is that it is relatively inexpensiveand allows screening of a large number of allergens at onetime. The disadvantage of skin testing is that it sometimessensitizes the allergic individual to new allergens and in somerare cases may induce systemic anaphylactic shock. A fewindividuals also manifest a late-phase reaction, which comes4-6 h after testing and sometimes lasts for up to 24 h. Asnoted already, eosinophils accumulate during a late-phasereaction, and release of eosinophil-granule contents con-tributes to the tissue damage in a late-phase reaction site. Another method of assessing type I hypersensitivity is to determine the serum level of total IgE antibody by theradioimmunosorbent test (RIST). This highly sensitive tech-nique, based on the radioimmunoassay, can detect nanomo-lar levels of total IgE. The patient's serum is reacted withagarose beads or paper disks coated with rabbit anti-IgE.After the beads or disks are washed, 125I-labeled rabbit anti- IgE is added. The radioactivity of the beads or disks, mea-sured with a gamma counter, is proportional to the level of IgE in the patient's serum (Figure 16-11a). The similar radioallergosorbent test (RAST) detects the serum level of IgE specific for a given allergen. The allergen iscoupled to beads or disks, the is and374 PART III Immune Effector MechanismsInduced IgE synthesis, ng/ml 5 4 3 2 1 0 IL-4, ng/ml10 5 1234(a) Induced IgE synthesis, ng/ml IFN-, \u00b5/ml200 100 50 40 30 20 10 010 5 1234(b) FIGURE 16-9 Effect of IL- 4and IFN- /H9253on in vitro production of IgE.

In this individual, a weal and flare response devel-oped within a few minutes at the site where grass was injected, indi-cating that the individual is allergic to grass. [From L. M.

The amount of specific IgE bound to the solid-phase allergen is then measured byadding 125I-labeled rabbit anti-IgE, washing the beads, and counting the bound radioactivity (Figure 16-11b). Type I Hypersensitivities Can Be Controlled Medically The obvious first step in controlling type I hypersensitivities is to avoid contact with known allergens. Often the removalof house pets, dust-control measures, or avoidance of offend-ing foods can eliminate a type I response. Elimination of in-halant allergens (such as pollens) is a physical impossibility,however, and other means of intervention must be pursued. Immunotherapy with repeated injections of increasing doses of allergens (hyposensitization) has been known forsome time to reduce the severity of type I reactions, or eveneliminate them completely, in a significant number of indi- viduals suffering from allergic rhinitis. Such repeated intro-duction of allergen by subcutaneous injections appears tocause a shift toward IgG production or to induce T-cell-mediated suppression (possibly by a shift to the T H1 subset and IFN- /H9253production) that turns off the IgE response (Fig- ure 16-12). In this situation, the IgG antibody is referred to asblocking antibody because it competes for the allergen, binds to it, and forms a complex that can be removed by phagocy-tosis; as a result, the allergen is not available to crosslink thefixed IgE on the mast-cell membranes, and allergic symp-toms decrease. Another form of immunotherapy is the use of humanized monoclonal anti-IgE. These antibodies bind to IgE, but only ifIgE is not already bound to Fc /H9280RI; the latter would lead to his- tamine release. In fact, the monoclonal antibodies are specifi-cally selected to bind membrane IgE on IgE-expressing B cells.Hypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 375 +Radiolabeled anti-IgE Count bound labelPatient Anti-IgE coupled to solid phasePaper disk oragarose bead(a) coupled to solid phase boundlabelPatient IgEBound allergen - specific IgE Radiolabeled anti-IgENonspecific IgE is washed away(b) FIGURE 16-11 Procedures for assessing type I hypersensitivity. test can quantify nanogram amounts of serum IgE specific for a particular al lergen.These antibodies are humanized by the genetic engineering of the genes encoding the H and L chains; mouse frameworkregions are replaced with human framework sequences andthe end result is a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal that is not likely to be recognized as foreign by the human immunesystem. When injected into people suffering from allergy, theseantibodies can bind free IgE as well as down-regulate IgE pro-duction in B cells. This results in lower serum IgE concentra-tion which, in turn, reduces the sensitivity of basophils. Thisform of immunotherapy is useful in treating many forms ofallergies, especially crippling food allergies. Another approach for treating allergies stems from the finding that soluble antigens tend to induce a state of anergyby activating T cells in the absence of the necessary co-stimulatory signal (see Figure 10-15). Presumably, a soluble376 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms siveness. Atopic individuals, those with a predisposition to the type I hypersensitiveresponse, are most susceptible to the de-velopment of bronchial hyperresponsive-ness and asthma, but only 10%-30% of atopic individuals actually develop asthma.The evidence that asthma has a geneticcomponent originally was derived fromfamily studies, which estimated that therelative contribution of genetic factors toatopy and asthma is 40%-60%. While ge- netic factors are important, further studieshave indicated that environmental factorsalso play a large role. Additionally, asthmais a complex genetic disease, controlled byseveral genes, so that susceptibility to it islikely to involve the interaction of multiplegenetic and environmental factors. How do we determine which genes contribute to a complex multigenic dis-ease such as this? One approach is thecandi date-gene approach, in which a hypo- thesis suggests that a particular gene or setof genes may have some relation to the dis- ease. After such a gene has been identified,families with apparent predisposition to thedisease are examined for polymorphic alle-les of the gene in question. Comparing fam-ily members who do or do not have thedisease allows correlation between a partic-ular allele and the presence of the disease.The problem with this approach is its biastoward identification of genes already sus-pected to play a role in the disease, whichprecludes identification of new genes. Agood example of the use of the candidate-gene approach is the identification of a re-gion on chromosome 5, region 5q31-33 , that appears to be linked to the develop-ment of asthma. Using a candidate-geneapproach, this region was investigated be-cause it includes a cluster of cytokinegenes, among them the genes that en-code IL- 3, -4, -5, -9, and - 13, as well as the gene that encodes granulocytemacro-phage colony-stimulating factor. IL-4is thought to be a good candidate gene, sinceit induces the Ig class-switch to IgE. Severalgroups of investigators have examined thisregion in different populations and con-cluded that there is a polymorphism associ- Asthma affects almost 5% of the population of the United States.For reasons that are still unclear, the inci-dence of asthma recently has increaseddramatically in developed countries.Even more alarming is that the severity ofthe disease also appears to be increasing.The increase in asthma mortality is high-est among children, and in the UnitedStates the mortality is highest amongAfrican-American children of the innercity. In 1999 , 7.7million children had asthma and more than 2000 of them died of the disease. These statistics areincreasing each year. In addition to itshuman costs, asthma imposes high fi-nancial costs on society. During 2000 , the cost for the treatment of asthma in the United States was more than $ 12billion.

Antihistamines have beenthe most useful drugs for symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Thesedrugs act by binding to the histamine receptors on target cellsand blocking the binding of histamine. The H 1receptors are blocked by the classical antihistamines, and the H 2receptors by a newer class of antihistamines. Several drugs block release of allergic mediators by inter- fering with various prevents Ca 2+influx into mast cells. Theophylline, which is commonly administered to asthmat-ics orally or through inhalers, blocks phosphodiesterase,which catalyzes the breakdown of cAMP to 5 /H11032-AMP . The resulting prolonged increase in cAMP levels blocks degranu-lation. A number of drugs stimulate the /H9252-adrenergic system by stimulating /H9252-adrenergic receptors. As mentioned earlier,Hypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 377 More recently, a large genome-wide screen for loci linked to asthma suscepti-bility was conducted in ethnically diversepopulations that included Caucasians,Hispanics, and African-Americans. Thisstudy, published by a large collaborativegroup from medical centers throughoutthe United States identified many candi-date loci associated with asthma. One lo-cus on chromosome 5coincided with the already identified region at 5q31-33. In- terestingly, however, this locus was associ-ated with asthma in Caucasians but not inHispanics or African-Americans. Similarly,some loci appeared to have a high cor-relation with asthma in Hispanics only,and other loci were identified as unique to African-Americans. Another interestingconclusion was that the association be-tween chromosome 11q and atopy did not appear to be correlated with asthma.This could indicate that asthma and atopyhave different molecular bases. More im-portant, it suggests that genetic linkage toatopy should not be confused with geneticlinkage to asthma. Overall, this studyidentified several genes linked to asthmaand found that the number and relativeimportance of these genes may differ among ethnic groups. This suggests thatgenetic differences as well as differences inenvironment may be the underlying basisof the differences observed in the preva-lence as well as the severity of the diseaseamong ethnic groups in the United States. It is well documented that a higher than average percentage of African-American inner-city children have serious complica-tions with asthma. This has raised the ques-tion whether there is a genetic predis-position for asthma in African-Americans. Recently, however, a report from Rosen-streich and colleagues has indicated an im-portant environmental linkage to asthma inthe inner city. This group assessed the role ofallergies to the cockroach in the develop-ment of asthma; they found that a combina-tion of cockroach allergy and exposure tohigh levels of cockroach allergen can help ex-plain the high frequency of asthma-relatedhealth problems in inner-city children. Thesedata also point to defects in the public-healthsystems in large cities. Clearly, a concertedeffort by public agencies to eradicate insectinfestations would benefit the health ofthose who live in inner-city communities.ated with predisposition to asthma that maps to the promotor region of IL-4. Addi- tionally, two alleles of IL-9associated with atopy have been identified. Another approach to identifying genes associated with a particular disease is arandom genomic search. In this method,the entire genome is scanned for polymor-phisms associated with the disease inquestion. Using the random genomic ap-proach, a British study (Lympany al.,1992 ) linkage between a on chromosome 11\u2014more specifically, region 11q13\u2014associated with atopy in British families. This region mapsto the vicinity of the /H9252subunit of the high- affinity IgE receptor (Fc /H9280RI/H9252). This asso- ciation is exciting, since we know how important IgE is in mediating type I reac-tions. However, some caution in interpret-ing these results is necessary. This studylooked at associations between polymor-phisms and atopy, but most individualswho are atopic do not develop asthma.Therefore this association, while impor-tant in identifying factors in developingatopy, may not be relevant to the develop-ment of asthma.

It acts by binding to/H9252-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscles and mast cells, elevating the cAMP levels within these cells. Theincreased levels of cAMP promote relaxation of the bron-chial muscles and decreased mast-cell degranulation. Anumber of epinephrine analogs have been developed thatbind to selected /H9252-adrenergic receptors and induce cAMP increases with fewer side effects than are seen with epineph-rine. Cortisone and various other anti-inflammatory drugsalso have been used to reduce type I reactions. Antibody-Mediated Cytotoxic (Type II) Hypersensitivity Type II hypersensitive reactions involve antibody-mediated destruction of cells. Antibody can activate the complementsystem, creating pores in the membrane of a foreign cell (seeFigure 13-5), or it can mediate cell destruction by antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). In this pro-cess, cytotoxic receptors bind to the Fc region ofantibodies on target cells and promote killing of the cells (seeFigure 14-12). Antibody bound to a foreign cell also can serveas an opsonin, enabling phagocytic cells with Fc and phagocytose the antibody-coated cell(see Figure 13-12).This section examines three examples of type II hypersen- sitive reactions. Certain autoimmune diseases involve auto-antibody-mediated cellular destruction by type II mecha-nisms. These diseases are described in Chapter 20. Transfusion Reactions Are Type II Reactions A large number of proteins and glycoproteins on the mem-brane of red blood cells are encoded by different genes, eachof which has a number of alternative alleles. An individualpossessing one allelic form of a blood-group antigen can rec-ognize other allelic forms on transfused blood as foreign andmount an antibody response. In some cases, the antibodieshave already been induced by natural exposure to similarantigenic determinants on a variety of microorganisms pre-sent in the normal flora of the gut. This is the case with theABO blood-group antigens (Figure 16-13a). Antibodies to the A, B, and O antigens, called isohemag- glutinins, are usually of the IgM class. An individual withblood type A, for example, recognizes B-like epitopes on in-testinal microorganisms and produces isohemagglutinins tothe This same individual does not respond toA-like epitopes on the same intestinal microorganisms be-cause these A-like epitopes are too similar to self and a state ofself-tolerance to these epitopes should exist (Figure 16-13b).If a type A individual is transfused with blood containing typeB cells, a transfusion reaction occurs in which the anti-B iso- hemagglutinins bind to the B blood cells and mediate their378 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms Galactose (a) N-AcetylglucosamineLipid or protein N-Acetylgalactosamine Anti-A NoneAnti-A and anti -B FIGURE 16-13 ABO blood group.

(b) ABO genotypes and corresponding to other blood-group antigens may blood transfusions because minor allelic differencesin these antigens can stimulate antibody production. Theseantibodies are usually of the IgG class. The clinical manifestations of transfusion reactions result from massive intravascular hemolysis of the transfused redblood cells by antibody plus complement. These manifesta-tions may be either immediate or delayed. Reactions thatbegin immediately are most commonly associated with ABOblood-group incompatibilities, which lead to complement-mediated lysis triggered by the IgM isohemagglutinins.Within hours, free hemoglobin can be detected in the plas-ma; it is filtered through the kidneys, resulting in hemoglo-binuria. Some of the hemoglobin gets converted to bilirubin,which at high levels is toxic. Typical symptoms include fever,chills, nausea, clotting within blood vessels, pain in the lowerback, and hemoglobin in the urine. Treatment involvesprompt termination of the transfusion and maintenance ofurine flow with a diuretic, because the accumulation ofhemoglobin in the kidney can cause acute tubular necrosis. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions generally occur in individuals who have received repeated transfusions ofABO-compatible blood that is incompatible for other blood-group antigens. The reactions develop between 2 and 6 daysafter transfusion, reflecting the secondary nature of thesereactions. The transfused blood induces clonal selection andproduction of IgG a of commonly Rh, Kidd, Kell, and Duffy.The predominant isotype involved in these reactions is IgG,which is less effective than IgM in activating complement.For this reason, complement-mediated lysis of the transfusedred blood cells is incomplete, and many of the transfusedcells are destroyed at extravascular sites by agglutination, op-sonization, and subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages.Symptoms include fever, low hemoglobin, increased biliru-bin, mild jaundice, and anemia. Free hemoglobin is usuallynot detected in the plasma or urine in these reactions becauseRBC destruction occurs in extravascular sites. Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn Is Caused by Type II Reactions Hemolytic disease of the newborn develops when maternal IgG antibodies specific for fetal blood-group antigens crossthe placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells. The conse-quences of such transfer can be minor, serious, or lethal.Severe hemolytic disease of the newborn, called erythroblas- tosis fetalis, most commonly develops when an Rh +fetus ex- presses an Rh antigen on its blood cells that the Rh-mother does not express. During pregnancy, fetal red blood cells are separated from the mother's circulation by a layer of cells in the placentacalled the trophoblast. During her first pregnancy with anRh +fetus, an Rh-woman is usually not exposed to enough fetal red blood cells to activate her Rh-specific B cells. At thetime of delivery, however, separation of the placenta from the uterine wall allows larger amounts of fetal umbilical-cordblood to enter the mother's circulation. These fetal red bloodcells activate Rh-specific B cells, resulting in production ofRh-specific plasma cells and memory B cells in the mother.The secreted IgM antibody clears the Rh +fetal red cells from the mother's circulation, but the memory cells remain, athreat to any subsequent pregnancy with an Rh +fetus. Acti- vation of these memory cells in a subsequent pregnancyresults in the formation of IgG anti-Rh antibodies, whichcross the placenta and damage the fetal red blood cells (Fig-ure 16-14). Mild to severe anemia can develop in the fetus,sometimes with fatal consequences. In addition, conversionof hemoglobin to bilirubin can present an additional threatto the newborn because the lipid-soluble bilirubin may accu-mulate in the brain and cause brain damage. Hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by Rh incom- patibility in a subsequent pregnancy can be almost entirelyprevented by administering antibodies against the Rh anti-gen to the mother within 24-48 h after the first delivery.These antibodies, called Rhogam, bind to any fetal red blood cells that enter the mother's circulation at the time of deliveryand facilitate their clearance before B-cell activation andensuing memory-cell production can take place. In a subse-quent pregnancy with an Rh +fetus, a mother who has been treated with Rhogam is unlikely to produce IgG anti-Rh anti-bodies; thus, the fetus is protected from the damage thatwould occur when these antibodies crossed the placenta. The development of hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by Rh incompatibility can be detected by testing ma-ternal serum at intervals during pregnancy for antibodies to theRh antigen. A rise in the titer of these antibodies as pregnancyprogresses indicates that the mother has been exposed to Rhantigens and is producing increasing amounts of antibody. Thepresence of maternal IgG on the surface of fetal red blood cellscan be detected by a Coombs test. Isolated fetal red blood cellsare incubated with the Coombs reagent, goat antibody tohuman IgG antibody. If maternal IgG is bound to the fetal redblood cells, the cells agglutinate with the Coombs reagent. If hemolytic disease caused by Rh incompatibility is de- tected during pregnancy, the treatment depends on theseverity of the reaction. For a severe reaction, the fetus can begiven an intrauterine blood-exchange transfusion to replacefetal Rh +red blood cells with Rh-cells. These transfusions are given every 10-21 days until delivery. In less severe cases,a blood-exchange transfusion is not given until after birth,primarily to remove bilirubin; the infant is also exposed tolow levels of UV light to break down the bilirubin and pre-vent cerebral damage. The mother can also be treated duringthe pregnancy by plasmapheresis. In this procedure, a cell- separation machine is used to separate the mother's bloodinto two fractions, cells and plasma. The plasma containingthe anti-Rh antibody is discarded, and the cells are reinfusedinto the mother in an albumin or fresh-plasma solution. The majority of cases (65%) of hemolytic disease of the newborn have minor consequences and are caused by ABOHypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 379blood-group incompatibility between the mother and fetus. Type A or B fetuses carried by type O mothers most com-monly develop these reactions. A type O mother is mostlikely to develop IgG antibody to the A or B blood-groupantigens either through natural exposure or through expo-sure to fetal blood-group A or B antigens in successive preg-nancies. Usually the fetal anemia resulting from this incom-patibility is mild; the major clinical manifestation is a slightelevation of bilirubin, with jaundice. Depending on the sever-ity of the anemia and jaundice, a blood-exchange transfusionmay be required in these infants. In general the reaction ismild, however, and exposure of the infant to low levels of UVlight is enough to break down the bilirubin and avoid cere-bral damage. Drug-Induced Hemolytic Anemia Is a Type II Response Certain antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporin, and strep- tomycin) can adsorb nonspecifically to proteins on RBCmembranes, forming a complex similar to a hapten-carriercomplex. In some patients, such drug-protein complexesinduce formation of antibodies, which then bind to theadsorbed drug on red blood cells, inducing complement- mediated lysis and thus progressive anemia. When the drug iswithdrawn, the hemolytic anemia disappears. Penicillin isnotable in that it can induce all four types of hypersensitivitywith various clinical manifestations (Table 16-5).380 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms B cellDEVELOPMENT OF ERYTHROBLASTOSIS (WITHOUT RHOGAM) circulation RBCs with Rhantigen 1st Pregnancy 2nd PregnancyDeliveryMother Mother (treated with Rhogam) Rh-specific B cell Memory cell Memory cellPlasma 16-14 Development of erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) caused when an Rh-mother carries an Rh+fetus ( left), and effect of treatment with anti-Rh antibody, or Rhogam (right). TABLE 16-5Penicillin-induced hypersensitive reactions Antibody or Type of lymphocytes Clinical reaction induced manifestations I IgE Urticaria, systemic IgM, Complex-Mediated (Type III) Hypersensitivity The reaction of antibody with antigen generates immune complexes. Generally this complexing of antigen with anti-body facilitates the clearance of antigen by phagocytic cells.In some cases, however, large amounts of immune complexescan lead to tissue-damaging type III hypersensitive reactions.The magnitude of the reaction depends on the quantity ofimmune complexes as well as their distribution within thebody. When the complexes are deposited in tissue very nearthe site of antigen entry, a localized reaction develops. Whenthe complexes are formed in the blood, a reaction can de-velop wherever the complexes are deposited. In particular,complex deposition is frequently observed on blood-vesselwalls, in the synovial membrane of joints, on the glomerularbasement membrane of the kidney, and on the choroidplexus of the brain. The deposition of these complexes initi-ates a reaction that results in the recruitment of neutrophilsto the site. The tissue there is injured as a consequence ofgranular release from the neutrophil. Type III hypersensitive reactions develop when immune complexes activate the complement system's array of im-mune effector molecules (see Figure 13-2). As explained inChapter 13, C3a, C4a, and C5a split prod-ucts are anaphylatoxins that cause localized mast-cell and in C5b67 are also can accumulate in large numbers atthe site of immune-complex deposition. Larger immune com-plexes are deposited on the basement membrane of blood-vessel walls or kidney glomeruli, whereas smaller complexesmay pass through the basement membrane and be depositedin the subepithelium. The type of lesion that results dependson the site of deposition of the complexes. Much of the tissue damage in type III reactions stems from release of lytic enzymes by neutrophils as they attemptto phagocytose immune complexes. The C3b complementcomponent acts as an opsonin, coating immune complexes.A neutrophil binds to a C3b-coated immune complex bymeans of the type I complement receptor, which is specificfor C3b. Because the complex is deposited on the basement-membrane surface, phagocytosis is impeded, so that lyticenzymes are released during the unsuccessful attempts of theneutrophil to ingest the adhering immune complex. Furtheractivation of the membrane-attack mechanism of the com-plement system can also contribute to the destruction of tis-sue. In addition, the activation of complement can induceaggregation of platelets, and the resulting release of clottingfactors can lead to formation of microthrombi. Type III Reactions Can Be Localized Injection of an antigen intradermally or subcutaneously intoan animal that has high levels of circulating antibody specificfor that antigen leads to formation of localized immunecomplexes, which mediate an acute Arthus reaction within 4-8 h (Figure 16-15). Microscopic examination of the tissuereveals neutrophils adhering to the vascular endotheliumand then migrating into the tissues at the site of immune-complex deposition. As the reaction develops, localized tissueand vascular damage results in an accumulation of fluid(edema) and red blood cells (erythema) at the site. The sever-ity of the reaction can vary from mild swelling and redness totissue necrosis. After an insect bite, a sensitive individual may have a rapid, localized type I reaction at the site. Often, some 4-8 h later, atypical Arthus reaction also develops at the site, with pro-nounced erythema and edema. a localized Arthus reaction (type III hypersensitive reaction). Complement activation initiated by immunecomplexes (classical pathway) produces complement intermediatesthat ( 1) ( 2) of lytic enzymes from neu- trophils trying to phagocytose C 3b-coated immune complexes.reactions induced by bacterial spores, fungi, or dried fecal pro- teins can also cause pneumonitis or alveolitis. These reactionsare known by a variety of common names reflecting the sourceof the antigen. For example, \"farmer's lung\" from of aserum protein in dust derived from dried pigeon feces. Type III Reactions Can Also Be Generalized When large amounts of antigen enter the bloodstream andbind to antibody, circulating immune complexes can form. Ifantigen is in excess, small complexes form; because these arenot easily cleared by the phagocytic cells, they can cause tis-sue-damaging type III reactions at various sites. Historically,generalized type III reactions were often observed after theadministration of antitoxins containing foreign serum, suchas horse antitetanus or antidiphtheria serum. In such cases,the recipient of a foreign antiserum develops antibodies spe-cific for the foreign serum proteins; these antibodies thenform circulating immune complexes with the foreign serumantigens. Typically, within days or weeks after exposure toforeign serum antigens, an individual begins to manifest acombination of symptoms that are called serum sickness (Figure 16-16). These symptoms include fever, weakness,generalized vasculitis (rashes) with edema and erythema,lymphadenopathy, arthritis, and sometimes glomerulone-phritis. The precise manifestations of serum sickness dependon the quantity of immune complexes formed as well as theoverall size of the complexes, which determine the site oftheir deposition. As mentioned above, the sites of depositionvary but, in general, complexes accumulate in tissues wherefiltration of plasma occurs. This explains the high incidenceof glomerulonephritis (complex deposition in the kidney)and vasculitis (deposition in the arteries) and arthritis (de-position in the synovial joints) caused by serum sickness. Formation of circulating immune complexes contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of conditions other thanserum sickness. These include the Diseases Systemic DiseasesPoststreptococcal glomerulonephritisMeningitisHepatitisMononucleosisMalariaTrypanosomiasisComplexes of antibody with various bacterial, viral, and par- asitic antigens have been shown to induce a variety of type IIIhypersensitive reactions, including skin rashes, arthritic symp-toms, and glomerulonephritis. Poststreptococcal glomeru-lonephritis, for example, develops circulating com-plexes of antibody and streptococcal antigens are depositedin the kidney and damage the glomeruli. A number of auto-immune diseases stem from circulating complexes of anti-body with self-proteins, with glycoproteins, or even withDNA. In systemic of DNAand anti-DNA antibodies accumulate in synovial mem-branes, causing arthritic symptoms, or accumulate on thebasement membrane of the kidney, causing progressive kid-ney damage. Type IV or Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) When some subpopulations of activated T Hcells encounter certain types of antigens, they secrete cytokines that induce alocalized inflammatory reaction called delayed-type hyper-sensitivity (DTH). The reaction is characterized by large in-fluxes of nonspecific inflammatory cells, in particular, macro-phages. This type of reaction was first described in 1890 by382 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms 0 Time after BSA injection, days20Free AbSerum levels Free Ag Immune complexesSymptoms of serum sickness 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 FIGURE 16-16 Correlation between formation of immune com- plexes and development of symptoms of serum sickness. A large doseof antigen (BSA) was injected into a rabbit at day 0. As antibody formed, it complexed with the antigen and was deposited in the kid-neys, joints, and capillaries. The symptoms of serum sickness (lightblue area) corresponded to the peak in immune-complex formation. Asthe immune complexes were cleared, free circulating antibody (dashedblack curve) was detected and the symptoms of serum sickness sub-sided. [Based on F. G. Germuth, Jr., 1953,J. Exp. Med. 97:257.]Robert Koch, who observed that individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis developed a localized inflamma- tory response when injected intradermally with a filtratederived from a mycobacterial culture. He called this localizedskin reaction a \"tuberculin reaction.\" Later, as it became ap-parent that a variety of other antigens could induce thisresponse (Table 16-6), its name was changed to delayed-typeor type IV hypersensitivity in reference to the delayed onsetof the reaction and to the tissue damage (hypersensitivity)that is often associated with it. The term hypersensitivity is somewhat misleading, for it suggests that a DTH response isalways detrimental. Although in some cases a DTH responsedoes cause extensive tissue damage and is in itself pathologic,in many cases tissue damage is limited, and the responseplays an important role in defense against intracellular patho-gens and contact antigens. The hallmarks of a type IV reac-tion are the delay in time required for the reaction to developand the recruitment of macrophages as opposed to neu-trophils, as found in a type III reaction. Macrophages are themajor component of the infiltrate that surrounds the site ofinflammation. There Are Several Phases of the DTH Response The development of the DTH response begins with an initial sensitization phase of 1-2 weeks after primary contact withan antigen. During this period, T Hcells are activated and clonally expanded by antigen presented together with therequisite class II MHC molecule on an appropriate antigen-presenting cell (Figure 16-17a). A variety of antigen-presentingcells have been shown to be involved in the activation of aDTH response, including Langerhans cells and macrophages.Langerhans cells are dendritic cells found in the epidermis.These cells are thought to pick up antigen that enters throughthe skin and transport it to regional lymph nodes, where T cells are activated by the antigen. In some species, including humans, the vascular endothelial cells express class II MHCmolecules and also function as antigen-presenting cells in thedevelopment of the DTH response. Generally, the T cells ac-tivated during the sensitization phase are CD4 +,p r i m a r i l y o f the T H1 subtype, but in a few cases CD8+cells have also been shown to induce a DTH response. The activated T cells pre-viously were called T DTH cells to denote their function in the DTH response, although in reality they are simply a subset ofactivated T H1 cells (or, in some cases, T Ccells). A subsequent exposure to the antigen induces the effector phase of the DTH response (see Figure 16-17b). In the effec-tor phase, T H1 cells secrete a variety of cytokines that recruit and activate macrophages and other nonspecific inflamma-tory cells. A DTH response normally does not become appar-ent until an average of 24 h after the second contact with theantigen; the response generally peaks 48-72 h after secondcontact. The delayed onset of this response reflects the timerequired for the cytokines to induce localized influxes ofmacrophages and their activation. Once a DTH response be-gins, a complex interplay of nonspecific cells and mediatorsis set in motion that can result in tremendous amplification.By the time the DTH response is fully developed, only about5% of the participating cells are antigen-specific T H1 cells; the remainder are macrophages and other nonspecific cells. Macrophages are the principal effector cells of the DTH response. Cytokines elaborated by T H1 cells induce blood monocytes to adhere to vascular endothelial cells and mi-grate from the blood into the surrounding tissues. Duringthis process the monocytes differentiate into activated macro-phages. As Chapter 2 described, activated macrophages ex-hibit increased levels of phagocytosis and an increased abilityto kill microorganisms through various cytotoxic mediators.In addition, activated macrophages express increased levelsof class II MHC molecules and cell-adhesion molecules andtherefore function more effectively as antigen-presentingcells. The influx and activation of macrophages in the DTH re- sponse is important in host defense against parasites andbacteria that live within cells, where circulating antibodiescannot reach them. The heightened phagocytic activity andthe buildup of lytic enzymes from macrophages in the area ofinfection lead to nonspecific destruction of cells, and thus ofthe intracellular pathogen. Generally, the pathogen is clearedrapidly with little tissue damage. However, in some cases,especially if the antigen is not easily cleared, a prolongedDTH response can itself become destructive to the host as theintense inflammatory response develops into a visible granu-lomatous reaction. A granuloma develops when continuousactivation of macrophages induces the macrophages to ad-here closely to one another, assuming an epithelioid shapeand sometimes fusing to form multinucleated giant cells(Figure 16-18). These giant cells displace the normal tissuecells, forming palpable nodules, and release high concentra-tions of lytic enzymes, which destroy surrounding tissue. Inthese cases, the response can damage blood vessels and leadHypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 383 TABLE 16-6Intracellular pathogens and contact antigens that induce sp.to extensive tissue necrosis. The response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis illustrates the double-edged nature of the DTH response. Immunity to this intracellular bacterium involves aDTH response in which activated macrophages wall off theorganism in the lung and contain it within a granuloma-typelesion called a tubercle. Often, however, the concentrated re-lease of lytic enzymes from the activated macrophages withintubercles damages lung tissue. Some examples of truly hyper-sensitive conditions, in which tissue damage far outweighsany beneficial effects, are described in Chapter 17.Numerous Cytokines Participate in the DTH Reaction Among the cytokines produced by T H1 cells are a number that attract and activate macrophages to the site of infection.IL-3 and GM-CSF inducing a number of changes that facilitateextravasation of monocytes and other nonspecific inflam-384 PART III Immune Effector Mechanisms VISUALIZING CONCEPTS (a) Sensitization phase (b) Effector phase Resting macrophageMembrane TNF-Secreted macrophage receptor Activated macrophage FIGURE 16-17 Overview of the DTH response. (a) In the sensiti- zation phase after initial contact with antigen (e.g., peptides derivedfrom intracellular bacteria), T Hcells proliferate and differentiate into TH1cells. Cytokines secreted by these T cells are indicated by the dark blue balls. (b) In the effector phase after subsequent exposure of sen-sitized T H1cells to antigen, the T H1cells secrete a variety of cytokines and chemokines. These factors attract and activate macrophages andother nonspecific inflammatory cells. Activated macrophages aremore effective in presenting antigen, thus perpetuating the DTH re-sponse, and function as the primary effector cells in this reaction. matory cells. Circulating neutrophils and monocytes adhere to the adhesion molecules displayed on the vascular endothe-lial cells and extravasate into the tissue spaces. Neutrophilsappear early in the reaction, peaking by about 6 h and thendeclining in numbers. The monocyte infiltration occurs be-tween 24 and 48 h after antigen exposure. As the monocytes enter the tissues to become macro- phages, they are chemotactically drawn to the site of theDTH response by chemokines such as monocyte chemotac-tic and calledmigration-inhibition factor (MIF) inhibits macrophages frommigrating beyond the site of a DTH reaction. As macro-phages accumulate at the site of a DTH reaction, they areactivated by cytokines, particularly IFN- /H9253and membrane- bound T H1 cells. As noted earlier, macrophages become more effective as antigen-presentingcells upon activation. Thus, the activated macrophages canefficiently mediate activation of more T cells, which in turnsecrete more cytokines that recruit and activate even moremacrophages. This self-perpetuating response, however, is adouble-edged sword, with a fine line existing between a ben-eficial, protective response and a detrimental response char-acterized by extensive tissue damage. A report of experiments with knockout mice that could not produce IFN- /H9253demonstrated the importance of this cytokine in the DTH response. When these knockout micewere infected with an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis known as BCG (Bacille Calmette Gu\u00e9rin), nearly all the animals died within 60 days, whereas wild-type mice sur-vived (Figure 16-19). Macrophages from the IFN- /H9253knockout mice were shown to have reduced levels of class II MHC mol-ecules and of bactericidal metabolites such as nitric oxideand superoxide anion.The DTH Reaction Is Detected with a Skin Test The presence of a DTH reaction can be measured experi- mentally by injecting antigen intradermally into an animaland observing whether a characteristic skin lesion developsat the injection site. A positive skin-test reaction indicatesthat the individual has a population of sensitized T H1 cells specific for the test antigen. For example, to determinewhether an individual has been exposed to M. tuberculosis, PPD, a protein derived from the cell wall of this mycobac-terium, is injected intradermally. Development of a red,slightly swollen, firm lesion at the site between 48 and 72 hlater indicates previous exposure. The skin lesion resultsfrom intense infiltration of cells to the site of injection duringa DTH reaction; 80%-90% of these cells are macrophages.Note, however, that a positive test does not allow one to conclude whether the exposure was to a pathogenic form ofM. tuberculosis or to a vaccine form received through immu- nization, which is performed in some parts of the world. Contact Dermatitis Is a Type of DTH Response Many contact-dermatitis reactions, including the responses to formaldehyde, trinitrophenol, nickel, turpentine, and activeagents in various cosmetics and hair dyes, poison oak, and poi-son ivy, are mediated by T H1 cells. Most of these substances are small molecules that can complex with skin proteins.Hypersensitive Reactions CHAPTER 16 385 Intracellular bacteriaActivated macrophageEpithelioid cellMultinucleated giant cellTH1 cell FIGURE 16-18 A prolonged DTH response can lead to formation of a granuloma, a nodule-like mass.

Dalton et al., 1993, Science 259: 1739.]This complex is internalized by antigen-presenting cells in the skin (e.g., Langerhans cells), then processed and pre-sented together with class II MHC molecules, causing activa-tion of sensitized T H1 cells. In the reaction to poison oak, for example, a pentadecacatechol compound from the leaves ofthe plant forms a complex with skin proteins. When T Hcells react with this compound appropriately displayed by localantigen-presenting cells, they differentiate into sensitizedT H1 cells. A subsequent exposure to pentadecacatechol will elicit activation of T H1 cells and induce cytokine production (Figure 16-20). Approximately 48-72 h after the secondexposure, the secreted cytokines cause macrophages to accu-mulate at the site. Activation of these macrophages andrelease of lytic enzymes result in the redness and pustulesthat characterize a reaction to poison oak. SUMMARY IHypersensitive reactions are inflammatory reactions with-in the humoral or cell-mediated branches of the immunesystem that lead to extensive tissue damage or even death.The four types of hypersensitive reaction generate charac-teristic effector molecules and clinical manifestations. IA type I hypersensitive reaction is mediated by IgE anti-bodies, whose Fc region binds to receptors on mast cells orblood basophils. Crosslinkage of the fixed IgE by allergenleads to mast cell or basophil degranulation with release ofpharmacologically active mediators. The principal effectsof these mediators are smooth-muscle contraction andvasodilation. Clinical manifestations of type I reactions in-clude potentially life-threatening systemic anaphylaxis andlocalized responses such as hay fever and asthma. IA type II hypersensitive reaction occurs when antibody re-acts with antigenic determinants present on the surface ofcells, leading to cell damage or death through complement-mediated lysis antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyto-toxicity (ADCC). Transfusion reactions and hemolytic dis-ease of the newborn are type II reactions. IA type III hypersensitive reaction is mediated by the for-mation of immune complexes and the ensuing activationof complement. Complement split products serve as im-mune effector molecules that elicit localized vasodilationand chemotactically attract neutrophils. Deposition of im-mune complexes near the site of antigen entry can inducean Arthus reaction, in which lytic enzymes released by theaccumulated neutrophils and the complement membrane-attack complex cause localized tissue damage. IA type IV hypersensitive reaction involves the cell-mediatedbranch of the immune system. Antigen activation of sensi-tized T H1 cells induces release of various cytokines that cause macrophages to accumulate and become activated.The net effect of the activation of macrophages is to releaselytic enzymes that cause localized tissue damage.References Ansari, A.

One of the first and most important features of host innateimmunity is the barrier provided by the epithelial surfaces ofthe skin and the lining of the gut. The difficulty of penetrat-ing these epithelial barriers ensures that most pathogensnever gain productive entry into the host. In addition to pro-viding a physical barrier to infection, the epithelia also pro-duce chemicals that are useful in preventing infection. Thesecretion of gastric enzymes by specialized epithelial cellslowers the pH of the stomach and upper gastrointestinaltract, and other specialized cells in the gut produce antibac-terial peptides. A major feature of innate immunity is the presence of the normal gut flora, which can competitively inhibit the bind-ing of pathogens to gut epithelial cells. Innate responses canalso block the establishment of infection. For example, thecell walls of some gram-positive bacteria contain a peptido-glycan that activates the alternative complement pathway,resulting in the generation of C3b, which opsonizes bacteriaand enhances phagocytosis (see Chapter 13). Some bacteriaproduce endotoxins such as LPS, which stimulate the pro-duction of such as TNF- /H9251, Phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophagesand other phagocytic cells is another highly effective line ofinnate defense. However, some types of bacteria that com-monly grow intracellularly have developed mechanisms thatallow them to resist degradation within the phagocyte. Viruses are well known for the stimulation of innate responses. In particular, many viruses induce the productionof interferons, which can inhibit viral replication by induc-ing an antiviral response. Viruses are also controlled by NKcells. As described in Chapter 14, NK cells frequently formthe first line of defense against viral infections. Generally, pathogens use a variety of strategies to escape destruction by the adaptive immune system. Many patho-gens reduce their own antigenicity either by growing withinhost cells, where they are sequestered from immune attack,or by shedding their membrane antigens. Other pathogenscamouflage themselves by mimicking the surfaces of hostcells, either by expressing molecules with amino acid se-quences similar to those of host cell-membrane molecules orby acquiring a covering of host membrane molecules. Somepathogens are able to suppress the immune response selec-tively or to regulate it so that a branch of the immune system is activated that is ineffective against the pathogen. Contin-ual variation in surface antigens is another strategy thatenables a pathogen to elude the immune system. This anti-genic variation may be due to the gradual accumulation ofmutations, or it may involve an abrupt change in surfaceantigens. Both innate and adaptive immune responses to patho- gens provide critical defense, but infectious diseases, whichhave plagued human populations throughout history, stillcause the death of millions each year. Although widespreaduse of vaccines and drug therapy has drastically reducedmortality from infectious diseases in developed countries,such diseases continue to be the leading cause of death in theThird World. It is estimated that over 1 billion people areinfected worldwide, resulting in more than 11 million deathsevery year (Figure 17-1). Despite these alarming numbers,estimated expenditures for research on infectious diseasesprevalent in the Third World are less than 5% of total health-research expenditures worldwide. Not only is this a tragedyfor these countries, but some of these diseases are begin-ning to emerge or re-emerge in developed countries. For chapter 17example, some United States troops returned from the Per- sian Gulf with leishmaniasis; cholera cases have recentlyincreased worldwide, with more than 100,000 cases reportedin KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, during the summer of 2001;and a new drug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculo- sis is spreading at an alarming rate in the United States. In this chapter, the concepts described in earlier chapters, antigenicity (Chapter 3) and immune effector mechanisms(Chapters 12-16), as well as vaccine development (which willbe considered in Chapter 18) are applied to selected infec-tious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, andhelminths\u2014the four main types of pathogens. Viral Infections A number of specific immune effector mechanisms, togetherwith nonspecific defense mechanisms, are called into play toeliminate an infecting virus (Table 17-1). At the same time,the virus acts to subvert one or more of these mechanisms toprolong its own survival. The outcome of the infection de-pends on how effectively the host's defensive mechanismsresist the offensive tactics of the virus. The innate immune response to viral infection is primar- ily through the induction of type I interferons (IFN- /H9251and IFN- /H9252) and the activation of NK cells. Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced during the viral life cycle can induce theexpression of IFN- /H9251and also are capable of syn-thesizing these cytokines, but the mechanisms that inducethe production of type I interferons in these cells are notcompletely understood. IFN- /H9251and IFN- /H9252can induce an antiviral response or resistance to viral replication by bind-ing to the IFN /H9251//H9252receptor. Once bound, IFN- /H9251and IFN- activate the JAK-STAT pathway, which in turn induces thetranscription of several genes. One of these genes encodes an390 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseDeaths in millions4.0 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 Acute respiratory infections (including pneumonia and influenza)AIDS Malaria Measles TB Diarrheal diseases3.5 2.3Over age five 1.1 0.91.52.2Under age five FIGURE 17-1 Leading infectious disease killers.

Other genes activated by IFN- /H9251//H9252bind- ing to its receptor also contribute to the inhibition of viralreplication. For example, IFN- /H9251//H9252binding induces kinase called dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR),which inactivates protein synthesis, thus blocking viral repli-cation in infected cells (Figure 17-2). The binding of IFN- /H9251and IFN- /H9252to NK cells induces lytic activity, making them very effective in killing virally infectedcells. The activity of NK cells is also greatly enhanced by IL-12, a cytokine that is produced very early in a response toviral infection. Many Viruses are Neutralized by Antibodies Antibodies specific for viral surface antigens are often crucialin containing the spread of a virus during acute infection andin protecting against reinfection. Antibodies are particularlyeffective in protecting against infection if they are localized atthe site of viral entry into the body. Most viruses express sur-face receptor molecules that enable them to initiate infection by binding to specific host-cell membrane molecules. Forexample, influenza virus binds to sialic acid in adhesion molecules (ICAMs); and Epstein-Barrvirus binds to type 2 complement receptors on B cells. If anti-body to the viral receptor is produced, it can block infectionaltogether by preventing the binding of viral particles to hostcells. Secretory IgA in mucous secretions plays an importantrole in host defense against viruses by blocking viral attach-ment to mucosal epithelial cells. The advantage of the atten-uated oral polio vaccine, considered in Chapter 18, is that itinduces production of secretory IgA, which effectively blocksattachment of poliovirus along the gastrointestinal tract. Viral neutralization by antibody sometimes involves mechanisms that operate after viral attachment to host cells.In some cases, antibodies may block viral penetration bybinding to epitopes that are necessary to mediate fusion ofthe viral envelope with the plasma membrane. If the inducedantibody is of a complement-activating isotype, lysis of en-veloped virions can ensue. Antibody or complement can alsoagglutinate viral particles and function as an opsonizingagent to facilitate Fc- or C3b-receptor-mediated phagocyto-sis of the viral particles. Cell-Mediated Immunity is Important for Viral Control and Clearance Although antibodies have an important role in containing the spread of a virus in the acute phases of infection, they arenot usually able to eliminate the virus once infection hasoccurred\u2014particularly if the virus is capable of entering alatent state in which its DNA is integrated into host chromo-somal DNA. Once an infection is established, cell-mediatedimmune mechanisms are most important in host defense. Ingeneral, CD8 +TCcells and CD4+TH1 cells are the main com- of cell-mediated antiviral defense, although in somecases CD4 +TCcells have also been implicated. Activated T H1 produce a number of cytokines, including IL-2, IFN- /H9253, and TNF, against viruses either directly or indi-rectly. IFN- /H9253acts directly by inducing an antiviral state in cells. IL-2 acts indirectly by assisting in the recruitment ofCTL precursors into an effector population. Both IL-2 andIFN- /H9253activate NK cells, which play an important role in host defense during the first days of many viral infections until aspecific CTL response develops. In most viral infections, specific CTL activity arises within 3-4 days after infection, peaks by 7-10 days, and then de-clines. Within 7-10 days of primary infection, most virionshave been eliminated, paralleling the development of CTLs.CTLs specific for the virus eliminate virus-infected self-cellsand thus eliminate potential sources of new virus. The role ofCTLs in defense against viruses is demonstrated by the abil-ity of virus-specific CTLs to confer protection for the specificvirus on nonimmune recipients by adoptive transfer. Theviral specificity of the CTL as well can be demonstrated withImmune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 Induction of antiviral activity by IFN- /H9251and - /H9252. These interferons bind to the IFN receptor, which in turn induces the syn-thesis of both 2-5(A) synthetase and protein kinase (PKR). The action of of 2-5(A) synthetase results in the activation of RNAse L, which can degrade mRNA. PKR inactivates the translation initiation factoreIF-2by phosphorylating it. Both pathways thus result in the inhibi- tion of protein synthesis and thereby effectively block viral replication.adoptive transfer: adoptive transfer of a CTL clone specific for influenza virus strain X protects mice against influenzavirus X but not against influenza virus strain Y. Viruses Can Evade Host Defense Mechanisms Despite their restricted genome size, a number of viruses have been found to encode proteins that interfere at variouslevels with specific or nonspecific host defenses. Presumably,the advantage of such proteins is that they enable viruses toreplicate more effectively amidst host antiviral defenses. Asdescribed above, the induction of IFN- /H9251and IFN- /H9252is a major innate defense against viral infection, but some viruseshave developed strategies to evade the action of IFN- /H9251//H9252. These include hepatitis C virus, which has been shown toovercome the antiviral effect of the interferons by blocking orinhibiting the action of PKR (see Figure 17-2). Another mechanism for evading host responses, utilized in particular by herpes simplex viruses (HSV) is inhibition of antigen presentation by infected host cells. HSV-1 andHSV-2 both express an immediate-early protein (a proteinsynthesized shortly after viral replication) called ICP47,which very effectively inhibits the human transporter mole-cule needed for antigen processing (TAP; see Figure 8-8).Inhibition of TAP blocks antigen delivery to class I MHC re-ceptors on HSV-infected cells, thus preventing presentationof viral antigen to CD8 +T cells. This results in the trapping of empty class I MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticu-lum and effectively shuts down a CD8 +T-cell response to HSV-infected cells. The targeting of MHC molecules is not unique to HSV . Other viruses have been shown to down-regulate class IMHC expression shortly after infection. Two of the best-characterized examples, the adenoviruses and cytomegalo-virus (CMV), use distinct molecular mechanisms to reducethe surface expression of class I MHC molecules, again in-hibiting antigen presentation to CD8 viruses\u2014 measles virus, been shown to reducelevels of class II MHC molecules on the cell surface, thusblocking the function of antigen-specific antiviral helper T cells. Antibody-mediated destruction of viruses requires com- plement activation, resulting either in direct lysis of the viralparticle or opsonization and elimination of the virus byphagocytic cells. A number of viruses have strategies for evad-ing complement-mediated destruction. Vaccinia virus, forexample, secretes a protein that binds to the C4b complementcomponent, inhibiting the classical complement pathway;and herpes simplex viruses have a glycoprotein componentthat binds to the C3b complement component, inhibitingboth the classical and alternative pathways. A number of viruses escape immune attack by constantly changing their antigens. In the influenza virus, continualantigenic variation results in the frequent emergence of newinfectious strains. The absence of protective immunity tothese newly emerging strains leads to repeated epidemics of influenza. Antigenic variation among rhinoviruses, the causa-tive agent of the common cold, is responsible for our inabil-ity to produce an effective vaccine for colds. Nowhere is anti-genic variation greater than in the human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS. Estimates suggestthat HIV accumulates mutations at a rate 65 times faster thandoes influenza virus. Because of the importance of AIDS, asection of Chapter 19 addresses this disease. A large number of viruses evade the immune response by causing generalized immunosuppression. Among these arethe paramyxoviruses that cause HIV caused by direct viral in-fection of lymphocytes or macrophages. The virus can theneither directly destroy the immune cells by cytolytic mecha-nisms or alter their function. In other cases, immunosup-pression is the result of a cytokine imbalance. For example,EBV produces a protein, called BCRF1, that homologous of IL-2, TNF, and IFN- /H9253. Influenza Has Been Responsible for Some of the Worst Pandemics in History The influenza virus infects the upper respiratory tract and major central airways in humans, horses, birds, pigs, andeven seals. In 1918-19, an influenza pandemic (worldwideepidemic) killed more than 20 million people, a toll surpass-ing the number of casualties in World War I. Some areas,such as Alaska and the Pacific Islands, lost more than half oftheir population during that pandemic. PROPERTIES OF THE INFLUENZA VIRUS Influenza viral particles, or virions, are roughly spherical orovoid in shape, with an average diameter of 90-100 nm. Thevirions are surrounded by an outer envelope\u2014a lipid bilayeracquired from the plasma membrane of the infected host cellduring the process of budding. Inserted into the envelope aretwo glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which form radiating projections that are visible in electron micrographs (Figure 17-3). The hemagglutinin pro-jections, in the form of trimers, are responsible for theattachment of the virus to host cells. There are approximately1000 hemagglutinin projections per influenza virion. Thehemagglutinin trimer binds to sialic acid groups on host-cellglycoproteins and glycolipids by way of a conserved aminoacid sequence that forms a small groove in the hemagglu-tinin molecule. Neuraminidase, as its name indicates, cleaves N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) from viral glyco- proteins and host-cell membrane glycoproteins, an activitythat presumably facilitates viral budding from the infectedhost cell. Within the envelope, an inner layer of matrix pro-tein surrounds the nucleocapsid, which consists of eight dif-392 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseaseferent strands of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) associated with protein and RNA polymerase (Figure 17-4). Each RNAstrand encodes one or more different influenza proteins. Three basic types of influenza (A, B, and C), can be distin- guished by differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix pro-teins. Type A, which is the most common, is responsible for themajor human pandemics. Antigenic variation in hemagglu-tinin and neuraminidase distinguishes subtypes of type A in-fluenza virus. According to the nomenclature of the WorldHealth Organization, each virus strain is defined by its animalhost of origin (specified, if other than human), geographicalorigin, strain number, year of isolation, and antigenic descrip-tion of HA and NA (Table 17-2). For example, A/Sw/Iowa/15/30 (H1N1) designates strain-A isolate 15 that arose in swinein Iowa in 1930 and has antigenic subtypes 1 of HA and NA.Notice that the H and N spikes are antigenically distinct in thesetwo strains. There are 13 different hemagglutinins and 9 neu-raminidases among the type A influenza viruses. The distinguishing feature of influenza virus is its vari- ability. The virus can change its surface antigens so com-pletely that the immune response to infection with the virusthat caused a previous epidemic gives little or no protectionagainst the virus causing a subsequent epidemic. The anti-genic variation results primarily from changes in the hemag-glutinin and neuraminidase spikes protruding from the viralenvelope (Figure 17-5). Two different mechanisms generateantigenic variation in HA and NA: antigenic drift and anti-genic shift. Antigenic drift involves a series of spontaneous point mutations that occur gradually, resulting in minorchanges in HA and NA. Antigenic shift results in the suddenemergence of a new subtype of influenza whose HA and pos- sibly also NA are considerably different from that of the viruspresent in a preceding epidemic. The first time a human influenza virus was isolated was in 1934; this virus was given the subtype designation H0N1(where H is hemagglutinin and N is neuraminidase). TheH0N1 subtype persisted until 1947, when a major a new subtype, H1N1, which supplanted theprevious subtype H2N2 emerged. The H2N2 subtype prevailed forthe next decade and was replaced in 1968 by H3N2. Antigenicshift in 1977 saw the re-emergence of H1N1. The most recentantigenic shift, in 1989, brought the re-emergence of H3N2,which remained dominant throughout the next several years.However, an H1N1 strain re-emerged in T exas in 1995, andcurrent influenza vaccines contain both H3N2 and H1N1strains. With each antigenic shift, hemagglutinin and neu-raminidase undergo major sequence changes, resulting inmajor antigenic variations for which the immune systemlacks memory. Thus, each antigenic shift finds the populationimmunologically unprepared, resulting in major outbreaks ofinfluenza, which sometimes reach pandemic proportions.

The envelope is covered with neuraminidase and hemagglutinin spikes. In-side is an inner layer of matrix protein surrounding the nucleocapsid,which consists of eight ssRNA molecules associated with nucleopro-tein. The eight RNA strands encode ten proteins: PB 1, PB2, PA, HA (hemagglutinin), NP (nucleoprotein), NA NS1, and NS 2.O.1 /H9262mBetween pandemic-causing antigenic shifts, the influenza virus undergoes antigenic drift, generating minor antigenicvariations, which account for strain differences within a sub-type. The immune response contributes to the emergence of these different influenza strains. As individuals infectedwith a given influenza strain mount an effective immuneresponse, the strain is eliminated. However, the accumula-tion of point mutations sufficiently alters the antigenicity ofsome variants so that they are able to escape immune elimi-nation (Figure 17-6a). These variants become a new strain ofinfluenza, causing another local epidemic cycle. The role ofantibody in such immunologic selection can be demon-strated in the laboratory by mixing an influenza strain with amonoclonal antibody specific for that strain and then cultur-ing the virus in cells. The antibody neutralizes all unalteredviral particles and only those viral particles with mutationsresulting in altered antigenicity escape neutralization and areable to continue the infection. Within a short time in culture,a new influenza strain can be shown to emerge.Antigenic shift is thought to occur through genetic reas- sortment between influenza virions from humans and fromvarious animals, including horses, pigs, and ducks (Figure17-6b). The fact that influenza contains eight separatestrands of ssRNA makes possible the reassortment of theRNA strands of human and animal virions within a singlecell infected with both viruses. Evidence for in vivo geneticreassortment between influenza A viruses from humans anddomestic pigs was obtained in 1971. After infecting a pigsimultaneously with human Hong Kong influenza (H3N2)and with swine influenza (H1N1), investigators were able torecover virions expressing H3N1. In some cases, an apparentantigenic shift may represent the re-emergence of a previousstrain that has remained hidden for several decades. In Mayof 1977, a strain of influenza, A/USSR/77 (H1N1), appearedthat proved to be identical to a strain that had caused an epi-demic 27 years earlier. The virus could have been preservedover the years in a frozen state or in an animal reservoir.When such a re-emergence occurs, the HA and NA antigensexpressed are not really new; however, they will be seen by the immune system of anyone not previously exposed to that strain (people under the age of twenty-seven in the 1977epidemic, for example) as if they were new because no mem-ory cells specific for these antigenic subtypes will exist in the susceptible population. Thus, from an immunologicpoint of view, the re-emergence of an old influenza A strain 394 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Amino acid change, % NS25 Viral proteinsNS1M2M1NA HA1NPPA PB1 PB26169 1015202530 FIGURE 17-5 Amino acid sequence variation in 10 influenza viral proteins from two H 3N2strains and one H 1N1strain.

This antibody confers protec-tion against influenza, but its specificity is strain-specific andis readily bypassed by antigenic drift. Antigenic drift in theHA molecule results in amino acid substitutions in severalantigenic domains at the molecule's distal end (Figure 17-7).Two of these domains are on either side of the conservedsialic-acid-binding cleft, which is necessary for binding ofvirions to target cells. Serum antibodies specific for these tworegions are important in blocking initial viral infectivity.These antibody titers peak within a few days of infection andthen decrease over the next 6 months; the titers then plateauand remain fairly stable for the next several years. This anti-body does not appear to be required for recovery from in-fluenza, as patients with agammaglobulinemia recover fromthe disease. Instead, the serum antibody appears to play a sig-nificant role in resistance to reinfection by the same strain.When serum-antibody levels are high for a particular HAmolecule, both mice and humans are resistant to infection byvirions expressing that HA molecule. If mice are infectedwith influenza virus and antibody production is experimen-tally suppressed, the mice recover from the infection but can be reinfected with the same viral strain. In addition tohumoral responses, CTLs can play a role in immune re- sponses to influenza. Bacterial Infections Immunity to bacterial infections is achieved by means ofantibody unless the bacterium is capable of intracellulargrowth, in which case delayed-type hypersensitivity has animportant role. Bacteria enter the body either through anumber of natural routes (e.g., the respiratory tract, the gas-trointestinal tract, and the genitourinary tract) or throughnormally inaccessible routes opened up by breaks in mucousmembranes or skin.

If the inoculum size and the virulence are bothlow, then localized tissue phagocytes may be able to eliminatethe bacteria with an innate, nonspecific defense. Larger in-oculums or organisms with greater virulence tend to inducean adaptive, specific immune response. Immune Responses to Extracellular and Intracellular Bacteria Can Differ Infection by extracellular bacteria induces production of humoral antibodies, which are ordinarily secreted by plasmacells in regional lymph nodes and the submucosa of the res-piratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The humoral immuneresponse is the main protective response against extracellularbacteria. The antibodies act in several ways to protect thehost from the invading organisms, including removal of thebacteria and inactivation of bacterial toxins (Figure 17-8).Extracellular bacteria can be pathogenic because they inducea localized inflammatory response or because they producetoxins. The toxins, endotoxin or exotoxin, can be cytotoxicbut also may cause pathogenesis in other ways. An excellentexample of this is the toxin produced by diphtheria, whichexerts a toxic effect on the cell by blocking protein synthesis.Endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are generallycomponents of bacterial cell walls, while exotoxins, such asdiphtheria toxin, are secreted by the bacteria. Antibody that binds to accessible antigens on the surface of a bacterium can, together with the C3b component ofcomplement, act as an opsonin that increases phagocytosisand thus clearance of the bacterium (see Figure 17-8). In thecase of some bacteria\u2014notably, the gram-negative organ-isms\u2014complement activation can lead directly to lysis of theorganism. Antibody-mediated activation of the complementsystem can also induce localized production of immuneeffector molecules that help to develop an amplified andmore effective inflammatory response. For example, thecomplement split products C3a, C4a, and C5a act as thusvasodilation and the extravasation of lymphocytes and neu-trophils from the blood into tissue space (see Figure 17-8).Other complement split products serve as chemotactic fac-tors for neutrophils and macrophages, thereby contributingto the buildup of phagocytic cells at the site of infection.Antibody to a bacteria toxin may bind to the toxin and neu-tralize it; the antibody-toxin complexes are then cleared byphagocytic cells in the same manner as any other antigen-antibody complex. While innate immunity is not very effective against intra- cellular bacterial pathogens, intracellular bacteria can acti-vate NK cells, which, in turn, provide an early defense againstthese bacteria. Intracellular bacterial infections tend to in-duce a cell-mediated immune response, delayed-type hypersensitivity. ingested pathogens more effectively (see Figure 14-15). Bacteria Can Effectively Evade Host Defense Mechanisms There are four primary steps in bacterial infection: IAttachment to host cells IProliferation IInvasion of host tissue IT oxin-induced damage to host cells Host-defense mechanisms act at each of these steps, and many bacteria have evolved ways to circumvent some of thesehost defenses (Table 17-3). Some bacteria have surface structures or molecules that enhance their ability to attach to host cells. A number ofgram-negative bacteria, for instance, have pili (long hairlikeprojections), which enable them to attach to the membraneof the intestinal or genitourinary tract (Figure 17-9). Otherbacteria, such as Bordetella pertussis, secrete adhesion mole- cules that attach to both the bacterium and the ciliatedepithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. Secretory IgA antibodies specific for such bacterial struc- tures can block bacterial attachment to mucosal epithelialcells and are the main host defense against bacterial attach-ment. However, some bacteria (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, secreting proteases that cleave secretoryIgA at the hinge region; the resulting Fab and Fc fragmentshave a shortened half-life in mucous secretions and are notable to agglutinate microorganisms. Some bacteria evade the IgA response of the host by changing these surface antigens. In N. gonorrhoeae, for ex- ample, pilin, the protein component of the pili, has a highlyvariable structure. Variation in the pilin amino acid sequenceis generated by gene rearrangements of its coding sequence.The pilin locus consists of one or two expressed genes and10-20 silent genes. Each gene is arranged into six regionscalled minicassettes. Pilin variation is generated by a process of gene conversion, in which one or more minicassettes fromthe silent genes replace a minicassette of the expression gene.This process generates enormous antigenic variation, whichmay contribute to the pathogenicity of N. gonorrhoeae by increasing the likelihood that expressed pili will bind firmlyto epithelial cells. In addition, the continual changes in thepilin sequence allow the organism to evade neutralization by IgA. Some bacteria possess surface structures that serve to inhibit phagocytosis. A classic example is Streptococcus pneu- moniae, whose polysaccharide capsule prevents phagocytosis very effectively. There are 84 serotypes of S. pneumoniae that differ from one another by distinct capsular polysaccharides.396 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Go to www.whfreeman.com/immunology Animation Vaccine Strategies See Pathenogenesis Immune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 397 VISUALIZING CONCEPTS Mast cellOpsonization and phagocytosis Anaphylatoxins mediate mast combating infection by extracellular bacteria. ( 1) Antibody neutralizes bacterial toxins. ( 2) Complement activation on bacterial surfaces leads to complement-mediated lysis of bacteria. ( 3) Antibody and the com- plement split product C 3b bind to bacteria, serving as toincrease phagocytosis. C3a, C4a, and C 5a, generated by antibody- initiated complement activation, induce local mast cell degranulation,releasing substances that mediate vasodilation and extravasationof lymphocytes and are chemotactic for neutrophils and macrophages.During infection, the host produces antibody against the infecting serotype. This antibody protects against reinfectionwith the same serotype but will not protect against infectionby a different serotype. In this way, S. pneumoniae can cause disease many times in the same individual. On other bacteria,such as Streptococcus pyogenes, a surface protein projection called the M protein inhibits phagocytosis. Some pathogenicstaphylococci are able to assemble a protective coat from hostproteins. These bacteria secrete a coagulase enzyme that pre-cipitates a fibrin coat around them, shielding them fromphagocytic cells.Mechanisms for interfering with the complement system help other bacteria survive. In some gram-negative bacteria,for example, long side chains on the lipid A moiety of thecell-wall core polysaccharide help to and C5a anaphylatoxins, there-by diminishing the localized inflammatory reaction. A number of bacteria escape host defense mechanisms by their ability to survive within phagocytic cells. Some, such asListeria monocytogenes, do this by escaping from the phago- lysosome to the cytoplasm, which is a more favorable environ-ment for their growth. Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium avium, block lysosomal fusion with the phagolysosome; and some mycobacteria are resistant to the oxidative attack thattakes place within the phagolysosome. Immune Responses Can Contribute to Bacterial Pathogenesis In some cases, disease is caused not by the bacterial pathogen itself but by the immune response to the pathogen. Asdescribed in Chapter 12, pathogen-stimulated overproduc-tion of cytokines leads to the symptoms of bacterial septicshock, food poisoning, and toxic-shock syndrome. For in-stance, cell-wall endotoxins of some gram-negative bacteriaactivate of high levels ofIL-1 and TNF- /H9251, which can cause septic shock. In staphylo- coccal food poisoning and toxic-shock syndrome, exotoxinsproduced by the pathogens function as superantigens, whichcan activate all T cells that express T-cell receptors with a par-ticular V /H9252domain (see Table 10-4). The resulting overpro- duction of cytokines by activated T Hcells causes many of the symptoms of these diseases.398 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 17-3 Host immune responses to bacterial infection and bacterial evasion mechanisms Infection process Host defense Bacterial evasion mechanisms Attachment to host Blockage of attachment by Secretion of proteases that cleave N. gonorrhoeae ) Proliferation Phagocytosis (Ab- and Production of surface structures (polysaccharide capsule, M protein, C3b-mediated opsonization) fibrin coat) that inhibit phagocytic cells Mechanisms complement- localized inflammatory response mediated lysis Insertion of membrane-attack complex prevented by long side chain in cell-wall LPS (some gram-negative bacteria) Invasion of host tissues Ab-mediated agglutination Secretion of by antibody Secretion of hyaluronidase, which enhances bacterial invasiveness to host cells FIGURE 17-9 Electron micrograph of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at- taching to urethral epithelial cells.

Dis. 126: 601.]The ability of some bacteria to survive intracellularly with- in infected cells can result in chronic antigenic activation ofCD4 +T cells, leading to tissue destruction by a cell-mediated response with the characteristics of a delayed-type hypersen-sitivity reaction (see Chapter 14). Cytokines secreted by theseactivated CD4 +T cells can lead to extensive accumulation and activation of macrophages, resulting in formation of agranuloma. The localized concentrations of lysosomal en- zymes in these granulomas can cause extensive tissue necro-sis. Much of the tissue damage seen with M. tuberculosis is due to a cell-mediated immune response. Diphtheria ( Corynebacterium diphtheriae ) May Be Controlled by Immunization withInactivated Toxoid Diphtheria is the classic example of a bacterial disease caused by a secreted exotoxin to which immunity can be induced byimmunization inactivated toxoid. diphtheriae, was first described by Klebs in 1883 and was shown a year later by Loeffler to cause diphtheria inguinea pigs and rabbits. Autopsies on the infected animalsrevealed that, while bacterial growth was limited to the site ofinoculation, there was widespread damage to a variety oforgans, including the heart, liver, and kidneys. This findingled Loeffler to speculate that the neurologic and cardiologicmanifestations of the disease were caused by a toxic sub-stance elaborated by the organism. Loeffler's hypothesis was validated in 1888, when Roux and Y ersin produced the disease in animals by injecting themwith a sterile filtrate from a culture of C. diphtheriae. Two years later, von Behring showed that an antiserum to thetoxin was able to prevent death in infected animals. He pre-pared a toxoid by treating the toxin with iodine trichlorideand demonstrated that it could induce protective antibodiesin animals. However, the toxoid was still quite toxic andtherefore unsuitable for use in humans. In 1923, Ramonfound that exposing the toxin to heat and formalin renderedit nontoxic but did not destroy its antigenicity. Clinical trialsshowed that formaldehyde-treated toxoid conferred a highlevel of protection against diphtheria. As immunizations with the toxoid increased, the number of cases of diphtheria decreased rapidly. In the 1920s, therewere approximately 200 cases of diphtheria per 100,000 pop-ulation in the United States. In 1989, the Centers for DiseaseControl reported only three cases of diphtheria in the entireUnited States. Recently in the former Soviet Union, there hasbeen an alarming epidemic of diphtheria due to a reductionin vaccinations. Natural infection with C. diphtheriae occurs only in hu- mans. The disease is spread from one individual to anotherby airborne respiratory droplets. The organism colonizes thenasopharyngeal tract, remaining in the superficial layers ofthe respiratory mucosa. Growth of the organism itself causeslittle tissue damage, and only a mild inflammatory reaction develops. The virulence of the organism is due completely toits potent exotoxin. The toxin causes destruction of theunderlying tissue, resulting in the formation of a tough fibri-nous membrane (\"pseudomembrane\") composed of fibrin,white blood cells, and dead respiratory epithelial cells. Themembrane itself can cause suffocation. The exotoxin also isresponsible for widespread systemic manifestations. Pro-nounced myocardial damage (often leading to congestiveheart failure) and neurologic damage (ranging from mildweakness to complete paralysis) are common. The exotoxin that causes diphtheria symptoms is encoded by the tox gene carried by phage /H9252. Within some strains of C. diphtheriae, phage /H9252can exist in a state of lysogeny, in which the /H9252-prophage DNA persists within the bacterial cell. Only strains that carry lysogenic phage /H9252are able to produce the exotoxin. The diphtheria exotoxin contains two disulfide-linked chains, a binding chain and toxin chain. The bindingchain interacts with ganglioside receptors on susceptiblecells, facilitating exotoxin. T oxicity re-sults from the inhibitory effect of the toxin chain on proteinsynthesis. The diphtheria exotoxin is extremely potent; a sin-gle molecule has been shown to kill a cell. Removal of thebinding chain prevents the exotoxin from entering the cell,thus rendering the exotoxin nontoxic. As described in Chap-ter 4, an immunotoxin can be prepared by replacing thebinding chain with a monoclonal antibody specific for atumor-cell surface antigen; in this way the toxin chain can betargeted to tumor cells (see Figure 4-23). T oday, diphtheria toxoid is prepared by treating diphthe- ria toxin with formaldehyde. The reaction with formalde-hyde cross-links the toxin, resulting in an irreversible loss inits toxicity while enhancing its antigenicity. The toxoid isadministered together with tetanus toxoid and inactivatedBordetella pertussis in a combined vaccine that is given to children beginning at 6-8 weeks of age. Immunization withthe toxoid induces the production of antibodies (antitoxin),which can bind to the toxin and neutralize its activity. Be-cause antitoxin levels decline slowly over time, booster dosesare recommended at 10-year intervals to maintain antitoxinlevels within the protective range. Interestingly, antibodiesspecific for epitopes on the binding chain of the diphtheriaexotoxin are critical for toxin neutralization because theseantibodies block internalization of the active toxin chain. Tuberculosis ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) Is Primarily Controlled by CD 4+T Cells Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in the world from a single infectious agent, killing about 3 million individualsevery year and accounting for 18.5% of all deaths in adultsbetween the ages of 15 and 59. About 1.79 billion people,roughly one-third of the world's population, are infected withthe causative agent M. tuberculosis and are at risk of develop- ing the disease. Long thought to have been eliminated as aImmune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 399public health problem in the United States, tuberculosis re- emerged in the early 1990s, particularly in the inner cities andin areas where HIV-infection levels are high (see the last sec-tion of this chapter). In 2000, approximately 17,000 individu-als were diagnosed with tuberculosis in the United States. Although several Mycobacterium species can cause tuber- culosis, M. tuberculosis is the principal causative agent. This organism is spread easily, and pulmonary infection usuallyresults from inhalation of small droplets of respiratory secre-tions containing a few bacilli. The inhaled bacilli are ingestedby alveolar macrophages and are able to survive and multiplyintracellularly by inhibiting formation of phagolysosomes.When the infected macrophages lyse, as they eventually do,large numbers bacilli are released. A cell-mediated re-sponse involving CD4 +T cells, which is required for immu- nity to tuberculosis, may be responsible for much of the tis-sue damage in the disease. CD4 +T-cell activity is the basis for the tuberculin skin test to the purified protein derivative(PPD) from M. tuberculosis (see Chapter 14). Upon infection with M. tuberculosis, the most common clinical pattern, termed pulmonary tuberculosis, appears inabout 90% of those infected. In this pattern, CD4 +T cells are activated within 2-6 weeks after infection, inducing the infil-tration of large numbers of activated macrophages. Thesecells wall off the organism inside a granulomatous lesioncalled a tubercle (Figure 17-10). A tubercle consists of a fewsmall lymphocytes and a compact collection of activatedmacrophages, which sometimes differentiate into epithelioidcells or multinucleated giant cells. The massive activation ofmacrophages that occurs within tubercles often results in theconcentrated release of lytic enzymes. These enzymes destroynearby healthy cells, resulting in circular regions of necrotictissue, which eventually form a lesion with a caseous (cheese-like) consistency (see Figure 17-10). As these caseous lesionsheal, they become calcified and are readily visible on x-rays,where they are called Ghon complexes. Because the activated macrophages suppress proliferation of the phagocytosed bacilli, infection is contained. Cytokinesproduced by CD4 +T cells (T H1 subset) play an important role in the response by activating macrophages, so that theyare able to kill the bacilli or inhibit their growth. The role ofIFN- /H9253in the immune response to mycobacteria has been demonstrated with knockout mice lacking IFN- /H9253. These mice died when they were infected with an attenuated strain ofmycobacteria (BCG), whereas IFN- /H9253 +normal mice survive. Recent studies have revealed high levels of IL-12 in the pleural effusions of tuberculosis patients. The high levels of IL-12, produced by activated macrophages, are not sur-prising, given the decisive role of IL-12 in stimulating T H1- mediated responses (see Figure 12-12). In mouse models oftuberculosis, IL-12 has been shown to increase resistance tothe disease. Not only does IL-12 stimulate development ofT H1 cells, but it also may contribute to resistance by inducing the production of chemokines that attract macrophages tothe site of infection. When IL-12 is neutralized by granuloma formation in tuberculous mice is blocked.The CD4 +T-cell-mediated immune response mounted by the majority of people exposed to M. tuberculosis thus controls the infection and later protects against reinfection.However, about 10% of individuals infected with M. tuber- culosis follow a different clinical pattern: the disease pro- gresses to chronic pulmonary tuberculosis or extrapulmonarytuberculosis. This progression may occur years after the pri-mary infection. In this clinical pattern, accumulation of largeconcentrations of mycobacterial antigens within tuberclesleads to extensive CD4 activa- tion and ensuing macrophage activation. of lytic enzymes cause the necrotic caseouslesions to liquefy, creating a rich medium that allows the tuber-cle bacilli to proliferate extracellularly. Eventually the lesionsrupture, and the bacilli disseminate in the lung and/or are spread through the blood and lymphatic vessels to thepleural cavity, bone, urogenital system, meninges, peritoneum,or skin. Tuberculosis is treated with several used combina- tion, including isoniazid, rifampin, of isoniazidand rifampin has been particularly effective. The intracellulargrowth of M. tuberculosis makes it difficult for drugs to reach the bacilli. For this reason, drug therapy must be continued forat least 9 months to eradicate the bacteria. Some patients withtuberculosis do not exhibit any clinical symptoms, and somepatients with symptoms begin to feel better within 2-4 weeks400 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TH1 cell Activated macrophages Macrophage with bacilli ActivatedmacrophagesCaseouscenter A A. M. Dannenberg, 1993, Hosp. Prac. ( Jan. 15):51.]after treatment begins. T o avoid the side effects associated with the usual antibiotic therapy, many patients, once they feelbetter, stop taking the medications long before the recom-mended treatment period is completed. Because briefer treat-ment may not eradicate organisms that are somewhat resistantto the antibiotics, a multidrug-resistant strain can emerge.Noncompliance with required treatment regimes, one of themost troubling aspects of the large number of current tuber-culosis cases, clearly compromises efforts to contain the spreadof the disease. Presently, the only vaccine for M. tuberculosis is an attenu- ated strain of M. bovis called BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin). The vaccine appears to provide fairly effective protectionagainst extrapulmonary tuberculosis but has been inconsis-tent against pulmonary tuberculosis. In different studies, BCGhas provided protection in anywhere from 0% to 80% of vac-cinated individuals; in some cases, BCG vaccination has evenincreased the risk of infection. Moreover, after BCG vaccina-tion, the tuberculin skin test cannot be used as an effectivemonitor of exposure to M. tuberculosis. Because of the variable effectiveness of the BCG vaccine and the inability to monitorfor exposure with the skin test after vaccination, this vaccine isnot used in the United States. However, the alarming increasein multidrug-resistant strains has stimulated renewed effortsto develop a more effective tuberculosis vaccine. Protozoan Diseases Protozoans are unicellular eukaryotic organisms. They areresponsible for several serious diseases in humans, includ-ing amoebiasis, Chagas' disease, African sleeping sickness,malaria, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis. The type of im-mune response that develops to protozoan infection and theeffectiveness of the response depend in part on the location ofthe parasite within the host. Many protozoans have life-cyclestages in which they are free within the bloodstream, and it isduring these stages that humoral antibody is most effective.Many of these same pathogens are also capable of intracellulargrowth; during these stages, cell-mediated immune reactionsare effective in host defense. In the development of vaccines forprotozoan diseases, the branch of the immune system that ismost likely to confer protection must be carefully considered. Malaria ( Plasmodium Species) Infects 600Million People Worldwide Malaria is one of the most devastating diseases in the world today, infecting nearly 10% of the world population andcausing 1-2 million deaths every year. Malaria is caused byvarious species of the genus Plasmodium, of which P. falci- parum is the most virulent and prevalent. The alarming development of multiple-drug resistance in Plasmodium and the increased resistance of its vector, the Anopheles mosquito, to DDT underscore the importance of developing new stra-tegies to hinder the spread of malaria.PLASMODIUM LIFE CYCLE AND PATHOGENESIS OF MALARIA Plasmodium progresses through a remarkable series of devel- opmental and maturational stages in its extremely complexlife cycle. Female Anopheles mosquitoes, which feed on blood meals, serve as the vector for Plasmodium, and part of the parasite's life cycle takes place within the mosquito. (Becausemale Anopheles mosquitoes feed on plant juices, they do not transmit Plasmodium. ) Human infection begins when sporozoites, one of the Plasmodium stages, are introduced into an individual's blood- stream as an infected mosquito takes a blood meal (Figure17-11). Within 30 min, the sporozoites disappear from theImmune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 401 Sporozoites Liver Merozoites GametocytesIn mosquito gutRBC FIGURE 17-11 The life cycle of Plasmodium. Sporozoites enter the bloodstream when an infected mosquito takes a blood meal. Thesporozoites migrate to the liver, where they multiply, transformingliver hepatocytes into giant multinucleate schizonts, which releasethousands of merozoites into the bloodstream. The merozoites in-fect red blood cells, which eventually rupture, releasing more mero-zoites. Eventually some of the merozoites differentiate into male andfemale gametocytes, which are ingested by a mosquito and differen-tiate into gametes. The gametes fuse to form a zygote that differenti-ates to the sporozoite stage within the salivary gland of the mosquito.blood as they migrate to the liver, where they infect hepato- cytes. Sporozoites are long, slender cells that are covered by a 45-kDa protein called circumsporozoite (CS) antigen,which appears to mediate their adhesion to hepatocytes. Thebinding site on the CS antigen is a conserved region in thecarboxyl-terminal end (called region II) that has a high degreeof sequence homology with known cell-adhesion molecules. Within the liver, the sporozoites multiply extensively and undergo a complex series of transformations that culminatein the formation and release of merozoites in about a week. Ithas been estimated that a liver hepatocyte infected with a sin-gle sporozoite can release 5,000-10,000 merozoites. The re-leased merozoites infect red blood cells, initiating the symp-toms and pathology of malaria. Within a red blood cell,merozoites replicate and undergo successive differentiations;eventually the cell ruptures and releases new merozoites,which go on to infect more red blood cells. Eventually someof the merozoites differentiate into male and female gameto-cytes, which may be ingested by a female Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal. Within the mosquito's gut, the male andfemale gametocytes differentiate into gametes that fuse toform a zygote, multiplies and differentiates into sporo-zoites within the salivary gland. The infected mosquito isnow set to initiate the cycle once again. The symptoms of malaria are recurrent chills, fever, and sweating. The symptoms peak roughly every 48 h, when suc-cessive generations of merozoites are released from infectedred blood cells. An infected individual eventually becomesweak and anemic and shows splenomegaly. The large num-bers of merozoites formed can block capillaries, causingintense headaches, renal failure, heart failure, or cerebraldamage\u2014often with fatal consequences. There is speculationthat some of the symptoms of malaria may be caused not byPlasmodium itself but instead by excessive production of cytokines. This hypothesis stemmed from the observationthat cancer patients treated in clinical trials with recombi-nant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) developed symptoms thatmimicked malaria. The relation between TNF and malariasymptoms was studied by infecting mice with a mouse-specific strain of Plasmodium, which causes rapid death by cerebral malaria. Injection of these mice with antibodies toTNF was shown to prevent the rapid death. HOST RESPONSE TO PLASMODIUM INFECTION In regions where malaria is endemic, the immune response to Plasmodium infection is poor. Children less than 14 years old mount the lowest immune response and consequentlyare most likely to develop malaria. In some regions, the child-hood mortality rate for malaria reaches 50%, and worldwidethe disease kills about a million children a year. The low im-mune response to Plasmodium among children can be demonstrated by measuring serum antibody levels to thesporozoite stage. Only 22% of the children living in endemicareas have detectable antibodies to the sporozoite stage,whereas 84% of the adults have such antibodies. Even in adults, the degree of immunity is far from complete, how-ever, and most people living in endemic regions have lifelonglow-level Plasmodium infections. A number of factors may contribute to the low levels of immune responsiveness to Plasmodium. The maturational changes from sporozoite to merozoite to gametocyte allowthe organism to keep changing its surface molecules, result-ing in continual changes in the antigens seen by the immunesystem. The intracellular phases of the life cycle in liver cellsand erythrocytes also reduce the degree of immune activa-tion generated by the pathogen and allow the organism tomultiply while it is shielded from attack. Furthermore, themost accessible stage, the sporozoite, circulates in the bloodfor only about 30 min before it infects liver hepatocytes; it isunlikely that much immune activation can occur in such ashort period of time. And even when an antibody responsedoes develop to sporozoites, Plasmodium has evolved a way of overcoming that response by sloughing off the surface CS-antigen coat, thus rendering the antibodies ineffective. DESIGN OF MALARIA VACCINES An effective vaccine for malaria should maximize the mosteffective immune defense mechanisms. Unfortunately, littleis known of the roles that humoral and cell-mediatedresponses play in the development of protective immunity tothis disease. Current approaches to design of malaria vac-cines focus largely on the sporozoite stage. One experimentalvaccine, for example, consists of Plasmodium sporozoites at- tenuated by x-irradiation. In one study, nine volunteers wererepeatedly immunized by the bite of P. falciparum -infected, irradiated mosquitoes. Later challenge by the bites of mos-quitoes infected with virulent P. falciparum revealed that six of the nine recipients were completely protected. These re-sults are encouraging, but translating these findings into massimmunization remains problematic. Sporozoites do not growwell in cultured cells, so an enormous insectory would berequired to breed mosquitoes in which to prepare enoughirradiated sporozoites to vaccinate just one small village. Current vaccine strategies are aimed at producing syn- thetic subunit vaccines consisting of epitopes that can be rec-ognized by T cells and B cells. While no effective vaccine hasbeen developed, this is an active area of investigation. African Sleeping Sickness (Trypanosoma Species) Two species of African trypanosomes, which are flagellated protozoans, can cause sleeping sickness, a chronic, debilitat-ing disease transmitted to humans and cattle by the bite of thetsetse fly. In the bloodstream, a trypanosome differentiatesinto a long, slender form that continues to divide every 4-6 h.The disease progresses through several stages, beginning withan early (systemic) stage in which trypanosomes multiply inthe blood and progressing to a neurologic stage in which the402 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseaseparasite infects the central nervous system, causing menin- goencephalitis and eventually the loss of consciousness. As parasite numbers increase after infection, an effective humoral antibody response develops to the glycoproteincoat, called variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), that covers the trypanosomal surface (Figure 17-12). These antibodieseliminate most of the parasites from the bloodstream, bothby complement-mediated lysis and by opsonization and Immune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 403 VISUALIZING CONCEPTS (a)Millions of trypanosomes per milliliter of blood1.5 Variant 3 Variant 4Variant 2 Variant 1 28 30 27 26 29 250.5 01.0 Approximate time after tsetse fly bite, weeksAntibodies to variant 3 Antibodies to variant 2 Antibodies to variant 1 Duplication and translocation of parasitemia after infection with Trypanosoma result from antigenic shifts in the parasite's vari- ant surface glycoprotein (VSG).

However, about 1% of the organ- isms, which bear an antigenically different VSG, escape theinitial antibody response. These surviving organisms nowbegin to proliferate in the bloodstream, and a new wave ofparasitemia is observed. The successive waves of parasitemiareflect a unique mechanism of antigenic shift by which thetrypanosomes can evade the immune response to their gly-coprotein antigens. This process is so effective that each newvariant that arises in the course of a single infection is able toescape the humoral antibodies generated in response to thepreceding variant, so that waves of parasitemia recur (Figure17-12a). Several unusual genetic processes generate the extensive variation in trypanosomal VSG that enables the organism toescape immunologic clearance. An individual trypanosomecarries a large repertoire of VSG genes, each encoding a dif-ferent VSG primary sequence. Trypanosoma brucei, for ex- ample, contains more than 1000 VSG genes in its genome,clustered at multiple chromosomal sites. A trypanosomeexpresses only a single VSG gene at a time. Activation of aVSG gene results in duplication of the gene and its transposi-tion to a transcriptionally active expression site (ES) at thetelomeric end of specific chromosomes (Figure 17-12b).Activation of a new VSG gene displaces the previous genefrom the telomeric expression site. number of chromo-somes in the trypanosome have transcriptionally activeexpression sites at the telomeric ends, so that a number ofVSG genes can potentially be expressed, but unknown con-trol mechanisms limit expression to a single VSG expressionsite at a time. There appears to be some order in the VSG variation dur- ing infection. Each new variant arises not by clonal out-growth from a single variant cell but instead from the growthof multiple cells that have activated the same VSG gene in thecurrent wave of parasite growth. It is not known how thisprocess is regulated among individual trypanosomes. Thecontinual shifts in epitopes displayed by the VSG make thedevelopment of a vaccine for African sleeping sickness ex-tremely difficult. Leishmaniasis Is a Useful Model for Demonstrating Differences in HostResponses The protozoan parasite Leishmania major provides a power- ful and illustrative example of how host responses can differbetween individuals. These differences can lead to eitherclearance of the parasite or fatality from the infection. Leish- mania is a protozoan that lives in the phagosomes of macro- phages. Resistance to the infection correlates well with theproduction of IFN- /H9253and the development of a T H1 re- sponse. Elegant studies in mice have demonstrated thatstrains that are resistant to Leishmania develop a T H1 re- sponse and produce IFN- /H9253upon infection. Such strains of mice become highly susceptible to Leishmania -induced fatal-ity if they lose either IFN- /H9253or /H9253receptor, further underscoring the importance of IFN- /H9253in containing the infection. A few strains of mice, such as BALB/c, are highlysusceptible to Leishmania, and these animals frequently suc- cumb to infection. These mice mount a T H2-type response to Leishmania infection; they produce high levels of IL-4 and essentially no IFN- /H9253. Thus, one difference between an effec- tive and an ineffective defense against the parasite is thedevelopment of a T H1 response or a T H2 response. Recent studies demonstrate that one difference between the resistantstrains of mice and BALB/c is that a small restricted subset ofBALB/c CD4 +T cells are capable of recognizing a particular epitope on L. major, and this subset produces high levels of IL-4 early in the response to the parasite. This skews theresponse toward a predominantly T H2 type. Understanding how these different T-helper responses affect the outcome ofinfection could provide a more rational approach to the de-sign of effective treatments and successful vaccines for otherpathogens. Diseases Caused by Parasitic Worms (Helminths) Unlike protozoans, which are unicellular and often grow within human cells, helminths are large, multicellular organ-isms that reside in humans but do not ordinarily multiplythere and are not intracellular pathogens. Although hel-minths are more accessible to the immune system than pro-tozoans, most infected individuals carry few of these para-sites; for this reason, the immune system is not stronglyengaged and the level of immunity generated to helminths isoften very poor. Parasitic worms are responsible for a wide variety of dis- eases in both humans and animals. More than a billion peo-ple are infected with Ascaris, a parasitic roundworm that infects the small intestine, and more than 300 million peopleare infected with Schistosoma, a trematode worm that causes a chronic debilitating infection. Several helminths are impor-tant pathogens of domestic animals and invade humans whoingest contaminated food. These helminths include Taenia, a tapeworm of cattle and pigs, and Trichinella, the roundworm of pigs that causes trichinosis. Several Schistosoma species are responsible for the chronic, debilitating, and sometimes fatal disease schistoso- miasis (formerly known as bilharzia ). Three species, S. man- soni, S. japonicum, and S. haematobium, are the major pathogens in humans, infecting individuals in Africa, theMiddle East, South America, the Caribbean, China, South-east Asia, and the Philippines. A rise in the incidence of schis-tosomiasis in recent years has paralleled the increasingworldwide use of irrigation, which has expanded the habitatof the freshwater snail that serves as the intermediate host forschistosomes.404 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseInfection occurs through contact with free-swimming infectious larvae, called cercariae, which are released from aninfected snail at the rate of 300-3000 per day. When cercariaecontact human skin, they secrete digestive enzymes that helpthem to bore into the skin, where they shed their tails and aretransformed into schistosomules. The schistosomules enterthe capillaries and migrate to the lungs, then to the liver, andfinally to the primary site of infection, which varies with thespecies. S. mansoni and S. japonicum infect the intestinal mesenteric veins; S. haematobium infects the veins of the uri- nary bladder. Once established in their final tissue site, schis-tosomules mature into male and female adult worms. Theworms mate and the females produce at least 300 spiny eggsa day. Unlike protozoan parasites, schistosomes and otherhelminths do not multiply within their hosts. The eggs pro-duced by the female worm do not mature into adult wormsin humans; instead, some of them pass into the feces or urineand are excreted to infect more snails. The number of wormsin an infected individual increases only through repeated ex-posure to the free-swimming cercariae, and so most infectedindividuals carry rather low numbers of worms. Most of the symptoms of schistosomiasis are initiated by the eggs. As many as half of the eggs produced remain in thehost, where they invade the intestinal wall, liver, or bladderand cause hemorrhage. A chronic state can then develop inwhich the adult worms persist and the unexcreted eggs in-duce cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitive reactions,resulting in large granulomas that are gradually walled off byfibrous tissue. Although the eggs are contained by the forma-tion of the granuloma, often the granuloma itself obstructsthe venous blood flow to the liver or bladder. Although an immune response does develop to the schis- tosomes, in most individuals it is not sufficient to eliminatethe adult worms, even though the intravascular sites of schis-tosome infestation should make the worm an easy target forimmune attack. Instead, the worms survive for up to 20 years.The schistosomules would appear to be the forms most sus-ceptible to attack, but because they are motile, they can evadethe localized cellular buildup of immune and inflammatorycells. Adult schistosome worms also have several uniquemechanisms that protect them from immune defenses. Theadult worm has been shown to decrease the expression ofantigens on its outer membrane and also to enclose itself in aglycolipid and glycoprotein coat derived from the host,masking the presence of its own antigens. Among the anti-gens observed on the adult worm are the host's own ABOblood-group antigens and histocompatibility antigens! Theimmune response is, course, diminished by this coveringmade of the host's self-antigens, which must contribute tothe lifelong persistence of these organisms. The relative importance of the humoral and cell- mediated responses in protective immunity to schistosomia-sis is controversial. The humoral response to infection with S. mansoni is characterized by high titers of antischistosome IgE antibodies, localized increases in mast cells and their sub-sequent degranulation, and increased numbers of eosino- phils (Figure 17-13, top). These manifestations suggest that cytokines produced by a T H2-like subset are important for the immune response: IL-4, which induces B cells to class-switch to IgE production; IL-5, which induces bone-marrowprecursors to differentiate into eosinophils; and IL-3, which(along with IL-4) stimulates growth of mast cells. Degranula-tion of mast cells releases mediators that increase the infiltra-tion of such inflammatory cells as macrophages and eosino-phils. The eosinophils express Fc receptors for IgE and IgG and bind to the antibody-coated parasite. Once bound to the parasite, an eosinophil can participate in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), releasing me-diators from its granules that damage the parasite (see Figure14-12). One eosinophil mediator, called basic protein, is par-ticularly toxic to helminths. Immunization studies with mice, however, suggest that this humoral IgE response may not provide protective im-munity. When mice are immunized with S. mansoni vaccine, the protective immune response that develops is not an IgEresponse, but rather a T H1 response characterized by IFN- /H9253 production and macrophage accumulation (Figure 17-13,bottom ). Furthermore, inbred strains of mice with deficien- cies in mast cells or IgE develop protective immunity fromvaccination, whereas inbred strains with deficiencies in cell-mediated CD4 +T-cell responses fail to develop protective immunity in response to the vaccine. These studies suggestthat the CD4 +T-cell response may be the most important in immunity to schistosomiasis. It has been suggested that theability to induce an ineffective T H2-like response may have evolved in schistosomes as a clever defense mechanism toensure that T H2 cells produced sufficient levels of IL-10 to inhibit protective immunity mediated by the T H1-like subset in the CD4+T response. Antigens present on the membrane of cercariae and young schistosomules are promising vaccine componentsbecause these stages appear to be most susceptible to im-mune attack. Injecting mice and rats with monoclonal anti-bodies to cercariae and young schistosomules passivelytransferred resistance to infection with live cercariae. Whenthese protective antibodies were used in affinity columns to purify schistosome membrane antigens from crude mem-brane extracts, it was found that mice immunized andboosted with these purified antigens exhibited increasedresistance to a later challenge with live cercariae. Schisto-some cDNA libraries were then established and screenedwith the protective monoclonal antibodies to identify thosecDNAs encoding Experiments usingcloned cercariae or schistosomule antigens are presentlyunder way to assess their ability to induce protective immu-nity in animal models. However, in developing an effectivevaccine for schistosomiasis, a fine line separates a beneficialimmune response, which at best limits the parasite load,from a detrimental response, which in itself may becomepathologic.Immune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 405Emerging Infectious Diseases A cursory glance at the current offerings in your local book- store or video rental store brings into focus the preoccupa-tion of the public and the press with new infectious agents.Several times a year, it seems, we hear about a new virus orbacterium that arises in a particular location and causessevere illness or death in a population. Newly describedpathogens are referred to as emerging pathogens. Some of the emerging pathogens that have been described since theearly 1970s appear in Table 17-4. These new pathogens arethought to have emerged within the recent past. HIV is anexample of a newly emerged pathogen. In other instances, diseases that were no longer causing widespread infection suddenly began to infect an ever-largernumber of individuals. These are referred to as \"re-emerging\"406 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease VISUALIZING CONCEPTS C3bBasicproteinNeutrophilMast cell Eosinophil MacrophagePlasma immune response generated against Schistosoma mansoni. The response includes an IgE hu- moral component ( top) and a cell-mediated component re-emergence of these diseases should not be surprising if we consider that bacteria canadapt to living in almost any environment. If they can adaptto living at the high temperatures of the thermal vents deepwithin the oceans, it is not difficult to accept that they canevolve to evade antimicrobial drugs. (An additional risk fromintentionally disseminated diseases is discussed in the Clini-cal Focus.) Tuberculosis is a well-known re-emerging disease. Fifteen years ago, public health officials were convinced that tuber-culosis would soon disappear as a major health considerationin the United States. Then, because of a number of events,including the AIDS epidemic, thousands of infected individ-uals developed TB strains resistant to the conventional bat-tery of antibiotics. These individuals then passed on thenewly emerged, antibiotic-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis to others. While the rate of infection with M. tuberculosis in the United States increased sharply during the early part ofthe 1990s, by 1995 the incidence had begun to decline again.However, the worldwide incidence of the disease is still in-creasing, and the World Health Organization predicts that, between 1998 and 2020, one billion more people will becomeinfected and over 70 million will die from this disease if pre-ventive measures are not adopted. Another re-emerging disease is diphtheria. This disease was almost non-existent throughout Europe in recent yearsbecause of vaccination; in 1994, however, scattered cases werereported in some of the republics of the former Soviet Union.By 1995, there were over 50,000 cases reported in the sameregion, and thousands died from diphtheria infection. Thesocial upheaval and instability that came with the breakup ofthe Soviet Union was almost certainly a major factor in there-emergence of this disease, because of the resultant lapsesin public health measures\u2014perhaps most important was theloss of immunization programs. Since 1995, immunizationprograms have been re-established and the trend has re-versed, with only 13,687 cases of diphtheria reported in Rus-sian republics in 1996, 6932 in 1998, and 1573 in 2000. Other diseases have appeared seemingly from nowhere and, as far as we know, are new pathogens. These includeImmune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 407 TABLE 17-4 Emerging pathogens recognized since 1973 Year Pathogen Disease 1973 Rotavirus Major cause of infantile diarrhea globally 1974 Hepatitis C Non-A, non-B hepatitis commonly transmitted via transfusions 1976 Cryptosporidium parvum Acute chronic diarrhea 1977 Ebola virus Ebola haemorrhagic fever Legionella pneumophilia diseases distributed 1980 Human T-lymphotrophic virus I (HTLV- 1) T-cell lymphoma 1981 Toxin-producing strains of Toxic shock syndrome Staphylococcus aureus 1982 Escherichia coli 0157 :H7 Haemorrhagic colitis HTLV-II Hairy 1983 HIV AIDS pylori Peptic 1988 Hepatitis E Enteric non-A, virus Venezuelan Conjunctivitis, disseminated epidemic cholera Bartonella henselae Cat scratch disease 1994 Sabia virus Brazilian haemorrhagic fever 1995 Human herpes virus- 8 Associated with Kaposi sarcoma in AIDS patients 1996 TSE causing agent New variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (mad cow disease) 1997 Influenza A subtype H 5N1 Avian influenza 1999 Influenza A subtype H 9N2 New strain of human influenza Nipah virus EncephalitisWest Nile virus Encephalitis SOURCE: Adapted from M.

Ebola was first recognized after an out-break in Africa, in 1976. By 1977, the virus that causes thisdisease had been isolated and classified as a filovirus, a type of RNA virus that includes Marburg virus, a close relative ofEbola. Ebola causes a particularly severe haemorrhagic feverthat kills more than 50% of those infected. Because of the408 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease spread of the virus requires direct contact with infected fluids. More worrisome arepathogens that can be spread by aerosolcontact, such as anthrax, and toxins thatcan be added to food or water supplies,such as botulinum toxin. It is ironic that one of the most feared bioterrorism agents is smallpox, the tar-get of the first vaccine. Smallpox is causedby the virus Variola major; 30% or more of those infected with this virus die within amonth of exposure. Survivors may be hor-ribly scarred. Smallpox can spread rapidly,even before symptoms are visible. As de-scribed in Chapter 1, the vaccine for small- pox is a virus ( Vaccinia ) related to variola, which in most cases causes a localizedpustule that resolves within 3weeks. Smallpox disappeared as a consequenceof widespread vaccination\u2014the last re-ported case of natural infection was in1977 . As the disease was eradicated, vac- cination was discontinued. In the UnitedStates, vaccination ceased in 1972 . Pro- duction of the vaccine ceased and the re-maining doses were put into storage. Reasons for discontinuing smallpox vaccination include side effects that affectapproximately 40individuals per million vaccinees. These can be life threateningand take the form of encephalitis or dis-seminated skin infection. In addition, re-cently vaccinated individuals can spreadthe virus to others, especially those withcompromised immunity. The occasionalnegative reactions to vaccinia can betreated by the administration of immu-noglobulin isolated from sera of personspreviously vaccinated, but this so-calledVaccina IG, or VIG, is no longer produced and little remains available. Facing thethreat of smallpox as a bioterrorism agentmeans that vaccination must be reconsid-ered. It is unlikely that the vaccine pro-duced today will be the same one usedearlier. Vaccine was produced by infectionof the scarified skin of calves and viruswas collected by scraping the infectedarea. Most likely a new vaccine candidatewill be produced under controlled condi-tions in a tissue-cultured cell line that iscertified free of any contaminating viruses.Furthermore, the actual virus used may bea more highly attenuated form of vaccinia.Stocks of VIG must be replenished beforea mass vaccination effort is begun. Most of the viruses on the select agent list are not easy to disseminate.Agents of bioterrorism prepared in aform that allows easy dispersal are re-ferred to as weaponized. While nightmare scenarios include customized viralagents engineered in the laboratory, themore likely weaponized pathogens arebacteria. An accidental release of anthrax(Bacillus anthracis ) in Sverdlovsk in the former Soviet Union infected 79per- sons, of whom 68died, pointing to the deadly potential of this organism. In late2001 , mail containing anthrax (see the accompanying figure) infected a numberof persons in multiple postal centers asthe letters progressed to their destina-tions, giving a glimpse of how widely andrapidly a bioweapon might be spreadthrough modern infrastructure. Bacillus anthracis is a common veteri- nary pathogen, and like smallpox was thesubject of early vaccine efforts, in this caseby Louis Pasteur. Human infection wasfound mainly in those working with hair orhides from animals, especially goats. In-fection occurs via three different routes: IInhalation causes severe flu-like illness with high mortality unlessdiagnosed and treated immediatelyThe use of human patho- gens as weapons has a long history. LordJeffery Amherst used smallpox againstnative American populations before theRevolutionary War, and there are reportsof attempts to spread plague andanthrax in both the distant and recentpast. A few years ago, members of a dis-sident cult in Oregon introduced salmo-nella into the salad bars of severalrestaurants in an attempt cause sicknessand death. The more recent discovery ofanthrax spores mailed to congressmenand news offices accelerates our interestin possible agents of bioterrorism. Pathogens and toxins with potential for use as weapons are called \"selectagents\" and include bacteria, bacterialtoxins, and certain viruses (see table). Thethreat from such agents depends on boththe severity of the disease it causes andthe ease with which it can be dissemi-nated. For example, Ebola virus causes afulminating hemorraghic disease, butCLINICAL FOCUS The Threat of Infection from Potential Agents of Bioterrorism Category A agents of bioterrorism Anthrax ( Lassa,Machupo])severity of disease and the rapid progression to death after the initial appearance of symptoms, this virus has received agreat deal of attention. However, while the risk of death isvery high if you are infected with Ebola, it is fairly easy tocontrol the spread of the virus. Through isolation of infected individuals, hospital workers and medical personnel can beprotected. In such ways, the spread of Ebola virus has beencontained during the two most recent outbreaks.Immune Response to Infectious Diseases CHAPTER 17 409 used as bioweapons. Primate studies sug- gest that inhalation of 2500 to 55,000 spores will cause fatal disease, althoughthe number is controversial. Victims mayhave flu-like symptoms; a chest x-ray willreveal a characteristic widening of the me-diastinum, and blood smears will showgram-positive bacilli. Since prompt diag-nosis and treatment is required for sur-vival it is essential that medical personnelrecognize the disease. A vaccine has been developed for an- thrax, but its use has been limited to themilitary. The present preparation is a fil-trate from cultures of a non-spore-formingstrain of B. anthracis. Newly proposed vac- cines take advantage of the informationgained from basic studies of the mecha-nism used by the organism to infect targetcells, as well as our understanding of thestructure and function of anthrax-derived proteins. The major protein involved in in-fection is the so-called protective antigen,or PA, which pairs with either edema factor(EF) or lethal factor (LF) to cause produc-tive infection. Antibodies that target thebinding site on PA for either LF or EF arebeing developed as the next generation ofvaccines against anthrax. The threat from select agents of bioter- rorism, like that from emerging diseases,is being addressed by careful attention to unusual infection events, and by in-creased study of agents that lend them-selves to weaponization. Research todetermine the efficacy of various treat-ments and the windows of immunity thatresult from administration of antitoxinshave risen to top priority in the U.S. fol-lowing the events of September 11, 2001 .with antibiotics such as penicillin, doxycycline or ciprofloxacin. ICutaneous exposure results in skin lesions with characteristic blackdeep eschar. Cutaneous anthrax hasa 20% mortality if untreated, but usually responds to antibiotics. IGastrointestinal exposure results in ulcers in the ileum or cecum, bloodydiarrhea, and sepsis, and is nearlyalways fatal because of difficulty indiagnosis. B. anthracis is particularly deadly be- cause the bacillus forms spores that arequite stable to heat, dryness, sunlight, andother factors that normally limit pathogenviability. It is relatively simple to inducespore formation, and it is spores that are Letters to congressmen and news agencies that contained anthrax spores.

Of the 221 afflicted, 34 diedfrom the infection. The organism causing the disease was notknown, but further investigation led to the identification of abacterium that was named Legionella pneumophilia. This bacterium proliferates in cool, damp areas and can be foundin the condensing units of large commercial air-conditioningsystems. The air-conditioning system can produce an aerosolthat contains the bacteria, thus spreading the infectionthroughout the area served by the unit. This was determinedto be the source of the bacteria at the 1976 convention inPhiladelphia. Because the hazard of such aerosols is now rec-ognized, improved design of air-conditioning and plumbingsystems has greatly reduced the incidence of the disease. In 1999, a new virus emerged in the Western Hemisphere. West Nile virus was first isolated in Uganda in 1937, but untilrecently it was not found outside Africa and western Asia. In1999, West Nile virus was found in the New Y ork City metro-politan area and by summer 2002, incidence of West Nile viruswas reported in all but a few states in the Northwest, indicat-ing a rapid spread of this virus in a short period of time. WestNile virus belongs to a group of viruses known as flaviruses, agroup of viruses spread by insects, usually mosquitoes. Themost common reservoir of the virus is birds. Crows are partic-ularly sensitive to infection by this virus. Mosquitoes bite aninfected bird and, most commonly, the virus-infected mos-quito passes the virus to another bird. However, on occasion,the mosquito bites a human, infecting that individual with thevirus. Since West Nile is not contagious between humans, itcannot be spread among human populations. In all but a smallproportion of humans, West Nile infection does not cause dis-ease. Only in individuals with compromised immune func-tion is the virus a health hazard. Because this virus can crossthe blood-brain barrier in compromised individuals, it cancause life threatening encephalitis or meningitis and this isthe usual cause of death. Between 1999 and 2001, West Nilecaused 18 deaths and sickened 131 others. By September 6,2002, 954 cases of West Nile had been reported to CDC and43 people had died in the year 2002. These statistics indicatethat West Nile is spreading and is a virus to monitor carefully.Current public health control mechanisms include educationof the public regarding mosquito control. Why are these new diseases emerging and others re- emerging? One reason suggested by public-health officials isthe crowding of the world's poorest populations into verysmall places within huge cities. Another factor is the greatincrease in international travel; it is now easy to traverse theglobe in a very short time, making it possible for an individualto become infected on one continent and then spread the dis-ease to another continent tens of thousands of miles distant.Other features of modern life that may contribute includemass distribution of food, which exposes large populations topotentially contaminated food, and unhygienic food prepara-tion. The World Health Organization and the U. S. Center forDisease Control both actively monitor new infections and work together closely to detect and identify new infectiousagents and to provide up-to-date information for travelers toparts of the world where such agents may pose a risk. SUMMARY IInnate immune responses form the initial defense againstpathogens. These include physical barriers, such as skin, aswell as the nonspecific production of complement compo-nents and certain cytokines in response to infection by var-ious pathogens. IThe immune response to viral infections involves bothhumoral and cell-mediated components. Antibody to aviral receptor can block viral infections of host cells. How-ever, a number of viruses, including influenza, are able tomutate their receptor molecules and thus evade thehumoral antibody response (see Figure 17-6). Once a viralinfection has been established, cell-mediated immunityappears to be more important than humoral. IThe immune response to extracellular bacterial infectionsis generally mediated by antibody. Antibody can inducelocalized production of immune effector molecules of thecomplement system, thus facilitating development of aninflammatory response. Antibody can also activate com-plement-mediated lysis of the bacterium, neutralize tox-ins, and serve as an opsonin to increase phagocytosis.Some bacteria secrete protease enzymes that cleave IgAdimers, thus reducing the effectiveness of IgA in themucous secretions. Other bacteria escape phagocytosis byproducing surface capsules or proteins that inhibit adher-ence to phagocytes, by secreting toxins that kill phagocytes,or by their ability to survive within phagocytes. Host de-fense against intracellular bacteria depends largely IBoth humoral and cell-mediated immune in immunity to protozoan infections. Ingeneral, humoral antibody is effective against blood-bornestages of protozoan life-cycle, but once protozoans haveinfected host cells, cell-mediated immunity is necessary. Pro-tozoans escape immune response through several mech-anisms. Some\u2014notably, Trypanosoma brucei \u2014are covered by a glycoprotein coat that is constantly changed by a genetic-switch mechanism (see Figure 17-12). Others (includingPlasmodium, the causative agent of malaria) slough off their glycoprotein coat after antibody has bound to it. IHelminths are large parasites that normally do not multi-ply within cells. Because few of these organisms are carriedby an affected individual, immune-system exposure tohelminths is limited; consequently, only a low level of im-munity is induced. Although helminths generally are at-tacked by antibody-mediated defenses, these may be inef-fective. A cell-mediated response by CD4 +T cells plays a critical role in the response to Schistosoma.410 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseIEmerging and re-emerging pathogens include some that are newly described and others that had been thought to becontrolled by public-health practices. Factors leading tothe emergence of such pathogens include increased traveland intense crowding of some populations. References Alcami, A., and U. H.

Study Questions CLINICAL FOCUS QUESTION VIG is used to treat individuals who display complications following administration of the smallpoxvaccine. Where is VIG obtained and why is it frequently an effec-tive treatment? 1.The effect of the MHC on the immune response to peptides of the influenza virus nucleoprotein was studied in H-2 bmice that had been previously immunized with live influenza viri-ons.

Experience has shown that not every vaccine candidate that was successful in laboratory and animal stud-ies prevents disease in humans. Some potential vaccinescause unacceptable side effects, and some may even worsenthe disease they were meant to prevent. Live virus vaccinespose a special threat to those with primary or acquired im-munodeficiency (see Chapter 19). Stringent testing is an ab-solute necessity, because vaccines will be given to largenumbers of well persons. Adverse side effects, even those thatoccur at very low frequency, must be balanced against the po-tential benefit of protection by the vaccine. Vaccine development begins with basic research. Recent advances in immunology and molecular biology have led toeffective new vaccines and to promising strategies for findingnew vaccine candidates. Knowledge of the differences in epi-topes recognized by T cells and B cells has enabled immunol-ogists to begin to design vaccine candidates to maximizeactivation of both arms of the immune system. As differencesin antigen-processing pathways became evident, scientistsbegan to design vaccines and to use adjuvants that maximizeantigen presentation with class I or class II MHC molecules. chapter 18 IActive and Passive Immunization IDesigning Vaccines for Active Immunization IWhole-Organism Vaccines IPurified Subunit vaccination trials of Jenner andLouis Pasteur. Since those pioneering efforts, vac- cines have been developed for many diseases that were oncemajor afflictions of mankind. The incidence of diseases suchas diphtheria, measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough),rubella (German measles), poliomyelitis, and tetanus has de-clined dramatically as vaccination has become more com-mon. Clearly, vaccination is a cost-effective weapon fordisease prevention. Perhaps in no other case have the bene-fits of vaccination been as dramatically evident as in theeradication of smallpox, one of mankind's long-standingand most terrible scourges. Since October 1977, not a singlenaturally acquired smallpox case has been reported any-where in the world. Equally encouraging is the predictederadication of polio. The last recorded case of naturally ac-quired polio in the Western Hemisphere occurred in Peru in1991, and the World Health Organization (WHO) predictsthat paralytic polio will be eradicated throughout the worldwithin the next few years. A new addition to the weaponsagainst childhood disease is a vaccine against bacterial pneu-monia, a major cause of infant death. A crying need remains for vaccines against other diseases. Every year, millions throughout the world die from malaria,tuberculosis, and AIDS, diseases for which there are no effec-tive vaccines. It is estimated by the World Health Organiza-tion that 16,000 individuals a day, or 5.8 million a year,become infected with HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS. Aneffective vaccine could have an immense impact on the con-trol of this tragic spread of death and disaster. In addition tothe challenges presented by diseases for which no vaccines ex-ist, there remains the need to improve the safety and efficacyof present vaccines and to find ways to lower their cost anddeliver them efficiently to all who need them, especially in de-veloping countries of the world. The WHO estimates thatmillions of infant deaths in the world are due to diseases thatcould be prevented by existing vaccines (see Clinical Focus). The road to successful development of a vaccine that can be approved for human use, manufactured at reasonablecost, and efficiently delivered to at-risk populations is costly,long, and tedious. Procedures for manufacture of materialsthat can be tested in humans and the ways they are tested inclinical trials are regulated closely. Even those candidate vac-cines that survive initial scrutiny and are approved for use inhuman trials are not guaranteed to find their way into Vaccination with DNA414 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease recently of a causal relationship between vaccination and autism, a condition ofunknown etiology. Most such reportsare based solely on the coincidental tim-ing of vaccination and onset of disease,or on limited sampling and poor statisti-cal analyses. So far, no alleged asso-ciations have withstood scrutiny that included large population samples andacceptable statistical methods. While children in this country are pro- tected against a variety of once-deadlydiseases, this protection depends oncontinuation of our immunization pro-grams. Dependency on herd immunity isdangerous for both the individual andsociety. Adverse reactions to vaccinesmust be examined thoroughly, of course,and if a vaccine causes unacceptableside reactions, the vaccination programmust be reconsidered. At the same time,anecdotal reports of disease brought onby vaccines, and unsupported beliefs, such as the contention that vaccinesweaken the immune system, must becountered by correct information fromtrusted sources. To retreat from ourprogress in immunization by noncom-pliance will return us to the age whenmeasles, mumps, whooping cough, andpolio were part of the risk of growing up. Children in the developing world suf- fer from a problem different from thosein the United States. Examination of in-fant deaths worldwide shows that exist-ing vaccines could save the lives ofmillions of children. As seen in the table,there are safe, effective vaccines for fiveof the top ten killers of children. Al-though the list of diseases in the table in-cludes HIV, TB, and malaria, for whichno vaccines are available, administrationof the vaccines that are recommendedfor infants in the United States could cutchild mortality in the world by approxi-mately half. What barriers exist to the achievement of worldwide vaccination and completeeradication of many childhood diseases?The inability to achieve higher levels of Many previously common childhood diseases are seldom seen inthe United States, a testament to the ef-fectiveness of vaccination. A major bar-rier to similar success in the rest of theworld is the difficulty of delivering vac-cines to all children. However, even athome the U.S. is becoming a victim ofits own success. Some parents whohave never encountered diseases nownearly vanquished in the U.S. do notconsider it important to have their in-fants vaccinated or they may be lax inadhering to recommended schedules ofimmunization. Others hold the unin-formed belief that the risks associatedwith vaccination outweigh the risk of in-fection. This flawed reasoning is fueledby periodic allegations of linkage be-tween vaccination and various disor-ders, such as the report circulatingCLINICAL FOCUS Vaccination: Challenges in the U.S. and Developing Countries Genetic engineering techniques can be used to develop vac- cines to maximize the immune response to selected epitopesand to simplify delivery of the vaccines. This chapter de-scribes the vaccines now in use and describes vaccine strate-gies, including experimental designs that may lead to thevaccines of the future. Active and Passive Immunization Immunity to infectious microorganisms can be achieved byactive or passive immunization . In each case, immunity can be acquired either by natural processes (usually by transferfrom mother to fetus or by previous infection by the organ-ism) or by artificial means such as injection of antibodies orvaccines (Table 18-1, on page 416). The agents used for in-ducing passive immunity include antibodies from humans oranimals, whereas active immunization is achieved by inocu-lation with microbial pathogens that induce immunity butdo not cause disease or with antigenic components from the pathogens. This section describes current usage of passiveand active immunization techniques. Passive Immunization Involves Transfer of Preformed Antibodies Jenner and Pasteur are recognized as the pioneers of vaccina- tion, or induction of active immunity, but similar recogni-tion is due to Emil von Behring and Hidesaburo Kitasato fortheir contributions to passive immunity. These investigatorswere the first to show that immunity elicited in one animalcan be transferred to another by injecting it with serum fromthe first (see Clinical Focus, Chapter 4). Passive immunization, in which preformed antibodies are transferred to a recipient, occurs naturally by transfer of ma-ternal antibodies across the placenta to the developing fetus.Maternal antibodies to diphtheria, tetanus, streptococci,rubeola, rubella, mumps, and poliovirus all afford pas-sively acquired protection to the developing fetus. Maternal antibodies present in colostrum and milk also provide pas- sive immunity to the infant. Passive immunization can also be achieved by injecting a recipient with preformed antibodies. In the past, before vac-cines and antibiotics became available, passive immunizationprovided a major defense against various infectious diseases.Despite the risks (see Chapter 16) incurred by injecting ani-mal sera, usually horse serum, this was the only effective ther-apy for otherwise fatal diseases. Currently, there are severalconditions that warrant the use of passive immunization.These include: IDeficiency in synthesis of antibody as a result ofcongenital or acquired B-cell defects, alone or togetherwith other immunodeficiencies. IExposure or likely exposure to a disease that will causecomplications (e.g., a child with leukemia exposed tovaricella or measles), or when time does not permitadequate protection by active immunization.Vaccines CHAPTER 18 415 IInfection by pathogens whose effects may be amelioratedby antibody. For example, if individuals who have notreceived up-to-date active immunization against tetanussuffer a puncture wound, they are given an injection ofhorse antiserum to tetanus toxin. The preformed horseantibody neutralizes any tetanus toxin produced byClostridium tetani in the wound. Passive immunization is routinely administered to indi- viduals exposed to botulism, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis,measles, and rabies (Table 18-2). Passively administered anti-serum is also used to provide protection from poisonoussnake and insect bites. Passive immunization can provide im-mediate protection to travelers or health-care workers whowill soon be exposed to an infectious organism and lack ac-tive immunity to it. Because passive immunization does notactivate the immune system, it generates no memory re-sponse and the protection provided is transient.

Evenif we assume that suitable vaccines havebeen developed and that compliance isuniversal, the ability to produce and deliverthe vaccines everywhere is a profoundchallenge. The World Health Organization(WHO) has stated that the ideal vaccinewould have the following properties: IAffordable worldwide IHeat stable IEffective after a single dose IApplicable to a number of diseases IAdministered by a mucosal route ISuitable for administration early in life Few, if any, vaccines in common use to- day conform to all of these properties.However, the WHO goals can guide us inthe pursuit of vaccines useful for world-wide application. They further aid us insetting priorities, especially for develop-ment of the vaccines needed most in de-veloping countries. For example, anHIV/AIDS vaccine that meets the WHOcriteria could have an immediate effecton the world AIDS epidemic, whereasone that does not will require further de- velopment before it reaches the popula-tions most at risk. Immunization saves millions of lives, and viable vaccines are increasingly avail-able. The challenge to the biomedical re- search community is to develop better,safer, cheaper, easier-to-administer formsof these vaccines so that worldwide im-munization becomes a reality.immunization is the best preventative currently available. A monoclonal antibody or a combination of two monoclonalantibodies may be administered to children at risk for RSVdisease. These monoclonal antibodies are prepared in micebut have been \"humanized\" by splicing the constant regionsof human IgG to the mouse variable regions (see Chapter 5).This modification prevents many of the complications thatmay follow a second injection of the complete mouse anti-body, which is a highly immunogenic foreign protein. Although passive immunization may be an effective treatment, it should be used with caution because certainrisks are associated with the injection of preformed antibody. If the antibody was produced in another species,such as a horse, the recipient can mount a strong responseto the isotypic determinants of the foreign antibody. Thisanti-isotype response can cause serious complications.Some individuals, for example, produce IgE antibody specific for determinants on the injected antibody. Immune complexes of this IgE bound to the passively administeredantibody can mediate systemic mast cell degranulation,leading to systemic anaphylaxis. Other individuals produceIgG or IgM antibodies specific for the foreign antibody,which form complement-activating immune complexes.The deposition of these complexes in the tissues can lead totype III hypersensitive reactions. Even when human gammaglobulin is administered passively, the recipient can gener-ate an anti-allotype response to the human immunoglobu-lin, although its intensity is usually much less than that ofan anti-isotype response. Active Immunization Elicits Long-Term Protection Whereas the aim of passive immunization is transient pro- tection or alleviation of an existing condition, the goal of ac-tive immunization is to elicit protective immunity andimmunologic memory. When active immunization is suc-cessful, a subsequent exposure to the pathogenic agent elicitsa heightened immune response that successfully eliminatesthe pathogen or prevents disease mediated by its products.Active immunization can be achieved by natural infectionwith a microorganism, or it can be acquired artificially by ad-ministration of a vaccine (see Table 18-1).

Vaccination of children is begun at about 2 months of age. The recommended program of childhood immunizations inthis country, updated in 2002 by the American Academy ofPediatrics, is outlined in Table 18-3. The program includesthe IHepatitis B (Salk) polio vaccine (IPV); the oral (Sabin)vaccine is no longer recommended for use in the UnitedStates IMeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combined vaccine IHaemophilus vaccine for chickenpoxIPneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV); a new addition to the list. In addition, hepatitis A vaccine at 18 months and influenza vaccines after 6 months are recommended for infants inhigh-risk populations. The introduction and spreading use of various vaccines for childhood immunization has led to a dramatic decreasein the incidence of common childhood diseases in the UnitedStates (Figure 18-1). The comparisons of disease incidence in1999 to that reported in the peak years show dramatic dropsand, in one case, complete elimination of the disease in theUnited States. As long as widespread, effective immunizationprograms are maintained, the incidence of these childhooddiseases should remain low. However, the occurrence of sidereactions to a vaccine may cause a drop in its use, which canlead to re-emergence of that disease. For example, the side ef-fects from the pertussis attenuated bacterial vaccine includedseizures, encephalitis, brain damage, and even death. De-creased usage of the vaccine led to an increase in the inci-Vaccines CHAPTER 18 417 TABLE 18-3 Recommended childhood immunization schedule in the United States, 2002 AGE Vaccine * Birth 1mo the recommended ages for routine administration of currently licensed childhood vaccines. Bars indicate ranges of recommended ages. Any dose not given at the recommended age should be given as a \"catch-up\" immunization at any subsequent visit when indicated and feasible. Different schedules exist depending upon the HBsAg status of the mother. A first vaccination after the first month is recommended only if the mother is HBsAg negative. DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) is the preferred vaccine for all doses in the immunization series. Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids) is recommended at 11-12 years of age if at least 5years have elapsed since the last dose. \u00a7Only inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccine is now recommended for use in the United States. However, OPV remains the vaccine of choice for mass immunization campaigns to control outbreaks due to wild poliovirus. #Varicella (Var) vaccine is recommended at any visit on or after the first birthday for susceptible children, i.e., those who lack a reliable history of chickenpox (as judged by a health-care provider) and who have not been immunized. Susceptible persons 13years of age or older should receive 2doses, given at least 4weeks apart. SOURCE: Adapted from the ECBT Web site (see references); approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics.Multiple immunizations with the polio vaccine are required to ensure that an adequate immune response is generated to each of the three strains of poliovirus that make up thevaccine. Recommendations for vaccination of adults depend on the risk group. Vaccines for meningitis, pneumonia, and in-fluenza are often given to groups living in close quarters (e.g.,military recruits) or to individuals with reduced immunity(e.g., the elderly). Depending on their destination, interna-tional travelers are also routinely immunized against suchendemic diseases as cholera, yellow fever, plague, typhoid,hepatitis, meningitis, typhus, and polio. Immunizationagainst the deadly disease anthrax had been reserved forworkers coming into close contact with infected animals orproducts from them. Recently, however, suspected use ofanthrax spores by terrorists or in biological warfare haswidened use of the vaccine to military personnel and civil-ians in areas at risk of attack with this deadly agent. Vaccination is not 100% effective. With any vaccine, a small percentage of recipients will respond poorly and there-fore will not be adequately protected. This is not a seriousproblem if the majority of the population is immune to aninfectious agent. In this case, the chance of a susceptible individual contacting an infected individual is so low that the susceptible one is not likely to become infected. This phenomenon is known as herd immunity . The appearance of measles epidemics among college students and unvaccinatedpreschool-age children in the United States during the mid-to late 1980s resulted partly from an overall decrease in vac-cinations, which had lowered the herd immunity of the pop-ulation (Figure 18-2). Among preschool-age children, 88%of those who developed measles were unvaccinated. Most ofthe college students who contracted measles had been vacci-nated as children, but only once; the failure of the single vac-cination to protect them may have resulted from the presenceof passively acquired maternal antibodies that reduced theiroverall response to the vaccine. The increase in the incidenceof measles prompted the recommendation that children receive two immunizations with the combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, one at 12-15 months of age and thesecond at 4-6 years. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has called atten- tion to the decline in vaccination rates and herd immunityamong American children. For example, a 1995 publicationreported that in California nearly one-third of all infants areunvaccinated and about half of all children under the age of2 are behind schedule on their vaccinations. Such a decreasein herd immunity portends serious consequences, as illus-trated by recent events in the newly independent states of theformer Soviet Union. By the mid-1990s, a diphtheria epi-demic was raging in many regions of these new countries,linked to a decrease in herd immunity resulting from de-creased vaccination rates after the breakup of the SovietUnion. This epidemic, which led to over 157,000 cases ofdiptheria and 5000 deaths, is now controlled by mass immu-nization programs.418 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Paralytic polio 0 cases 19341952 of cases of rubella (Ger- man measles), polio, pertussis (whooping cough), mumps, measles,and diphtheria in the United States in the peak year for which data areavailable (orange) compared with the number of cases of each dis-ease in 1999 (green). Currently, vaccines are available for each of these diseases, and vaccination is recommended for all children in theUnited States. [Data from Centers for Disease Control.] dence of whooping cough, with 7405 cases in 1998. The re- cent development of an acellular pertussis vaccine that is aseffective as the older vaccine, but with none of the side ef-fects, is expected to reverse this trend. As indicated in Table 18-3, children typically require multiple boosters (repeated inoculations) at appropriatelytimed intervals to achieve effective immunity. In the firstmonths of life, the reason for this may be persistence of cir-culating maternal antibodies in the young infant. For exam-ple, passively acquired maternal antibodies bind to epitopeson the DPT vaccine and block adequate activation of the im-mune system; therefore, this vaccine must be given severaltimes after the maternal antibody has been cleared from aninfant's circulation in order to achieve adequate immunity.Passively acquired maternal antibody also interferes with theeffectiveness of the measles vaccine; for this reason, theMMR vaccine is not given before 12-15 months of age. InThird World countries, however, the measles vaccine is ad-ministered at 9 months, even though maternal antibodiesare still present, because 30%-50% of young children inthese countries contract the disease before 15 months of age.Designing Vaccines for Active Immunization Several factors must be kept in mind in developing a success- ful vaccine. First and foremost, the development of an im-mune response does not necessarily mean that a state ofprotective immunity has been achieved. What is often criticalis which branch of the immune system is activated, andtherefore vaccine designers must recognize the importantdifferences between activation of the humoral and the cell-mediated branches. A second factor is the development ofimmunologic memory. For example, a vaccine that induces aprotective primary response may fail to induce the formationof memory cells, leaving the host unprotected after the pri-mary response to the vaccine subsides. The role of memory cells in immunity depends, in part, on the incubation period of the pathogen. In the case ofinfluenza virus, which has a very short incubation period (1or 2 days), disease symptoms are already under way by thetime memory cells are activated. Effective protection againstinfluenza therefore depends on maintaining high levels ofneutralizing antibody by repeated immunizations; those athighest risk are immunized each year. For pathogens with alonger incubation period, maintaining detectable neutraliz-ing antibody at the time of infection is not necessary. The poliovirus, for example, requires more than 3 days to begin toinfect the central nervous system. An incubation period ofthis length gives the memory B cells time to respond by producing high levels of serum antibody. Thus, the vaccinefor polio is designed to induce high levels of immunologicmemory. After immunization with the Salk vaccine, serumantibody levels peak within 2 weeks and then decline, but thememory response continues to climb, reaching maximal lev- els at 6 months and persisting for years (Figure 18-3). If animmunized individual is later exposed to the poliovirus,these memory cells will respond by differentiating intoplasma cells that produce high levels of serum antibody,which defend the individual from the infection. In the remainder of this chapter, various approaches to the design of vaccines\u2014both currently used vaccines and ex-perimental ones\u2014are described, with an examination oftheir ability to induce humoral and cell-mediated immunityand the production of memory cells.Vaccines CHAPTER 18 419 FIGURE 18-2 Introduction of the measles vaccine in 1962 led to a dramatic decrease in the annual incidence of this disease in theUnited States. Occasional outbreaks of measles in the 1980 s (inset)occurred mainly among unvaccinated young children and among college students; most of the latter had been vaccinated, but onlyonce, when they were young.

Induction of immunologic mem- ory follows a slower time course, reaching maximal levels 6months after vaccination. The persistence of the memory response for yearsafter primary vaccination is responsible for immunity to polio-myelitis. [From M. Zanetti et al., 1987,Immunol. Today 8:18.]Whole-Organism Vaccines As Table 18-4 indicates, many of the common vaccines cur- rently in use consist of inactivated (killed) or live but attenu-ated (avirulent) bacterial cells or viral particles. The primarycharacteristics of these two types of vaccines are compared inTable 18-5 to one another and to DNA vaccines that are cur-rently being tested for use in humans. Attenuated Viruses and Bacteria Cause Immunity Without Disease In some cases, microorganisms can be attenuated so that they lose their ability to cause significant disease (pathogenicity)but retain their capacity for transient growth within an inoc-ulated host. Attenuation often can be achieved by growing apathogenic bacterium or virus for prolonged periods underabnormal culture conditions. This procedure selects mutantsthat are better suited to growth in the abnormal culture con-ditions and are therefore less capable of growth in the naturalhost. For example, an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bo- viscalled Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was developed by growing M. bovis on a medium containing increasing con- centrations of bile. After 13 years, this strain had adapted togrowth in strong bile and had become sufficiently attenuatedthat it was suitable as a vaccine for tuberculosis. The Sabinpolio vaccine and the measles vaccine both consist of attenu-ated viral strains. The poliovirus used in the Sabin vaccinewas attenuated by growth in monkey kidney epithelial cells.The measles vaccine contains a strain of rubella virus thatwas grown in duck embryo cells and later in human cell lines. Attenuated vaccines have advantages and disadvantages. Because of their capacity for transient growth, such vaccinesprovide prolonged immune-system exposure to the individ-ual epitopes on the attenuated organisms, resulting in in-creased immunogenicity and production of memory cells. Asa consequence, these vaccines often require only a single im-munization, eliminating the need for repeated boosters. Thisproperty is a major advantage in Third World countries,where epidemiologic studies have shown that roughly 20% ofindividuals fail to return for each subsequent booster. Theability of many attenuated vaccines to replicate within hostcells makes them particularly suitable for inducing a cell-mediated response. The Sabin polio vaccine, consisting of three attenuated strains of poliovirus, is administered orally to children on asugar cube or in sugar liquid. The attenuated viruses colonizethe intestine and induce protective immunity to all threestrains of virulent poliovirus. Sabin vaccine in the intestinesinduces production of secretory IgA, which serves as an im-portant defense against naturally acquired poliovirus. Thevaccine also induces IgM and IgG classes of antibody. Unlikemost other attenuated vaccines, which require a single im-munizing dose, the Sabin polio vaccine requires boosters,420 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 18-4Classification of common vaccines for humans Disease or pathogen Type of vaccine WHOLE ORGANISMS Bacterial cells Anthrax Inactivated InactivatedPertussis Recombinant surface antigen (HBsAg) *There is an now also an acellular pertussis vaccine consisting of toxoids and inactivated bacteria components. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is an avirulent strain of Mycobacterium bovis.Vaccines CHAPTER 18 421 because the three strains of attenuated poliovirus in the vac- cine interfere with each other's replication in the intestine.With the first immunization, one strain will predominate inits growth, inducing immunity to that strain. With the sec-ond immunization, the immunity generated by the previousimmunization will limit the growth of the previously pre-dominant strain in the vaccine, enabling one of the two re-maining strains to predominate and induce immunity.Finally, with the third immunization, immunity to all threestrains is achieved. A major disadvantage of attenuated vaccines is the possi- bility that they will revert to a virulent form. The rate ofreversion of the Sabin polio vaccine (OPV) leading to subse-quent paralytic disease is about one case in 2.4 million dosesof vaccine. This reversion implies that pathogenic forms ofthe virus are being passed by a few immunized individualsand can find their way into the water supply, especially in ar-eas where sanitation standards are not rigorous or wherewaste water must be recycled. This possibility has led to theexclusive use of the inactivated polio vaccine in this country(see Table 18-3). The projected eradication of paralytic polio(Figure 18-4) will be impossible as long as OPV is used any-where in the world. The alternative inactivated Salk vaccineshould be substituted as the number of cases decrease, al-though there are problems in delivering this vaccine in devel-oping countries. Attenuated vaccines also may be associated with compli- cations similar to those seen in the natural disease. A smallpercentage of recipients of the measles vaccine, for example,develop post-vaccine encephalitis or other complications. Asshown in Table 18-6 (page 423), however, the risk of vaccine-related complications is much lower than risks from infec-tion. An independent study showed that 75 million doses ofmeasles vaccine were given between 1970 and 1993, with anincidence of 48 cases of vaccine-related encephalopathy. Thelow in-cidence of this side effect compared with the rate ofencephalopathy associated with infection argues for the effi-cacy of the vaccine. A more convincing argument for vacci- nation is the high death rate associated with measles infec-tion even in developed countries. Genetic engineering techniques provide a way to attenu- ate a virus irreversibly by selectively removing genes that arenecessary for virulence. This has been done with a her-pesvirus vaccine for pigs, in which the thymidine kinase genewas removed. Because thymidine kinase is required for thevirus to grow in certain types of cells (e.g., neurons), removalof this gene rendered the virus incapable of causing disease.It is possible that similar genetic engineering techniquescould eliminate the risk of reversion of the attenuated poliovaccine. More recently, a vaccine against rotavirus, a majorcause of infant diarrhea, was developed using genetic engi-neering techniques to modify an animal rotavirus to containantigens present on the human viruses. Pathogenic Organisms Are Inactivated by Heat or Chemical Treatment Another common approach in vaccine production is inacti- vation of the pathogen by heat or by chemical means so thatit is no longer capable of replication in the host. It is criticallyimportant to maintain the structure of epitopes on surfaceantigens during inactivation. Heat inactivation is generallyunsatisfactory because it causes extensive denaturation ofproteins; thus, any epitopes that depend on higher orders ofprotein structure are likely to be altered significantly. Chem-ical inactivation with formaldehyde or various alkylatingagents has been successful. The Salk polio vaccine is pro-duced by formaldehyde inactivation. Attenuated vaccines generally require only one dose to induce long-lasting immunity. Killed vaccines, on theother hand, often require repeated boosters to maintainthe immune status of the host. In addition, killed vaccinesinduce a predominantly humoral antibody response; theyare less effective than attenuated vaccines in inducing TABLE 18-5 Comparison of attenuated (live), inactivated (killed), and DNA vaccines Characteristic Attenuated vaccine Inactivated vaccine DNA vaccine Production Selection for avirulent organisms: Virulent pathogen is inactivated by Easily manufactured virulent pathogen is grown under chemicals or irradiation with /H9253-rays and purified adverse culture conditions or prolonged passage of a virulent human pathogen through different hosts Booster requirement Generally requires only a single Requires multiple boosters Single injection may suffice booster Relative stability Less stable More stable Highly stableType of immunity induced Humoral and cell-mediated Mainly humoral Humoral and cell-mediatedReversion tendency May revert to virulent form Cannot revert to virulent form Cannot revertcell-mediated immunity and in eliciting a secretory IgA response. Even though they contain killed pathogens, inactivated whole-organism vaccines are still associated with certainrisks. A serious complication with the first Salk vaccines arose when formaldehyde failed to kill all the virus in twovaccine lots, which caused paralytic polio in a high percent-age of recipients.422 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease FIGURE 18-4 Progress toward the worldwide eradication of polio. Comparison of infection numbers for 1988 with those for 1998 show considerable progress in most parts of the world. Some expertsquestion whether the use of live attenuated oral polio vaccine willcause reversion to pathogenic forms at a rate sufficiently high to pre- vent total eradication of this once prevalent crippling disease. [Data from WHO.]0 casesReported polio cases 1988 1-10 cases More than 10 casesNo report 0 cases1998 1-10 cases More than 10 casesNo report Purified Macromolecules as Vaccines Some of the risks associated with attenuated or killed whole- organism vaccines can be avoided with vaccines that consistof specific, purified macromolecules derived from patho-gens. Three general forms of such vaccines are in current use:inactivated exotoxins, capsular Bacterial Polysaccharide Capsules Are Used as Vaccines The virulence of some pathogenic bacteria depends primarily on the antiphagocytic properties of their hydrophilic polysac-charide capsule. Coating of the capsule with antibodies and/or complement greatly increases the ability of macrophagesand neutrophils to phagocytose such pathogens. These find-ings provide the rationale for vaccines consisting of purifiedcapsular polysaccharides. The current vaccine for Streptococcus pneumoniae ,w h i c h causes pneumococcal pneumonia, consists of 23 antigeni-cally different capsular polysaccharides. The vaccine inducesformation of opsonizing antibodies and is now on the list ofvaccines recommended for all infants. The vaccine for Neisse- ria meningitidis , a common cause of bacterial meningitis, also consists of purified capsular polysaccharides. One limitation of polysaccharide vaccines is their inabil- ity to activate T Hcells. They activate B cells in a thymus- independent type 2 (TI-2) manner, resulting in IgM produc-tion but little class switching, no affinity maturation, and little,if any, development of memory cells. Several investigators havereported the induction of IgA-secreting plasma cells in hu- mans receiving subcutaneous immunization with the pneu-mococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In this case, since T Hcells are not involved in the response, the vaccine may activate IgA-specific memory B cells previously generated by naturally-occurring bacterial antigens at mucosal surfaces. Because thesebacteria have both polysaccharide and protein epitopes, theywould activate T Hcells, which in turn could mediate class switching and memory-cell formation. One way to involve T Hcells directly in the response to a polysaccharide antigen is to conjugate the antigen to somesort of protein carrier. For example, the vaccine for Haemo- philus influenzae type b (Hib), the major cause of bacterial meningitis in children less than 5 years of age, consists oftype b capsular polysaccharide covalently linked to conjugateis considerably more immunogenic than the polysaccharidealone, and because it activates T Hcells, it enables class switch- ing from IgM to IgG. Although this type of vaccine can in-duce memory B cells, it cannot induce memory T cellsspecific for the pathogen. In the case of the Hib vaccine, it ap-pears that the memory B cells can be activated to some degreein the absence of a population of memory T Hcells, thus ac- counting for the efficacy of this vaccine. Toxoids Are Manufactured from Bacterial Toxins Some bacterial pathogens, including those that cause diph- theria and tetanus, produce exotoxins. These exotoxins produce many of the disease symptoms that result from Vaccines CHAPTER 18 423 TABLE 18-6Risk of complications from natural measles infection compared with known risks of vaccination with a live attenuated virus in immunocompetent individuals Complication Risk after natural disease * Risk after vaccination Otitis media 7-9% 0 Pneumonia 1-6% 0 Diarrhea 66% 0 encephalomyelitis 0.5-1 per 0 Thrombocytopenia \u20141per 30,000\u00a7 Death 0.1-1 per 1000 (up to 5-15 % in 0 developing countries) *Risk after natural measles are calculated in terms of events per number of cases. Risks after vaccination are calculated in terms of events per number of doses. Although there have been several reports of thrombocytopenia occurring after measles including bleeding, the risk has not been properly quantified. \u00a7This risk has been reported after MMR vaccination and cannot only be attributed to the Diphtheria tetanus vaccines, for example, can be made by purifying the bacterial exotoxin and then inacti-vating the toxin with formaldehyde to form a toxoid . Vacci- nation with the toxoid induces anti-toxoid antibodies, whichare also capable of binding to the toxin and neutralizing itseffects. Conditions for the production of toxoid vaccinesmust be closely controlled to achieve detoxification withoutexcessive modification of the epitope structure. The problemof obtaining sufficient quantities of the purified toxins toprepare the vaccines has been overcome by cloning the exo-toxin genes and then expressing them in easily grown hostcells. In this way, large quantities of the exotoxin can be pro-duced, purified, and subsequently inactivated. Proteins from Pathogens Are Produced by Recombinant Techniques Theoretically, the gene encoding any immunogenic protein can be cloned and expressed in bacterial, yeast, or mam-malian cells using recombinant DNA technology. A numberof genes encoding surface antigens from viral, bacterial, andprotozoan pathogens have been successfully cloned into bac-terial, yeast, insect, or mammalian expression systems, andthe expressed antigens used for vaccine development. Thefirst such recombinant antigen vaccine approved for humanuse is the hepatitis B vaccine. This vaccine was developed bycloning the gene for the major surface antigen of hepatitis Bvirus (HBsAg) and expressing it in yeast cells. The recombi-nant yeast cells are grown in large fermenters, and HBsAg accumulates in the cells. The yeast cells are harvested and disrupted by high pressure, releasing the recombinantHBsAg, which is then purified by conventional biochemicaltechniques. This recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has beenshown to induce the production of protective antibodies.This vaccine holds much promise for the 250 million carriersof chronic hepatitis B worldwide! Use of Synthetic Peptides as Vaccines Has Progressed Slowly Although once considered very promising, the use of syn- thetic peptides as vaccines has not progressed as originallyprojected. Peptides are not as immunogenic as proteins, andit is difficult to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity tothem. The use of conjugates and adjuvants can assist in rais-ing protective immunity to peptides, but barriers to thewidespread use of peptide vaccines remain and pose an in-teresting problem for immunologists. Most importantly, ad-vances in techniques to produce recombinant proteins orfragments of proteins in transfected cell culture have re-moved the impetus to develop vaccines based on syntheticpeptides. Nonetheless, there remains theoretical interest inimmunity to them, and studies of peptide immunity maygenerate insights leading to new vaccines. Construction of synthetic peptides for use as vaccines to induce either humoral or cell-mediated immunity requiresan understanding of the nature of T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Ideally, vaccines for inducing humoral in-clude peptides that form immunodominant B-cell epitopes.Such epitopes can be identified by determining the dominantantibody in the sera of individuals who are recovering from adisease and then testing various synthetic peptides for theirability to react with that antibody with high affinity. A suc-cessful vaccine must also generate a population of memoryT Hcells; therefore the peptide should include Since MHC molecules differ in theirability to present peptides to T cells, MHC polymorphismwithin a species influences the level of T-cell response by dif-ferent individuals to different peptides. Moreover, differentsubpopulations of T cells probably recognize different epi-topes. Experiments by E. Sercarz have identified nonoverlap-ping amino acid sequences within hen egg-white lysozymethat induce a strong helper response to an antigen and otherpeptides that induce immunologic suppression. For exam-ple, immunization with the amino-terminal residues 1-17 ofhen egg-white lysozyme suppressed the response to nativelysozyme. By identifying suppressor peptides and eliminat-ing them from synthetic vaccines, it might be possible to gen-erate enhanced immunity. Recombinant-Vector Vaccines Genes that encode major antigens of especially virulentpathogens can be introduced into attenuated viruses or bac-teria. The attenuated organism serves as a vector, replicatingwithin the host and expressing the gene product of thepathogen. A number of organisms have been used for vectorvaccines, vaccinia virus, the Mycobacterium bovis, and certain strains of streptococcus that normally exist in the oral cavity. Vaccinia virus, the attenuated vaccine used to eradicate smallpox, has been widely employed as a vector vaccine. Thislarge, complex virus, with a genome of about 200 genes, can beengineered to carry several dozen foreign genes without im-pairing its capacity to infect host cells and replicate. The proce-dure for producing a vaccinia vector that carries a foreign genefrom a pathogen is outlined in Figure 18-5. The genetically en-gineered vaccinia expresses high levels of the inserted geneproduct, which can then serve as a potent immunogen in aninoculated host. Like the smallpox vaccine, genetically engi-neered vaccinia vector vaccines can be administered simply byscratching the skin, causing a localized infection in host cells. Ifthe foreign gene product expressed by the vaccinia is a viral en-velope protein, it is inserted into the membrane of the infectedhost cell, inducing development of cell-mediated immunity aswell as antibody-mediated immunity. Other attenuated-vector vaccines may prove to be safer than the vaccinia vaccine. The canarypox virus has recentlybeen tried as a vector vaccine. Like its relative vaccinia, the ca-narypox virus is large and easily engineered to carry multiple424 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseVaccines CHAPTER 18 425 Tissue-culture cellsRestriction-enzyme Gene from Transfection BUdr Recombinant vaccinia vector vaccinePlasmid FIGURE 18-5 Production of vaccinia vector vaccine.

Unlike vaccinia, the canarypox virus does not appear to be virulent even in individuals with severe immune suppres-sion. Another possible vector is an attenuated strain of Salmo- nella typhimurium , which has been engineered with genesfrom the bacterium that causes cholera. The advantage of this vector vaccine is that Salmonella infects cells of the mucosal lining of the gut and therefore will induce secretory IgA pro-duction. Effective immunity against a number of diseases,including cholera and gonorrhea, depends on increased pro-duction of secretory IgA at mucous membrane surfaces. Simi-lar strategies using bacteria that are a normal part of oral floraare in development. The strategy would involve introductionof genes encoding antigens from pathogenic organisms intobacterial strains that inhabit the oral cavity or respiratory tract.Eliciting immunity at the mucosal surface could provide excel-lent protection at the portal used by the pathogen. DNA Vaccines In a recently developed vaccination strategy, plasmid DNAencoding antigenic proteins is injected directly into the mus-cle of the recipient. Muscle cells take up the DNA and the encoded protein antigen is expressed, leading to both a humoral antibody response and a cell-mediated response.What is most surprising about this finding is that the injectedDNA is taken up and expressed by the muscle cells withmuch greater efficiency than in tissue culture. The DNA ap-pears either to integrate into the chromosomal DNA or to bemaintained for long periods in an episomal form. The viralantigen is expressed not only by the muscle cells but also bydendritic cells in the area that take up the plasmid DNA andexpress the viral antigen. The fact that muscle cells expresslow levels of class I MHC molecules and do not express co-stimulatory molecules suggests that local dendritic cells maybe crucial to the development of antigenic responses to DNAvaccines (Figure 18-6). DNA vaccines offer advantages over many of the existing vaccines. For example, the encoded protein is expressed in thehost in its natural form\u2014there is no denaturation or modifi-cation. The immune response is therefore directed to the anti-gen exactly as it is expressed by the pathogen. DNA vaccinesalso induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity; tostimulate both arms of the immune response with non-DNAvaccines normally requires immunization with a live attenu-ated preparation, which introduces additional elements ofrisk. Finally, DNA vaccines cause prolonged expression of theantigen, which generates significant immunological memory. The practical aspects of DNA vaccines are also very promising (Table 18-5). Refrigeration is not required for thehandling and storage of the plasmid DNA, a feature thatgreatly lowers the cost and complexity of delivery. The sameplasmid vector can be custom tailored to make a variety ofproteins, so that the same manufacturing techniques can beused for different DNA vaccines, each encoding an antigenfrom a different pathogen. An improved method for admin-istering these vaccines entails coating microscopic gold beadswith the plasmid DNA and then delivering the coated parti-cles through the skin into the underlying muscle with an airgun (called a gene gun ). This will allow rapid delivery of a426 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease FIGURE 18-6 Use of DNA vaccines raises both humoral and cel- lular immunity. The injected gene is expressed in the injected musclecell and in nearby APCs. The peptides from the protein encoded bythe DNA are expressed on the surface of both cell types after pro-cessing as an endogenous antigen by the MHC class I pathway. Cellsthat present the antigen in the context of class I MHC moleculesstimulate development of cytotoxic T cells. The protein encoded by the injected DNA is also expressed as a soluble, secreted protein,which is taken up, processed, and presented in the context of class IIMHC molecules. This pathway stimulates B-cell immunity and gen-erates antibodies and B-cell memory against the protein. [Adapted from D. B. Weiner and R. C. Kennedy, 1999,Sci.

T ests of DNA vaccines in animal models have shown that these vaccines are able to induce protective immunity against anumber of pathogens, including the influenza virus. It hasbeen further shown that the inclusion of certain DNA se-quences in the vector leads to enhanced immune response. Atpresent, there are human trials underway with several differentDNA vaccines, including those for malaria, AIDS, influenza,and herpesvirus. Future experimental trials of DNA vaccineswill mix genes for antigenic proteins with those for cytokinesor chemokines that direct the immune response to the opti-mum pathway. For example, the IL-12 gene may be included ina DNA vaccine; expression of IL-12 at the site of immunizationwill stimulate TH 1-type immunity induced by the vaccine. DNA vaccines will likely be used for human immuniza- tion within the next few years. However, they are not a uni-versal solution to the problems of vaccination; for example,only protein antigens can be polysaccharide antigens. Vaccines One of the limitations of synthetic peptide vaccines and recombinant protein vaccines is that they tend to be poorlyimmunogenic; in addition, they tend to induce a humoral antibody response but are less likely to induce a cell-mediatedresponse. What is needed is a method for constructing syn-thetic peptide vaccines that contain both immunodominantB-cell and T-cell epitopes. Furthermore, if a CTL response isdesired, the vaccine must be delivered intra-cellularly so thatthe peptides can be processed and presented together withclass I MHC molecules. A number of innovative techniquesare being applied to develop multivalent vaccines that canpresent multiple copies of a given peptide or a mixture ofpeptides to the immune system (Figure 18-7).Vaccines CHAPTER 18 427 VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 18-7 Multivalent subunit vaccines. (a) Solid matrix- antibody-antigen complexes can be designed to contain syntheticpeptides representing T-cell epitopes be extracted antigens orantigenic peptides. In micelles and liposomes, the hydrophilic resi-dues of the antigen molecules are oriented outward. In ISCOMs,the long fatty-acid tails of the external detergent layer are adjacentto the hydrophobic residues of the centrally located antigen mole-cules. (c) ISCOMs and liposomes can deliver antigens mimic endogenous antigens. Subsequent processing bythe cytosolic pathway and presentation a cell-mediated Antigen(b) Detergent extracted membrane antigens or LiposomeMicelle into ISCOM ProteasomeTAP EROne approach is to prepare solid matrix-antibody- antigen (SMAA) complexes by attaching monoclonal anti-bodies to particulate solid matrices and then saturating theantibody with the desired antigen. The resulting complexesare then used as vaccines. By attaching different monoclonalantibodies to the solid matrix, it is possible to bind a mixtureof peptides or proteins, composing immunodominant epi-topes for both T cells and B cells, to the solid matrix (see Fig-ure 18-7a). These multivalent complexes have been shown toinduce vigorous humoral and cell-mediated responses. Theirparticulate nature contributes to their increased immuno-genicity by facilitating phagocytosis by phagocytic cells. Another means of producing a multivalent vaccine is to use detergent to incorporate protein antigens into protein mi-celles, lipid vesicles (called liposomes), or immunostimulat-ing complexes (see Figure 18-7b). Mixing proteins in deter-gent and then removing the detergent forms micelles. The in-dividual proteins orient themselves with their hydrophilicresidues toward the aqueous environment and the hydropho-bic residues at the center so as to exclude their interactionwith the aqueous environment. Liposomes containing pro-tein antigens are prepared by mixing the proteins with a sus-pension of phospholipids under conditions that form vesiclesbounded by a bilayer. The proteins are incorporated into thebilayer with the hydrophilic residues exposed. Immunostimu-lating complexes (ISCOMs) are lipid carriers prepared bymixing protein with detergent and a glycoside called Quil A. Membrane proteins from various pathogens, including in- fluenza virus, measles virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV havebeen incorporated into micelles, liposomes, and ISCOMs andare currently being assessed as potential vaccines. In additionto their increased immunogenicity, liposomes and ISCOMsappear to fuse with the plasma membrane to deliver the anti-gen intracellularly, where it can be processed by the cytosolicpathway and thus induce a cell-mediated response (see Figure18-7c). SUMMARY IA state of immunity can be induced by passive or activeimmunization a) Short-term passive immunization is induced by transfer of preformed antibodies. b) Infection or inoculation achieves long-term active immu- nization. IThree types of vaccines are currently used in tenuated (avirulent) microorganisms, inactivated (killed)microorganisms, or components pathogens expressed in cell culturemay be effective vaccines. IRecombinant vectors, including viruses or bacteria, engi-neered to carry genes from infectious microorganisms,maximize cell-mediated immunity to the encoded antigens.IPlasmid DNA encoding a protein antigen from a pathogencan serve as an effective vaccine inducing both humoraland cell-mediated immunity. IRealizing the optimum benefit of vaccines will requirecheaper manufacture and improved delivery methods forexisting vaccines. References Afzal, M. F., et al. 2000.

Immunodeficiencies are conve-niently categorized by the type or the developmental stage ofthe cells involved. Figure 19-1 reviews the overall cellular de-velopment in the immune system, showing the locations ofdefects that give rise to primary immunodeficiencies. AsChapter 2 explained, the two main cell lineages important toimmune function are lymphoid and myeloid. Most defectsthat lead to immunodeficiencies affect either one or theother. The lymphoid cell disorders may affect T cells, B cells,or, in combined immunodeficiencies, both B and T cells. Themyeloid cell disorders affect phagocytic function. Most of theprimary immunodeficiencies are inherited, and the precisemolecular variations and the genetic defects that lead tomany of these dysfunctions have been determined (Table 19-1 and Figure 19-2). In addition, there are immunodefi-ciencies that stem from developmental defects that impairproper function of an organ of the immune system. The consequences of primary immunodeficiency depend on the number and type of immune system components in-volved. Defects in components early in the hematopoietic de-velopmental scheme affect the entire immune system. In thiscategory is reticular dysgenesis, a stem-cell defect that affectsthe maturation of all leukocytes; the resulting general failureof immunity leads to susceptibility to infection by a variety ofmicroorganisms. Without aggressive treatment, the affectedindividual usually dies young from severe infection. In the chapter 19 IPrimary Immunodeficiencies IAIDS and Other Acquired or Secondary ImmunodeficienciesAIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies L - , immune system is subject to failure of some or allof its parts. This failure can have dire consequences. When the system loses its sense of self and begins to attackhost cells and tissues, the result is autoimmunity, which is described in Chapter 20. When the system errs by failing toprotect the host from disease-causing agents or from malig-nant cells, the result is immunodeficiency, which is the sub- ject of this chapter. A condition resulting from a genetic or developmental de- fect in the immune system is called a primary immunodefi-ciency. In such a condition, the defect is present at birthalthough it may not manifest itself until later in life. Sec-ondary immunodeficiency, or acquired immunodeficiency,is the loss of immune function and results from exposure tovarious agents. By far the most common secondary immun-odeficiency is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, which results from infection with the human immun- odeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). In the year 2000, AIDS killed ap-proximately 3 million persons, and HIV infection continuesto spread to an estimated 15,000 persons per day. AIDS pa-tients, like other individuals with severe immunodeficiency,are at risk of infection with so-called opportunistic agents.These are microorganisms that healthy individuals can har-bor with no ill consequences but that cause disease in thosewith impaired immune function. The first part of this chapter describes the common pri- mary immunodeficiencies, examines progress in identifyingthe genetic defects that underlie these disorders, and consid-ers approaches to their treatment, including innovative usesof gene therapy. Animal models of primary immunodefi-ciency are also described. The rest of this chapter describesacquired immunodeficiency, with a strong focus on HIV in-fection, AIDS, and the current status of therapeutic and prevention strategies for combating this fatal acquired im-munodeficiency. Primary Immunodeficiencies A primary immunodeficiency may affect either adaptive orinnate immune functions. Deficiencies involving compo-nents of adaptive immunity, such as T or B cells, are thus Nude Mouse (nu/nu)more restricted case of defective phagocytic function, the major consequence is susceptibility to bacterial infection.Defects in more highly differentiated compartments of theimmune system have consequences that are more specific432 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease and usually less severe. For example, an individual with selec-tive IgA deficiency may enjoy a full life span, troubled only bya greater than normal susceptibility to infections of the respi-ratory and genitourinary tracts.VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 19-1 Congenital defects that interrupt hematopoiesis or impair functioning of immune-system cells result in variousimmunodeficiency diseases.

They are less common than conditions, usually lesssevere, that result from defects in more highly differentiatedlymphoid cells. B-cell immunodeficiency disorders make up a diverse spectrum of diseases ranging from the complete absence ofmature recirculating B cells, plasma cells, and immuno-globulin to the selective absence of only certain classes ofAIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 433 immunoglobulins. Patients with these disorders usually aresubject to recurrent bacterial infections but display normalimmunity to most viral and fungal infections, because the T-cell branch of the immune system is largely unaffected. Mostcommon in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies areinfections by such encapsulated bacteria as staphylococci,streptococci, and pneumococci, because antibody is criticalfor the opsonization and clearance of these organisms. Because of the central role of T cells in the immune sys- tem, a T-cell deficiency can affect both the humoral and thecell-mediated responses. The impact on the cell-mediatedsystem can be severe, with a reduction in both delayed-typehypersensitive responses and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

By contrast, defects in the cell-mediated system are associated with increased suscepti-bility to viral, protozoan, often implicated, tance of T cells in eliminating intracellular pathogens. Infec-tions with viruses that are rarely pathogenic for the normalindividual (such as cytomegalovirus or even an attenuatedmeasles vaccine) may be life threatening for those with im-paired cell-mediated immunity. Defects that cause decreasedT-cell counts generally also affect the humoral system, be-cause of the requirement for T Hcells in B-cell activation. Gen- erally there is some decrease in antibody levels, particularly inthe production of specific antibody after immunization. As one might expect, combined deficiencies of the humoral and cell-mediated branches are the most serious of the im-munodeficiency disorders. The onset of infections begins earlyin infancy, and the prognosis for these infants is early death un-less therapeutic intervention reconstitutes their defective im-mune system. As described below, there are increasing numbersof options for the treatment of immunodeficiencies. The immunodeficiencies that affect lymphoid function have in common the inability to mount or sustain a completeimmune response against specific agents. A variety of failures can lead to such immunodeficiency. Defective intercellularcommunication may be rooted in deleterious mutations ofgenes that encode cell-surface receptors or signal-transductionmolecules; defects in the mechanisms of gene rearrangementand other functions may prevent normal B- or T-cell re-sponses. Figure 19-3 is an overview of the molecules involvedin the more well-described interactions among T cells and B cells that give rise to specific responses, with a focus on pro-teins in which defects leading to immunodeficiency havebeen identified. SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY (SCID) The family of disorders termed SCID stems from defects inlymphoid development that affect either T cells or both Tand B cells. All forms of SCID have common features despitedifferences in the underlying genetic defects. Clinically, SCIDis characterized by a very low number of circulating lympho-cytes. There is a failure to mount immune responses medi-ated by T cells. The thymus does not develop, and the fewcirculating T cells in the SCID patient do not respond tostimulation by mitogens, indicating that they cannot prolif-erate in response to antigens. Myeloid and erythroid (red-blood-cell precursors) cells appear normal in number andfunction, indicating that only lymphoid cells are depleted inSCID. SCID results in severe recurrent infections and is usually fatal in the early years of life. Although both the T and B lin-eages may be affected, the initial manifestation of SCID in in-fants is almost always infection by agents, such as fungi orviruses, that are normally dealt with by T-cell immunity. TheB-cell defect is not evident in the first few months of the af-fected infant's life because antibodies are passively obtainedfrom transplacental circulation or from mother's milk. SCIDinfants suffer from chronic diarrhea, pneumonia, and skin,mouth, and throat lesions as well as a host of other oppor-tunistic infections. The immune system is so compromisedthat even live attenuated vaccines (such as the Sabin poliovaccine) can cause infection and disease. The life span of aSCID patient can be prolonged by preventing contact with allpotentially harmful microorganisms, for example by con-finement in a sterile atmosphere. However, extraordinary ef-fort is required to prevent direct contact with other personsand with unfiltered air; any object, including food, thatcomes in contact with the sequestered SCID patient mustfirst be sterilized. Such isolation is feasible only as a tempo-rary measure, pending treatment. The search for defects that underlie SCID has revealed several different causes for this general failure of immunity. Asurvey of 141 patients by Rebecca Buckley indicated that themost common cause (64 cases) was deficiency of the com-mon gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R /H9253;s e e F i g u r e 12-7). Defects in this chain impede signaling throughreceptors for IL-4, -7, -9, and -15 as well as the IL-2 receptor,because the chain is present in receptors for all of these cy-tokines. Deficiency in the kinase JAK-3, which has a similar434 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) Properdin diseases result from defects in loci on the X chromosome. [Data from the Natl. Cen- ter for Biotechnology Information Web site.]phenotype because the IL receptors signal through this mol- ecule, accounted for 9 of the cases (see Figure 12-10). A raredefect found in only 2 of the patients involved the IL-7 recep-tor; these patients have impaired T and B cells but normalNK cells. Another common defect is the adenosine deami-nase or ADA deficiency found in 22 patients. Adenosinedeaminase catalyzes conversion of adenosine to inosine, andits deficiency results in accumulation of adenosine, which in-terferes with purine metabolism and DNA synthesis. The remaining cases included single instances of reticular dysge-nesis and cartilage hair dysplasia or were classified as autoso-mal recessive defects not related to known IL-2R /H9253or JAK-3 mutations. Thirteen of the 141 cases were of unknown ori-gin, with no apparent genetic defect or family history of im-munodeficiency. There are other known defects that give rise to SCID. There is a defect characterized by depletion of CD8 /H11001T cells that in- volves the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, important element transduction Figures 10-11 and 10-12). In-fants with defects in ZAP-70 may have normal levels of im-munoglobulin and CD4 /H11001lymphocytes, but their CD4/H11001T cells the enzyme purinenucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) causes immunodeficiency by a mechanism similar to the ADA defect. As described inChapters 5 and 9, both immunoglobulin and T-cell receptorgenes undergo rearrangement to express the active forms ofthese molecules. A defect in the genes that encode mediatorsof the rearrangement processes (recombination-activatingproteins RAG-1 and RAG-2) precludes development of B andT cells with functional receptors and leads to SCID. A defect leading to general failure of immunity similar to SCID is failure to transcribe the genes that encode class IIMHC molecules. Without these molecules, the patient's lym-phocytes cannot participate in cellular interactions with Thelper cells. This type of immunodeficiency is also called thebare-lymphocyte syndrome. Molecular studies of a class II MHC deficiency revealed a defective interaction between a 5 /H11032 promoter sequence of the gene for the class II MHC moleculeand a DNA-binding protein necessary for gene transcription.Other patients with SCID-like symptoms lack class I MHCmolecules. This rare variant of immunodeficiency was ascribed to mutation in the TAP genes that are vital to anti-gen processing by class I MHC molecules (see Clinical FocusChapter 8). This defect causes a deficit in CD8-mediated AIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 435 FIGURE 19-3 Defects in cell interaction and signaling can lead to severe immunodeficiency. The interaction of T cell and B cell isshown here with a number of the components important to the intra-and extracellular signaling pathways. A number of primary immuno-deficiencies are rooted in defects in these interactions. SCID may re-sult from defects in ( 1) the recombination-activating genes ( RAG- 1 and -2) required for synthesis of the functional immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors that characterize mature B and T cells; ( 2) the /H9253chainof receptors for IL- 2, 4, 7, 9, and 15(IL-R /H9253); (3) JAK- 3, which trans- duces signals from the gamma chain of the cytokine receptor; or ( 4) expression of the class II MHC molecule (bare lymphocyte syn-drome). XLA results from defective from defects in CD 40L that preclude normal maturation of B cells. [Adapted from B. A. Smart and H. MHC(bare in chain of receptors forIL-2, 4, 7, 9, 15immunity, characterized by susceptibility to viral infection. A recent case of SCID uncovered a defect in the gene for thecell-surface phosphatase CD45. Interestingly, this defectcaused lack of /H9251/H9252T-cells but spared the /H9253/H9254lineage. WISKOTT-ALDRICH SYNDROME (WAS) The severity of this X-linked disorder increases with age and usually results in fatal infection or lymphoid malignancy. Ini-tially, T and B lymphocytes are present in normal numbers.WAS first manifests itself by defective responses to bacterialpolysaccharides and by lower-than-average IgM levels. Otherresponses and effector mechanisms are normal in the earlystages of the syndrome. As the WAS sufferer ages, there are re-current bacterial infections and a gradual loss of humoral andcellular responses. The syndrome includes thrombocytopenia(lowered platelet count; the existing platelets are smaller thanusual and have a short half-life), which may lead to fatal bleed-ing. Eczema (skin rashes) in varying degrees of severity mayalso occur, usually beginning around one year of age. The de-fect in WAS has been mapped to the short arm of the X chro-mosome (see Table 19-1 and Figure 19-2) and involves acytoskeletal glycoprotein present in lymphoid cells calledsialophorin (CD43). The WAS protein is required for assemblyof actin filaments required for the formation of microvesicles. INTERFERON-GAMMA-RECEPTOR DEFECT A recently described immunodeficiency that falls into themixed-cell category involves a defect in the receptor for in-terferon gamma (IFN- /H9253, see Chapter 12). This deficiency was found in patients suffering from infection with atypical my-cobacteria (intracellular organisms related to the bacteriathat cause tuberculosis and leprosy). Most of those carryingthis autosomal recessive trait are from families with a historyof inbreeding. The susceptibility to infection with mycobac-teria is selective in that those who survive these infections arenot unusually susceptible to other agents, including other in-tracellular bacteria. This immunodeficiency points to a spe-cific role for IFN- /H9253and its receptor in protection from infection with mycobacteria. Whereas SCID and the related combined immunodefi- ciencies affect T cells or all lymphoid cells, other primary im-munodeficiencies affect B-cell function and result in thereduction or absence of some or all classes of immunoglobu-lins. While the underlying defects have been identified forsome of these, little information exists concerning the exactcause of some of the more common deficiencies, such as com-mon variable immunodeficiency and selective IgA deficiency. characterized by ex-tremely low IgG levels and by the absence of other im-munoglobulin classes. Individuals with XLA have noperipheral B cells and suffer from recurrent bacterial infec-tions, beginning at about nine months of age. A palliativetreatment for this condition is periodic administration of immunoglobulin, but patients seldom survive past theirteens. There is a defect in B-cell signal transduction in thisdisorder, due to a defect in a transduction molecule calledBruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), after the investigator who de-scribed the syndrome. B cells in the XLA patient remain inthe pre-B stage with H chains rearranged but L chains in theirgerm-line configuration. (The Clinical Focus in Chapter 11describes the discovery of this immunodeficiency and its un-derlying defect in detail.) X-LINKED HYPER-IgM SYNDROME A peculiar immunoglobulin deficiency first thought to resultfrom a B-cell defect has recently been shown to result insteadfrom a defect in a T-cell surface molecule. X-linked hyper-IgM (XHM) syndrome is characterized by a deficiency ofIgG, IgA, and IgE, and elevated levels of IgM, sometimes ashigh as 10 mg/ml (normal IgM concentration is 1.5 mg/ml).Although individuals with XHM have normal numbers of Bcells expressing membrane-bound IgM or IgD, they appearto lack B cells expressing membrane-bound IgG, IgA, or IgE.XHM syndrome is generally inherited as an X-linked reces-sive disorder (see Figure 19-2), but some forms appear to beacquired and affect both men and women. Affected individ-uals have high counts of IgM-secreting plasma cells in theirperipheral blood and lymphoid tissue. In addition, XHM pa-tients often have high levels of autoantibodies to neutrophils,platelets, and red blood cells. Children with XHM suffer re-current infections, especially respiratory infections; these aremore severe than expected for a deficiency characterized bylow levels of immunoglobulins. The defect in XHM is in the gene encoding the CD40 lig- and (CD40L), which maps to the X chromosome. T Hcells from patients with XHM fail to express functional CD40L ontheir membrane. Since an interaction between CD40 on theB cell and CD40L on the T Hcell is required for B-cell activa- tion, the absence of this co-stimulatory signal inhibits B-cell response to T-dependent antigens response to T-independent antigens, how-ever, is unaffected by this defect, accounting for the produc-tion of IgM antibodies. As described in Chapter 11, classswitching and formation of memory B cells both requirecontact with T Hcells by a CD40-CD40L interaction. The ab- sence of this interaction in XHM results in the loss of classswitching to IgG, IgA, or IgE isotypes and in a failure to pro-duce memory B cells. In addition, XHM individuals fail toproduce germinal centers during a humoral response, whichhighlights the role of the CD40-CD40L interaction in thegeneration of germinal centers. COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CVI) CVI is characterized by a profound decrease in numbers ofantibody-producing plasma cells, low levels of most im-munoglobulin isotypes (hypogammaglobulinemia), and re-current infections. The condition is usually manifested later436 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseasein life than other deficiencies and is sometimes called late- onset hypogammaglobulinemia or, incorrectly, acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. However, CVI has a genetic component and is considered a primary immunodeficiency,although the exact pattern of inheritance is not known. Be-cause the manifestations are very similar to those of acquiredhypogammaglobulinemia, there is some confusion betweenthe two forms (see below). Infections in CVI sufferers aremost frequently bacterial and can be controlled by adminis-tration of immunoglobulin. In CVI patients, B cells fail tomature into plasma cells; however in vitro studies show thatCVI B cells are capable of maturing in response to appropri-ate differentiation signals. The underlying defect in CVI isnot known, but must involve either an in vivo blockage of thematuration of B cells to the plasma-cell stage or their inabil-ity to produce the secreted form of immunoglobulins. HYPER-IgE SYNDROME (JOB SYNDROME) A primary immunodeficiency characterized by skin abcesses,recurrent pneumonia, eczema, and elevated levels of IgE ac-companies facial abnormalities and bone fragility. Thismulti-system disorder is autosomal dominant and has vari-able expressivity. The gene for hyper IgE syndrome, or HIES,maps to chromosome 4. HIES immunologic signs include re-current infection and eosinophilia in addition to elevated IgElevels. SELECTIVE DEFICIENCIES OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN CLASSES A number of immunodeficiency states are characterized bysignificantly lowered amounts of specific immunoglobulinisotypes. Of these, IgA deficiency is by far the most common.There are family-association data showing that IgA defi-ciency prevails in the same families as CVI, suggesting a rela-tionship between these conditions. The spectrum of clinicalsymptoms of IgA deficiency is broad; many of those affectedare asymptomatic, while others suffer from an assortment ofserious problems. Recurrent respiratory and genitourinarytract infections resulting from lack of secreted IgA on mu-cosal surfaces are common. In addition, problems such as in-testinal malabsorption, allergic disease, and autoimmunedisorders may also be associated with low IgA levels. The rea-sons for this variability in the clinical profile of IgA deficiencyare not clear but may relate to the ability of some, but not all,patients to substitute IgM for IgA as a mucosal antibody. Thedefect in IgA deficiency is related to the inability of IgA B cellsto undergo normal differentiation to the plasma-cell stage.IgG2 and IgG4 may also be deficient in IgA-deficient pa-tients. No causative defect in IgA genes has been identified,and the surface IgA molecules on these patients' B cells ap-pear to be expressed normally. A gene outside of the im-munoglobulin gene complex is suspected to be responsiblefor this fairly common syndrome. Other immunoglobulin deficiencies have been reported, but these are rarer. An IgM deficiency has been identified asan autosomal recessive trait. Victims of this condition aresubject to severe infection by agents such as meningococcus, which causes fatal disease. IgM deficiency may be accompa-nied by various malignancies or by autoimmune disease. IgGdeficiencies are also rare. These are often not noticed untiladulthood and can be effectively treated by administration ofimmunoglobulin. ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA Although not classified primarily as an immunodeficiency,ataxia telangiectasia is a disease syndrome that includes defi-ciency of IgA and sometimes of IgE. The syndrome is charac-terized by difficulty in maintaining balance (ataxia) and bythe appearance of broken capillaries (telangiectasia) in theeyes. The primary defect appears to be in a kinase involved inregulation of the cell cycle. The relationship between the im-mune deficiency and the other defects in ataxia telangiectasiaremains obscure. IMMUNE DISORDERS INVOLVING THE THYMUS Several immunodeficiency syndromes are grounded in fail-ure of the thymus to undergo normal development. Thymicmalfunction has a profound effect on T-cell function; allpopulations of T cells, including helper, cytolytic, and regula-tory varieties, are affected. Immunity to viruses and fungi is especially compromised in those suffering from these conditions. DiGeorge syndrome, or congenital thymic aplasia, in its most severe form is the complete absence of a thymus. Thisdevelopmental defect, which is associated with the dele-tion in the embryo of a region on chromosome 22, causesimmunodeficiency along with characteristic facial abnor-malities, hypoparathyroidism, and congenital heart disease(Figure 19-4). The stage at which the causative developmen-tal defect occurs has been determined, and the syndrome issometimes called the third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syn- drome to reflect its precise embryonic origin. The immune defect includes a profound depression of T-cell numbers andabsence of T-cell responses. Although B cells are present innormal numbers, affected individuals do not produce anti-body in response to immunization with specific antigens.Thymic transplantation is of some value for correcting the T-cell defects, but many DiGeorge patients have such severeheart disease that their chances for long-term survival arepoor, even if the immune defects are corrected. Whereas the DiGeorge syndrome results from an in- trauterine or developmental anomaly, thymic hypoplasia, orthe Nezelof syndrome, is an inherited disorder. The mode ofinheritance for this rare disease is not known and its presen-tation varies, making it somewhat difficult to diagnose. Asthe name implies, thymic hypoplasia is a defect in which avestigial thymus is unable to serve its function in T-cell de-velopment. In some patients, B cells are normal, whereas inothers a B-cell deficiency is secondary to the T-cell defect. Af-fected individuals suffer from chronic diarrhea, viral andfungal infections, and a general failure to thrive.AIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 437Immunodeficiencies of the Myeloid Lineage Affect Innate Immunity Immunodeficiencies of the lymphoid lineage affect adaptive immunity. By contrast, defects in the myeloid cell lineage af-fect the innate immune functions (see Figure 19-1). Most ofthese defects result in impaired phagocytic processes that aremanifested by recurrent microbial infection of greater orlesser severity. There are several stages at which the phago-cytic processes may be faulty; these include cell motility, ad-herence to and phagocytosis of organisms, and killing bymacrophages. REDUCTION IN NEUTROPHIL COUNT As described in Chapter 2, neutrophils are circulating granu-locytes with phagocytic function. Quantitative deficiencies inneutrophils can range from an almost complete absence ofcells, called agranulocytosis, to a reduction in the concentra-tion of peripheral blood neutrophils below 1500/mm 3, called granulocytopenia or neutropenia. These quantitative defi-ciencies may result from congenital defects or may be ac-quired through extrinsic factors. Acquired neutropenias aremuch more common than congenital ones. Congenital neutropenia is often due to a genetic defect that affects the myeloid progenitor stem cell; it results during hematopoiesis. Incongenital agranulocytosis, myeloid stem cells are present in the bone marrow but rarely differentiate beyond the promyelocyte stage. As a result, children born with this con-dition show severe neutropenia, with counts of less than 200neutrophils/mm 3. These children suffer from frequent bacte- rial infections beginning as early as the first month of life;normal infants are protected at this age by maternal antibodyas well as by innate immune mechanisms, including neu-trophils. Experimental evidence suggests that this genetic defect results in decreased production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thus in a failure of themyeloid stem cell to differentiate along the granulocytic lineage (see Figure 2-1). Neutrophils have a short life span, and their precursors must divide rapidly in the bone marrow to maintain levels ofthese cells in the circulation. For this reason, agents such asradiation and certain drugs (e.g., chemotherapeutic drugs)that specifically damage rapidly dividing cells are likely tocause neutropenia. Occasionally, neutropenia develops insuch autoimmune diseases as systemiclupus in conditions, autoantibodies de-stroy the neutrophils. Transient neutropenia often developsafter certain bacterial or viral infections, but neutrophilcounts return to normal as the infection is cleared. CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE (CGD) CGD is a genetic disease that has at least two distinct forms:an X-linked form that occurs in about 70% of patients and anautosomal recessive form found in the rest. This disease isrooted in a defect in the oxidative pathway by which phago-cytes generate hydrogen peroxide and the resulting reactiveproducts, such as hypochlorous acid, that kill phagocytosedbacteria. CGD sufferers undergo excessive inflammatory reactions that result in gingivitis, swollen lymph nodes,and nonmalignant granulomas (lumpy subcutaneous cellmasses); also susceptible to bacterial and fungal in-fection. CGD patients are not subject to infection by thosebacteria, such as pneumococcus, that generate their own hy-drogen peroxide. In this case, the myeloperoxidase in the hostcell can use the bacterial hydrogen peroxide to generateenough hypochlorous acid to thwart infection. Several re-lated defects may lead to CGD; these include a missing or de-fective cytochrome (cyt b 558) that functions in an oxidative pathway and defects in proteins (phagocyte oxidases, orphox) that stabilize the cytochrome. In addition to the gen-eral defect in the killer function of phagocytes, there is also adecrease in the ability of mononuclear cells to serve as APCs.Both processing and presentation of antigen are impaired.Increased amounts of antigen are required to trigger T-cellhelp when mononuclear cells from CGD patients are used asAPCs. The addition of IFN- /H9253has been shown to restore function to CGD granulocytes and monocytes in vitro. This observa-tion prompted clinical trials of IFN- /H9253for CGD patients. En- couraging increases in oxidative function and restoration of cytoplasmic cytochrome have been reported in these 438 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease FIGURE 19-4 A child with DiGeorge syndrome showing character- istic dysplasia of ears and mouth and abnormally long be-tween the eyes. [R. Kretschmer et al., 1968,New Engl. J. Med. 279: 1295; photograph courtesy of F. S. Rosen.]patients. In addition, knowledge of the precise gene defects underlying CGD makes it a candidate for gene therapy, andreplacement of the defective cytochrome has had promisingresults (see below). CHEDIAK-HIGASHI SYNDROME This autosomal recessive disease is characterized by recurrentbacterial infections, partial oculo-cutaneous albinism (lackof skin and eye pigment), and aggressive but nonmalignantinfiltration of organs by lymphoid cells. Phagocytes from pa-tients with this immune defect contain giant granules but donot have the ability to kill bacteria. The molecular basis of thedefect is a mutation in a protein (LYST) involved in the regu-lation of intracellular trafficking. The mutation impairs thetargeting of proteins which makesthem unable to lyse bacteria. LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY (LAD) As described in Chapter 15, cell-surface molecules belongingto the integrin family of proteins function as adhesion mole-cules and are required to facilitate cellular interaction. Threeof these, LFA-1, Mac-1, and gp150/95 (CD11a, b, and have a common /H9252chain and are variably present on different monocytic cells; is also expressedon B cells (Table 19-2). An immunodeficiency related to dysfunction of the adhesion molecules is rooted in a defectlocalized to the common /H9252chain and affects expression of all three of the molecules that use this chain. This defect, calledleukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), causes susceptibility toinfection with both gram-positive and gram-negative bacte-ria as well as various fungi. Impairment of adhesion of leuko-cytes to vascular endothelium limits recruitment of cells tosites of inflammation.Viral immunity is somewhat impaired,as would be predicted from the defective T-B cell cooperationarising from the adhesion defect. LAD varies in its severity;some affected individuals die within a few years, others sur-vive into their forties. The reason for the variable disease phe-notype in this disorder is not known. LAD is the subject of aClinical Focus in Chapter 15. Complement Defects Result in Immunodeficiency or Immune-Complex Disease Immunodeficiency diseases resulting from defects in the complement system are described in Chapter 13. Many com-plement deficiencies are associated with increased suscepti-bility to bacterial infections and/or immune-complexdiseases. One of these complement disorders, a deficiency inproperdin, which stabilizes the C3 convertase in the alterna-tive complement pathway, is caused by a defect in a gene lo-cated on the X chromosome (see Figure 19-2).AIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 439 TABLE 19-2 Properties of integrin molecules that are absent in leukocyte-adhesion deficiency INTEGRIN MOLECULES * Property LFA- 1 CR3 CR4 designation /H9251chain 4complement receptor, also known as gp 150/95 ; LFA- 1, CR 3, and CR 4are heterodimers containing a common /H9252chain but different /H9251chains designated L, M, and X, respectively.Immunodeficiency Disorders Are Treated by Replacement of the Defective Element Although there are no cures for immunodeficiency disor- ders, there are several treatment possibilities. In addition tothe drastic option of total isolation from exposure to any mi-crobial agent, treatment options for the immunodeficienciesinclude: Ireplacement of a missing protein Ireplacement of a missing cell type or lineage Ireplacement of a missing or defective gene For disorders that impair antibody production, the classic course of treatment is administration of the missing proteinimmunoglobulin. Pooled human gamma globulin given ei-ther intravenously or subcutaneously protects against recur-rent infection in many types of immunodeficiency. Main-tenance of reasonably high levels of serum immunoglobulin(5 mg/ml serum) will prevent most common infections inthe agammaglobulinemic patient. This is generally accom-plished by the administration of immunoglobulin that hasbeen selected for antibodies directed against a particular or-ganism. Recent advances in the preparation of human mon-oclonal antibodies and in the ability to genetically engineerchimeric antibodies with mouse V regions and human-derived C regions make it possible to prepare antibodies spe-cific for important pathogens (see Chapter 5). Advances in molecular biology make it possible to clone the genes that encode other immunologically important pro-teins, such as cytokines, and to express these genes in vitro,using bacterial or eukaryotic expression systems. The avail-ability of such proteins allows new modes of therapy inwhich immunologically important proteins may be replacedor their concentrations increased in the patient. For example,the administration of recombinant IFN- /H9253has proven effec- tive for patients with CGD, and the use of recombinant IL-2may help to restore immune function in AIDS patients. Re-combinant adenosine deaminase has been successfully ad-ministered to ADA deficient SCID patients. Cell replacement as therapy for immunodeficiencies has been made possible by recent progress in bone-marrow trans-plantation (see Chapter 21). Replacement of stem cells withthose from an immunocompetent donor allows developmentof a functional immune system (see Clinical Focus Chapter2). High rates of success have been reported for those who arefortunate enough to have an HLA-identical donor. Carefulmatching of patients with donors and the ability to manipu-late stem-cell populations to select CD34 /H11001precursor cells continues to minimize the risk in this procedure, even whenno ideal donor exists. These procedures have been highly suc-cessful with SCID infants when haploidentical (completematch of one HLA gene set or haplotype) donor marrow isused. T cells are depleted and CD34 /H11001stem cells are enriched before introducing the donor bone marrow into the SCID in-fant. Because this therapy has been used only in recent years,it is not known whether transplantation cures the immuno- deficiency permanently. A variation of bone-marrow trans-plantation is the injection of paternal CD34 /H11001cells in utero when the birth of an infant with SCID is expected. Two in-fants born after this procedure had normal T-cell functionand did not develop the infections that characterize SCID. If a single gene defect has been identified, as in adenosine deaminase deficiency or chronic granulomatous disease, re-placement of the defective gene may be a treatment option.Clinical tests of such therapy are underway for SCID causedby ADA deficiency and for chronic granulomatous diseasewith defective p67 phox, with promising initial results. Disease remission for up to 18 months was seen in the SCID patientsand up to 6 months in the CGD patients. A similar procedurewas used in both trials. It begins with obtaining cells (CD34 /H11001 stem cells are usually selected for these procedures) from thepatient and transfecting them with a normal copy of the de-fective gene. The transfected cells are then returned to the pa-tient. As this treatment improves, it will become applicable toa number of immunodeficiencies for which a genetic defectis well defined. As mentioned above, these include defects in genes that encode the /H9253chain of the IL-2 receptor, JAK-3, and ZAP-70, all of which give rise to SCID. Experimental Models of Immunodeficiency Include Genetically Altered Animals Immunologists use two well-studied animal models of pri- mary immunodeficiency for a variety of experimental pur-poses. One of these is the athymic, or nude, mouse; the otheris the severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, mouse. NUDE (ATHYMIC) MICE A genetic trait designated nu,which is controlled by a reces- sive gene on chromosome 11, was discovered in certain mice.Mice homozygous for this trait ( nu/nu ) a vestigial thymus (Figure 19-5). Heterozygotic, nu//H11001,litter mates have hair and a normal thymus. It is not knownwhether the hairlessness and the thymus defect are caused bythe same gene. It is possible that two very closely linked genescontrol these defects, which, although unrelated, appear to-gether in this mutant mouse. A gene that controls develop-ment may be involved, since the pathway that leads to thedifferential development of the thymus is related to the onethat controls the skin epithelial cells. The nu/nu mouse can- not easily survive; under normal conditions, the mortality is100% within 25 weeks and 50% die within the first two weeksafter birth. Therefore, when these animals are to be used forexperimental purposes, they must be maintained under con-ditions that protect them from infection. Precautions includeuse of sterilized food, water, cages, and bedding. The cagesare protected from dust by placing them in a laminar flowrack or by the use of air filters fitted over the individual cages. Nude mice lack cell-mediated immune responses, and they are unable to make antibodies to most antigens. The 440 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseaseimmunodeficiency in the nude mouse can be reversed by a thymic transplant. Because they can permanently tolerateboth allografts and xenografts, they have a number of practi-cal experimental uses. For example, hybridomas or solid tu-mors from any origin may be grown as ascites or asimplanted tumors in a nude mouse. It is known that the nudemouse does not completely lack T cells; rather, it has a lim-ited population that increases with age. The source of these Tcells is not known; an intriguing possibility is that there is anextrathymic source of mature T cells. However, it is morelikely that the T cells arise from the vestigial thymus. The ma-jority of cells in the circulation of a nude mouse carry T-cellreceptors of the /H9253/H9254type instead of the /H9251/H9252type that prevails in the circulation of a normal mouse. THE SCID MOUSE In 1983, Melvin and Gayle Bosma and their colleagues de-scribed an autosomal recessive mutation in mice that gaverise to a severe deficiency in mature lymphocytes. They des-ignated the trait SCID because of its similarity to human se-vere combined immunodeficiency. The SCID mouse wasshown to have early B- and T-lineage cells, but there was avirtual absence of lymphoid cells in the thymus, spleen,lymph nodes, and gut tissue, the usual locations of functionalT and B cells. The precursor T and B cells in the SCID mouseappeared to be unable to differentiate into mature functionalB and T lymphocytes. Inbred mouse lines carrying the SCIDdefect have been derived and studied in great detail. TheSCID mouse can neither make antibody nor carry out delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) or graft-rejection re-actions. If the animals are not kept in an extremely clean environment, they succumb to infection early in life. Cellsother than lymphocytes develop normally in the SCIDmouse; red blood cells, monocytes, and granulocytes are pre-sent and functional. SCID mice may be rendered immuno-logically competent by transplantation of stem cells fromnormal mice. The mutation in a DNA protein kinase that causes mouse SCID is a so-called \"leaky\" mutation, because a certain num-ber of SCID mice do produce immunoglobulin. About halfof these leaky SCID mice can also reject skin allografts. Thisfinding suggests that the defective enzyme can function partly in T- and B-cell development, allowing normal differ-entiation of a small percentage of precursor cells. More recently, immunodeficient SCID-like mice have been devel-oped by deletion of the recombination-activating enzymes(RAG-1 and RAG-2) responsible for the rearrangement ofimmunoglobulin or T-cell-receptor genes in both B- and T-cell precursors (RAG knockout mice). This gives rise to a de-fect in both B and T cells of the mouse; neither can rearrangethe genes for their receptor and thus neither proceeds along anormal developmental path. Because cells with abnormal re-arrangements are eliminated in vivo, both B and T cells areabsent from the lymphoid organs of the RAG knockoutmouse. In addition to providing a window into possiblecauses of combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiency, theSCID mouse has proven extremely useful in studies of cellu-lar immunology. Because its rejection mechanisms do notoperate, the SCID mouse can be used for studies on cells ororgans from various sources. For example, immune precur-sor cells from human sources may be used to reestablish theSCID mouse's immune system. These human cells can de-velop in a normal fashion and, as a result, the SCID mousecirculation will contain immunoglobulin of human origin.In one important application, these SCID mice are infectedwith HIV-1. Although normal mice are not susceptible toHIV-1 infection, the SCID mouse reconstituted with humanlymphoid tissue (SCID-Hu mouse) provides an animalmodel in which to test therapeutic or prophylactic strategiesagainst HIV infection of the transplanted human lymphoidtissue. AIDS and Other Acquired or Secondary Immunodeficiencies As described above, a variety of defects in the immune sys- tem give rise to immunodeficiency. In addition to the pri-mary immunodeficiencies, there are also acquired, orsecondary, immunodeficiencies. One that has been knownfor some time is called acquired hypogammaglobulinemia.AIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 441 FIGURE 19-5 A nude mouse (nu/nu). This defect leads to ab- sence of a thymus or a vestigial thymus and cell-mediated im-munodeficiency. [Courtesy of the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine.] (As mentioned above, this condition is sometimes confused with common variable immunodeficiency, a condition thatshows genetic predisposition.) The origin of acquired hy-pogammaglobulinemia is unknown, and its major symptom,recurrent infection, manifests itself in young adults. The pa-tients generally have very low but detectable levels of totalimmunoglobulin. T-cell numbers and function may be normal, but there are some cases with T-cell defects and thesemay grow more severe as the disease progresses. The diseaseis generally treated by immunoglobulin therapy, allowing pa-tients to survive into their seventh and eighth decades. Unlikesimilar deficiencies described above, there is no evidence forgenetic transmission of this disease. Mothers with acquiredhypogammaglobulinemia deliver normal infants. However,at birth the infants will be deficient in circulating im-munoglobulin, because the deficiency in maternal circula-tion is reflected in the infant. Another form of secondary immunodeficiency, known as agent-induced immunodeficiency, results from exposure toany of a number of chemical and biological agents that in-duce an immunodeficient state. Certain of these are drugsused to combat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoidarthritis or lupus erythematosis. Corticosteroids, which arecommonly used for autoimmune disorders, interfere withthe immune response in order to relieve disease symptoms.Similarly, a state of immunodeficiency is deliberately in-duced in transplantation patients who are given immuno-suppressive drugs, such as cyclosporin A, in order to bluntthe attack of the immune system on transplanted organs. Aswill be described in Chapter 21, there are recent efforts to usemore specific means of inducing tolerance to allografts tocircumvent the unwanted side effects of general immuno-suppression. The mechanism of action of the immunosup-pressive agents varies, although T cells are a common target.In addition, cytotoxic drugs or radiation treatments given totreat various forms of cancer frequently damage the dividingcells in the body, including those of the immune system, andinduce a state of immunodeficiency as an unwanted conse-quence. Patients undergoing such therapy must be moni-tored closely and treated with antibiotics or immunoglob-ulin if infection appears. HIV/AIDS Has Claimed Millions of Lives Worldwide In recent years, all other forms of immunodeficiency have been overshadowed by an epidemic of severe immunodefi-ciency caused by the infectious agent called human immun-odeficiency virus 1, or HIV-1. The disease that HIV-1 causes,acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first re-ported in the United States in 1981 in Los Angeles, New Y ork,and San Francisco. A group of patients displayed unusual in-fections, including the opportunistic fungal pathogen Pneu- mocystis a pneumonia ( P. carinii pneumonia) in persons with immunodeficiency. In addition to PCP , some patients had Kaposi's sarcoma, an extremely rare skin tumor, as well as other, rarely encoun-tered opportunistic infections. More complete evaluation of the patients showed that they had in common a marked defi-ciency in cellular immune responses and a significant de-crease in the subpopulation of T cells that carry the CD4marker (T helper cells.) When epidemiologists examined thebackground of the first patients with this new syndrome, itwas found that the majority of those afflicted were homosex-ual males. As the number of AIDS cases increased and thedisease was recognized throughout the world, persons foundto be at high risk for AIDS were homosexual males, promis-cuous heterosexual individuals of either sex and their part-ners, intravenous drug users, persons who received blood orblood products prior to 1985, and infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Since its discovery in 1981, AIDS has increased to epi- demic proportions throughout the world. As of December2000, the cumulative total number of persons in the UnitedStates reported to have AIDS was 688,200, and of these ap-proximately 420,000 have died. Although reporting of AIDScases is mandatory, many states do not require reporting ofcases of HIV infection that have not yet progressed to AIDS.Therefore, there is no official count of the number of HIV-infected individuals; as many as 1 million Americans are esti-mated to be infected. Although the death rate from AIDS hasdecreased in recent years because of improved treatments,AIDS remains among the leading killers of persons in the 25-44-year-old age range in this country (Figure 19-6). Thefact that the number of yearly AIDS deaths has leveled off is encouraging, but does not indicate an end to the epidemic inthis country; there were an estimated 45,000 persons newlyinfected in 2000.442 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease 40 353025201510 50Deaths /100,000 population Year84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99*Unintentional injuries Cancer Heart disease Suicide Homicide Liver disease Stroke DiabetesHIV infection FIGURE 19-6 Death rates of the leading causes of death in per- sons aged 25-44 years in the United States for the years 1982-99 (*/H11005preliminary data). The heavy line shows that the death rate per 100,000 persons caused by AIDS surpassed any other single cause of death in this age range during the period 1993 to 1995 . The recent decrease in AIDS deaths in the United States is attributed to im-provements in anti-HIV drug therapy, which prolongs the lives of pa-tients. [National Vital Statistics Report.]The magnitude of the AIDS epidemic in the United States is dwarfed by figures for other parts of the world. The globaldistribution of those afflicted with AIDS is shown in Figure19-7. In sub-Saharan Africa an estimated 25.3 million personswere living with AIDS at the end of 2000, and in South andSoutheast Asia there were another 5.8 million. There are anestimated 36.1 million persons worldwide with AIDS, includ-ing over 5 million children. In addition, there are over 8 mil-lion children who have been orphaned by the death of theirparents from AIDS. Recent estimates from the World HealthOrganization indicate that there were 5.3 million new HIV in-fections in 2000, or an average of almost 15,000 persons in-fected each day during that year. This number includes a dailyinfection toll of 1700 children under 15 years of age. The initial group of AIDS patients in the United States and Western Europe was predominantly white and male. Al-though this remains the group predominantly affected inthese areas, more recently the distribution in the UnitedStates has shifted to include a larger proportion of women(20% in 2000 versus 6% in 1985) and an increasing propor-tion of minorities (39% black and Hispanic in 1996 versus11% in 1985). Worldwide, the number of AIDS patients dis- tributes more equally between males and females, and insub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest incidence of AIDS,about 50% of those afflicted are females. HIV- 1Spreads by Sexual Contact, Infected Blood, and from Mother to Infant Although the precise mechanism by which HIV-1 infects an individual is not known, epidemiological data indicate thatcommon means of transmission include homosexual andheterosexual intercourse, receipt of infected blood or bloodproducts, and passage from mothers to infants. Before testsfor HIV in the blood supply were routinely used, patientswho received blood transfusions and hemophiliacs who re-ceived blood products were at risk for HIV-1 infection. Expo-sure to infected blood accounts for the high incidence of AIDSamong intravenous drug users who normally share hypo-dermic needles. Infants born to mothers who are infected withHIV-1 are at high risk of infection. Unless infected mothers aretreated with anti-viral agents before delivery, approximatelyAIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 443 FIGURE 19-7 The global AIDS epidemic. The estimated worldwide distribution of AIDS cases as of December 2000 . There were approx- imately 36.1million persons living with AIDS as of December 2000 ; most of these were in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. InNorth America and Western Europe, about 80% of those affected were men, whereas in Africa nearly equal numbers of women andmen have AIDS.

Possible vehicles of passage frommother to infant include blood transferred in the birthprocess and milk in the nursing period. Transmission froman infected to an uninfected individual is most likely bytransmission of HIV-infected cells\u2014in particular, macro-phages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. In the worldwide epidemic, it is estimated that 75% of the cases of HIV transmission are attributable to heterosexualcontact. While the probability of transmission by vaginal in-tercourse is lower than by other means, such as IV drug useor receptive anal intercourse, the likelihood of infection isgreatly enhanced by the presence of other sexually transmit-ted diseases (STDs). In populations where prostitution isrampant, STDs flourish and provide a powerful cofactor forthe heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. Reasons for this in-creased infection rate include the lesions and open sores present in many STDs, which favor the transfer of HIV-infected blood during intercourse. While the AIDS epidemic has engendered an understand- able fear of infection among most informed individuals,there are also exaggerated claims of the ease with which HIVinfection may be passed on. At present, there is no evidencethat casual contact with or touching an infected person canspread HIV-1 infection. Airborne transmission has neverbeen observed to cause infection. In virtually every well-documented case of HIV-1 infection, there is evidence forcontact with blood, milk, semen, or vaginal fluid from an infected individual. Research workers and medical profes-sionals who take reasonable precautions have a very low inci-dence of AIDS, despite repeated contact with infectedmaterials. The risk of transmitting HIV infection can beminimized by simple precautionary measures, including theavoidance of any practice that could allow exposure of bro-ken or abraded skin or any mucosal membrane to bloodfrom a potentially infected person. The use of condoms whenhaving sex with individuals of unknown infection status ishighly recommended. One factor contributing to the spreadof HIV is the long period after infection during which noclinical signs may appear but during which the infected indi-vidual may infect others. Thus, universal use of precaution-ary measures is important whenever and wherever infectionstatus is uncertain. It is a sobering thought that the epidemic of AIDS came at a time when many believed that infectious diseases no longerposed a serious threat to people in the United States and otherindustrialized nations. Vaccines and antibiotics controlledmost serious infectious agents. The eradication of smallpox inthe world had recently been celebrated, and polio was yieldingto widespread vaccination efforts; these were consideredmilestones on the road to elimination of most infectious dis-eases. The outbreak of AIDS shattered this complacency andtriggered a massive effort to combat this disease. In addition,the immunodeficiency that characterizes AIDS has allowedre-emergence of other infectious diseases, such as tuberculo-sis, which have the potential to spread into populations not infected with HIV . A Retrovirus, HIV- 1, Is the Causative Agent of AIDS Within a few years after recognition of AIDS as an infectious disease, the causative agent was discovered and characterizedby efforts in the laboratories of Luc Montagnier in Paris andRobert Gallo in Bethesda (Figure 19-8). This immunodefi-ciency syndrome was novel at the time in that the type ofvirus causing it was a retrovirus. Retroviruses carry their ge- netic information in the form of RNA. When the virus entersa cell, the RNA is reverse transcribed to DNA by a virally encoded enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT). As the nameimplies, RT reverses the normal transcription process andmakes a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome. This copy,which is called a provirus, is integrated into the cell genome and is replicated along with the cell DNA. When the provirusis expressed to form new virions, the cell lyses. Alternatively,the provirus may remain latent in the cell until some regula-tory signal starts the expression process. Only one other human retrovirus, human T-cell lym- photropic virus I, or HTLV-I, had been described beforeHIV-1. This retrovirus is endemic in the southern part ofJapan and in the Caribbean. Although most individuals in-fected with HTLV-I display no clinical signs of disease, asmall percentage develop serious illness, either adult T-cellleukemia, which is aggressive and usually fatal, or a disablingprogressive neurologic disorder called HTLV-I-associatedmyelopathy (called tropical spastic paraparesis in early re-ports). Although comparisons of their genomic sequencesrevealed that HIV-1 is not a close relative of HTLV-I, similar-ities in overall characteristics led to use of the name HTLV-IIIfor the AIDS virus in early reports. There is also a related hu-man virus called HIV-2, which is less pathogenic in humansthan HIV-1. HIV-2 is similar to viruses isolated from mon-keys; it infects certain nonhuman primates that are not in-fected by HIV-1. Viruses related to HIV-1 have been found in nonhuman primates. These viruses, variants of simian immunodefi-ciency virus, or SIV , cause immunodeficiency in cer-tain infected monkeys. Normally, SIV strains cause nodisease in their normal host but produce immunodeficiencysimilar to AIDS when injected into another species. For ex-ample, the virus from African green monkeys (SIV agm) is present in a high percentage of normal healthy African greenmonkeys in the wild. However, when SIV agmis injected into macaques, it causes a severe, often lethal, immunodeficiency. A number of other animal retroviruses more or less similar to HIV-1 have been reported. These include the feline andbovine immunodeficiency viruses and the mouse leukemiavirus. Study of these animal viruses has yielded informationconcerning the general nature of retrovirus action, but specificinformation about HIV-1 cannot be gained by infecting ani-444 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseAIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 445 mals because HIV-1 does not replicate in them. Only the chimpanzee supports infection with HIV-1 at a level sufficientto be useful in vaccine trials, but infected chimpanzees onlyrarely develop AIDS, which limits the value of this model inthe study of viral pathogenesis. In addition, the number ofchimpanzees available for such studies is low and both the ex-pense and the ethical issues involved in experiments withchimpanzees preclude widespread use of this infection model.The SCID mouse (see above) reconstituted with human lym-phoid tissue for infection with HIV-1 has been useful for cer-tain studies of HIV-1 infection, especially in the developmentof drugs to combat viral replication. Reasons for the limited host range of HIV-1 include not only the cell-surface receptors required for entry of the virusinto the host cell but dependence of the virus on host-cellfactors for early events in its replication process, such as tran-scription and splicing of viral messages. For example, mousecells transfected with genes that mediate expression of thehuman receptors for HIV-1 will not support HIV-1 replica-tion because they lack other host factors. By contrast, cellsfrom hamsters or rabbits transfected to express the human receptors support levels of virus replication similar to thoseseen in human cells. Despite some progress in understandingthe factors needed for HIV-1 infection, no clear candidate foran animal model of HIV-1 infection exists. This lack of a suit-able infection model hampers efforts to develop both drugsand vaccines to combat AIDS. Recent publicity focused on activists claiming that there is no connection between HIV and AIDS and that antiretrovi-ral drugs are useless to combat the disease. The so-calledAIDS denialists believe that precautions against infection arenot necessary, and that testing for HIV infection has no valuebecause treatment is worthless or harmful. Some even denythe existence of an epidemic or that AIDS is an actual disease.While science requires that all ideas should be tested, denialof medical care to infected individuals based on this fringegroup's notions is not an option. All relevant studies supporta near perfect correlation between HIV infection and disease;drugs that lower the amount of virus in a patient (viral load)prevent opportunistic infections.VISUALIZING CONCEPTS FIGURE 19-8 Structure of HIV. (a) Cross-sectional schematic diagram of HIV virion. Each virion expresses 72glycoprotein pro- jections composed of gp 120and gp 41. The gp 41molecule is a transmembrane molecule that crosses the lipid bilayer of the viralenvelope. Gp 120is associated with gp 41and serves as the viral receptor for CD 4on host cells. The viral envelope derives from the host cell and contains some host-cell membrane proteins, in-cluding class I and class II MHC molecules. Within the envelopeis the viral core, or nucleocapsid, which includes a layer of a pro-tein called p 17and an inner layer of a protein called p 24. The HIVgenome consists of two copies of single-stranded RNA, which are associated with two molecules of reverse transcriptase (p 64) and nucleoid proteins p 10, a protease, and p 32, an integrase.

The highly encouraging results of the Uganda study revealed in-fection in only 13.1% of the babies in the Nevirapine group when tested at 16 weeks of age. Of those given a shortcourse of Zidovudine, 25.1% were in- fected at this age compared to 40.2% in a small group given placebo. From thisstudy it appears that the single dose ofNevirapine is the most effective meansfound thus far to prevent maternal-infanttransmission of HIV infection\u2014evenbetter than the more extensive and costlyregimen currently used in developedcountries. These results must be verifiedand the possibility of unexpected side ef- fects must be explored. However, this re-sult gives hope for reduction of infantinfection in parts of the world where ac-cess to medical care is limited. As mentioned above, the study was designed to conform to the reality of ma-ternal health care in Kampala; it fits thissystem perfectly. The use of Nevirapinehas other significant advantages, includ-ing stability of the drug at room temper-ature and reasonable cost. The dose ofNevirapine administered to the motherand infant costs about 200 times less than the Zidovudine regimen in currentuse in the U.S. In fact, the treatment issufficiently inexpensive to suggest that itmay be cost-effective to treat all mothersat the time of delivery in those areaswhere rates of infection are high, be-cause the Nevirapine treatment costsless than the tests used to determineHIV infection. Obviously, such a strategymust be embarked upon cautiously,given the danger of long-term side ef-fects and other unexpected problems. Approximately 500,000 infants become infected with HIV each year. The majority of these in-fections result from transmission ofvirus from HIV-infected mothers duringchildbirth or by transfer of virus frommilk during breast-feeding. The inci-dence of maternal acquired infection canbe reduced as much as 67% by treat- ment of the infected mother with acourse of Zidovudine (AZT) for severalmonths prior to delivery, and treatmentof her infant for 6weeks after birth. This treatment regimen is widely used in theU.S. However, the majority of worldwideHIV infection of infants occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and other less developedareas, where the cost and timing of theZidovudine regimen render it an imprac-tical solution to the problem of maternal-infant HIV transmission. A 1999 clinical trial of the anti-retroviral Nevirapine (viramune) brings hope for apractical way to combat infant HIV in-fection under less than ideal conditions of clinical care. The trial took place at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda,and enrolled 645 mothers who tested positive for HIV infection. About half ofthe mothers were given a single dose ofNevirapine at the onset of labor and theirinfants were given a single dose 24-30 hours after birth. The dose and timingwere dictated by the customary rapid discharge at the hospital. The control armof the study involved a more extensivecourse of Zidovudine, but in-country con-ditions did not allow exact replication ofthe full course administered to infectedmothers in the U.S. The overall rate of infection for in- fants born to untreated mothers is esti-CLINICAL FOCUS Prevention of Infant HIV Infection by Anti-RetroviralTreatment Mural showing mother and child on an outside wall of Mulago Hospital Complex in Kampala, Uganda, site of the clinical trial demonstrating that maternal-infant HIV- 1 transmission was greatly reduced by Nevirapine. [Courtesy of Thomas Quinn, Johns Hopkins University.]In Vitro Studies Revealed the HIV- 1 Replication Cycle The AIDS virus can infect human T cells in culture, replicat- ing itself and in many cases causing the lysis of the cell host(Figure 19-9). Much has been learned about the life cycle ofHIV-1 from in vitro studies. The various proteins encoded bythe viral genome have been characterized and the functionsof most of them are known (Figure 19-10). The first step in HIV infection is viral attachment and en- try into the target cell. HIV-1 infects T cells that carry theCD4 antigen on their surface; in addition, certain HIVstrains will infect monocytes and other cells that have CD4on their surface. The preference for CD4 /H11001cells is due to a high-affinity interaction between a coat (envelope or env)protein of HIV-1 and cell-surface CD4. Although the virusbinds to CD4 on the cell surface, this interaction alone is notsufficient for entry and productive infection. Expression ofother cell-surface molecules, coreceptors present on T cellsand monocytes, is required for HIV-1 infection. The infec-tion of a T cell, depicted in Figure 19-11a, is assisted by the T-cell coreceptor CXCR4 (in initial reports, this molecule wascalled fusin). analogous receptor called CCR5 functionsfor the monocyte or macrophage. After the virus has entered the cell, the RNA genome of the virus is reverse transcribed and a cDNA copy (provirus)integrates into the host genome. The integrated provirus istranscribed and the various viral RNA messages spliced and translated into proteins, which along with a complete newcopy of the RNA genome are used to form new viral particles(Figure 19-11b). The gag proteins of the virus are cleaved bythe viral protease into the forms that make up the nuclearcapsid (see Figure 19-10) in a mature infectious viral particle.As will be described below, different stages in this viral repli-cation process can be targeted by antiviral drugs. The discovery that CXCR4 and CCR5 serve as corecep- tors for HIV-1 on T cells and macrophages, respectively,explained why some strains of HIV-1 preferentially infectT cells (T-tropic strains) while others prefer macrophages(M-tropic strains). T-tropic strain uses CXCR4, whilethe M-tropic strains use CCR5. This use of different core-ceptors also helped to explain the different roles of cy-tokines and chemokines in virus replication. It was knownfrom in vitro studies that certain chemokines had a nega-tive effect on virus replication while certain pro-inflamma-tory cytokines had a positive effect. Both of the HIVcoreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, function as receptors forchemokines (see Table 15-2). Because the receptors cannotbind simultaneously to HIV-1 and to their chemokine lig-and, there is competition for the receptor between thevirus and the normal ligand (Figure 19-11c), and thechemokine can block viral entry into the host cell. Whereasthe chemokines compete with HIV for usage of the core-ceptor and thus inhibit viral entry, the pro-inflammatorycytokines induce greater expression of the chemokine re-ceptors on the cell surface, making the cells more suscepti-ble to viral entry. HIV-1 infection of T cells with certain strains of virus leads to the formation of giant cells or syncytia. These areformed by the fusion of a group of cells caused by the inter-action of the viral envelope protein gp120 on the surface ofinfected cells with CD4 and the coreceptors on the surface ofother cells, infected or not. After the initial binding, the ac-tion of other cell-adhesion molecules welds the cells togetherin a large multinuclear mass with a characteristic fused bal-looning membrane which eventually bursts. Formation ofsyncytia may be blocked by antibodies to some of the epi-topes of the CD4 molecule, by soluble forms of the CD4 mol-ecule (prepared by in vitro expression of a CD4 genegenetically engineered to lack the transmembrane portion),and by antibodies to cell-adhesion molecules. Individual isolates of HIV-1 differ in their ability to induce syncytia formation. Isolates of HIV-1 from different sources were formerly classified as syncytia-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI). In most cases, these differences correlatedwith the ability of the virus to infect T cells or macrophages:T-tropic strains were SI, whereas M-tropic strains were NSI.More recent classifications of HIV-1 are based on whichcoreceptor the virus uses; there is good but not absolute cor-relation between the use of CXCR4, which is present on Tcells, and syncytia-inducing ability. The NSI strains useAIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 447 FIGURE 19-9 Once the HIV provirus has been activated, buds rep- resenting newly formed viral particles can be observed on the surfaceof an infected T cell.

Nucleocapsid containing viral genome and enzymes enters cells. Viral genome and enzymes are released following removal of core proteins. Viral reverse transcriptase catalyzes reverse transcription of ssRNA, forming RNA -DNA hybrids. Original RNA template is partially degraded by ribonuclease H, followed by synthesis of second DNA strand to yield HIV dsDNA. The viral dsDNA is then translocated to the nucleus and integrated into the host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme.Transcription factors stimulate transcription of proviral DNA into genomic ssRNA and, after processing, several mRNAs. Viral RNA is exported to cytoplasm. Host-cell ribosomes catalyze synthesis of viral precursor proteins. Viral protease cleaves precursors into viral proteins. HIV ssRNA and proteins assemble beneath the host-cell membrane, into which gp41 and gp120 are inserted. The membrane buds out, forming the viral envelope.

Studies of the viral envelope protein gp120 identified a region called the V3loop, which plays a role in the choice of receptors used by thevirus. A study by Mark Goldsmith and Bruce Chesebro andtheir colleagues indicates that a single amino acid differencein this region of gp120 may be sufficient to determine whichreceptor is used. HIV- 1Infection Leads to Opportunistic Infections Isolation of HIV-1 and its growth in culture has allowed pu- rification of viral proteins and the development of tests forinfection with the virus. The most commonly used test is forthe presence of antibodies directed against proteins of HIV-1. These generally appear in the serum of infected individu-als by three months after the infection has occurred. Whenthe antibodies appear, the individual is said to have serocon-verted or to be seropositive for HIV-1. Although the precisecourse of HIV-1 infection and disease onset varies consider-ably in different patients, a general scheme for the progres-sion of AIDS can be constructed (Figure 19-12). The courseof HIV-1 infection begins with no detectable anti-HIV-1 an-tibodies or virus and progresses to the full AIDS syndrome. Diagnosis of AIDS includes evidence for infection with HIV-1 (presence of antibodies or virus in blood), greatly di-minished numbers of CD4 /H11001T cells ( or and theoccurrence of opportunistic infections (Table 19-3). Patientswith AIDS generally succumb to tuberculosis, pneumonia,severe wasting diarrhea, or various malignancies. The timebetween acquisition of the virus and death from the immun-odeficiency averages nine to twelve years. In the period be-tween infection and severe disease, there may be fewsymptoms. Primary infection in a minority of patients maybe symptomatic with fever, lymphadenopathy (swollenlymph nodes), and a rash, but these symptoms generally donot persist more than a few weeks. Most commonly, primaryinfection goes unnoticed and is followed by a long chronicphase, during which the infected individual shows little or noovert sign of HIV-1 infection. The first overt indication of AIDS may be opportunistic infection with the fungus Candida albicans, which causes the appearance of sores in the mouth (thrush) and, in women, avulvovaginal yeast infection that does not respond to treat-ment. A persistent hacking cough caused by P. carinii infec- tion of the lungs may also be an early indicator. A rise in thelevel of circulating HIV-1 (viral load) in the plasma and concomitant drop in the number of CD4 /H11001T cells generally previews this first appearance of symptoms. Some relationbetween the CD4 /H11001T-cell number and the type of infection experienced by the patient has been established (see Table19-3). Of intense interest to immunologists are the eventsthat take place between the initial confrontation with HIV-1and the takeover and collapse of the host immune system.Understanding how the immune system holds HIV-1 incheck during this chronic phase can lead to the design of ef-fective therapeutic and preventive strategies. Research into the process that underlies the progression of HIV infection to AIDS has revealed a dynamic interplay be-tween the virus and the immune system. The initial infectionevent causes dissemination of virus to lymphoid organs anda resultant strong immune response. This response, whichinvolves both antibody and cytotoxic CD8 /H11001T lymphocytes, keeps viral replication in check; after the initial burst ofviremia (high levels of virus in the circulation), the viral levelin the circulation achieves a steady state. Although the in-fected individual normally has no clinical signs of disease atthis stage, viral replication continues and virus can be de-tected in circulation by sensitive PCR assays for viral RNA.These PCR-based assays, which measure viral load (the number of copies of viral genome in the plasma), have as-sumed a major role in determination of the patient's statusand prognosis. Even when the level of virus in the circulationis stable, large amounts of virus are produced in infectedCD4 /H11001T cells; as many as 109virions are released every day and continually infect and destroy additional host T cells(Figure 19-13a). Despite this high rate of replication, thevirus is kept in check by the immune system throughout the450 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease 1,000 800 600 400200 0 YearsChronic phase CD4 T cells HIV viral load Anti-HIV antibodyAIDSDeath Seroconversion Acute phase Weeks0 61 2 123456789 1 0 1 1CD4+ T-cell count in blood (cells/mm3) Viral load in blood (HIV RNA copies/ml plasma) 102103104105106++ ++ + + FIGURE 19-12 Serologic profile of HIV infection showing three stages in the infection process. Soon after infection, viral RNA is de-tectable in the serum. However, HIV infection is most commonly de-tected by the presence of anti-HIV antibodies after seroconversion,which normally occurs within a few months after infection. Clinicalsymptoms indicative of AIDS generally do not appear for at least 8 years after infection, but this interval is variable. The onset of clinicalAIDS is usually signaled by a decrease in T-cell numbers and an in-crease in viral load. [Adapted from A. Fauci et al., 1996,Annals Int. Med. 124: 654.]chronic phase of infection, and the level of virus in circula- tion from about six months after infection is a good predic-tor of the course of disease. Low levels of virus in this periodcorrelate with a longer time in which the infected individualremains free of opportunistic infection. But the virus eventu-ally breaks through host immune defenses, resulting in an in-crease in viral load, a decrease in CD4 /H11001T cell numbers, in- creased opportunistic infection, and death of the patient. While the viral load in plasma remains fairly stable throughout the period of chronic HIV infection, examina-tion of the lymph nodes has revealed a different story.

The decrease in CD4 /H11001T cells is the hallmark of AIDS. Several explanations have been advanced for the depletion ofthese cells in patients. In early studies, direct viral infectionand destruction of CD4 /H11001T cells was discounted as the primary cause, because the large numbers of circulatingHIV-infected T cells predicted by the model were not found.More recent studies indicate that the reason for the difficultyin finding the infected cells is that they are so rapidly killed byHIV; the half-life of an actively infected CD4 /H11001T cell is less than 1.5 days. There are smaller numbers of CD4/H11001T cells that become infected but do not actively replicate virus.These latently infected cells persist for long periods, and theintegrated proviral DNA replicates in cell division along withcell DNA. Studies in which viral load is decreased by anti-retroviral therapy show a concurrent increase in CD4 /H11001T cell numbers (Figure 19-13b). These data support a model of dy-namic interaction between virus and T cells, with simultane-ous high levels of viral production and rapid depletion ofinfected CD4 /H11001T cells. While other mechanisms for deple- tion of CD4/H11001T cells may be envisioned, infection with HIV remains the prime suspect.Not only depletion of CD4/H11001T cells but other immuno- logic consequences can be measured in HIV-infected indi-viduals during the progression to AIDS. These include adecrease or absence of delayed hypersensitivity to antigens towhich the individual normally reacts. Serum levels of im-munoglobulins, especially IgG and IgA, show a sharp in-crease in the AIDS patient. This increase may be due toincreased levels in HIV-infected individuals of a B-cell subpopulation with low CD21 expression and enhanced population proliferates poorlyin response to B-cell mitogens. Cellular parameters of im-munologic response, such as the proliferative response to mi-togens, to antigens, or to alloantigens, all show a markeddecrease. Generally, the HIV-infected individual loses theability to mount T-cell responses in a predictable sequence:responses to specific antigens (for example, influenza virus)are first lost, then response to alloantigens declines, andlastly, the response to mitogens such as concanavalin A orphytohemagglutinin can no longer be detected.

(a) A dynamic relation-ship exists between the number of CD 4 /H11001cells and the amount of virus produced. As virus is produced, new CD 4/H11001cells are infected, and theseinfected cells have a half-life of 1.5days. In progression to full AIDS, the viral load increases and the CD 4/H11001T-cell count decreases before onset of opportunistic infections.

A frequent complication in laterstages of HIV infection is AIDS dementia complex, a neuro-logical syndrome characterized by abnormalities in cognition,motor performance, and behavior. Whether AIDS dementiaand other clinical and histopathological effects observed in thecentral nervous systems of HIV-infected individuals are a di-rect effect of viral antigens on the brain, a consequence of im-mune responses to the virus, or a result of infection byopportunistic agents remains unknown. Therapeutic Agents Inhibit Retrovirus Replication Development of a vaccine to prevent the spread of AIDS is the highest priority for immunologists, but it is also criticalto develop drugs and therapies that can reverse the effects ofHIV-1 in infected individuals. The number of HIV-infectedpersons is estimated to be close to 1 million in the UnitedStates alone; for all of these individuals to develop AIDS would be an enormous tragedy. There are several strategiesfor development of effective anti-viral drugs. The life cycle ofHIV shows several susceptible points that might be blockedby pharmaceutical agents (Figure 19-14). The key to successof such therapies is that they must be specific for HIV-1 andinterfere minimally with normal cell processes. Thus far, twotypes of antiviral agents have found their way into commonusage. The first success in treatment was with drugs that in-terfere with the reverse transcription of viral RNA to cDNA;several drugs in common use operate at this step. A secondstage of viral replication that has proved amenable to block-ade is the step at which precursor proteins are cleaved intothe units needed for construction of a new mature virion.This step requires the action of a specific viral protease,which can be inhibited by chemical agents; this precludes theformation of infectious viral particles. Several antiretroviral drugs are now in widespread use (Table 19-5) that either interfere with reverse transcriptionor inhibit the viral protease. The prototype of the drugs thatAIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 453 TABLE 19-4 Immunologic abnormalities associated with HIV infection Stage of infection Typical abnormalities observed LYMPH NODE STRUCTURE Early Infection and destruction of dendritic cells; some structural disruption Late Extensive damage and tissue necrosis; loss of folicular dendritic cells and germinal centers; inability to trap antigens or support activation of T and B cells T HELPER (T H) CELLS Early No in vitro proliferative response to specific antigen Late Decrease in T H-cell numbers and corresponding helper activities; no response to T-cell mitogens or alloantigens ANTIBODY PRODUCTION Early Enhanced nonspecific IgG and IgA production but reduced IgM synthesis Late No proliferation of B cells specific for HIV- 1: no detectable anti-HIV antibodies in some patients; increased numbers of B cells with low CD 21and enhanced Ig secretion.

The introduction of AZT, a nucleosideanalog, into the growing cDNA chain of the retrovirus causestermination of the chain. AZT is effective in some but not allpatients, and its efficacy is further limited because long-termuse has several adverse side effects and because resistant viralmutants develop in treated patients. The administered AZTis used not only by the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase but alsoby human DNA polymerase. The incorporation of AZT intothe DNA of host cells kills them. Precursors of red blood cellsare especially sensitive to AZT, which thus causes anemia inaddition to other side effects. A different approach to block-ing reverse transcription employs drugs such as Nevirapine,which inhibit the action of the reverse transcriptase enzyme(see Table 19-5). A second class of drugs called protease inhibitors has proven effective when used in conjunction with AZT and/orother nucleoside analogs. Current treatment for AIDS is acombination therapy, using regimens designated HAART(highly active anti-retroviral therapy). In most cases, this com-bines the use of two nucleoside analogs and one protease in-hibitor. The combination strategy appears to overcome theability of the virus to rapidly produce mutants that are drug resistant. In many cases, HAART has lowered viral load to levels that are not detectable by current methods and has improved the health of AIDS patients to the point that theycan again function at a normal level. The decrease in the num-ber of AIDS deaths in the United States in recent years (see Fig-ure 19-6) is attributed to this advance in therapy. Despite theoptimism engendered by success with HAART, present draw-backs include a strict time schedule of administration and thelarge number of pills to be taken every day. In addition, theremay be serious side effects (see Table 19-5) that, in some pa-tients, may be too severe to allow use of HAART. The success of HAART in treating AIDS has opened dis- cussion of whether it might be possible to eradicate all virusfrom an infected individual and thus actually cure AIDS. MostAIDS experts are not convinced that this is possible, mainlybecause of the persistence of latently infected CD4 /H11001T cells and macrophages, which can serve as a reservoir of infectiousvirus if the provirus should be activated. Even with a viral loadbeneath the level of detection by PCR assays, the immune sys-tem may not recover sufficiently to clear virus should it beginto replicate in response to some activation signal. In addition,virus may persist in sites such as the brain, not readily pene-trated by the antiretroviral drugs, even though the virus in cir-culation is undetectable. The use of immune modulators,such as recombinant IL-2, in conjunction with HAART is be-454 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease FIGURE 19-14 Stages in the viral replication cycle that provide tar- gets for therapeutic antiretroviral drugs.

New drugs are in various stages of development. One promising class of drugs interferes with integration of the viral DNA into the host genome (see Figure 19-14). Othersdrugs being considered act at the stage of viral attachment tothe host cell. It should be stressed that the development ofany drug to the point at which it can be used for patients is along and arduous procedure. The drugs that pass the rigor-ous tests for safety and efficacy represent a small fraction of those that receive initial consideration.

Even if eradication of the virus in individualstreated with combination therapy becomes possible, it will notgreatly influence the epidemic in the developing countries,which include the majority of AIDS victims. It is likely that ef-fective, inexpensive, and well-tolerated drugs will be developedin the future, but at present it appears that the best option tostop the spread of AIDS is a safe, effective vaccine that preventsinfection and progression to disease. Why do we not have anAIDS vaccine? The best answer to this question is to examinethe special conditions that must be addressed in developing asafe, effective vaccine for this disease (Table 19-6). Most effective vaccines mimic the natural state of infection. Individuals who recover from most diseases are immune fromsubsequent attacks. The infection by HIV-1 and progression toimmunodeficiency syndrome flourishes even in the presenceof circulating antibodies directed against proteins of the virus.Immunity may hold the virus in check for a time, but as men-tioned above, it rarely exceeds 12 years. In a rare subset of in-fected individuals called long-term nonprogressors, the periodof infection without disease is longer and even indefinite. An-other group for whom immunity seems to function are thosewho are persistently exposed but who remain seronegative. Inthis category are a low percentage of commercial sex workersin areas of high endemic infection, such as Nairobi, who havenot become infected despite multiple daily exposures to in-fected individuals. Because the state of immunity (which anti-bodies are present and what type of cellular immunity isactive) in these individuals is not clear or consistent, it is diffi-cult to duplicate for vaccine development. Certain of the long-term nonprogressors or exposed and noninfected individualshave mutations and deletions in genes encoding cell corecep-tors that slow the progress of viral attack on their immune sys-tem, rather than an immune response that is holding HIV replication in check. Most vaccines prevent disease, not infection. Polio and in- fluenza vaccines hold the virus produced by infected cells incheck so that it does not cause harm to the host, and it is thencleared. HIV-1 does not fit this model, because it integratesinto the host genome and may remain latent for long periods.As described above in the context of treatment strategies,eradication of a retrovirus is not a simple matter. Clearanceof a retrovirus is a difficult goal for a vaccine; every copy ofthe virus and every infected cell, including those latently infected, must be eradicated from the host. However evenwithout complete eradication, an HIV vaccine may benefitthe infected individual; furthermore, a vaccine that caused alowered viral load would help to control the spread of infec-tion. A recent study in Uganda of sexual partners unmatchedfor infection showed that low viral load in the infected part-ner inhibited spread to the uninfected mate. Most vaccines prevent infection by viruses that show little variation. The instability of its genome differentiates HIV-1 from most viruses for which successful vaccines have beendeveloped. With the exception of influenza, for which thevaccines must be changed periodically, most viruses that canbe controlled by immunization show only minor variabilityin structure. For comparison, consider that the rhinovirusesthat cause the common cold have more than 100 subtypes;therefore no effective vaccine has been developed. HIV-1shows variation in most viral antigens; and the rate of repli-cation may be as high as 10 9viruses per day. This variability along with the high rate of replication allows the productionof viruses with multiple mutations; some of these allow es-cape from immunity.

Most vaccines protect against disease, not against infection; HIV infection may remain latent for long periods before causing A IDS. Most vaccines protect for years against viruses that change very little over time; HIV- 1mutates at a rapid rate and efficiently selects mu- tant forms that evade immunity. Most effective vaccines are whole-killed or live-attenuated organisms; killed HIV- 1does not retain antigenicity and the use of a live retro- virus vaccine raises safety issues. Most vaccines protect against infections that are infrequently encountered; HIV may be encountered daily by individuals at high risk. Most vaccines protect against infections through mucosal surfaces of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract; the great major ity of HIV infection is through the genital tract. Most vaccines are tested for safety and efficacy in an animal model before trials with human volunteers; there is no suitable a nimal model for HIV/AIDS at present. SOURCE: Adapted from A. S. Fauci, 1996 , An HIV breaking the paradigms, Proc. Am. Assoc. Phys. 108: 6.lates taken from the same patient at different times indicates that variation occurs and that some of the variants replicate,presumably because they have learned to evade host immunedefenses. Data showing that antibody from advanced AIDSpatients will not neutralize virus isolated from that patient,but will kill other strains of HIV-1, argues that HIV-1 doesevade the immune system by mutation of proteins targetedby antibody. The majority of successful vaccines are live-attenuated or heat-killed organisms. While there are exceptions to this, no- tably the recombinant protein used for hepatitis B vaccine andthe conjugate used for Haemophilus influenzae B vaccine (see Chapter 18), most of the widely used vaccines are attenuatedorganisms. The development of a live-attenuated retrovirusvaccine from animal viruses engineered to include HIV anti-gens is a possible route. However, the use of live vaccines ispredicated on the supposition that the immunity raised willclear the vaccine virus from the host. This is not easily done fora retrovirus, which integrates into the host genome. A massivetesting effort would be required to assure that a live retroviralvaccine was safe and did not cause chronic host infection. Onthe positive side, clinical studies using other viruses such as at-tenuated vaccinia or canarypox as carriers for genes encodingHIV proteins have passed phase I (safety) trials and have ad-vanced to phase II (efficacy) trials. For most viruses, the frequency of exposure to infection is rare or seasonal. In many high-risk individuals, such as com- mercial sex workers, monogamous sexual partners of HIV-infected subjects, and intravenous drug users, the virus isencountered frequently and, potentially, in large doses. AnAIDS vaccine is thus asked to prevent infection against a con-stant attack by the virus and/or massive doses of virus; this isnot normally the case with other viruses for which immu-nization has proved successful. Most vaccines protect against respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. In addition to the frequency of exposure to HIV , which may be extraordinarily high for some high-risk indi-viduals, there is also the question of route. The majority ofsuccessful vaccines protect against viruses that are encoun-tered in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; the mostcommon route of HIV-1 infection is by the genital tract. It isnot known whether the immunity established by conven-tional vaccination procedures will protect against infectionby this route. Although the lack of a completely relevant ani-mal model precludes an in-depth test of protection, prelimi-nary vaccine studies using rectal or vaginal challenge ofimmunized primates with HIV-SIV chimeric viruses (SHIV)show protection to this challenge route. Development of most vaccines through to clinical trials relies upon animal experiments. T esting a vaccine for safety and ef- ficacy normally involves challenge of an animal with thevirus under conditions similar to those encountered in thehuman. In this way, the correlates of protective immunity areestablished. For example, if high titers of CD8 /H11001T cells and neutralizing antibody are necessary for protection in an ani-mal, then CD8/H11001T-cell immunity and antibody should be measured in human trials of the vaccine. Thus far, animalstudies of HIV infection and disease have yielded only a fewhard facts about immune responses that are protectiveagainst infection or that prevent progression to disease.Many results involve a specific virus in a particular host andare not easily extrapolated to universal concepts, becausethey depend upon host factors as well the relationships be-tween the immunizing and challenge strains of virus. How-ever, experiments have shown that passive immunizationwith antibodies taken from HIV-infected chimpanzees pro-tect macaques from challenge with SHIV strains bearingHIV-envelope glycoprotein. Further indication that antibod-ies can prevent infection is given by studies in which mono-clonal antibodies protected macaques from vaginal challengewith SHIV . In all cases the antibodies needed to be present atthe time of challenge. Post-challenge administration of anti-bodies was not effective in preventing infection. Although there are no reports of great success in human HIV vaccine trials, research in this difficult area continues tobe active. At the end of the year 2000, there were 60 phase Itrials in progress involving recombinant proteins, peptides,DNA vaccines, and poxvirus/recombinant protein combina-tion trials. At the same time, only 6 phase II trials were inprogress and only 2 candidates advanced to phase III\u2014the3rd, or final, phase of clinical trials\u2014the test of efficacy. De-spite a massive effort, progress remains slow. There is nowhope that a vaccine can emerge from the accumulating know-ledge on human responses to the vaccine candidates. In addition to developing a scientific rationale, behavioral and social issues influence the development and testing ofcandidate AIDS vaccines .Counseling concerning safe sexual practice must be part of the care given to volunteers in a vac-cine trial. Will this influence the results? Would a lowering ofthe infection rate in all groups taking part in the trial pre-clude seeing a meaningful difference in the infection rate between the vaccine and the placebo groups? A further con-sideration is the fact that anyone successfully immunizedagainst the AIDS virus will become seropositive and will testpositive in the standard screening assays for infection. Whatramifications will this have? Will the more complex viral-load assays be needed to ascertain whether an immunized in-dividual is actually infected? It is clear that development of an AIDS vaccine is not a simple exercise in classic vaccinology. More research is neededto understand how this viral attack against the immune sys-tem can be thwarted. While much has been written about thesubject and large-scale initiatives are proposed, the path to aneffective vaccine is not obvious. It is certain only that all datamust be carefully analyzed and that all possible means of cre-ating immunity must be tested. This is one of the greatestpublic health challenges of our time. An intense and coopera-tive effort must be launched to devise, test, and deliver a safeand effective vaccine for AIDS. The status of current efforts inAIDS vaccine development is summarized in Table 19-7.AIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 457SUMMARY IImmunodeficiency results from the failure of one or more components of the immune system. Primary immunodefi-ciencies are present at birth, secondary or acquired im-munodeficiencies arise from a variety of causes. IImmunodeficiencies may be classified by the cell types in-volved and may affect either the lymphoid or the myeloidcell lineage or both. IThe gene defects that underlie primary immunodeficiencyallow precise classification. Genetic defects in moleculesinvolved in signal transduction or in cellular communica- tion are found in many immunodeficiencies. ILymphoid immunodeficiencies affect T cells, B cells,or both. Failure of thymic development results in severe immunodeficiency and can hinder normal de-velopment of B cells, because of the lack of cellular cooperation.

Would you diagnose either patient or both of them as having AIDS?AIDS and Other Immunodeficiencies CHAPTER 19 461IOrgan-Specific Autoimmune Diseases ISystemic Autoimmune Diseases IAnimal Models for Autoimmune Diseases IEvidence Implicating the CD 4+T Cell, MHC, and TCR in ofAutoimmunity ITreatment of Autoimmune DiseasesAutoimmunity , realized that the immune system could go awryand, instead of reacting against foreign antigens, could focus its attack on self-antigens. He termed this con-dition \"horror autotoxicus.\" We now understand that, whilemechanisms of self-tolerance protect an individualfrom potentially self-reactive lymphocytes, there are failures.They result in an inappropriate response of the immune system against self-components termed autoimmunity. In the 1960s, it was believed that all self-reactive lymphocyteswere eliminated during their development in the bone mar-row and thymus and that a failure to eliminate these lym-phocytes led to autoimmune consequences. Since the late1970s, a broad body of experimental evidence has counteredthat belief, revealing that not all self-reactive lymphocytesare deleted during T-cell and B-cell maturation. Instead,normal healthy have been shown to possess ma-ture, recirculating, self-reactive lymphocytes. Since the pres-ence of these self-reactive lymphocytes in the periphery doesnot inevitably result in autoimmune reactions, their activitymust be regulated in normal individuals through clonalanergy or clonal suppression. A breakdown in this regulationcan lead to activation of self-reactive clones of T or B cells,generating humoral or cell-mediated responses against self-antigens. These reactions can cause serious damage to cellsand organs, sometimes with fatal consequences. Sometimes the damage to self-cells or organs is caused by antibodies; in other cases, T cells are the culprit. For exam-ple, a common form of autoimmunity is tissue injury bymechanisms similar to type II hypersensitivity reactions. AsChapter 16 showed, type II hypersensitivity reactions in-volve antibody-mediated destruction of cells. Autoimmunehemolytic anemia is an excellent example of such an autoim-mune disease. In this disease, antigens on red blood cells arerecognized by auto-antibodies, which results in the destruc-tion of the blood cells, which in turn results in anemia. Auto-antibodies are also the major offender in Hashimoto's thy-roiditis, in which antibodies reactive with tissue-specificantigens such as thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin causesevere tissue destruction. Other autoimmune diseases thatinvolve auto-antibodies are listed in Table 20-1. Many autoimmune diseases are characterized by tissue destruction mediated directly by T cells. A well-known ex-ample is rheumatoid arthritis, in which self-reactive T cellsattack the tissue in joints, causing an inflammatory responsethat results in swelling and tissue destruction. Other exam-ples include insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and multi-ple sclerosis (see Table 20-1).This chapter describes some common human autoim- mune diseases. These can be divided into two broad cate-gories: organ-specific and systemic autoimmune disease(Table 20-1). Such diseases affect 5%-7% of the human pop-ulation, often causing chronic debilitating illnesses. Severalexperimental animal models used to study autoimmunityand various mechanisms that may contribute to inductionof autoimmune reactions also are described. Finally, currentand experimental therapies for treating autoimmune dis-eases are described. Organ-Specific Autoimmune Diseases In an organ-specific autoimmune disease, the immune re- sponse is directed to a target antigen unique to a single organor gland, so that the manifestations are largely limited to thatorgan. The cells of the target organs may be damaged di- chapter 20 Kidney Biopsy from Goodpasture's Syndrone Erectly by humoral or cell-mediated Alternatively, the antibodies may overstimulate or block thenormal function of the target organ. Some Autoimmune Diseases Are Mediated by Direct Cellular Damage Autoimmune diseases involving direct cellular damage occur when lymphocytes or antibodies bind to cell-membrane an-tigens, causing cellular lysis and/or an inflammatory responsein the affected organ. Gradually, the damaged cellular struc-ture is replaced by connective tissue (scar tissue), and the func-tion of the organ declines. This section briefly describes a fewexamples of this type of autoimmune disease. HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is most frequently seen inmiddle-aged women, an individual produces auto-antibodiesand sensitized T H1 cells specific for thyroid antigens. The DTH response is characterized by an intense infiltration ofthe thyroid gland by lymphocytes, The ensuing inflammatory response causes agoiter, or visible enlargement of the thyroid gland, a physio-logical response to hypothyroidism. Antibodies are formedto a number of thyroid proteins, including thyroglobulin andthyroid peroxidase, both of which are involved in the uptakeof iodine. Binding of the auto-antibodies to these proteinsinterferes with iodine uptake and leads to decreased produc-tion of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). AUTOIMMUNE ANEMIAS Autoimmune anemias include pernicious anemia, autoim-mune hemolytic anemia, and drug-induced hemolytic ane-mia. Pernicious anemia is caused by auto-antibodies to intrin-sic factor, a membrane-bound intestinal protein on gastricparietal cells. Intrinsic factor facilitates uptake of vitamin B 12Autoimmunity CHAPTER 20 463 TABLE 20-1 Some autoimmune diseases in humans Disease Self-antigen Immune response ORGAN-SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Addison's disease Adrenal cells Auto-antibodies Autoimmune hemolytic anemia RBC membrane proteins Auto-antibodiesGoodpasture's syndrome Renal and lung basement membranes Auto-antibodiesGraves' disease Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor Auto-antibody (stimulating)Hashimoto's thyroiditis purpura Platelet membrane proteins SYSTEMIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Ankylosing sponkylitis Vertebrae Immune complexesMultiple sclerosis Brain or white matter T H1cells and T C cells, auto-antibodies Rheumatoid arthritis Connective tissue, IgG Auto-antibodies, immune gastrointestinal Salivary gland, liver, kidney, thyroid Auto-antibodiesSystemic lupus protein, RBC and platelet membranes Auto-antibodies, immune complexesfrom the small intestine. Binding of the auto-antibody to intrinsic factor blocks the intrinsic factor-mediated absorp-tion of vitamin B 12. In the absence of sufficient vitamin B 12, which is necessary for proper hematopoiesis, the number offunctional mature red blood cells decreases below normal.Pernicious anemia is treated with injections of vitamin B 12, thus circumventing the defect in its absorption. An individual with autoimmune hemolytic anemia makes auto-antibody to RBC antigens, triggering complement-mediated lysis or antibody-mediated opsonization and phago-cytosis of the red blood cells. One form of autoimmune ane-mia is drug-induced: when certain drugs such as penicillin orthe anti-hypertensive agent methyldopa interact with redblood cells, the cells antigenic. The immunodiag-nostic test for autoimmune hemolytic anemias generallyinvolves a Coombs test, in which the red cells are incubatedwith an anti-human IgG antiserum. If IgG auto-antibodiesare present on the red cells, the cells are agglutinated by theantiserum. GOODPASTURE'S SYNDROME In Goodpasture's syndrome, auto-antibodies specific for certain basement-membrane antigens bind to the basementmembranes of the kidney glomeruli and the alveoli of thelungs. Subsequent complement activation leads to direct cel-lular damage and an ensuing inflammatory response medi-ated by a buildup of complement split products. Damage tothe glomerular and alveolar basement membranes leads toprogressive kidney damage and pulmonary hemorrhage.Death may ensue within several months of the onset ofsymptoms. Biopsies from patients with Goodpasture's syn-drome stained with fluorescent-labeled anti-IgG and anti-C3b reveal IgG along the membranes (Figure 20-2).INSULIN-DEPENDENT the population, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is caused by an autoimmune attack on the pancreas. The attack is directed against special-ized insulin-producing cells (beta cells) that are located inspherical clusters, called the islets of Langerhans, scatteredthroughout the pancreas. The autoimmune attack destroysbeta cells, resulting in decreased production of insulin andconsequently increased levels of blood glucose. Several factorsare important in the destruction of beta cells. First, activatedCTLs migrate into an islet and begin to attack the insulin-producing cells. Local cytokine production during this464 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease (a) (b) FIGURE 20-1 Photomicrographs of (a) normal thyroid gland show- ing a follicle lined by cuboidal follicular (b) gland inHashimoto's thyroiditis showing intense lymphocyte infiltration.

Thefirst CTL infiltration and activation of macrophages, fre-quently referred to as insulitis (Figure 20-3), is followed bycytokine release and the presence of auto-antibodies, whichleads to a cell-mediated DTH response. The subsequent beta-cell destruction is thought to be mediated by cytokinesreleased during the DTH response and by lytic enzymes released from the activated macrophages. Auto-antibodies tobeta cells may contribute to antibody-plus-complement lysis or antibody-dependentcell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The abnormalities in glucose metabolism that are caused by the destruction of islet beta cells result in serious meta-bolic problems that include ketoacidosis and increased urineproduction. The late stages of the disease are often character-ized by atherosclerotic vascular lesions\u2014which in turn causegangrene of the extremities due to impeded vascular flow\u2014renal failure, and blindness. If untreated, death can result.The most common therapy for diabetes is daily administra-tion of insulin. This is quite helpful in managing the disease,but, because sporadic doses are not the same as metabolicallyregulated continuous and controlled release of the hormone,periodically injected doses of insulin do not totally alleviatethe problems caused by the disease. Another complicatingfeature of diabetes is that the disorder can go undetected forseveral years, allowing irreparable loss of pancreatic tissue tooccur before treatment begins. Some Autoimmune Diseases Are Mediated by Stimulating or Blocking Auto-Antibodies In some autoimmune diseases, antibodies act as agonists, binding to hormone receptors in lieu of the normal ligandand stimulating inappropriate activity. This usually leads to an overproduction of mediators or an increase in cell growth.Conversely, auto-antibodies may act as antagonists, bindinghormone receptors but blocking receptor function. This gen-erally causes impaired secretion of mediators and gradualatrophy of the affected organ. GRAVES' DISEASE The production of thyroid hormones is carefully regulated bythyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced bythe pituitary gland. cyclase triiodothyronine. Apatient with Graves' disease produces auto-antibodies that bind the receptor for TSH and mimic the normal action ofTSH, activating adenylate cyclase and resulting in produc-tion of the thyroid hormones. Unlike TSH, however, the auto-antibodies are not regulated, and consequently they over-stimulate the thyroid. For this reason these auto-antibodiesare called (LATS) antibod-ies (Figure 20-4). MYASTHENIA GRAVIS Myasthenia gravis is the prototype autoimmune disease mediated by blocking antibodies. A patient with this diseaseproduces auto-antibodies that bind the acetylcholine recep-tors on the motor end-plates of muscles, blocking the normalbinding of acetylcholine and also inducing complement-mediated lysis of the cells. The result is a progressive weaken-ing of the skeletal muscles (Figure 20-5). Ultimately, the anti-bodies destroy the cells bearing the receptors. The early signsof this disease include drooping eyelids and inability toretract the corners of the mouth, which gives the appearanceof snarling. Without treatment, progressive weakening of theAutoimmunity CHAPTER 20 465 (a) (b) FIGURE 20-3 Photomicrographs of an islet of Langerhans (a) in pancreas from a normal mouse and (b) one in pancreas from a mousewith a disease resembling insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

However, with appropriate treat-ment, this disease can be managed quite well and afflictedindividuals can lead a normal life.Systemic Autoimmune Diseases In systemic autoimmune diseases, the response is directedtoward a broad range of target antigens and involves a num-ber of organs and tissues. These diseases reflect a general de-fect in immune regulation that results in hyperactive T cellsand B cells. Tissue damage is widespread, both from cell-mediated immune responses and from direct cellular dam-age caused by auto-antibodies or by accumulation of im-mune complexes. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Attacks Many Tissues One of the best examples of a systemic autoimmune disease is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which typically appears in women between 20 and 40 years of age; the ratio of femaleto male patients is 10:1. SLE is characterized by fever, weak-ness, arthritis, skin rashes, pleurisy, and kidney dysfunction(Figure 20-6). Lupus is more frequent in African-Americanand Hispanic women than in Caucasians, although it is notknown why this is so. Affected individuals may produce auto-antibodies to a vast array of tissue antigens, such as DNA, his-tones, RBCs, platelets, leukocytes, and clotting factors; inter-action of these auto-antibodies with their specific antigensproduces various symptoms. Auto-antibody specific for RBCsand platelets, for example, can lead to complement-mediatedlysis, resulting in hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia,respectively. When immune complexes of auto-antibodieswith various nuclear antigens are deposited along the walls of466 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease STIMULATING AUTO-ANTIBODIES (Graves' disease) Pituitary gland TSH cellAChR Auto-antibody to AChR Muscle activation Muscle activation inhibited FIGURE 20-4 In Graves' disease, binding of auto-antibodies to the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) induces unregu-lated activation of the thyroid, leading to overproduction of the thy-roid hormones (purple dots). FIGURE 20-5 In myasthenia gravis, binding of auto-antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor ( right) blocks the normal binding of acetyl- choline (burgandy dots) and subsequent muscle activation ( left). Inaddition, the anti-AChR auto-antibody activates complement, muscle end-plate; the number of acetylcholine receptorsdeclines as the disease progresses. AChR = acetylcholine receptor.small blood vessels, a type III hypersensitive reaction devel- ops. The complexes activate the complement system andgenerate membrane-attack complexes and complement splitproducts that damage the wall of the blood vessel, resultingin vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. Excessive complement activation in patients with severe SLE produces elevated serum levels of the complement splitproducts C3a and C5a, which may be three to four timeshigher than normal. C5a induces increased expression of thetype 3 complement receptor (CR3) on neutrophils, facilitat-ing neutrophil aggregation and attachment to the vascularendothelium. As neutrophils attach to small blood vessels, thenumber of circulating neutrophils declines (neutropenia) andvarious occlusions of the small blood vessels develop (vasculi-tis). These occlusions can lead to widespread tissue damage. Laboratory diagnosis of SLE focuses on the characteristic antinuclear antibodies, which are directed against double-stranded or single-stranded DNA, nucleoprotein, histones,and nucleolar RNA. SLE patients produces various characteris-tic nucleus-staining patterns. Multiple Sclerosis Attacks the Central Nervous System Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neuro- logic disability associated with disease in Western countries.The symptoms may be mild, such as numbness in the limbs,or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. Most people withMS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40. Individualswith this disease produce autoreactive T cells that participatein the formation of inflammatory lesions along the myelinsheath of nerve fibers. The cerebrospinal fluid of patientswith active MS contains activated T lymphocytes, which infiltrate the brain tissue and cause characteristic inflamma-tory lesions, destroying the myelin. Since myelin functions toinsulate the nerve fibers, a breakdown in the myelin sheathleads to numerous neurologic dysfunctions. Epidemiological studies indicate that MS is most com- mon in the Northern hemisphere and, interestingly, in theUnited States. Populations who live north of the 37th parallelhave a prevalence of 110-140 cases per 100,000, while thosewho live south of the 37th parallel show a prevalence of57-78 per 100,000. And individuals from south of the 37thparallel who move north assume a new risk if the moveoccurs before 15 years of age. These provocative data suggestthat there is an environmental component of the risk of con-tracting MS. This is not the entire story, however, sincegenetic influences also are important. While the average per-son in the United States has about one chance in 1000 ofdeveloping MS, close relatives of people with MS, such aschildren or siblings, have 1 chance in 50 to 100 of developingMS. The identical twin of a person with MS has a 1 in 3chance of developing the disease. These data point stronglyto the genetic component of the disease. And, as is describedin the Clinical Focus of this chapter, MS affects women twoto three times more frequently than men. The cause of MS, like most autoimmune diseases, is not well understood. However, there are some suggestions thatinfection by certain viruses may predispose a person to MS.Certainly some viruses can cause demyelinating diseases, andit is tempting to speculate that virus infection plays a signifi-cant role in MS, but at present there is no definitive dataimplicating a particular virus. Rheumatoid Arthritis Attacks Joints Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disorder, most often affecting women from 40 to 60 years old. Themajor symptom is chronic inflammation of the joints,although the hematologic, cardiovascular, and respiratorysystems are also frequently affected. Many individuals withrheumatoid arthritis produce a group of auto-antibodiescalled rheumatoid factors that are reactive with determi- nants Fc region of IgG. The classic rheumatoid factoris an IgM antibody with that reactivity. Such auto-antibodiesbind to normal circulating IgG, forming IgM-IgG complexesthat are deposited in the joints. These immune complexescan activate the complement cascade, resulting in a type IIIhypersensitive reaction, which leads to chronic inflammationof the joints. Animal Models for Autoimmune Diseases Animal models for autoimmune diseases have contributed valuable insights into the mechanism of autoimmunity, toAutoimmunity CHAPTER 20 467 FIGURE 20-6 Characteristic \"butterfly\" rash over the cheeks of a young girl with systemic lupus erythematosus. [From L. Steinman, 1993, Sci. Am. 269 (3):80. ]our understanding of autoimmunity in humans, and to potential treatments. Autoimmunity develops spontaneouslyin certain inbred strains of animals and can also be inducedby certain experimental manipulations (Table 20-2). Autoimmunity Can Develop Spontaneously in Animals A number of autoimmune diseases that develop sponta- neously in animals exhibit important clinical and pathologicsimilarities to certain autoimmune diseases in humans. Cer-tain inbred mouse strains have been particularly valuablemodels for illuminating the immunologic defects involved inthe development of autoimmunity. New Zealand Black (NZB) mice and F 1hybrids of NZB and New Zealand White (NZW) mice spontaneously developautoimmune diseases that closely resemble systemic lupus ery-thematosus. NZB mice spontaneously develop autoimmunehemolytic anemia between 2 and 4 months of age, at whichtime various auto-antibodies can be detected, including anti-bodies to erythrocytes, nuclear proteins, DNA, and T lym-phocytes. F 1hybrid animals develop glomerulonephritis from immune-complex deposits in the kidney and die prematurelyby 18 months. As in human SLE, the incidence of autoimmu-nity in the (NZB /H11003NZW)F 1hybrids is greater in females. An accelerated and severe form of systemic autoimmune disease resembling systemic lupus erythematosus develops ina mouse strain called MRL/ lpr/lpr. These mice are homozy- gous for a gene called lpr,which has been identified as a defective fas gene. The fas-gene product is a cell-surface pro- tein belonging to the TNF family of cysteine-rich membranereceptors (see Figure 12-6d). When the normal Fas proteininteracts with its ligand, it transduces a signal that leads toapoptotic death of the Fas-bearing cells. This mechanismmay operate in destruction of target cells by some CTLs (seeFigure 14-9). Fas is known also to be essential in the death ofhyperactivated peripheral CD4 +cells. Normally, when ma- ture peripheral T cells become activated, they are induced toexpress both Fas antigen and Fas ligand, When Fas-bearingcells come into contact with a neighboring activated cell bear-ing Fas ligand, the Fas-bearing cell is induced to die. It is alsopossible that Fas ligand can engage Fas from the same cell,inducing a cellular suicide. In the absence of Fas, matureperipheral T cells do not die, and these activated cells con-tinue to proliferate and produce cytokines that result ingrossly enlarged lymph nodes and spleen. Defects in fas ex- pression similar to that found in the lpr mouse are observed in humans, and these can have severe consequences. Howeverthere is no link between fas expression and SLE in humans, which suggests that the lprmouse may not be a true model for SLE. Another important animal model is the nonobese dia- betic (NOD) mouse, which spontaneously develops a formof diabetes that resembles human insulin-dependent dia-468 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 20-2 Experimental animal models of autoimmune diseases Disease Possible human transferred Animal model disease counterpart Inducing antigen by T cells SPONTANEOUS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Nonobese diabetic (NOD) Insulin-dependent diabetes Unknown Yes chicken Hashimoto's thyroiditis Thyroglobulin Yes EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES * Experimental autoimmune Myasthenia gravis Acetylcholine receptor Yes myasthenia gravis (EAMG) Experimental autoimmune Multiple sclerosis (MS) Myelin basic protein (MBP); Yes encephalomyelitis (EAE) proteolipid protien (PLP) Autoimmune arthritis (AA) Experimental autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis Thyroglobulin Yes thyroiditis (EAT) *These diseases can be induced by injecting appropriate animals with the indicated antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant. Except for autoimmune arthritis, the antigens used correspond to the self-antigens associated with the human-disease counterpart. Rheumatoid arthritis involves reaction to proteoglycans, which are self-antigens associated with connective tissue.betes mellitus (IDDM). Like the human disease, the NOD mouse disease begins with lymphocytic infiltration into theislets of the pancreas. Also, as in IDDM, there is a strong asso-ciation between certain MHC alleles and the development ofdiabetes in these mice. Experiments have shown that T cellsfrom diabetic mice can transfer diabetes to nondiabetic re-cipients. For example, when the immune system of normalmice is destroyed by lethal doses of x-rays and then is recon-stituted with an injection of bone-marrow cells from NODmice, the reconstituted mice develop diabetes. Conversely,when the immune system of still healthy NOD mice is de-stroyed by x-irradiation and then reconstituted with normalbone-marrow cells, the NOD mice do not develop diabetes.Various studies have demonstrated a pivotal role for CD4 + T cells in the NOD mouse, and recent evidence implicates theT H1 subset in disease development. Several other spontaneous autoimmune diseases have been discovered in animals that have served as models for similarhuman diseases. Among these are Obese- strain chickens, which develop both humoral and cell-mediated reactivity tothyroglobulin resembling that seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoimmunity Can Be Induced Experimentally in Animals Autoimmune dysfunctions similar to certain human autoim- mune diseases can be induced experimentally in some ani-mals (see Table 20-2). One of the first such animal modelswas discovered serendipitously in 1973 when rabbits wereimmunized with acetylcholine receptors purified from elec-tric eels. The animals soon developed muscular weaknesssimilar to that seen in myasthenia gravis. This experimentalautoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) was shown to resultwhen antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor blocked mus-cle stimulation by acetylcholine in the synapse. Within a year,this animal model had proved its value with the discoverythat auto-antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor were thecause of myasthenia gravis in humans. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is another animal model that has greatly improved under-standing of autoimmunity. This is one of the best-studiedmodels of autoimmune disease. EAE is mediated solely by T cells and can be induced in a variety of species by immu-nization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or proteolipidprotein (PLP) in complete Freund's adjuvant (Figure 20-7).Within 2-3 weeks the animals develop cellular infiltration ofthe myelin sheaths of the central nervous system, resulting in demyelination and paralysis. Most of the animals die, butothers have milder symptoms, and some animals develop achronic form of the disease that resembles chronic relapsingand remitting MS in humans. Those that recover are resistantto the development of disease from a subsequent injection ofMBP and adjuvant. The mouse EAE model provides a system for testing treatments for human MS. For example, because MBP- orPLP-specific T-cell clones are found in the periphery, it isassumed that these clones must have escaped negative selec- tion in the thymus. Recent mouse experiments have suggestedthat orally administered MBP may make these antigen-specificperipheral T-cell clones self-tolerant. These studies have pavedthe way for clinical trials in MS patients. Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) can be induced in a number of animals by immunizing with thy-roglobulin in complete Freund's adjuvant. Both humoral anti-bodies and T H1 cells directed against the thyroglobulin de- velop, resulting in thyroid inflammation. EAT appears to bestmimic Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In contrast to both EAE andEAT, which are induced by immunizing with self-antigens,autoimmune arthritis (AA) is induced by immunizing ratswith Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freund's adju- vant. These animals develop an arthritis whose features aresimilar to those of rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Evidence Implicating the CD 4+T Cell, MHC, and TCR in Autoimmunity The inappropriate response to self-antigens that character- izes all autoimmune diseases can involve either the humoralor cell-mediated branches of the immune system. Identifyingthe defects underlying human autoimmune diseases hasbeen difficult; more success has been achieved in characteriz-ing the immune defects in the various animal models. Eachof the animal models has implicated the CD4 +T cell as the primary mediator of autoimmune disease. For example, theevidence is quite strong that, in mice, EAE is caused by CD4 + TH1 cells specific for the immunizing antigen. The disease can be transferred from one animal into another by T cellsfrom animals immunized with either MBP or PLP or byAutoimmunity 20 469 Normal ratMBP + CFA Lymph-node cells+ MBP EAE rat (paralysis) Normal rat EAE rat (most die; some recover)MBP-specificT-cell clones FIGURE 20-7 Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) can be induced in rats by injecting them with myelin basic protein(MBP) in complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA). MBP-specific T-cellclones can be generated by culturing lymph-node cells from EAE ratswith MBP. When these T cells are injected into normal animals, mostdevelop EAE and die, although a few recover.cloned T-cell lines from such animals. It also has been shown that disease can be prevented by treating animals with anti-CD4 antibodies. These data are compelling evidence for theinvolvement of CD4 in the establishment of EAE. T-cell recognition of antigen, of course, involves a trimol- ecular complex of the T-cell receptor, an MHC molecule, andantigenic peptide (see Figure 9-16). Thus, an individual sus-ceptible to autoimmunity must possess MHC molecules andT-cell receptors capable of binding self-antigens. CD4+T Cells and T H1/TH2Balance Plays an Important Role in Autoimmunity in Some Animal Models Autoimmune T-cell clones have been obtained from all of the animal models listed in Table 20-2 by culturing lymphocytesfrom the autoimmune animals in the presence of various T-cell growth factors and by inducing proliferation of spe-cific autoimmune clones with the various autoantigens. Forexample, when lymph-node cells from EAE rats are culturedin vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP), clones of activatedT cells emerge. When sufficient numbers of these MBP-specific T-cell clones are injected intravenously into normalsyngeneic animals, the cells cross the blood-brain barrier andinduce demyelination; EAE develops very quickly, within 5 days (see Figure 20-7). A similar experimental protocol has been used to isolate T-cell clones specific for thyroglobulin and for M. tuberculosis from EAT and AA animals, respectively. In each case, the T-cellclone induces the experimental autoimmune disease in nor-mal animals. Examination of these T cells has revealed thatthey bear the CD4 membrane marker. In a number of animalmodels for autoimmune diseases it has been possible to reversethe autoimmunity by depleting the T-cell population example, abolished the autoimmunesymptoms in (NZB /H11003NZW) F 1mice and in mice with EAE. Most cases of organ-specific autoimmune disease develop as a consequence of self-reactive CD4+T cells.Analysis of these cells has revealed that the T H1/T H2 balance can affect whether autoimmunity develops. T H1 cells have been implicated in the development of autoimmunity, whereas, in a number of cases,T H2 cells not only protect against the induction of disease but also against progression of established disease. In EAE, forexample, immunohistologic studies revealed the and IFN- /H9253) in the central ner- vous system tissues at the height of the disease. In addition, theMBP-specific CD4 +T-cell clones generated from animals with EAE, as shown in Figure 20-7, can be separated into T H1 and TH2 clones. Experiments have shown that only the T H1 clones transfer EAE to normal healthy mice, whereas the T H2 clones not only do not transfer EAE to normal healthy mice but alsoprotect the mice against induction of EAE by subsequentimmunization with MBP plus adjuvant. Experiments that assessed the role of various cytokines or cytokine inhibitors on the development of EAE have providedfurther evidence for the different roles of T H1 and T H2 cells in autoimmunity. When mice were injected with IL-4 at the timeof immunization with MBP plus adjuvant, the development ofEAE was inhibited, whereas administration of IL-12 had theopposite effect, promoting the development of EAE. As notedin Chapter 12, IL-4 promotes development of T H2 cells and IFN- /H9253, in addition to other cytokines such as IL-12, promotes development of T H1 cells (see Figure 12-12). Thus, the ob- served effects of IL-4 and IL-12 on EAE development are con-sistent with a role for T H1 cells in the genesis of autoimmunity. Autoimmunity Can Be Associated with the MHC or with Particular T-Cell Receptors Several types of studies have supported an association be- tween expression of a particular MHC allele and susceptibil-ity to autoimmunity, an issue covered in detail in Chapter 7.The strongest association between an HLA allele and anautoimmune disease is seen in ankylosing spondylitis, aninflammatory disease of vertebral joints. Individuals whohave HLA-B27 have a 90 times greater likelihood of develop- ing ankylosing spondylitis than individuals with a differentHLA-B allele. However, the existence of such an association should not be interpreted to imply that the expression of aparticular MHC allele has caused the disease, because therelationship between MHC alleles and development of auto-immune disease is complex. It is interesting to note that,unlike many other autoimmune diseases, 90% of the cases ofankylosing spondylitis are male. The presence of T-cell receptors containing particular V /H9251 and V /H9252domains also has been linked to a number of auto- immune diseases, including experimental EAE and its humancounterpart, multiple sclerosis. In one approach, T cells spe-cific for various encephalitogenic peptides of MBP werecloned and their T-cell receptors analyzed. For example,T-cell clones were obtained from PL/J mice by culturing theirT cells with the acetylated amino-terminal nonapeptide ofMBP presented in association with a class II IA u MHC mole- cule. Analysis of the T-cell receptors on these clones revealed arestricted repertoire of V /H9251and V /H9252domains: 100% of the T-cell clones expressed V /H92514.3, and 80% of the T-cell clones expressed V /H92528.2. In human autoimmune diseases, evidence for restricted TCR expression has been obtained for both mul-tiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis. The preferential expres-sion of TCR variable-region genes in these autoimmune T-cellclones suggests that a single epitope might induce the clonalexpansion of a small number of pathogenic T cells. Proposed Mechanisms for Induction of Autoimmunity A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the T-cell-mediated generation of autoimmune diseases(Figure 20-8). Evidence exists for each of these mechanisms,470 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseaseand it is likely that autoimmunity does not develop from a single event but rather from a number of different events. In addition, susceptibility to many autoimmune diseases differs between the two sexes. As noted earlier, Hashimoto'sthyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis,rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma preferentially affectwomen. Factors that have been proposed to account for thispreferential susceptibility, such as hormonal differences be-tween the sexes and the potential effects of fetal cells in thematernal circulation during pregnancy, are discussed in theClinical Focus. Release of Sequestered Antigens Can Induce Autoimmune Disease As discussed in Chapter 10, the induction of self-tolerance in T cells results from exposure of immature thymocytes to self-antigens and the subsequent clonal deletion of those that areself-reactive. Any tissue antigens that are sequestered fromthe circulation, and are therefore not seen by the developingT cells in the thymus, will not induce self-tolerance. Exposure of mature T cells to such normally sequestered antigens at alater time might result in their activation. Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an example of an antigen normally sequestered from the immune system, in this case bythe blood-brain barrier. In the EAE model, animals are in-jected directly with MBP , together with adjuvant, under con-ditions that maximize immune exposure. In this type of ani-mal model, the immune system is exposed to sequestered self-antigens under nonphysiologic conditions; however, traumato tissues following either an accident or a viral or bacterialinfection might also release sequestered antigens into the cir-culation. A few tissue antigens are known to fall into this cate-gory. For example, sperm arise late in development and aresequestered from the circulation. However, after a vasectomy,some sperm antigens are released into the circulation and caninduce auto-antibody formation in some men. Similarly, therelease of lens protein after eye damage or of heart-muscleantigens after myocardial infarction has been shown to lead onoccasion to the formation of auto-antibodies.Autoimmunity CHAPTER 20 471 VISUALIZING CONCEPTS TH cell Tissue damageInflammation and local DTH Ab to self-antigensActivated macrophage Target tissueepithelium IFN- TH cell Activated TH cellTH TH cellHelp Plasma cell B Normal thymic selection appears to generatesome self-reactive T Hcells; abnormalities in this process may generate even more self-reactive T Hcells. Activation of these self- reactive T cells in various ways, as well as polyclonal activation ofB cells, is thought to induce an autoimmune response, in this case resulting in tissue damage. In all likelihood, several mecha-nisms are involved in each autoimmune disease. [Adapted from V. Kumar et al., 1989, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 7:657.]Data indicate that injection of normally sequestered anti- gens directly into the thymus can reverse the development oftissue-specific autoimmune disease in animal models. Forinstance, intrathymic injection of pancreatic islet beta cellsprevented development of autoimmunity in NOD mice.Moreover, EAE was prevented in susceptible rats by prior injection of MBP directly into the thymus. In these experi-ments, exposure of immature T cells to self-antigens thatnormally are not present in the thymus presumably led totolerance to these antigens.472 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease young females. Women tend to have higher levels of CD 4+T cells and signifi- cantly higher levels of serum IgM. In mice, whose gender differences are easier to study, there is a large body of lit-erature documenting gender differencesin immune responses. Female mice aremuch more likely than male mice to de-velop T H1responses and, in infections to which pro-inflammatory T H1responses are beneficial, are more likely to be re-sistant to the infection. An excellentexample is infection by viruses such asvesicular these viruses is enhanced byT H1responses. In some cases, however, a pro-inflammatory response can bedeleterious. For example, a T H1response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus(LCMV) correlates with more severe dis-ease and significant pathology. Thus,female mice are more likely to succumbto infection with LCMV. The fact that gen-der is important in LCMV infection isunderscored by experiments demonstrat-ing that castrated male mice behave likefemales and are more likely to succumbto infection than their un-castrated malelittermates. Another disease in which gender plays a role is infection by coxsackievirus Type B- 3(CVB- 3), an etiological agent of immune myocarditis. Malemice are much more susceptible to this disease than females. CVB- 3induces a predominant T H1response in males, while females, contrary to the situationsdescribed above, respond by mounting aprotective T H2response. The response by females can be altered by injectingthem with testosterone, which makesthem susceptible to the disease. Ad-ditionally, the male response can be al-tered by injecting them with estradiol,which makes them resistant to the virus.These data in mice are consistent withthe possibility that basic differences maywell exist between men and women intheir responses to pathogens. We muststress, however, that the particular gen-der differences observed in mice maynot extend to human populations. How do these gender differences arise? The evidence cited above thatestradiol or testosterone can alter theoutcome of infection by CVB- 3suggests a critical role for sex hormones. In hu-mans it appears that estrogen on its owndoes not play a significant role in the eti-ology of either RA or MS, but there areindications that it may be important inSLE. This is suggested by data indicat-ing that estrogen can stimulate auto-antibody production in SLE-prone miceand effects can be modulated byan anti-estrogenic compound. Such dataimply that, at least iscapable of triggering SLE-like autoimmu-nity. Additionally, androgens such astestosterone clearly play an importantrole in some autoimmune diseases. Female NOD mice are much more sus-ceptible to spontaneous diabetes, andcastration significantly increases thesusceptibility of male NOD mice. Fe-male SJL mice are more likely to be sus-ceptible to EAE, a mouse MS-like dis-ease. This indicates that testosteronemay well be effective in amelioratingsome autoimmune responses and so Of the nearly 9million individuals in the United States with autoimmune disease, approxi-mately 6.7million are women. This pre- disposition to autoimmunity is moreapparent in some diseases than others.For example, the female:male ratio ofindividuals who suffer from diseasessuch as multiple sclerosis (MS) orrheumatoid arthritis (RA) is approxi-mately two or three females to one male,and there are nine women for every onemale afflicted with systemic lupus ery-thematosus (SLE). However, these sta-tistics do not tell the entire story, since,in some diseases, MS for example, theseverity of the disease can be worse inmen than in women. The fact thatwomen are more susceptible to autoim-mune disease has been recognized forseveral years but the reasons for this in-creased risk are not entirely understood.Here some of the possible explanationsare considered. Although it may seem unlikely, con- siderable evidence suggests there aresignificant gender differences in im-mune responses in both humans andmice. Immunization studies in both spe-cies suggest that females produce ahigher titer of antibodies than males. Infact, females in general tend to mountmore vigorous immune responses. Inhumans, this is particularly apparent inCLINICAL FOCUS Why Are Women More Susceptible Than Men to Autoimmunity? Gender Differences in AutoimmuneDiseaseMolecular Mimicry May Contribute to Autoimmune Disease For several reasons, the notion that microbial or viral agents might play a role in autoimmunity is very attractive. It is wellaccepted that migrant human populations acquire the dis- eases of the area to which they move and that the incidence ofautoimmunity has increased dramatically as populationshave become more mobile. This, coupled with the fact that anumber of viruses and bacteria have been shown to possessAutoimmunity CHAPTER 20 473 can have a profound influence on im- mune responses, as demonstrated inmice by removal of the anterior pituitary:this results in a severe immunosuppres-sion, which can be entirely reversed bytreatment with exogenous prolactin. Thepresence of prolactin receptors on peri-pheral T and B cells in humans is furtherevidence that this hormone may play arole in regulating immune responses. Infact, some evidence suggests that pro-lactin may tend to turn cells towardsT H1-dominated immune responses. Pregnancy may give us a clue to how sex plays a role in regulating immuneresponse. It is clear that, while womennormally mount a normal response toforeign antigens, during pregnancy it iscritical that the mother tolerate the fetus(which is, in fact, a foreign graft). Thismakes it very likely that the femaleimmune system undergoes importantmodifications during pregnancy. Recallthat women normally tend to mountmore T H1-like responses than T H2re- sponses. During pregnancy, however, wo-men mount more T H2-like responses. It is thought that pregnancy-associated lev-els of sex steroids may promote an anti-inflammatory environment. In this re-gard, it is notable that diseases enhancedby T H2-like responses, such as SLE, which has a strong antibody-mediatedcomponent, can be exacerbated duringpregnancy, while diseases that involveinflammatory responses, such as RA andMS, sometimes are ameliorated in preg-nant women. Another effect of pregnancy is the presence of fetal cells in the maternal cir-culation (see the description of sclero-derma on page 000). It is known that fetal cells can persist in the maternal cir-culation for decades, so these long-livedfetal cells may play a significant role inthe development of autoimmune dis-ease. Furthermore, the exchange of cellsduring pregnancy is bi-directional (cells of the mother may also appear in thefetal circulatory system), and this has ledsome to postulate that the presence ofmother's cells in the male circulationcould be a contributing factor in autoim-mune disease. In summary, women and men differ significantly in their ability to mount animmune response. Women mount morerobust immune responses, and theseresponses tend to be more T H1-like. It has been reported that estrogen is im-munostimulatory; this may be due, inpart, to the ability of the hormone to reg-ulate specific gene expression throughthe estrogen receptor. Furthermore, theincidence of autoimmune diseases issharply higher in women than in men.These observations have generated thecompelling hypothesis that the tendencyof females to mount more T H1-like re- sponses may, in part, explain differencesin susceptibility to autoimmunity. Sincethis type of response is pro-inflammatory,it may enhance the development ofautoimmunity. Whether the bias towardsa T H1response is due to differences in sex steroids between males and femalesis less certain, but surely, in the next sev-eral years, experiments that explore thisidea are likely to be pursued vigorously. NOTE: The data discussed in this Clinical Focus were extracted from a let-ter to Science (C. C. Whitacre, S. C. Rein- gold, and P. A. O'Looney, 1999 , Science 283: 1277 ) from the Task Force on Gender, MS, and Autoimmunity, a groupconvened by the National Multiple Scle-rosis Society to begin a dialog on issuesof gender and autoimmune disease.Science also has established a Web site (http://www.sciencemag.org/ feature/ data/ 983519. shl) that contains more de- concerning autoimmunityand gender.may be protective against several auto- immune diseases, including MS, dia-betes, SLE, and Sjogren's syndrome. Why do sex steroids affect immune responses? This is not well understood,but it is likely that these hormones, whichcirculate throughout the body, alterimmune responses by altering patternsof gene expression. The sex steroids, ahighly lipophilic group of compounds,function by passing through the cellmembrane and binding a cytoplasmicreceptor. Each hormone has a cognatereceptor and binding of hormone to re-ceptor leads to the activation or, in someinstances, repression of gene expression.This is mediated by the binding of thereceptor/hormone complex receptor to a specific DNA sequence. Thus, estro-gen enters a cell, binds to the estrogenreceptor, and induces the binding of theestrogen receptor to a specific DNAsequence, which in turn results in themodulation of transcription. Therefore,in cells that contain hormone receptors,sex hormones can regulate gene expres-sion, and it is highly likely that sexsteroids play an important role in theimmune system through their receptors.Whether various cells of the immune sys-tem contain hormone receptors is notknown at present; to understand how sexhormones mediate immune responses,clearly we must determine which cellsexpress which hormone receptors. Hormonal effects on immune re- sponses may not be limited to steroidalsex hormones. Prolactin, a hormone thatis expressed in higher levels in womenthan in men, is not a member of thelipophilic sex steroid family that includesestrogen, progesterone, and testoster-one. But prolactin secretion (by the ante-rior pituitary) is stimulated by estrogen,thus explaining the higher levels of pro-lactin in women and the very high levelsobserved during pregnancy. Prolactin AU: supply 5e page ref (or delete this)antigenic determinants that are identical or similar to normal host-cell components led Michael Oldstone to propose that apathogen may express a region of protein that resembles aparticular self-component in conformation or primary se-quence. Such molecular mimicry appears in a wide variety oforganisms (Table 20-3). In one study, 600 different mono-clonal antibodies specific for 11 different viruses were testedto evaluate their reactivity with normal tissue antigens. Morethan 3% of the virus-specific antibodies tested also bound tonormal tissue, suggesting that molecular mimicry is a fairlycommon phenomenon. Molecular mimicry has been suggested as one mecha- nism that leads to autoimmunity. One of the best examples ofthis type of autoimmune reaction is post-rabies encephalitis,which used to develop in some individuals who had receivedthe rabies vaccine. In the past, the rabies virus was grown inrabbit brain-cell cultures, and preparations of the vaccineincluded antigens derived from the rabbit brain cells. In avaccinated person, these rabbit brain-cell antigens couldinduce formation of antibodies and activated T cells, whichcould cross-react with the recipient's own brain cells, leadingto encephalitis. Cross-reacting antibodies are also thought to be the cause of heart damage in rheumatic fever, which cansometimes develop after a Streptococcus infection. In this case, the antibodies are to streptococcal antigens, but theycross-react with the heart muscle. There Is Evidence for Mimicry Between MBP and Viral Peptides Since the encephalitogenic MBP peptides are known, the ex- tent to which they are mimicked by proteins from other organ-isms can be assessed. For example, one MBP peptide (aminoacid residues 61-69) is highly homologous with a peptide inthe P3 protein of the measles virus (see Table In onestudy, the sequence of another encephalitogenic MBP peptide(66-75) was compared with the known sequences of a largenumber of viral proteins. This computer analysis revealedsequence homologies between this MBP peptide and a num-ber of animal poly-oma, adenovirus, sarcoma, Abelson leukemia, polio-myelitis, Epstein-Barr, and hepatitis B viruses.474 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 20-3 Molecular mimicry between proteins of infectious organisms and human host proteins Protein * ResidueSequence Human cytomegalovirus IE 27 9 PDP LG R P DED HLA-DR molecule 60 VTE LG R P DAE Poliovirus VP 27 0 STT KESRG T T Acetylcholine receptor 176 TV I KESRG T K Papilloma virus E 27 6 SLH LESLKD S Insulin receptor 66 VYG LESLKD L Rabies virus glycoprotein 147 24 160 G VETTTPS Human IgG constant region 466 G VETTTPS Measles virus P 31 3 LEC IRA LK Corticotropin 18 LEC IRA CK Measles virus P 33 1 EI S DN LG Q E Myelin basic protein 61 EI S FK LG Q E *In each pair, the human protein is listed second.

Oldstone, 1987 , Cell 50:819.One peptide from the polymerase enzyme of the hepati- tis B virus was particularly striking, exhibiting 60% homol-ogy with a sequence in the encephalitogenic MBP peptide. T otest the hypothesis that molecular mimicry generateautoimmunity, rabbits were immunized with this hepatitis Bvirus peptide. The peptide was shown to induce both the for-mation of antibody and the proliferation of T cells that cross-reacted with MBP; in addition, central nervous system tissuefrom the immunized rabbits showed cellular infiltrationcharacteristic of EAE. These findings suggest that infection with certain viruses expressing epitopes that mimic sequestered self-components,such as myelin basic protein, may induce autoimmunity tothose components. Susceptibility to this type of autoimmunitymay also be influenced by the MHC haplotype of the individ-ual, since certain class I and class II MHC molecules may bemore effective than others in presenting the homologous pep-tide for T-cell activation. Another particularly compelling example of molecular mimicry comes from studies of herpes stromal keratinitis(HSK). In these studies, investigators showed that prior in-fection of mice with herpes simplex virus Type 1 leads adisease known as herpes stromal keratinitis (HSK), an auto-immune-like disease in which T cells specific for a particularviral peptide attack corneal tissue, thus causing blindness.These data demonstrated very clearly that a particular epi-tope of HSV-1 is responsible for the disease and that mutantstrains of HSV-1 that lack this epitope do not cause HSK. Thedata provide strong evidence for molecular mimicry in thedevelopment of a particular autoimmune disease. Inappropriate Expression of Class II MHC Molecules Can Sensitize Autoreactive T Cells The pancreatic beta cells of individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) express high levels of both class Iand class II MHC molecules, whereas healthy beta cells ex-press lower levels of class I and do not express class II at all.Similarly, thyroid acinar cells from those with Graves' diseasehave been shown to express class II MHC molecules on theirmembranes. This inappropriate expression of class II MHCmolecules, which are normally expressed only on antigen-presenting cells, may serve to sensitize T Hcells to peptides derived from the beta cells or thyroid cells, allowing activa-tion of B cells or T Ccells or sensitization of T H1 cells against self-antigens. Other evidence suggests that certain agents can induce some cells that should not express class II MHC molecules toexpress them. For example, the T-cell mitogen phytohemag-glutinin (PHA) has been shown to induce thyroid cells toexpress class II molecules. In vitro studies reveal that IFN- /H9253 also induces increases in class II MHC molecules on a widevariety of cells, including pancreatic beta cells, intestinalepithelial cells, melanoma cells, and thyroid acinar cells. Itwas hypothesized that trauma or viral infection in an organmay induce a localized inflammatory response and thus in- creased concentrations of IFN- /H9253in the affected organ. If IFN- /H9253induces class II MHC expression on non-antigen-presenting cells, inappropriate T H-cell activation might follow, with autoimmune consequences. It is noteworthy that SLE pa-tients with active disease have higher serum titers of IFN- /H9253 than patients with inactive disease. These data suggested thatthe increase in IFN- /H9253in these patients may lead to inappro- priate expression of class II MHC molecules and thus to T-cell activation against a variety of autoantigens. An interesting transgenic mouse system implicates IFN- /H9253 and inappropriate class II MHC expression in autoim-munity. In this system, an IFN- /H9253transgene was genetically engineered with the insulin promoter, so that the transgenicmice secreted IFN- /H9253from their pancreatic IFN- /H9253up-regulates class II MHC expression, these transgenic mice also expressed class II MHC moleculeson their pancreatic beta cells. The mice developed diabetes,which was associated with cellular infiltration of lympho-cytes and inflammatory cells like the infiltration seen in auto-immune NOD mice and in patients with insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus (Figure 20-9b). Although inappropriate class II MHC expression on pan- creatic beta cells may be involved in the autoimmune reactionin these transgenic mice, other factors also may play a role. Forexample, IFN- /H9253is known to induce production of several other cytokines, including IL-1 and TNF. Therefore, the devel-opment of autoimmunity in this transgenic system may in-volve antigen presentation by class II MHC molecules on pan-creatic beta cells together with a co-stimulatory signal, such asIL-1, that may activate self-reactive T cells. There is also someevidence to suggest that IL-1, IFN- /H9253, and TNF may directly impair the secretory function of human beta cells. Polyclonal B-Cell Activation Can Lead to Autoimmune Disease A number of viruses and bacteria can induce nonspecific poly- clonal B-cell activation. Gram-negative bacteria, cytomega-lovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are all known to be suchpolyclonal activators, inducing the proliferation of numer-ous clones of B cells that express IgM in the absence ofT Hcells. If B cells reactive to self-antigens are activated by this mechanism, auto-antibodies can appear. For instance,during infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by EBV ,a variety of auto-antibodies are produced, including auto-antibodies reactive to T and B cells, rheumatoid factors, andantinuclear antibodies. Similarly, lymphocytes from patientswith SLE produce large quantities of IgM in culture, suggest-ing that they have been polyclonally activated. Many AIDSpatients also show high levels of nonspecific antibody andauto-antibodies to RBCs and platelets. These patients areoften coinfected with other viruses such as EBV and cyto-megalovirus, which may induce the polyclonal B-cell activa-tion that results in auto-antibody production.Autoimmunity CHAPTER 20 475Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases Ideally, treatment for autoimmune diseases should be aimed at reducing only the autoimmune response while leaving therest of the immune system intact. T o date, this ideal has notbeen reached. Current therapies for autoimmune diseases are not cures but merely palliatives, aimed at reducing symptoms to providethe patient with an acceptable quality of life. For the mostpart, these treatments provide nonspecific suppression of theimmune system and thus do not distinguish between a patho-logic autoimmune response and a protective immune re-sponse. Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, aza-thioprine, and cyclophosphamide) are often given with theintent of slowing proliferation of lymphocytes. By depressingthe immune response in general, such drugs can reduce theseverity of autoimmune symptoms. The general reduction inimmune responsiveness, however, puts the patient at greaterrisk for infection or the development of cancer. A somewhatmore selective approach employs cyclosporin A or FK506 to treat autoimmunity. These agents block signal transduc-tion mediated by the T-cell receptor; thus, they inhibit onlyantigen-activated T cells while sparing nonactivated ones. Another therapeutic approach that has produced positive results in some cases of myasthenia gravis is removal of thethymus. Because patients with this disease often have thymic abnormalities (e.g., thymic hyperplasia or thymomas), adultthymectomy often increases the likelihood of remission ofsymptoms. Patients with Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis,rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus may experience short-term benefit from plasmapheresis. Inthis process, plasma is removed from a patient's blood bycontinuous-flow centrifugation. The blood cells are then re-suspended in a suitable medium and returned to the patient.Plasmapheresis has been beneficial to patients with autoim-mune diseases involving antigen-antibody complexes, whichare removed with the plasma. Removal of the complexes,although only temporary, can result in a short-term reductionin symptoms. On the positive side, studies with experimental autoim- mune animal models have provided evidence that it is indeedpossible to induce specific immunity to the development ofautoimmunity. Several of these approaches are describedbelow and outlined in Figure 20-10. T-Cell Vaccination Is a Possible Therapy The basis for T-cell vaccination as a therapy for some auto-immune diseases came from experiments with the EAE ani-mal model. When rats were injected with low doses (<10 -4) of cloned T cells specific for MBP , they did not develop 476 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease 3' 5' PI/IFN- transgene Pancreas IFN- Cellular geneInsulin gene promoterInsulin gene 5'Insulin genepromoter(PI)Insulin gene terminator region Insulin structural geneInsulin structural gene Poly A FIGURE 20-9 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in transgenic mice.

Instead they became resistant to the development of EAE when later challenged with a lethal doseof activated MBP-specific T cells or MBP in adjuvant. Laterfindings revealed that the efficacy of these autoimmune T-cell clones as a vaccine could be enhanced by crosslinkingthe cell-membrane components with formaldehyde or glu-taraldehyde. When crosslinked T cells were injected into ani-mals with active EAE, permanent remission of symptoms wasobserved. The crosslinked T cells apparently elicit regulatory T cells specific for TCR variable-region determinants of theautoimmune clones. Presumably these regulatory T cells act tosuppress the autoimmune T cells that mediate EAE. Peptide Blockade of MHC Molecules Can Modulate Autoimmune Responses Identification and sequencing of various autoantigens has led to the development of new approaches to modulate auto-immune T-cell activity. In EAE, for example, the encephalito-genic peptides of MBP have been well characterized. Syn-thetic peptides differing by only one amino acid from theirMBP counterpart have been shown to bind to the appropri-ate MHC molecule. Moreover, when sufficient amounts ofsuch a peptide were administered along with the correspond-ing encephalitogenic MBP peptide, the clinical developmentof EAE was blocked. Presumably, the synthetic peptide acts asa competitor, occupying the antigen-binding cleft on MHC molecules and thus preventing binding of the MBP peptide. In other studies, blocking peptides complexed to soluble class II MHC molecules reversed the clinical progression ofEAE in mice, presumably by inducing a state of clonal anergyin the autoimmune T cells. Monoclonal Antibodies May Be Used to Treat Autoimmunity Monoclonal antibodies have been used successfully to treat autoimmune disease in several animal models. For example,a high percentage of (NZB /H11003NZW) F 1mice given weekly injections of high doses of monoclonal antibody specific forthe CD4 membrane molecule recovered from their autoim-mune lupus-like symptoms (Figure 20-11). Similar positiveresults were observed in NOD mice, in which treatment withan anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody led to disappearance ofthe lymphocytic infiltration and diabetic symptoms. Because anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies block or deplete all T H cells, regardless of their specificity, they can threaten the overall immune responsiveness of the recipient.One remedy for this disadvantage is to try to block antigen-activated T Hcells only, since these cells are involved in the autoimmune state. T o do this, researchers have used mono-clonal antibody directed against the /H9251subunit of the high- affinity IL-2 receptor, which is expressed only by antigen-activated T Hcells. Because the IL-2R /H9251subunit is expressed at higher levels on autoimmune T cells, monoclonal anti-body to the /H9251subunit (anti-TAC) might preferentially block autoreactive T cells. This approach was tested in adult ratsinjected with activated MBP-specific T cells in the presenceor absence of anti-TAC. All the control rats died of EAE,whereas six of the nine treated with anti-TAC had no symp-toms, and the symptoms in the other three were mild.Autoimmunity CHAPTER 20 477 IL-2RIL-2 agents tion in autoimmune %60Treatment started Anti-CD4 Saline control Age, months80100 6789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 8 FIGURE 20-11 Weekly injections of anti-CD 4monoclonal anti- body into (NZB /H11003NZW) F 1mice exhibiting autoimmune lupus-like symptoms significantly increased their survival rate. [Adapted from D. Wofsy, 1988, Prog. Allergy 45:106.]The association of autoimmune disease with restricted TCR expression in a number of animal models has promptedresearchers to see if blockage of the preferred receptors withmonoclonal antibody might be therapeutic. Injection of PL/Jmice with monoclonal antibody specific for the V /H92528.2 T-cell receptor prevented induction of EAE by MBP in adjuvant.Even more promising was the finding that the V /H92528.2 mono- clonal antibody could also reverse the symptoms of auto-immunity in mice manifesting induced EAE (Figure 20-12)and that these mice manifested long-term remission. Clearly,the use of monoclonal antibodies as a treatment for humanautoimmune diseases presents exciting possibilities. Similarly, the association of various MHC alleles with auto- immunity (see Table 7-4), as well as the evidence for increasedor inappropriate MHC expression in some autoimmune dis-ease, offers the possibility that monoclonal antibodies againstappropriate MHC molecules might retard development ofautoimmunity. Moreover, since antigen-presenting cells ex-press many different class II MHC molecules, it should theo-retically be possible to selectively block an MHC molecule thatis associated with autoimmunity while sparing the others. Inone study, injecting mice with monoclonal antibodies to classII MHC molecules before injecting MBP blocked the develop-ment of EAE. If, instead, the antibody was given after the injec-tion of MBP , development of EAE was delayed but not pre-vented. In nonhuman primates, monoclonal antibodies toHLA-DR and HLA-DQ have been shown to reverse EAE. Oral Antigens Can Induce Tolerance When antigens are administered orally, they tend to inducethe state of immunologic unresponsiveness called tolerance.For example, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, mice fed MBP do not develop EAE after subsequent injection of MBP .This finding led to a double-blind pilot trial in which 30 indi-viduals with multiple sclerosis were fed either a placebo or300 mg of bovine myelin every day for a year. The results ofthis study revealed that T cells specific for MBP were reducedin the myelin-fed group; there also was some suggestion thatMS symptoms were reduced in the male recipients (althoughthe reduction fell short of statistical significance) but not inthe female recipients. While the results of oral toleranceinduction in mice were promising, the data from humans donot appear to be as beneficial. However, the human clinicaltrials are in the early stages, and it may be that the peptidesused so far were not the most effective, or perhaps the doseswere not correct. Because of the promise of this approach asshown in animal studies, it is likely that more clinical trialswill be conducted over the next few years. SUMMARY IHuman autoimmune diseases can be divided into organ-specific and systemic diseases. The organ-specific diseasesinvolve an autoimmune response directed primarily againsta single organ or gland. The systemic diseases are directedagainst a broad spectrum of tissues and have manifestationsin a variety of organs resulting from cell-mediated responsesand cellular damage caused by auto-antibodies or immunecomplexes. IThere are both spontaneous and experimental animal mod-els for autoimmune diseases. Spontaneous autoimmune di-seases resembling systemic lupus erythematosus occur 1mice MRL/ lpr/lpr mice, which have a defective fasgene. Several experimental animal models have been developed by immunizing animals withself-antigens in the presence of adjuvant. IStudies with experimental autoimmune animal modelshave revealed a central role for CD4 +THcells in the devel- opment of autoimmunity. In each of the experimentallyinduced autoimmune diseases, autoimmune T-cell clonescan be isolated that induce the autoimmune disease in nor-mal animals. The relative number of T H1 and T H2 cells appears to play a pivotal role in determining whether auto-immunity develops: T H1 cells promote the development of autoimmunity, whereas T H2 cells appear to block develop- ment of autoimmune disease and also block the progres-sion of the disease once it is established. The MHC haplo-type of the experimental animal determines the ability topresent various autoantigens to T Hcells. IA variety of mechanisms have been proposed for inductionof autoimmunity, including release of sequestered antigens,molecular mimicry, inappropriate class II MHC expressionon cells cases stimulated by IFN- /H9253, and polyclonal B-cell activation. Evidence exists for each of these mecha-478 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseEAE severity3 210 01 0 20 30 40Anti-V 8.2Control Time after antibody injection, days FIGURE 20-12 Injection of monoclonal antibody to the V /H92528.2 T-cell receptor into PL/J mice exhibiting EAE symptoms producednearly complete remission of symptoms.

ICurrent therapies for autoimmune diseases include treat-ment with immunosuppressive drugs, thymectomy, andplasmapheresis for diseases involving immune complexes.Other therapies include vaccination with T cells specificfor a given autoantigen, administration of synthetic block-ing peptides that compete with autoantigen for binding toMHC molecules, treatment with monoclonal antibodiesthat react with some component specifically involved in anautoimmune reaction, and induction of tolerance toautoantigens by administering them orally.

The desire to accomplish transplants stems from the realizationthat many diseases can be cured by implantation of a healthyorgan, tissue, or cells (a graft) from one individual (thedonor) to another in need of the transplant (the recipient orhost). The development of surgical techniques that allow thefacile reimplantation of organs has removed one barrier tosuccessful transplantation, but others remain. One is the lackof organs for transplantation. Although a supply of organs isprovided by accident victims and, in some cases, livingdonors, there are more patients in need of transplants thanthere are organs available. The seriousness of the donor-organ shortage is reflected in the fact that, as of November2000, an estimated 73,000 patients in the United States wereon the waiting list for an organ transplantation. The major-ity of those on the list (~70%) require a kidney; at present,the waiting period for this organ averages over 800 days.While the lack of organs for transplantation is a serious is-sue, the most formidable barrier to making transplantationa routine medical treatment is the immune system. Theimmune system has evolved elaborate and effective mecha-nisms to protect the organism from attack by foreign agents,and these same mechanisms cause rejection of grafts fromanyone who is not genetically identical to the recipient. Alexis Carrel reported the first systematic study of trans- plantation in 1908; he interchanged both kidneys in a seriesof nine cats. Some of those receiving kidneys from other catsmaintained urinary output for up to 25 days. Although allthe cats eventually died, the experiment established that atransplanted organ could carry out its normal function inthe recipient. The first human kidney transplant, attemptedin 1935 by a Russian surgeon, failed because there was a mis-match of blood types between donor and recipient. Thisincompatibility caused almost immediate rejection of thekidney, and the patient died without establishing renal func-tion. The rapid immune response experienced here, termedhyperacute rejection, is mediated by antibodies and will bedescribed in this chapter. The first successful human kidneytransplant, which was between identical twins, was accom-plished in Boston in 1954. T oday, kidney, pancreas, heart,lung, liver, bone-marrow, and cornea transplantations areperformed among nonidentical individuals with ever-increasing frequency and success.A variety of immunosuppressive agents can aid in the survival of the transplants, including drugs and specific anti-bodies developed to diminish the immunologic attack ongrafts, but the majority of these agents have an overallimmunosuppressive effect, and their long-term use is delete-rious. New methods of inducing specific tolerance to thegraft without suppressing other immune responses are beingdeveloped and promise longer survival of transplants with-out compromise of host immunity. This chapter describesthe mechanisms underlying graft rejection, various proce-dures that are used to prolong graft survival, and a summaryof the current status of transplantation as a clinical tool. AClinical Focus section examines the use of organs from non-human species (xenotransplants) to circumvent the shortageof organs available for patients in need of them. chapter 21Immunologic Basis of Graft Rejection The degree of immune response to a graft varies with the type of graft. The following terms are used to denote differ-ent types of transplants: IAutograft is self-tissue transferred from one body site to another in the same individual. Transferring healthy skinto a burned area in burn patients and use of healthyblood vessels to replace blocked coronary arteries areexamples of frequently used autografts. IIsograft is tissue transferred between genetically identical individuals. In inbred strains of mice, an isograft can beperformed from one mouse to another syngeneic mouse.In humans, an isograft can be performed betweengenetically identical (monozygotic) twins. IAllograft is tissue transferred between genetically different members of the same species. In mice, anallograft is performed by transferring tissue or an organfrom one strain to another. In humans, organ grafts fromone individual to another are allografts unless the donorand recipient are identical twins. IXenograft is tissue transferred between different species (e.g., the graft of a baboon heart into a human). Becauseof significant shortages in donated organs, raisinganimals for the specific purpose of serving as organdonors for humans is under serious consideration. Autografts and isografts are usually accepted, owing to the genetic identity between graft and host (Figure 21-1a). Be-cause an allograft is genetically dissimilar to the host, it is often recognized as foreign by the immune system and is re-jected. Obviously, xenografts exhibit the greatest genetic dis-parity and therefore engender a vigorous graft rejection. Allograft Rejection Displays Specificity and Memory The rate of allograft rejection varies according to the tissue involved. In general, skin grafts are rejected faster than othertissues such as kidney or heart. Despite these time differ-ences, the immune response culminating in graft rejectionalways displays the attributes of specificity and memory. If aninbred mouse of strain A is grafted with skin from strain B,primary graft rejection, known as first-set rejection, occurs(Figure 21-1b). The skin first becomes revascularized betweendays 3 and 7; as the reaction develops, the vascularized trans-plant becomes infiltrated with lymphocytes, monocytes, neu-trophils, and other inflammatory cells. There is decreased vas-cularization of the transplanted tissue by 7-10 days, visiblenecrosis by 10 days, and complete rejection by 12-14 days. Immunologic memory is demonstrated when a second strain-B graft is transferred to a previously grafted strain-Amouse. In this case, a graft-rejection reaction develops more quickly, with complete rejection occurring within 5-6 days;this secondary response is designated second-set rejection(Figure 21-1c). The specificity of second-set rejection can bedemonstrated by grafting an unrelated strain-C graft at thesame time as the second strain-B graft. Rejection of thestrain-C graft proceeds according to first-set rejection kinet-ics, whereas the strain-B graft is rejected in an acceleratedsecond-set fashion. T Cells Play a Key Role in Allograft Rejection In the early 1950s, Avrion Mitchison showed in adoptive-transfer experiments that lymphocytes, but not serum anti-body, could transfer allograft immunity. Later studies im-plicated T cells in allograft rejection. For example, nude mice, which lack a thymus and consequently lack functionalT cells, were found to be incapable of allograft rejection;indeed, these mice even accept xenografts. In other studies,T cells derived from an allograft-primed mouse were shownto transfer second-set allograft rejection to an unprimed syngeneic recipient, as long as that recipient was grafted withthe same allogeneic tissue (Figure 21-2). Analysis of the T-cell subpopulations involved in allograft rejection has implicated both CD4 +and CD8+populations. In one study, mice were injected with monoclonal antibodiesto deplete one or both types of T cells and then the rate ofgraft rejection was measured. As shown in Figure 21-3, re-moval of the CD8 +population alone had no effect on graft survival, and the graft was rejected at the same rate as in con-trol mice (15 days). Removal of the CD4 +T-cell population alone prolonged graft survival from 15 days to 30 days. How-ever, removal of both the CD4 +and the CD8+T cells resulted in long-term survival (up to 60 days) of the allografts. Thisstudy indicated that both CD4 +and CD8+T-cells partici- pated in rejection and that the collaboration of both subpop-ulations resulted in more pronounced graft rejection. Similar Antigenic Profiles Foster Allograft Acceptance Tissues that are antigenically similar are said to be histocom- patible; such tissues do not induce an immunologic response that leads to tissue rejection. Tissues that display significantantigenic differences are histoincompatible and induce an immune response that leads to tissue rejection. The variousantigens that determine histocompatibility are encoded bymore than 40 different loci, but the loci responsible for themost vigorous allograft-rejection reactions are located with-in the major histocompatibility (MHC). The orga- nization of the MHC\u2014called the H-2 complex in mice andthe HLA complex in humans\u2014was described in Chapter 7(see Figure 7-1). Because the MHC loci are closely linked,they are usually inherited as a complete set, called a haplo- type, from each parent.482 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseWithin an inbred strain of mice, all animals are homozy- gous at each MHC locus. When mice from two different in-bred strains, with haplotypes b and k,for example, are mated, all the F 1progeny inherit one haplotype from each parent (see Figure 7-2a). These F 1offspring have the MHC type b/k andcan accept grafts from either parent. Neither of the parental strains, however, can accept grafts from the F 1offspring be- cause each parent lacks one of the F 1haplotypes. MHC inher- itance in outbred populations is more complex, degree of polymorphism exhibited at each MHC locusTransplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 483 VISUALIZING CONCEPTS (a) Autograft acceptance Grafted epidermis Blood vessels Days 3-7: Revascularization(b) Days 12-14: FIGURE of the process of graft ac- ceptance and rejection.

(c) Second-set rejection of an allograft begins within 3-4days, with full rejection by 5-6days. The cellular infiltrate that invades an allograft (b, c) contains lymphocytes, phagocytes, andother inflammatory cells.gives a probability of heterozygosity at most loci. In mat- ings between members of an outbred species, there is only a25% chance that any two offspring will inherit identical MHChaplotypes (see Figure 7-2c), unless the parents share one ormore haplotypes. Therefore, for purposes of organ or bone-marrow grafts, it can be assumed that there is a 25% chance ofidentity within the MHC between siblings. With parent-to-child grafts, the donor and recipient will always have one hap-lotype in common but are nearly always mismatched for thehaplotype inherited from the other parent.Graft Donors and Recipients Are Typed for RBC and MHC Antigens Since differences in blood group and major histocompatibility antigens are responsible for the most intense graft-rejectionreactions, various tissue-typing procedures to identify theseantigens have been developed to screen potential donor andrecipient cells. Initially, donor and recipient are screened forABO blood-group compatibility. The blood-group antigensare expressed on RBCs, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells.Antibodies produced in the recipient to any of these antigensthat are present on transplanted tissue will induce antibody-mediated complement lysis of the incompatible donor cells. HLA typing of potential donors and a recipient can be accomplished with a microcytotoxicity test (Figure 21-4a, b).In this test, white blood cells from the potential donors andrecipient are distributed into a series of wells on a microtiterplate, and then antibodies specific for various class I and classII MHC alleles are added to different wells. After incubation,complement is added to the wells, and cytotoxicity is assessedby the uptake or exclusion of various dyes (e.g., trypan blueor eosin Y) by the cells. If the white blood cells express theMHC allele for which a particular monoclonal antibody isspecific, then the cells will be lysed upon addition of comple-ment, and these dead cells will take up a dye such as trypanblue. HLA typing based on antibody-mediated microcyto-toxicity can thus indicate the presence or absence of variousMHC alleles. Even when a fully HLA-compatible donor is not available, transplantation may be successful. In this situation, a one-waymixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR) can be used to quantifythe degree of class II MHC compatibility between potential484 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease First skin graft, strain ASecond skin graft, strain A Naive strain = B mouseFirst-set rejection Second-set rejection 14 days Time 6 days Naive strain = B mouseNecrosis First skin graft, strain ANecrosis Second-set rejection 6 daysNecrosisSpleenic T cells FIGURE 21-2 Experimental demonstration that T cells can trans- fer allograft rejection.

(c) Mixed lymphocyte reaction to determine identity of classII HLA antigens between a potential donor and recipient. Lympho-cytes from the donor are irradiated or treated with mitomycin C toprevent cell division and then added to cells from the recipient. If theclass II antigens on the two cell populations are different, the recipi-ent cells will divide rapidly and take up large quantities of radioactivenucleotides into the newly synthesized nuclear DNA. The amount ofradioactive nucleotide uptake is roughly proportionate to the MHCclass II differences between the donor and recipient lymphocytes.donors and a recipient (Figure 21-4c). Lymphocytes from a potential donor that have been x-irradiated or treated withmitomycin C serve as the stimulator cells, and lymphocytesfrom the recipient serve as responder cells. Proliferation ofthe recipient T cells, which indicates T-cell activation, is mea-sured by the uptake of [ 3H]thymidine into cell DNA. The greater the class II MHC differences between the donor andrecipient cells, the more [ 3H]thymidine uptake will be ob- served in an MLR assay. Intense proliferation of the recipientlymphocytes indicates a poor prognosis for graft survival.The advantage of the MLR over microcytotoxicity typing isthat it gives a better indication of the degree of T H-cell acti- vation generated in response to the class II MHC antigens ofthe potential graft. The disadvantage of the MLR is that ittakes several days to run the assay. If the potential donor is acadaver, for example, it is not possible to wait for the resultsof the MLR, because the organ must be used soon after re-moval from the cadaver. In that case, the microcytotoxicitytest, which can be performed within a few hours, must berelied on. The importance of MHC matching for acceptance of allo- grafts is confirmed by data gathered from recipients of kid-ney transplants. The data in Figure 21-5 reveal that survivalof kidney grafts depends primarily on donor-recipient match-ing of the HLA class II antigens. Matching or mismatching ofthe class I antigens has a lesser effect on graft survival unlessthere also is mismatching of the class II antigens. A two-yearsurvival rate of 90% is seen for kidney transplants in whichone or two class I HLA loci are mismatched, while trans-planted kidneys with differences in the class II MHC haveonly a 70% chance of lasting for this period. Those withgreater numbers of mismatches have a very low survival rateat one year after transplant. As described below, HLA match-ing is most important for kidney and bone-marrow trans-plants; liver and heart transplants may survive with greatermismatching. Current understanding of the killer-inhibitory receptors (KIR) on the NK cell (see Chapter 14) suggests that absenceof a class I antigen recognized by the KIR molecules couldlead to killing of the foreign cell. Rejection was observed inexperimental bone-marrow transplants where the class Imolecule recognized by the recipient NK-inhibitory receptoris absent on donor cells. The effects of such class I mismatch-ing on solid organ grafts may be less marked. MHC identity of donor and host is not the sole factor determining tissue acceptance. When tissue is transplantedbetween genetically different individuals, even if their MHCantigens are identical, the transplanted tissue can be rejectedbecause of differences at various minor histocompatibility loci. As described in Chapter 10, the major histocompatibility antigens are recognized directly by T Hand T C cells, a phe- nomenon termed alloreactivity . In contrast, minor histocom- patibility antigens are recognized only when they are pre-sented in the context of self-MHC molecules. The tissuerejection induced by minor histocompatibility differences is usually less vigorous than that induced by major histo- compatibility differences. Still, reaction to these minor tissuedifferences often results in graft rejection. For this reason,successful transplantation even between HLA-identical indi-viduals requires some degree of immune suppression. Cell-Mediated Graft Rejection Occurs in Two Stages Graft rejection is caused principally by a cell-mediated im- mune response to alloantigens (primarily, MHC molecules)expressed the graft. Both delayed-type hypersensi-tive and cell-mediated cytotoxicity reactions have been im-plicated. The process of graft rejection can be divided into twostages: (1) a sensitization phase, in which antigen-reactivelymphocytes of the recipient proliferate in response to allo-486 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Cumulative graft survival, % Time after transplantation, months50100 24 12 6 306531 42 HLA mismatches (no.)

A singleclass II difference (line 4) has the same effect as 3or 4differences in class I antigens (line 3). When both class I and class II antigens are mismatched, rejection is accelerated.

Both major and minor histo-compatibility alloantigens can be recognized. In general, theresponse to minor histocompatibility antigens is weak, al-though the combined response to several minor differencescan sometimes be quite vigorous. The response to major histo-compatibility antigens involves recognition of both the donorMHC molecule and an associated peptide ligand in the cleft ofthe MHC molecule. The peptides present in the groove ofallogeneic class I MHC molecules are derived from proteinssynthesized within the allogeneic cell. The peptides presentin the groove of allogeneic class II MHC molecules are gener-ally proteins taken up and processed through the endocyticpathway of the allogeneic antigen-presenting cell. A host T Hcell becomes activated when it interacts with an antigen-presenting cell (APC) that both expresses an appro-priate antigenic ligand-MHC molecule complex and pro-vides the requisite co-stimulatory signal. Depending on thetissue, different populations of cells within a graft may func-tion as APCs. Because dendritic cells are found in most tis-sues and because they constitutively express high levels ofclass II MHC molecules, dendritic cells generally serve as themajor APC in grafts. APCs of host origin can also migrateinto a graft and endocytose the foreign alloantigens (bothmajor and minor histocompatibility molecules) and presentthem as processed peptides together with self-MHC mole-cules. In some organ and tissue grafts (e.g., grafts of kidney, thy- mus, and pancreatic islets), a population of donor APCscalled passenger leukocytes has been shown to migrate from the graft to the regional lymph nodes. These passenger leuko-cytes are dendritic cells, which express high levels of class IIMHC molecules (together with normal levels of class I MHCmolecules) and are widespread in mammalian tissues, withthe chief exception of the brain. Because passenger leuko-cytes express the allogeneic MHC antigens of the donor graft,they are recognized as foreign and therefore can stimulateimmune activation of T lymphocytes in the lymph node. Insome experimental situations, the passenger cells have beenshown to induce tolerance to their surface antigens by dele-tion of thymic T-cell populations with receptors specific forthem. Consistent with the notion that exposure to donorcells can induce tolerance are data showing that blood tran-fusions from the donor prior to transplantation can aid ac-ceptance of the graft. Passenger leukocytes are not the only cells involved in im- mune stimulation. For example, they do not seem to play anyrole in skin grafts. Other cell types that have been implicatedin alloantigen presentation to the immune system includeLangerhans cells and endothelial cells lining the blood ves- sels. Both of these cell types express class I and class II MHCantigens. Recognition of the alloantigens expressed on the cells of a graft induces vigorous T-cell proliferation in the host.This proliferation can be demonstrated in vitro in a mixed-lymphocyte reaction (see Figure 21-4c). Both dendritic from an allogeneic proliferation. The major proliferating cell is theCD4 +T cell, which recognizes class II alloantigens directly or alloantigen peptides presented by host antigen-presentingcells. This amplified population of activated T Hcells is thought to play a central role in inducing the various effectormechanisms of allograft rejection. EFFECTOR STAGE A variety of effector mechanisms participate in allograft re-jection (Figure 21-6). The are cell-mediatedreactions involving and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity; less destruction antibody-dependentcell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The hallmark of graftrejection involving cell-mediated reactions is an influx ofT cells and macrophages into the graft. Histologically, the in-filtration in many cases resembles that seen during a delayed-type hypersensitive response, in which cytokines producedby T DTH cells promote macrophage infiltration (see Figure 14-15). Recognition of foreign class I alloantigens on thegraft by host CD8 +cells can lead to CTL-mediated killing (see Figure 14-4). In some cases, CD4+T cells that function as class II MHC-restricted cytotoxic cells mediate graft rejection. In each of these effector mechanisms, cytokines secreted by T Hcells play a central role (see 21-6). For example, IL-2, IFN- /H9253, and mediators of graft rejection. IL-2 promotes T-cell pro-liferation and generally is necessary for the generation ofeffector CTLs (see Figure 14-1). IFN- /H9253is central to the devel- opment of a DTH response, promoting the influx of macro-phages into the graft and their subsequent activation intomore destructive cells. TNF- /H9252has been shown to have a di- rect cytotoxic effect on the cells of a graft. A number of cyto-kines promote graft rejection by inducing expression of classI or class II MHC molecules on graft and IFN- /H9253increases class II MHC expression as well. During a rejection episode, the levels of these cytokinesincrease, inducing a variety of cell types within the graft toexpress class I or class II MHC molecules. In rat cardiac allo-grafts, for example, dendritic cells are initially the only cellsthat express class II MHC molecules. However, as an allograftreaction begins, localized production of IFN- /H9253in the graft induces vascular endothelial cells and myocytes to expressclass II MHC molecules as well, making these cells targets forCTL attack.Transplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 487Clinical Manifestations of Graft Rejection Graft-rejection reactions have various time courses depending upon the type of tissue or organ grafted and the immuneresponse involved. Hyperacute rejection reactions occur with-in the first 24 hours after transplantation; acute rejection reac-tions usually begin in the first few weeks after transplantation;and chronic rejection reactions can occur from months toyears after transplantation.Pre-Existing Recipient Antibodies Mediate Hyperacute Rejection In rare instances, a transplant is rejected so quickly that the grafted tissue never becomes vascularized. These hyperacutereactions are caused by preexisting host serum antibodiesspecific for antigens of the graft. The antigen-antibody com-plexes that form activate the complement system, resulting inan intense infiltration of neutrophils into the grafted tissue.The ensuing inflammatory reaction causes massive bloodclots within the capillaries, preventing vascularization of thegraft (Figure 21-7).488 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TH cell CD8+ TC CD4+ 21-6 Effector mechanisms (purple blocks) involved in allograft rejection. The generation or activity of various effector cellsdepends directly or indirectly on cytokines THcells. ADCC = antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.Several mechanisms can account for the presence of pre- existing antibodies specific for allogeneic MHC antigens. Re-cipients of repeated blood transfusions sometimes developsignificant levels of antibodies to MHC antigens expressedon white blood cells present in the transfused blood. If someof these MHC antigens are the same as those on a subsequentgraft, then the antibodies can react with the graft, inducing ahyperacute rejection reaction. With repeated pregnancies, wo-men are exposed to the paternal alloantigens of the fetus andmay develop antibodies to these antigens. Finally, individualswho have had a previous graft sometimes have high levels ofantibodies to the allogeneic MHC antigens of that graft. In some cases, the preexisting antibodies participating in hyperacute graft rejection may be specific for blood-groupantigens in the graft. If tissue typing and ABO blood-grouptyping are performed prior to transplantation, these preex-isting antibodies can be detected and grafts that would resultin hyperacute rejection can be avoided. Xenotransplants areoften rejected in a hyperacute manner because of antibodiesto cellular antigens of the donor species that are not presentin the recipient species. Such an antigen is discussed in theClinical Focus section of this chapter. In addition to the hyperacute rejection mediated by pre- existing antibodies, there is a less frequent form of rejectiontermed accelerated rejection caused by antibodies that are produced immediately after transplantation. Acute Rejection Is Mediated by T-Cell Responses Cell-mediated allograft rejection manifests as an acute rejec- tion of the graft beginning about 10 days after transplanta-tion (see Figure 21-1b). Histopathologic examination revealsa massive infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes at thesite of tissue destruction, suggestive of T H-cell activation and proliferation. Acute graft rejection is effected by the mecha-nisms described previously (see Figure 21-6). Chronic Rejection Occurs Months or Years Post-Transplant Chronic rejection reactions develop months or years after acute rejection reactions have subsided. The mechanisms of chronicrejection include both humoral and cell-mediated responses bythe recipient. While the use of immunosuppressive drugs andthe application of tissue-typing methods to obtain optimummatch of donor and recipient have dramatically increased sur-vival of allografts during the first years after engraftment, littleTransplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 489 Antibodies bind to antigens of renal capillaries and activate complement (C-)2 Pre-existing host antibodies are carried tokidney graft1 endothelialwalls Kidneygraft Neutrophil tissue, causingvascular blockage4 PlateletsComplement split products attract neutrophils, which release lytic enzymes3 Enzymes FIGURE 21-7 Steps in the hyperacute rejection of a kidney graft. progress has been made in long-term survival. The use of im- munosuppressive drugs, which are described below, greatlyincreases the short-term survival of the transplant, but chronicrejection is not prevented in most cases. Data for rejection ofkidney transplants since 1975 indicates an increase from 40%to over 80% in one-year survival of grafts. However, in thesame period long-term survival has risen only slightly; as in1975, about 50% of transplanted kidneys are still functioningat 10 years after transplant. Chronic rejection reactions are dif-ficult to manage with immunosuppressive drugs and maynecessitate another transplantation.General Immunosuppressive Therapy Allogeneic transplantation requires some degree of immu- nosuppression if the transplant is to survive. Most of theimmunosuppressive treatments that have been developedhave the disadvantage of being nonspecific; that is, theyresult in generalized immunosuppression of responses to allantigens, not just those of the allograft, which places therecipient at increased risk of infection. In addition, many490 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease (and those of most mammals other than humans and the highest nonhuman pri-mates) of a disaccharide antigen (galacto-syl-1,3-/H9251-galactose) that is not present on human cells. The presence of this antigenon many microorganisms means thatnearly everyone has been exposed to itand has formed antibodies against it. Thepreexisting antibodies react with pig cells,which are then lysed rapidly by comple-ment. The absence of human regulatorsof complement activity on the pig cells, in-cluding human and human scriptions of DAF and MCP.) How can this major obstacle be cir- cumvented? Being tested are strategiesfor absorbing the antibodies from the circulation on solid supports, and usingsoluble gal-gal disaccharides to block antibody reactions. A more elegant solu-tion involves genetically engineering pigsto knock out the gene for the enzyme that synthesizes galactosyl- 1,3-/H9251-galactose. Solving the immediate rejection reactionby interfering with the specific reactionagainst this antigen may not prevent allantibody-mediated rejection. Certainly otherantigenic differences to which human re-cipients have antibodies will be present in some if not all donor/recipient pairs.However, any antibody attack on the pigcells may be blunted if human DAF is pre- sent on the targeted cell to dampen thecomplement reaction. The lack of humanDAF is remedied by producing transgenicpigs that express this protein. Addition ofhuman complement regulators to the pigrepresents a universal solution, in that anycell that might become a target in thetransplant will resist complement lysis. An additional concern is that pig en- dogenous retroviruses will be introducedinto humans as a result of xenotransplan-tation and cause disease. Opponents ofxenotransplantation raise the specter ofanother HIV-type epidemic resulting fromhuman infection by a new animal retro-virus. Recently, a Boston-based companyannounced development of pigs free ofendogenous pig retroviruses, reducingthe possibility of this bleak outcome. Will we see the use of pig kidneys in humans in the near future? The increasingdemand for organs is driving the com-mercial development of colonies of pigssuitable to become organ donors. Whilekidneys are the most sought-after organ atpresent, other organs and cells from thespecially bred and engineered animals willfind use if they are proven to be safe andeffective. A statement from the AmericanSociety of Transplantation and the Ameri-can Society of Transplant Surgeons en-dorses the use of xenotransplants if cer-tain conditions are Xenotransplanta- tion 7:235). demonstra- tion of feasibility in a nonhuman primatemodel, proven benefit to the patient, andlack of infectious-disease risk. Barriers re-main to the clinical use of xenotrans-plants, but serious efforts are in motion toovercome them. Unless organ donations increase drastically, most ofthe 72,000 U.S. patients on the waiting list for a transplant will not receive one.The majority ( 47,000 ) need a kidney, but last year only 12,500 kidneys were trans- planted. A solution to this shortfall is toutilize animal organs. Some argue thatxenografts bring the risk of introducingpathogenic retroviruses into the humanpopulation; others object based on ethi-cal grounds relating to animal rights.Nevertheless, the use of pigs to supplyorgans for humans is under serious con-sideration. Pigs breed rapidly, have largelitters, can be housed in pathogen-freeenvironments, and share considerableanatomic and physiologic similarity withhumans. In fact, pigs have served asdonors of cardiac valves for humans foryears. Primates are more closely relatedto humans than pigs are, but the avail-ability of large primates as transplantdonors is, and will continue to be, ex-tremely limited. Balancing the advantages of pig do- nors are serious difficulites. For example,if a pig kidney were implanted into a hu-man by techniques standard for humantransplants, it would likely fail in a rapidand dramatic fashion due to hyperacuterejection. This antibody-mediated rejec-tion is due to the presence on the pig cellsCLINICAL FOCUS Is There a Clinical Future for Xenotransplantation?immunosuppressive measures are aimed at slowing the pro- liferation of activated lymphocytes. However, because anyrapidly dividing nonimmune cells (e.g., epithelial cells of thegut or bone-marrow hematopoietic stem cells) are also af-fected, serious or even life-threatening complications canoccur. Patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapyare at increased risk of cancer, hypertension, and metabolicbone disease. Mitotic Inhibitors Thwart T-Cell Proliferation Azathioprine (Imuran), a potent mitotic inhibitor, is oftengiven just before and after transplantation to diminish T-cellproliferation in response to the alloantigens of the graft. Aza-thioprine acts on cells in the S phase of the cell cycle to blocksynthesis of inosinic acid, which is a precursor of the purinesadenylic and guanylic acid. Both B-cell and T-cell prolifera-tion is diminished in the presence of azathioprine. Func-tional immune assays such as the MLR, CML, and skin testshow a significant decline after azathioprine treatment, indi-cating an overall decrease in T-cell numbers. Two other mitotic inhibitors that are sometimes used in conjunction with other immunosuppressive agents are cyclo-phosphamide and methotrexate. Cyclophosphamide is analkylating agent that inserts into the DNA helix and becomescross-linked, leading to disruption of the DNA chain. It isespecially effective against rapidly dividing cells and there-fore is sometimes given at the time of grafting to block T-cellproliferation. Methotrexate acts as a fact that the mitotic inhi-bitors act on all rapidly dividing cells and not specifically onthose involved in immune response against the allograft canlead to deleterious side reactions by thwarting division ofother functional cells in the body. Corticosteroids Suppress Inflammation As described at the end of Chapter 15, corticosteroids, such asprednisone and dexamethasone, are potent anti-inflammatoryagents that exert their effects at many levels of the immuneresponse. These drugs are often given to transplant recipientstogether with a mitotic inhibitor such as azathioprine to pre-vent acute episodes of chemically unrelated, CsA and FK506have similar actions. Both drugs block activation of resting T cells by inhibiting the transcription of genes encoding IL-2and the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), which are essen-tial for CsA and FK506 exert this effect by bindingto cytoplasmic proteins called immunophilins, forming acomplex that blocks the phosphatase activity of calcineurin.This prevents the formation and nuclear translocation of thecytoplasmic subunit NFATc and its subsequent assembly into NFAT, a DNA-binding protein necessary for transcription ofthe genes encoding a number of molecules important to T-cell activation (see Figure 10-11). Rapamycin is structur-ally similar to FK506 and also binds an immunophilin.However, the rapamycin-immunophilin complex does notinhibit calcineurin activity; instead, it blocks the prolifera-tion and differentiation of activated T Hcells in the G 1phase of the cell cycle. All three drugs, by inhibiting T H-cell prolif- eration and thus T H-cell cytokine expression, sub- sequent activation of various effector populations involvedin graft rejection, including T Hcells, T C cells, NK cells, macrophages, and B cells. The profound immunosuppressive properties of these three agents have made them a mainstay of heart, liver, kid-ney, and bone-marrow transplantation. Cyclosporin A hasbeen shown to prolong graft survival in kidney, liver, heart,and heart-lung transplants. In one study of 209 kidney trans-plants from cadaver donors, the 1-year survival rate was 64%among recipients receiving other immunosuppressive treat-ments and 80% among those receiving cyclosporin A. Simi-lar results have been obtained with liver transplants (Figure21-8). Despite these impressive results, CsA does have somenegative side effects, the most notable of which is toxicity tothe kidneys. Acute nephrotoxicity is quite common, in somecases progressing to chronic nephrotoxicity and drug-inducedkidney failure. FK506 and rapamycin are 10-100 times morepotent as immune suppressants than CsA, and therefore canbe administered at lower doses and with fewer side effectsthan CsA.Transplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 491 0Survival, % 36 Time after transplantation, months60 50 4030 1070 208090100 12 4 12 6 3 FIGURE 21-8 Comparison of the survival rate of liver transplants in 84patients who were immunosuppressed with azathioprine and corticosteroids (black) with the survival rate in 55patients who were immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A and corticosteroids (blue).[Adapted from S. M. Sabesin and W. Williams, Hosp. Pract. 15( July): 75.]Total Lymphoid Irradiation Eliminates Lymphocytes Because lymphocytes are extremely sensitive to x-rays, x-irradiation can be used to eliminate them in the transplantrecipient just before grafting. In total lymphoid x-irradiation,the recipient receives multiple x-ray exposures to the thymus,spleen, and lymph nodes before the transplant surgery. Thetypical protocol is daily x-irradiation treatments of about200 rads per day for several weeks until a total of 3400 radshas been administered. The recipient is grafted in this im-munosuppressed state. Because the bone marrow is not x-irradiated, lymphoid stem cells proliferate and renew thepopulation of recirculating lymphocytes. These newly formedlymphocytes appear to be more tolerant to the antigens ofthe graft. Specific Immunosuppressive Therapy In addition to harmful side effects peculiar to the various immunosuppressive treatments described above, a majorlimitation common to all is that they lack specificity, thusproducing a more-or-less generalized immunosuppressionand increasing the recipient's risk for infection. What isneeded ideally is an antigen-specific immunosuppressantthat reduces the immune response to the alloantigens of thegraft while preserving the recipient's ability to respond toother foreign antigens. Although this goal has not yet beenachieved in human transplants, recent successes in animalexperiments indicate that it may be possible. Specific immu-nosuppression to allografts has been achieved in animalexperiments using antibodies or soluble ligands reactive withcell-surface molecules. Monoclonal Antibodies Can Suppress Graft-Rejection Responses Monoclonal antibodies directed against various surface mol- ecules on cells of the immune system have been used success-fully to suppress T-cell activity in general or to suppress theactivity of subpopulations of T cells. Results from studieswith animal models suggest further that certain monoclonalsmay be used to suppress only T cells that are activated. Suc-cesses with animal models and trials with humans give reason to believe that two types of strategies involving anti-bodies to suppress rejection will find broad clinical use.Monoclonal antibodies may be used to deplete the recipientof a certain broad or specific cell population; alternatively,they may be used to block co-stimulatory signals. In the lat-ter case, a state of anergy is induced in those T cells that reactto antigens present on the allograft. A strategy to deplete immune cells involves use of a mon- oclonal antibody to the CD3 molecule of the TCR complex.Injection of such monoclonal antibodies results in a rapiddepletion of mature T cells from the circulation. This deple- tion appears to be caused by binding of antibody-coated T cells to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells, which then phago-cytose and clear the T cells from the circulation. In a furtherrefinement of this strategy, a cytotoxic agent such as diphthe-ria toxin is coupled with the antibody. The cell with whichthe antibody reacts internalizes the toxin, causing its death.Another depletion strategy used to increase graft survivaluses monoclonal antibodies specific for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (anti-TAC). Since the high-affinity IL-2 recep-tor is expressed only on activated T cells, exposure to anti-TAC after the graft specifically blocks proliferation of T cellsactivated in response to the alloantigens of the graft. Monoclonal-antibody therapy, which was initially em- ployed to deplete T cells in graft recipients, also has been usedto treat donors' bone marrow before it is transplanted. Suchtreatment is designed to deplete the immunocompetent T cells in the bone-marrow transplant; these are the cells thatreact with the recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host dis-ease (described below). Monoclonal antibodies with isotypesthat activate the complement system are most effective in allcell-depletion strategies. The CD3 receptor and the high-affinity IL-2 receptor are targets present on all activated T cells; molecules present onparticular T-cell subpopulations may also be targeted for im-munosuppressive therapy. For example, a monoclonal anti-body to CD4 has been shown to prolong graft survival. Inone study, monkeys were given a single large dose of anti-CD4 just before they received a kidney transplant. Graft sur-vival in the treated animals was markedly increased over thatin untreated control animals. Interestingly, the anti-CD4 didnot reduce the CD4 +T-cell count, but instead appeared to induce the T cells to enter an immunosuppressed state. Thisis an example of a nondepleting antibody. Other targets for monoclonal-antibody therapy are the cell-surface adhesion molecules. Simultaneous treatment withmonoclonal antibodies to the adhesion molecules ICAM-1and LFA-1 for 6 days after transplantation has permittedindefinite survival of cardiac grafts between allogeneic mice.However, when either monoclonal antibody was adminis-tered alone, the cardiac transplant was rejected. The require-ment that both monoclonal antibodies be given at the sametime probably reflects redundancy of the adhesion mole-cules: LFA-1 is known to bind to ICAM-2 in addition toICAM-1; and ICAM-1 is known to bind to Mac-1 and CD43in addition to LFA-1. Only when all possible pairings amongthese adhesins are blocked at the same time is adhesion andsignal transduction through this ligand pair blocked. A practical difficulty with using monoclonal antibodies to prolong graft survival in humans is that they are generally ofmouse origin. Many recipients develop an antibody responseto the mouse monoclonal antibody, rapidly clearing it fromthe body. This limitation has been overcome by the construc-tion of human monoclonal antibodies and mouse-humanchimeric antibodies (see Figure 5-25 and Clinical Focus inChapter 5).492 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseBecause cytokines appear to play an important role in al- lograft rejection, another strategy for prolonging graft sur-vival is to inject animals with monoclonal antibodies specificfor been shown to prolong bone-marrow transplants in mice and to reduce theincidence of graft-versus-host disease. Monoclonal antibod-ies to IFN- /H9253and to IL-2 have each been reported in some cases to prolong cardiac transplants in rats. Blocking Co-Stimulatory Signals Can Induce Anergy As described in Chapter 10, T H-cell activation requires a co- stimulatory signal in addition to the signal mediated by theT-cell receptor. The interaction between the B7 molecule onthe membrane of antigen-presenting cells and the CD28 orCTLA-4 molecule on T cells provides one such signal (seeFigure 10-13). Lacking a co-stimulatory signal, antigen-activated T cells become anergic (see Figure 10-15). CD28 isexpressed on both resting and activated T cells and binds B7 with a moderate affinity; CTLA-4 is expressed at muchlower levels and only on activated T cells but binds B7 with a20-fold higher affinity. A second pair of co-stimulatory mol-ecules required for T-cell activation are CD40, the APC, and CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154),which is present on the T cell. D. J. Lenschow, J. A. Bluestone, and colleagues demon- strated that blocking the B7-mediated co-stimulatory signalwith CTLA-4 after transplantation would cause the host's T cells directed against the grafted tissue to become anergic, thus enabling it to survive. In their experiment, human pan-creatic islets were transplanted into mice injected withCTLA-4Ig, a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracel-lular domains of CTLA4 and the constant region of the IgG1heavy chain (see Figure 10-14). Including the IgG1 heavy-chain constant region increases the half-life of the solublefusion protein. The xenogeneic graft exhibited long-termsurvival in treated mice but was quickly rejected in untreatedcontrols. The fact that the soluble form of the CTLA-4 re-ceptor was able to block the rejection of the human tissuetransplant in the recipient mice is evidence that blocking co-stimulatory signals in vivo is a viable strategy (Figure 21-9). These exciting results were extended to transplantation of kidneys mismatched for class I and class II antigens in mon-keys by Allan Kirk, David Harlan, and their colleagues. Therecipients were treated for about 4 weeks after transplanta-tion with either CTLA4-Ig or a monoclonal antibody directedagainst CD40L, or both in combination. Untreated controlanimals rejected the mismatched kidneys within 5-8 days;those treated with a single agent retained their grafts for20-98 days. However, the animals given both reagents showedno evidence of rejection at 150 days after transplantation.This suppression of allograft rejection did not lead to a stateof general immunosuppression; peripheral T-cell counts re-mained normal and other immune functions were present,including mixed lymphocyte reactivity between donor andrecipients. Human clinical trials of the procedures developedfor monkeys are planned; if successful, they could revolution-ize clinical transplantation procedures. The ability to block Transplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 493 T cell T cells that recognize graft antigens become activated Graft rejected Graft survivesAPCCD28 B7 CTLA4-Ig T cells that recognize graft antigens lack co-stimulation and become anergic FIGURE 21-9 Blocking co-stimulatory signals at the time of trans- plantation can cause anergy instead of activation of the T cells reactiveagainst the graft. T-cell activation requires both the interaction of theTCR with its ligand and the reaction of co-stimulatory receptors withtheir ligands (a). In (b), contact between one of the co-stimulatory re-ceptors, CD 28on the T cell, and its ligand, B 7on the APC, is blocked by reaction of soluble ligand CTLA- 4Ig. The CTLA 4is cou- pled to an Ig H chain, which slows its clearance from the circulation.This process specifically suppresses graft rejection without inhibitingthe immune response to other antigens.allograft rejection without general immunosuppression and without the deleterious side effects of suppressive drugswould enable recipients to lead normal lives. Immune Tolerance to Allografts There are instances in which an allograft may be acceptedwithout the use of immunosuppressive measures. Obviously,in the case of tissues that lack alloantigens, such as cartilageor heart valves, there is no immunologic barrier to transplan-tation. However, there are also instances in which the strongpredicted response to an allograft does not occur. There aretwo general cases in which an allograft may be accepted. Oneis when cells or tissue are grafted to a so-called privileged sitethat is sequestered from immune-system surveillance. Thesecond is when a state of tolerance has been induced biologi-cally, usually by previous exposure to the antigens of thedonor in a manner that causes immune tolerance rather thansensitization in the recipient. Each of these exceptions is con-sidered below. Privileged Sites Accept Antigenic Mismatches In immunologically privileged sites, an allograft can beplaced without engendering a rejection reaction. These sitesinclude the anterior chamber of the eye, the cornea, theuterus, the testes, and the brain. The cheek pouch of the Syr-ian hamster is a privileged site used in experimental situa-tions. Each of these sites is characterized by an absence oflymphatic vessels and in some cases by an absence of bloodvessels as well. Consequently, the alloantigens of the graft arenot able to sensitize the recipient's lymphocytes, and the grafthas an increased likelihood of acceptance even when HLAantigens are not matched. The privileged location of the cornea has allowed corneal transplants to be highly successful. The brain is an immu-nologically privileged site because the blood-brain barrierprevents the entry or exit of many molecules, including anti-bodies. The successful transplantation of allogeneic pan-creatic islet cells into the thymus in a rat model of diabetessuggests that the thymus may also be an immunologicallyprivileged site. Immunologically privileged sites fail to induce an im- mune response because they are effectively sequestered fromthe cells of the immune system. This suggests the possibilityof physically sequestering grafted cells. In one study, pancre-atic islet cells were encapsulated in semipermeable mem-branes (fabricated from an acrylic copolymer) and thentransplanted into diabetic mice. The islet cells survived andproduced insulin. The transplanted cells were not rejected,because the recipient's immune cells could not penetrate themembrane. This novel transplant method enabled the dia-betic mice to produce normal levels of insulin and may haveapplication for treatment of human diabetics.Early Exposure to Alloantigens Can Induce Specific Tolerance In 1945, Ray Owen reported that nonidentical twins in cattle retained the ability to accept cells or tissue from the genet-ically distinct sibling throughout their lives, unlike noniden-tical twins of other mammalian species. A shared placenta incattle allows free circulation of cells from one twin to theother throughout the embryonic period. Although the twinsmay have inherited distinct paternal and maternal antigens,they do not recognize those of their placental partner as for-eign and can accept grafts from them. Experimental support for the notion that tolerance comes from exposure of the developing organism to alloantigenscame from mouse experiments. If neonates of mouse strainA are injected with cells from strain C they will accept graftsfrom C strain as adults. Immunocompetence of the injectedA-strain mice and specificity of the tolerance is shown by thefact that they reject grafts from other strains as rapidly astheir untreated littermates. While no human experimentaldata demonstrate such specific tolerance, anecdotal data sug-gests that it may operate in humans as well. There are exam-ples in which allografts, mismatched at a single HLA locusare accepted with little or no immune suppression. In caseswhere the mismatched antigen is expressed by the mother,but not inherited by the offspring, there is the possibility thatperinatal exposure induced subsequent tolerance to this anti-gen. Because human maternal cells do not normally cross theplacental barrier, such specific tolerance to noninheritedmaternal antigens would be an exception rather than a com-monplace event. Clinical Transplantation For a number of illnesses, a transplant is the only means oftherapy. Figure 21-10 summarizes the major organ and celltransplants being performed at the present time. In addition,certain combinations of organs, such as heart and lung orkidney and pancreas, are being transplanted simultaneouslywith increasing frequency. Since the first kidney transplantwas performed in the 1950s, approximately 400,000 kidneyshave been transplanted worldwide. The next most frequentlytransplanted solid organ is the liver (52,000), followed by theheart (42,000) and, more distantly, by the lung (6,000) andpancreas (2,000). Bone-marrow transplants number around80,000. Although the clinical results of transplantation ofvarious cells, tissues, and organs in humans have improvedconsiderably in the past few years, major obstacles to the useof this treatment exist. As explained above, the use of immu-nosuppressive drugs greatly increases the short-term survivalof the transplant, but medical problems arise from use ofthese drugs, and chronic rejection is not prevented in mostcases. The need for additional transplants after rejection exac-erbates the shortage of organs which is a major obstacle to the494 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseasewidespread use of transplantation. Several of the organ sys- tems for which transplantation is a common treatment areconsidered below. The frequency with which a given organ ortissue is transplanted depends on a number of factors: IClinical situations in which transplantation is indicated IAvailability of tissue or organs IDifficulty in performing transplantation and caring forpost-transplantation patientsISpecific factors that aid or hinder acceptance of theparticular transplant The urgency of the transplantation may depend on the affected organ. In the case of the heart, lung, and liver, fewalternative procedures can keep the patient alive when theseorgans cease to function. Although dialysis may be used tomaintain a patient awaiting a kidney transplant, there are nocomparable measures for the heart or lungs if the allograftfails. Research on artificial organs is ongoing but there are noreports of long-term successes.Transplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 495 VISUALIZING CONCEPTS Cornea From cadaverImmunosuppression not required40,000 transplants per year LungFrom data (47 in 2000) HeartFrom brain-dead donorHLA matching useful but often impossibleRisk of coronary artery damage, perhapsmediated by host antibody2172 transplants in 2000 KidneyFrom live donor or cadaverABO and HLA matching usefulImmunosuppression usually requiredRisk of GVHD very low13,258 transplants in 2000Increasingly, pancreas/kidney transplantfor advanced diabetes (910 in 2000)BloodTransfused from living donor ABO and Rh matching requiredComplications extremely rareAn estimated 14 million units in 2000 Bone marrowNeedle aspiration from living donorImplanted by IV injectionABO and HLA matching requiredRejection rare but GVHD a risk FIGURE 21-10 Transplantations routinely used in clinical prac- tice. For the solid organs, the number of transplants performed inthe United States in 2000 is indicated. Estimates are included for other transplants if available.The Most Commonly Transplanted Organ Is the Kidney As mentioned above, the most commonly transplanted organ is the kidney; in 2000, there were 13,258 kidney transplantsperformed in the United States. Major factors contributing tothis number are the numerous clinical indications for kidneytransplantation. Many common diseases, such as diabetes andvarious types of nephritis, result in kidney failure that can bealleviated by transplantation. With respect to availability, kid-neys can be obtained not only from cadavers but also from liv-ing relatives or volunteers, because it is possible to donate akidney and live a normal life with the remaining kidney. In1999, 4457 of the 12,483 kidneys transplanted in the U.S. camefrom living donors. Surgical procedures for transplantationare straightforward; technically, the kidney is simpler to reim-plant than the liver or heart. Because many kidney transplantshave been done, patient-care procedures have been workedout in detail. Matching of blood and histocompatibility groupsis advantageous in kidney transplantation because the organis heavily vascularized, but the kidney presents no specialproblems that promote rejection or graft-versus-host disease(GVHD), as the bone marrow or liver do. Two major problems are faced by patients waiting for a kidney. One is the short supply of available organs, and thesecond is the increasing number of sensitized recipients. Thelatter problem stems from rejection of a first transplant,which then sensitizes the individual and leads to the forma-tion of antibodies and activation of cellular mechanisms di-rected against kidney antigens. Any subsequent graft con-taining antigens in common with the first would be quicklyrejected. Therefore, detailed tissue typing procedures mustbe used to ascertain that the patient has no antibodies oractive cellular mechanisms directed against the potentialdonor's kidney. In many cases, patients can never again find amatch after one or two rejection episodes. It is almost alwaysnecessary to maintain kidney-transplant patients on someform of immunosuppression, usually for their entire lives.Unfortunately, this gives rise to complications, including risksof cancer and infection as well as other side effects such ashypertension and metabolic bone disease. Bone-Marrow Transplants Are Used for Leukemia, Anemia, and Immunodeficiency After the kidney, bone marrow is the most frequent trans- plant. Since the early 1980s, bone-marrow transplantationhas been increasingly adopted as a therapy for a ofmalignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases, severe com-bined immunodeficiency, or SCID (see Chapter 19). Thebone marrow, which is obtained from a living donor by multi-ple needle aspirations, consists of erythroid, myeloid, mono-cytoid, megakaryocytic, lineages. The graft,usually per kilogram of host body weight, isinjected intravenously into the recipient. The first successful bone-marrow transplantations were performed between iden-tical twins. However, development of the tissue-typing pro-cedures described earlier now makes it possible to identifyallogeneic donors who have HLA antigens identical or near-identical to those of the recipients. While the supply of bonemarrow for transplantation is not a problem, finding amatched donor may be one. In the usual procedure, the recipient of a bone-marrow transplant is immunologically suppressed before grafting.Leukemia patients, for example, are often treated with cyclo-phosphamide and total-body irradiation to kill all cancerouscells. The immune-suppressed state of the recipient makesgraft rejection rare; however, because the donor bone mar-row contains immunocompetent cells, the graft may rejectthe host, GVHD affects 50%-70% patients; donor T cells recognize alloantigens on the hostcells. The activation and proliferation of these T cells and thesubsequent production of cytokines generate inflammatoryreactions in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Insevere cases, GVHD can result in generalized erythrodermaof the skin, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and liver failure. Various treatments are used to prevent GVHD in bone- marrow transplantation. The transplant recipient is usuallyplaced on a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs, oftenincluding cyclosporin A and methotrexate, in order to inhibitthe immune responses of the donor cells. In another ap-proach, the donor bone marrow is treated with anti-T-cellantisera or monoclonal antibodies specific for T cells beforetransplantation, thereby depleting the offending T cells. Com-plete T-cell depletion from donor bone marrow, however,increases the likelihood that the marrow will be rejected, andso the usual procedure now is a partial T-cell depletion.Apparently, a low level of donor T-cell activity, which resultsin a low-level GVHD, is actually beneficial because the donorcells kill any host T cells that survive the immunosuppressiontreatment. This prevents residual recipient cells from becom-ing sensitized and causing rejection of the graft. In leukemiapatients, low-level GVHD also seems to result in destructionof host leukemic cells, thus making it less likely for theleukemia to recur. Heart Transplantation Is a Challenging Operation Perhaps the most dramatic form of transplantation is that of the heart; once the damaged heart has been removed, thepatient must be kept alive by wholly artificial means until the transplanted heart is in place and beating. Heart-lungmachines are available to circulate and aerate the patient'sblood after the heart is removed. The donor's heart must bemaintained in such a manner that it will begin beating whenit is placed in the recipient. It has been found that a humanheart can be kept viable for a limited period in ice-cold buffersolutions that effectively short circuit the electric impulses496 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseasethat control the rhythmic beating, which could damage the isolated organ. The surgical methods of implanting a hearthave been available for a number of years. The first hearttransplant was carried out in South Africa by Dr. ChristianBarnard, in 1964. Since then, the one-year survival rate fortransplantation of the heart has become greater than 80%. In2000, 2172 heart transplants were performed in the UnitedStates and about 3500 worldwide. An issue peculiar to hearttransplantation has been a new type of atherosclerotic dis-ease in the coronary arteries of the implanted organ. There issome possibility that host antibodies mediate injury to thevessels in the donated heart. Although a heart transplant may greatly benefit patients with various types of heart disease or damage, there is obvi-ously a strict limit on the number of available hearts. Acci-dent victims who are declared brain dead but have an intactcirculatory system and a functioning heart are the normalsource of these organs. HLA matching is desirable but notoften possible, because of the limited supply of hearts and theurgency of the procedure. Lung Transplants Are on the Increase In recent years, lung transplantation, either by itself or inconjunction with heart transplantation, has been used totreat diseases such as cystic fibrosis and emphysema or acutedamage to the lungs such as that caused by smoke inhalation.In 2000, 945 lung and 47 heart/lung transplants were per-formed. First-year survival rate for lung transplants is re-ported at about 60%. Liver Transplants Treat Congenital Defects and Damage from Viral or Chemical Agents The liver is a large organ that performs a number of func- tions related to clearance and detoxification of chemical andbiological substances. Liver malfunction can be caused bydamage to the organ from viral diseases such as hepatitis orby exposure to harmful chemicals, as in chronic alcoholism.Damage to the liver may correct itself and the damaged tissuecan regenerate after the causative injurious agent is cleared. Ifthe liver tissue does not regenerate, damage may be fatal. Themajority of liver transplants are used as a therapy for con-genital abnormalities of the liver. Because the liver is largeand has a complicated circulation, re-implantation of theliver initially posed a technical problem. T echniques have beendeveloped to overcome this major surgical challenge, and therecent one-year survival rate has risen to approximately 65%.In 2000, 4816 livers were transplanted in the United States.Increasingly, a liver from a single donor may be split andgiven to two recipients; normally, a child will receive thesmaller portion and an adult the larger. The immunology of liver transplantation is interesting because the organ appears to resist rejection by hyperacuteantibody-mediated mechanisms. It has been shown that eventransplantation across blood-group barriers, which would be expected to trigger hyperacute rejection, can be successful in the short term. However, leukocytes within the donor or-gan together with anti-blood-group antibodies can mediateantibody-dependent hemolysis of recipient red blood cells ifthere is a mismatch of the blood groups. In addition, mani-festations of GVHD have occurred in liver transplants evenwhen donor and recipient are blood-group compatible. Thesereactions are obviously caused by donor lymphocytes carriedby the transplanted liver. Pancreas Transplantation Offers a Cure for Diabetes Mellitus One of the more common diseases in the United States is diabetes mellitus. This disease is caused by malfunction ofinsulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas. Transplantationof a pancreas could provide the appropriately regulated levelsof insulin necessary to make the diabetic individual normal.Recently, one-year success rates for pancreas transplantationof about 55% have been reported. Transplantation of the com-plete pancreas is not necessary to restore the function neededto produce insulin in a controlled fashion; transplantation ofthe islet cells alone could restore function. Kidney failure is afrequent complication of advanced diabetes occurring inabout 30% of diabetics, therefore kidney and pancreas trans-plants are indicated. In 2000, there were 420 pancreas trans-plants and 904 simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplants. Agroup at the University of Wisconsin reports that they haveovercome surgical and medical barriers to the dual trans-plant and have achieved survival rates of 87% at one year and78% at five years for the 381 cases in their study. Whether it isbetter to carry out simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantsor to transplant separately remains an issue to be resolved ona case-to-case basis. Skin Grafts Are Used to Treat Burn Victims Most skin transplantation in humans is done with autolo-gous tissue. However, in cases of severe burn, grafts of foreignskin thawed from frozen deposits in tissue banks may beused. These grafts generally act as biologic dressings, becausethe cellular elements are no longer viable and the graft doesnot grow in the new host; the grafts are left in place for sev-eral days but are regularly replaced. True allogeneic skin graft-ing using fresh viable donor skin has been undertaken insome cases, but rejection must be prevented by the use ofimmunosuppressive therapy. This is not desirable because amajor problem with burn victims is the high risk of infec-tion, and immunosuppressive therapy accentuates this risk. The above list of common transplants is by no means all- inclusive and is expected to grow in future years. For exam-ple, intracerebral neural-cell grafts have restored functional-ity in victims of Parkinson's disease. In studies conductedthus far, the source of neural donor cells was human em-bryos; the possibility of using those from other animal spe-cies is being tested.Transplantation Immunology CHAPTER 21 497Xenotransplantation May Be the Answer to the Shortage of Donor Organs While the immune system represents a formidable barrier to the use of transplantation, there has been significant progressin overcoming this obstacle. However, there has not beencomparable progress in solving the complex problem of find-ing organs for those who need them. The insufficient supplyof available organs means that a large percentage of patientsdie while waiting for a transplant. The need for an alternativesource of donor organs has focused attention on xenotrans-plantation. The larger nonhuman primates (chimpanzees andbaboons) have served as the main transplant donors, and, asdiscussed in the Clinical Focus section, the use of the pig as asource of organs is under serious consideration. The earliest transplants of chimpanzee kidneys into hu- mans date back to 1964. Since that time, sporadic attempts atkidney, heart, liver, and bone-marrow transplantation fromprimates into humans have been made. No attempt has metwith great success but several have received some attention. In1993, T. E. Starzl performed two liver transplants from ba-boons into patients suffering from liver failure. Both patientsdied, one after 26 days and the other after 70 days. In 1994, apig liver was transplanted into a 26-year-old suffering fromacute hepatic failure. The liver functioned only 30 hours beforeit was rejected by a hyperacute rejection reaction. In 1995,baboon bone marrow was infused into an HIV-infected manwith the aim of boosting his weakened immune system withthe baboon immune cells, which do not become infected withthe virus. Although there were no complications from thetransplant, the baboon bone marrow did not appear to estab-lish itself in the recipient. A major problem with xenotransplants is that immune rejection is often quite vigorous, even when recipients aretreated with potent immunosuppressive drugs such as FK506or rapamycin. The major response involves the action ofhumoral antibody and complement, leading to the develop-ment of a hyperacute rejection reaction. In addition to theproblem of rejection, there is general concern that xeno-transplantation has the potential of spreading pathogensfrom the donor to the recipient. These pathogens could po-tentially cause diseases, called xenozoonoses, that are fatal forhumans. For example, certain viruses, including close rela-tives of HIV-1 found in chimpanzees and HIV-2 and herpes-virus B, which occur in several primate species, cause limitedpathogenesis in their primate hosts but can lead to deadlyinfections in humans. In addition, there is the fear that pri-mate retroviruses (see Chapter 19), such as SIV , may recom-bine with human variants to produce new agents of disease.The possibility of introducing new viruses into humans maybe greater for transplants from closely related species, such asprimates, and less in the case of more distantly related spe-cies, such as pigs, because viruses are less likely to replicate incells from unrelated species.SUMMARY IGraft rejection is an immunologic response displaying the attributes of specificity, memory, and self/nonself recogni-tion. There are three major types of rejection reactions: Hyperacute rejection mediated by preexisting host anti- bodies to graft antigens. Acute graft rejection in which T Hcells and/or CTLs mediate tissue damage. Chronic rejection, which involves both cellular and hu- moral immune components. IThe immune response to tissue antigens encoded withinthe major histocompatibility complex is the strongest forcein rejection. IThe match between a recipient and potential graft donors isassessed by typing MHC class I and class II tissue antigens. IThe process of graft rejection can be divided into a sensiti-zation stage, in which T cells are stimulated, and an effectorstage, in which they attack the graft. IIn most clinical situations, graft rejection is suppressed bynonspecific immunosuppressive agents or by total lym-phoid x-irradiation. IExperimental monoclonal antibodiesoffer the possibility of immunosuppression. Theseantibodies may act by: Deleting populations of reactive cells. Inhibiting co-stimulatory signals leading to anergy in specifically reactive cells. ICertain sites in the body, including the cornea of the eye,brain, testes, and uterus, do not reject transplants despitegenetic mismatch between donor and recipient. ISpecific tolerance to alloantigens is induced by exposureto them in utero or by injection of neonates. IA major complication in bone-marrow transplantation is graft-versus-host reaction mediated by the lymphocytescontained within the donor marrow. IThe critical shortage of organs available for transplanta-tion may be solved in the future by using organs fromnonhuman species (xenotransplants). References Adams, D. H. 2000.

Current estimates project that oneperson in three in the United States will develop cancer, andthat one in five will die from it. From an immunologic per-spective, cancer cells can be viewed as altered self-cells thathave escaped normal growth-regulating mechanisms. Thischapter examines the unique properties of cancer cells, pay- ing particular attention to those properties that can be recog-nized by the immune system. The immune responses thatdevelop to cancer cells, as well as the methods by which can-cers manage to evade those responses, are then described. The final section describes current clinical and experimentalimmunotherapies for cancer. Cancer: Origin and Terminology In most organs and tissues of a mature animal, a balance is usually maintained between cell renewal and cell death. Thevarious types of mature cells in the body have a given lifespan; as these cells die, new cells are generated by the prolif-eration and differentiation of various types of stem cells. Under normal circumstances, the production of new cells is regulated so that the number of any particular type of cell remains constant. Occasionally, though, cells arise that no longer respond to normal growth-control mechanisms. Thesecells give rise to clones of cells that can expand to a consider- able size, producing a tumor, or neoplasm. A tumor that is not capable of indefinite growth and does not invade the healthy surrounding tissue extensively is be- nign. A tumor that continues to grow and becomes progres- sively invasive is malignant; the term cancer refers speci- fically to a malignant tumor. In addition to uncontrolledgrowth, malignant tumors exhibit metastasis; in this pro- cess, small clusters of cancerous cells dislodge from a tumor, invade the blood or lymphatic vessels, and are carried toother tissues, where they continue to proliferate. In this waya primary tumor at one site can give rise to a secondarytumor at another site (Figure 22-1). Malignant tumors or cancers are classified according to the embryonic origin of the tissue from which the tumor isderived. Most (>80%) are carcinomas, tumors that arise from endodermal or ectodermal tissues such as skin or theepithelial lining of internal organs and glands. The majorityof cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, and lung are carci- nomas. The leukemias and lymphomas are malignant tu- mors of hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow and ac-count for about 9% of cancer incidence in the United States. Leukemias proliferate as single cells, whereas lymphomas tend to grow as tumor masses. Sarcomas, which arise less frequently (around 1% of the incidence in the United States),are derived from mesodermal connective tissues such asbone, fat, and cartilage. Malignant Transformation of Cells Treatment of normal cultured cells with chemical carcino- gens, irradiation, and certain viruses can alter their mor-phology and growth properties. In some cases this process,referred to as transformation, makes the cells able to pro- duce tumors when they are injected into animals. Such cellschapter 22ART TKare said to have undergone malignant transformation, and they often exhibit properties in vitro similar to those of can-cer cells. For example, they have decreased requirements forgrowth factors and serum, are no longer anchorage-dependent, and grow in a density-independent fashion. Moreover, bothcancer cells and transformed cells can be subcultured indefi-nitely; that is, for all practical purposes, they are immortal.Because of the similar properties of cancer and transformedcells, the process of malignant transformation has been stud- ied extensively as a model of cancer induction. Various chemical agents (e.g., DNA-alkylating reagents) and physical agents (e.g., ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation)that cause mutations have been shown to induce transforma-tion. Induction of malignant transformation with chemical orphysical carcinogens appears to involve multiple steps and at least two distinct phases: initiation and promotion. Initiation involves changes in the genome but does not, in itself, lead tomalignant transformation. After initiation, promoters stimu-late cell division and lead to malignant transformation. The importance of mutagenesis in the induction of cancer is illustrated by diseases such as xeroderma pigmentosum.This rare disorder is caused by a defect in the gene that en-codes a DNA-repair enzyme called UV-specific endonuclease. Individuals with this disease are unable to repair UV-induced mutations and consequently develop skin cancers. A number of DNA and RNA viruses have been shown to induce malignant transformation. Two of the best-studiedare SV40 and polyoma. In both cases the viral genomes,502 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease VISUALIZING CONCEPTS (a) (b)(c) (d)Initially modified tumor cell Invasive tumor cells Mass of tumor cells (localized benign tumor)Basal lamina Blood vessel Tumor cellsinvadeblood vessels,allowing metastasisto occur FIGURE 22-1 Tumor growth and metastasis.

(d) The malignant tumor metastasizes by generating small clusters of cancer cells that dislodge from the tu-mor and are carried by the blood or lymph to other sites in thebody. [Adapted from J. Darnell et al., 1990, Molecular Cell Biology, 2d ed., Scientific American Books.]which integrate randomly into the host chromosomal DNA, include several genes that are expressed early in the course ofviral replication. SV40 encodes two early proteins called large T and little T, and polyoma encodes three early proteins calledlarge T, middle T, and little T. Each of these proteins plays arole in the malignant transformation of virus-infected cells. Most RNA viruses replicate in the cytosol and do not induce malignant transformation. The exceptions are retro-viruses, which transcribe their RNA into DNA by means of a reverse-transcriptase enzyme and then integrate the tran- script into the host's DNA. This process is similar in the cyto-pathic retroviruses such as HIV-1 and HIV-2 and in thetransforming retroviruses, which induce changes in the host cell that lead to malignant transformation. In some cases, retrovirus-induced transformation is related to the presence ofoncogenes, or \"cancer genes,\" carried by the retrovirus. One of the best-studied transforming retroviruses is the Rous sarcoma virus. This virus carries an oncogene called a 60-kDa protein kinase (v-Src) that cat- addition of phosphate to tyrosine residues on pro-teins. The first evidence that oncogenes alone could induce malignant transformation came from studies of the v- srcon- cogene from Rous sarcoma virus. When this oncogene was cloned and transfected into normal cells in culture, the cellsunderwent malignant transformation. Oncogenes and Cancer Induction In 1971, Howard T emin suggested that oncogenes might not be unique to transforming viruses but might also be found innormal cells; indeed, he proposed that a virus might acquireoncogenes from the genome of an infected cell. He calledthese cellular genes proto-oncogenes, or cellular oncogenes (c-onc), to distinguish them from their viral counterparts (v-onc). In the mid-1970s, J. M. Bishop and H. E. Varmus identified a DNA sequence in normal chicken cells that ishomologous to v- src from Rous sarcoma virus. This cellular oncogene was designated c- src.Since these early discoveries, numerous cellular oncogenes have been identified. Sequence comparisons of viral and cellular oncogenes reveal that they are highly conserved in evolution. Although most cellular oncogenes consist of a series of exons and in-trons, their viral counterparts consist of uninterrupted cod- ing sequences, suggesting that the virus might have acquiredthe oncogene through an intermediate RNA transcript fromwhich the intron sequences had been removed during RNAprocessing. The actual coding sequences of viral oncogenesand the corresponding proto-oncogenes exhibit a high de-gree of homology; in some cases, a single point mutation is all that distinguishes a viral oncogene from the correspond-ing proto-oncogene. It has now become apparent that most,if not all, oncogenes (both viral and cellular) are derived fromcellular genes that encode various growth-controlling pro- teins. In addition, the proteins encoded by a particular onco-gene and its corresponding proto-oncogene appear to have very similar functions. As described below, the conversion of a proto-oncogene into an oncogene appears in many cases toaccompany a change in the level of expression of a normalgrowth-controlling protein. Cancer-Associated Genes Have Many Functions Homeostasis in normal tissue is maintained by a highly reg- ulated process of cellular proliferation balanced by cell death.Ifthere is an imbalance, either at the stage of cellular prolif- eration or at the stage of cell death, then a cancerous state willdevelop. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have beenshown to play an important role in this process, by regulatingeither cellular proliferation or cell death. Cancer-associatedgenes can be divided into three categories that reflect thesedifferent activities, summarized in Table 22-1. INDUCTION OF CELLULAR PROLIFERATION One category of proto-oncogenes and their oncogenic coun-terparts encodes proteins that induce cellular proliferation. Some of these proteins function as growth factors or growth-factor receptors. Included among these are sis,which encodes a form of platelet-derived growth factor, and fms, erbB, and neu, which encode growth-factor receptors. In normal cells, the expression of growth factors and their receptors is care-fully regulated. Usually, one population of cells secretes agrowth factor that acts on another population of cells that carries the receptor for the factor, thus stimulating prolifera-tion of the second population. Inappropriate expression ofeither a growth factor or its receptor can result in uncon-trolled proliferation. Other oncogenes in this category encode products that function in signal-transduction pathways or as transcriptionfactors. The src and abl oncogenes tyrosine kinases, and the ras oncogene encodes a GTP-binding protein. The products of these genes act as signal transducers. The myc, jun, and fos oncogenes encode transcription factors. Overac- tivity of any of these oncogenes may result in unregulatedproliferation. INHIBITION OF CELLULAR PROLIFERATION A second category of cancer-associated genes\u2014called tumor- suppressor genes, or anti-oncogenes\u2014encodes proteins that inhibit excessive cell proliferation. Inactivation of these re-sults in unregulated proliferation. The prototype of this cate-gory of oncogenes is Rb,the retinoblastoma gene. Hereditary retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer, in which tumors develop from neural precursor cells in the immature retina.The affected child has inherited a mutated Rballele; somatic inactivation of the remaining Rb allele leads to tumor growth. Probably the single most frequent genetic abnormality in human cancer is mutation in p53, which encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein. Over 90% of small-cell lung cancers andCancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 503over 50% of breast and colon cancers have been shown to be associated with mutations in p53. REGULATION OF PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH A third category of cancer-associated genes regulates pro- grammed cell death. These genes encode proteins that either block or induce apoptosis. Included in this category of onco-genes is bcl-2, an anti-apoptosis gene. This oncogene was originally discovered because of its association with B-cell fol-licular lymphoma. Since its discovery, bcl-2 has been shown to play an important role in regulating cell survival duringhematopoiesis and in the survival of selected B cells and T cells during maturation. Interestingly, the Epstein-Barrvirus contains a gene that has sequence homology to bcl-2 and may act in a similar manner to suppress apoptosis.Proto-Oncogenes Can Be Converted to Oncogenes In 1972, R. J. Huebner and G. J. T odaro suggested that muta- tions or genetic rearrangements of proto-oncogenes by car-cinogens or viruses might alter the normally regulated functionof these genes, converting them into potent cancer-causingoncogenes (Figure 22-2). Considerable evidence supportingthis hypothesis accumulated in subsequent years. For example,some malignantly transformed cells con tain multiple copies of cellular oncogenes, resulting in increased production of onco- geneproducts. Such amplification of cellular oncogenes has been observed in cells from various types of human cancers.Several groups have identified c- myc oncogenes in homo- geneously staining regions (HSRs) of chromosomes from can-504 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 22-1 Functional classification of cancer-associated genes Type/name Nature of gene product CATEGORY I: GENES THAT INDUCE CELLULAR PROLIFERATION Growth factors sis A form of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) Growth-factor receptors fms Receptor for colony-stimulating Receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) neu Protein (HER 2) related to EGF receptor erbA Receptor for thyroid activity K-ras GTP-binding protein with GTPase activity Transcription factors jun Component of transcription factor AP 1 fos Component of transcription factor AP 1 myc DNA-binding protein CATEGORY II: TUMOR-SUPRESSOR GENES, INHIBITORS OF CELLULAR PROLIFERATION* Rb Suppressor of retinoblastoma p53 Nuclear phosphoprotein that inhibits formation of small-cell lung cander and colon cancers DCC Suppressor of colon carcinoma APC Suppressor of adenomatous polyposis NF1 Suppressor of neurofibromatosis WT 1 Suppressor of Wilm's tumor CATEGORY III: GENES THAT REGULATE PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH bcl- 2 Suppressor of apoptosis * The activity of the normal products of the category II genes inhibits progression of the cell cycle. Loss of a gene or its in activation by mutation in an indicated tumor-suppressor gene is associated with development of the indicated cancers.cer cells; these HSRs represent long tandem arrays of amplified genes. In addition, some cancer cells exhibit chromosomal trans- locations,usually the movement of a proto-oncogene from one chromosomal site to another (Figure 22-3). In manycases of Burkitt's lymphoma, for example, c- myc is moved from its normal position on chromosome 8 to a positionnear the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer on chro-mosome 14. As a result of this translocation, synthesis of thec-Myc protein, which functions as a transcription factor,increases. Mutation in proto-oncogenes also has been associated with cellular transformation, and it may be a major mecha- nism by which chemical carcinogens or a cancer-inducing oncogene. For in-stance, single-point mutations in c- ras have been detected in a significant fraction of several human cancers, including car-cinomas of the bladder, colon, and lung. Some of these muta-tions appear to reduce the ability of Ras to associate withGTPase-stimulating proteins, thus prolonging the growth-activated state of Ras. Viral integration into the host-cell genome may in itself serve to convert a proto-oncogene into a transforming onco-gene. For example, avian leukosis virus (ALV) is a retrovirus that does not carry any viral oncogenes and yet is able to trans-form B cells into lymphomas. This particular retrovirus hasbeen shown to integrate within the c- myc proto-oncogene, which contains three exons. Exon 1 of c- myc has an unknown function; exons 2 and 3 encode the Myc protein. Insertion ofAVL between exon 1 and exon 2 has been shown in some cases to allow the provirus promoter to increase transcription of exons 2 and 3, resulting in increased synthesis of c-Myc. A variety of tumors have been shown to express signifi- cantly increased levels of growth factors or growth-factorCancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 505 Normal cells Transformed cells Proto-oncogenes ExpressionRetroviral transduction Mutagens, viruses, radiation, and geneticpredisposition Cellular oncogenes ExpressionViral oncogenes Essential growth- controlling proteins Growth factors Growth-factor receptors Signal transducers Intranuclear factors Regulators of programmed cell death 1 Qualitatively altered, hyperactive proteins2 Quantitative alterations (gene amplification or translocation) resulting in increased or decreased levels of products FIGURE 22-2 Conversion of proto-oncogenes into oncogenes can involve mutation, resulting in production of qualitatively different geneproducts, or DNA amplification or translocation, resulting in increasedor decreased expression of gene products.(a) Chronic myelogenous leukemia with CML contain the so-called Philadelphia chromo-some, which results from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Cancer cells from some patients with Burkitt's lymphoma ex- hibit a translocation that moves part of chromosome 8to chromo- some 14. It is now known that this translocation involves c- myc, a cellular oncogene. Abnormalities such as these are detected by band-ing analysis of metaphase chromosomes. Normal chromosomes areshown on the left, and translocated chromosomes on the right.receptors. Expression of the receptor for epidermal growth factor, which is encoded by c- erbB, has been shown to be amplified in many cancer cells. And in breast cancer, increasedsynthesis of the growth-factor receptor encoded by c- neu has been linked with a poor prognosis. The Induction of Cancer Is a Multistep Process The development from a normal cell to a cancerous cell is usually a multistep process of clonal evolution driven by aseries of somatic mutations that progressively convert the cellfrom normal growth to a precancerous state and finally acancerous state. The presence of myriad chromosomal abnormalities in precancerous and cancerous cells lends support to the role ofmultiple mutations in the development of cancer. This has been demonstrated in human colon cancer, which progressesin a series of well-defined morphologic stages (Figure 22-4).Colon cancer begins as small, benign tumors called adeno- mas in the colorectal epithelium. These precancerous tumorsgrow,gradually becoming increasingly disorganized in their intracellular organization until they acquire the malignantphenotype. These well-defined morphologic stages of coloncancer have been correlated with a sequence of gene changesinvolving inactivation or loss of three tumor-suppressor genes(APC, DCC, and p53) and activation of one cellular prolifer- ation oncogene (K- ras). Studies with transgenic mice also support the role of multi- ple steps in the induction of cancer. Transgenic mice express-ing high levels of Bcl-2 develop a population of small resting B cells, derived from secondary lymphoid follicles, that havegreatly extended life spans. Gradually these transgenic mice develop lymphomas. Analysis of lymphomas from these micehas shown that approximately half have a c- myc translocation to the immunoglobulin H-chain locus. mice producedby mating the bcl-2 +transgenic mice with myc+transgenic mice. These mice develop leukemia very rapidly. Tumors of the Immune System Tumors of the immune system are classified as lymphomas or leukemias. Lymphomas proliferate as solid tumors withina lymphoid tissue such as the bone marrow, lymph nodes, orthymus; they include Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lym-phomas. Leukemias tend to proliferate as single cells and aredetected by increased cell numbers in the blood or lymph.Leukemia can develop in lymphoid or myeloid lineages. Historically, the leukemias were classified as acute or chronic according to the clinical progression of the disease. The acute leukemias appeared suddenly and progressedrapidly, whereas the chronic leukemias were much less ag- gressive and developed slowly as mild, barely symptomatic diseases. These clinical distinctions apply to untreated leuke-mias; with current treatments, the acute leukemias often havea good prognosis, and permanent remission can often beachieved. Now the major distinction between acute andchronic leukemias is the maturity of the cell involved. Acute leukemias tend to arise in less mature cells, whereas chronicleukemias arise in mature cells. The acute leukemias includeacute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); these diseases can develop at any age and have a rapid onset. The chronic leukemias include chro nic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); these diseases develop slowly and are seen in adults. A number of B- and T-cell leukemias and lymphomas in- volve a proto-oncogene that has been translocated into the immunoglobulin genes or T-cell receptor genes. One of thebest characterized is the translocation of c- myc in Burkitt's lymphoma and in In 75% of Burkitt'slymphoma patients, c- mycis translocated from chromosome 8 to the Ig heavy-chain gene cluster on chromosome 14 (see506 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Chromosomal site Alteration Gene5q Loss APC18q Loss DCC12p Activation genetic alterations leading to metastatic colon cancer. Each of the stages indicated at the bottom ismorphologically distinct, allowing researchers to determine the se-quence of genetic alterations. [Adapted from B. Vogelstein and K. W. Kinzler, 1993, Trends Genet. 9:138.]Figure 22-3b). In the remaining patients, c- myc remains on chromosome 8 and the /H9260or /H9253light-chain genes are translo- cated to a region 3 /H11032of c- myc.Kappa-gene translocations from chromosome 2 to chromosome 8 occur 9% of the time,and /H9253-gene translocations from chromosome 22 to chromo- some 8 occur 16% of the time. Translocations of c- myc to the Ig heavy-chain gene cluster on chromosome 14 have been analyzed, and, in some cases,the entire c- myc gene is translocated head-to-head to a re- gion near the heavy-chain enhancer. In other cases, exons 1, 2, and 3 or exons 2 and 3 of c- myc are translocated head-to- head to the S /H9262or S /H9251switch site (Figure 22-5). In each case, the translocation removes the myc coding exons from the regulatory mechanisms operating in chromosome 8 and places them in the immunoglobulin-gene region, a very ac-tive region that is expressed constitutively in these cells. Theconsequences of enhancer-mediated high levels of constitu- tive myc expression in lymphoid cells have been investigated in transgenic mice. In one study, mice containing a transgeneconsisting of all three c- myc exons and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer were produced. Of 15 transgenic pupsborn, 13 developed lymphomas of the B-cell lineage within afew months of birth. Tumor Antigens The subdiscipline of tumor immunology involves the study of antigens on tumor cells and the immune response to theseantigens. Two types of tumor antigens have been identifiedon A T As).Tumor-specific antigens are unique to tumor cells and do not occur on normal cells in the body. They mayresult from mutations in tumor cells that generate altered cellular proteins; cytosolic processing of these proteins would give rise to novel peptides that are presented with class I MHC molecules, inducing a cell-mediated response bytumor-specific CTLs (Figure 22-6). Tumor-associated anti-gens, which are not unique to tumor cells, may be proteinsthat are expressed on normal cells during fetal developmentwhen the immune system is immature and unable to respondbut that normally ar e not expressed in the adult. Reactivation of the embryonic genes that encode these proteins in tumorcells results in their expression on the fully differentiated tumor cells. Tumor-associated antigens may also be proteinsthat are normally expressed at extremely low levels on normalcells but are expressed at much higher levels on tumor cells. It is now clear that the tumor antigens recognized by human Tcells fall into one of four major categories: Antigens encoded by genes exclusively expressed by tumors Antigens encoded by variant forms of normal genes that have been altered by mutation Antigens normally expressed only at certain stages of differentiation or only by certain differentiation lineages Antigens that are overexpressed in particular tumors Many tumor antigens are cellular proteins that give rise to peptides presented with MHC molecules; typically, these an-tigens have been identified by their ability to induce the pro-liferation of antigen-specific CTLs or helper T cells.Cancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 507 5JH 3 C\u00b5 exonsEnhancerSwitch region D JH 2 Ig heavy-chain gene on chromosome 14 Translocated c- gene in some Burkitt's In many patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, c- myc gene is translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene clusteron chromosome 14. In some cases, the entire c- mycgene is inserted near the heavy-chain enhancer (a), but in other cases, only the codingexons ( 2and 3) of c- myc are inserted at S /H9262switch site (b). Only exons 2and 3of c-myc Antigens Are Tumor-specific antigens have been identified on tumors in- duced with chemical or physical carcinogens and on somevirally induced tumors. Demonstrating the presence of tumor- specific antigens on spo ntaneously occurring tumors is par- ticularly difficult because the immune response to such tu-mors eliminates all of the tumor cells bearing sufficientnumbers of the antigens and in this wa y selects for cells bear- ing low levels of the antigens. CHEMICALLY OR PHYSICALLY INDUCED TUMOR ANTIGENS Methylcholanthrene and ultraviolet light are two carcinogens that have been used extensively to generate lines of tumor cells.When syngeneic animals are injected with killed cells from a carcinogen-induced tumor-cell line, the animals develop aspecific immunologic respo nse that can protect against later challenge by live cells of the same line but not other tumor-cell lines (Table 22-2). Even when the same chemical carcinogeninduces two separate tumors at different sites in the same ani-mal, the tumor antigens are distinct and the immune responseto one tumor does not protect against the other tumor. The tumor-specific transplantat ion antigens of chemically induced tumors have been difficult to characterize becausethey cannot be identified by induced antibodies but only bytheir T-cell-mediated rejection. One experimental approachthat has allowed identification of genes encoding some TSTAsis outlined in Figure 22-7. When a mouse tumorigenic cell line(tum +), which gives rise to progressively growing tumors, is treated in vitro with a chemical mutagen, some cells are mutated so that they no longer are capable of growing into a508 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Altered self-peptide Mutation generates new peptide in class I MHC molecule (TSTA)OncofetalpeptideNormal cell Inappropriate expression of embryonic gene (TATA)Self-peptide Self-peptide Class I MHC Class I MHC Overexpression of normal protein (TATA) FIGURE 22-6 Different mechanisms tumor-specific transplantation antigens (TSTAs) and tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATAs).

These mutant tumor cells are desig- nated as tum-variants. Most tum-variants have been shown to express TSTAs that are not expressed by the original tum+ tumor-cell line. When tum-cells are injected into syngeneic mice, the unique TSTAs that the tum-cells express are The TSTA-specific CTLs destroy thetum -tumor cells, thus preventing tumor growth. T o identifythe genes encoding the TSTAs that are expressed on a tum-cell line, a cosmid DNA library is prepared from the tum-cells. Genes from the tum-cells are transfected into the original tum+cells. The transfected tum+cells are tested for the expres- sion of the tum-TSTAs by their ability to activate cloned CTLs specific for the tum-TSTA. A number of diverse TSTAs have been identified by this method.Cancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 509 CTLs mouse No lysis (cells do not expressTSTA) No lysis (cells do not expressTSTA) Lysis (cells express TSTA) FIGURE 22-7 One procedure for identifying genes encoding tumor- specific transplantation antigens (TSTAs). Most TSTAs can be detectedonly by the cell-mediated rejection they elicit. In the first part of this pro-cedure, a nontumorigenic (tum -) cell line is generated; this cell line ex- presses a TSTA that is recognized by syngeneic mice, which mount acell-mediated response against it. To isolate the gene encoding the TSTA, a cosmid gene library is prepared from the tum-cell line, the genes are transfected into tumorigenic tum+cells, and the transfected cells are incubated with TSTA-specific CTLs.In the past few years, two methods have facilitated the char- acterization of TSTAs (Figure 22-8). In one method, peptidesbound to class I MHC molecules on the membranes of thetumor cells are eluted with acid and purified by high-pressureliquid chromatography (HPLC). In some cases, sufficient pep-tide is eluted to allow its sequence to be deduced by Edmandegradation. In a second approach, cDNA libraries are pre-pared from tumor cells. These cDNA libraries are transfectedtransiently into COS cells, which are monkey kidney cells transfected with the gene that codes for the SV40 large-T anti- gen. When these cells are later transfected plasmids con-taining both the tumor-cell cDNA plasmid replication, sothat up to plasmid copies are produced per cell. Thisresults in high-level expression of the tumor-cell DNA. The genes that encode some TSTAs have been shown to differ from normal cellular genes by a single point mutation.Further characterization of TSTAs has demonstrated that many of them are not cell-membrane proteins; rather, as indi-cated already, they are short peptides derived from cytosolicproteins that have been processed and presented together withclass I MHC molecules. Tumor Antigens May Be Induced by Viruses In contrast to chemically induced tumors, virally induced tumors express tumor antigens shared by all tumors inducedby the same virus. For example, when syngeneic mice are injected with killed cells from a particular polyoma-inducedtumor, the recipients are protected against subsequent chal-lenge with live cells from any polyoma-induced tumors (seeTable 22-2). Likewise, when lymphocytes are transferred from mice with a virus-induced tumor into normal syngeneicrecipients, the recipients reject subsequent transplants of all syngeneic tumors induced by the same virus. In the case ofboth SV40- and polyoma-induced tumors, the presence oftumor antigens is related to the neoplastic state of the cell. Inhumans, Burkitt's-lymphoma cells have been shown to express a nuclear antigen of the Epstein-Barr virus that may indeed bea tumor-specific antigen for this type of tumor. Human papil-loma virus (HPV) E6 and E7 proteins are found in more than80% of invasive cervical cancers\u2014the clearest example of avirally encode d tumor antigen. Consequently, there is great interest in testing as vaccine candidates the HPVs that arestrongly linked to cervical cancer, such as HPV-16. The potential value of these virally induced tumor antigens can be seen in animal models. In one experiment, mice immu-nized with a preparation of gene tically engineered polyoma virus tumor antigen were shown to be immune to subsequent injections of live polyoma-induced tumor cells. In anotherexperiment, mice were immunized with a vaccinia-virus vac- cine engineered with the gene encoding the polyoma-tumorantigen. These mice also developed immunity, rejecting laterinjections of live polyoma-induced tumor cells (Figure 22-9).510 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Monkey kidney cos cells(a) Acid Elute peptidePurify FIGURE 22-8 Two methods used to isolate tumor antigens that induce tumor-specific CTLs. See text for details.Most Tumor Antigens Are Not Unique to Tumor Cells The majority of tumor antigens are not unique to tumor cells but also are present on normal cells. These tumor-associatedtransplantation antigens may be proteins usually expressed only on fetal cells but not on normal adult cells, or they maybe proteins expressed at low levels by normal cells but atmuch higher levels by tumor cells. The latter category in- cludes growth factors and growth-factor receptors, as well asoncogene-encoded proteins. Several growth-factor receptors are expressed at signifi- cantly increased levels on tumor cells and can serve as tumor-associated antigens. For instance, a variety of tumor cells ex-press the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at levels100 times greater than that in normal cells. An example of anover-expressed growth factor serving as a tumor-associated antigen is a transferrin growth factor, designated p97, whichaids in the transport of iron into cells. Whereas normal cellsexpress less than 8,000 molecules of p97 per cell, melanoma cells express 50,000-500,000 molecules of p97 per cell. The gene that encodes p97 has been cloned, and a recombinantvaccinia virus vaccine has been prepared that carries thecloned gene. When this vaccine was injected into mice, it in-duced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses,which protected the mice against live melanoma cells ex-pressing the p97 antigen. Results such as this highlight the importance of identifying tumor antigens as potential targetsof tumor immunotherapy. ONCOFETAL TUMOR ANTIGENS Oncofetal tumor antigens, as the name implies, are found not only on cancerous cells but also on normal fetal cells. Theseantigens appear early in embryonic development, before theimmune system acquires immunocompetence; if these anti-gens appear later on cancer cells, they are recognized as nonselfand induce an immunologic response. Two well-studied onco-fetal antigens are (AFP) and carcinoem- bryonic antigen (CEA). Although the serum concentration of AFP drops from mil- ligram levels in fetal serum to nanogram levels in normal adultserum, elevated AFP levels are found in a majority of patientswith liver cancer (Table 22-3). CEA is a membrane glycoprotein found on gastrointestinal and liver cells of 2- to 6-month-oldfetuses. Approximately 90% of patients with advanced colorec-tal cancer and 50% of patients with early colorectal cancer haveincreased levels of CEA in their serum; some patients withother types of cancer also exhibit increased CEA levels. How-ever, because AFP and CEA can be found in trace amounts in some normal adults and in some noncancerous disease states,the presence of these oncofetal antigens is not diagnostic ofCancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 511 TimeRecombinant PV antigenLive develops FIGURE 22-9 Experimental induction of immunity against tumor cells induced by polyoma virus (PV) hasbeen achieved by immunizing mice with recombinantpolyoma tumor antigen (a), with a vaccinia vector vac-cine containing the gene encoding the PV tumor anti-gen (b), or with CTLs specific for the PV tumor antigen(c). Unimmunized mice (d) develop tumors when in-jected with live polyoma-induced tumor cells, whereasthe immunized mice do not.tumors but rather serves to monitor tumor growth. If, for example, a patient has had surgery to remove a colorectal carci- noma, CEA levels are monitored after surgery. An increase inthe CEA level is an indication of resumed tumor growth. ONCOGENE PROTEINS AS TUMOR ANTIGENS A number of tumors have been shown to express tumor-associated antigens encoded by cellular oncogenes. Theseantigens are also present in normal cells encoded by the cor-responding proto-oncogene. In many cases, there is no qual- itative difference between the oncogene and proto-oncogeneproducts; instead, the increased levels of the oncogene prod-uct can be recognized by the immune system. For example, asnoted earlier, human breast-cancer cells exhibit elevated ex-pression of the oncogene-encoded Neu protein, a growth-factor receptor, whereas normal adult cells express only traceamounts of Neu protein. Because of this difference in the Neu level, anti-Neu monoclonal antibodies can recognize andselectively eliminate breast-cancer cells without damagingnormal cells. TATA SON HUMAN MELANOMAS Several tumor-associated transplantation antigens an-tigens. these expressed on a significant pro-portion of human melanoma tumors, as well as on a numberof other human tumors, but not on normal differentiated tissues except for the testis, where it is expressed on germ-line cells. In addition, a number of differentiation antigens ex- pressed on normal gp75\u2014are overexpressed enabling them to function as tumor-associatedtransplantation antigens. Several of the human melanoma tumor antigens are shared by a number of other tumors. About 40% of human mela- nomas are positive for MAGE-1, and about 75% are positivefor MAGE-2 or 3. In addition to melanomas, a significant per-centage of glioma cell lines, breast tumors, non-small-cell lung tumors, and head or neck carcinomas express MAGE-1, 2, or3. These shared tumor antigens could be exploited for clinicaltreatment. It might be possible to produce a tumor vaccine expressing the shared antigen for treatment of a number of these tumors, as described at the end of this chapter. Tumors Can Induce Potent Immune Responses In experimental animals, tumor antigens can be shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responsesthat result in the destruction of the tumor cells. In general, thecell-mediated response appears to play the major role. A number of tumors have been shown to induce tumor-specificCTLs that recognize tumor antigens presented by class I MHCon the tumor cells. However, as discussed below, expression ofclass I MHC molecules is decreased in a number of tumors,thereby limiting the role of specific CTLs in their destruction. NK Cells and Macrophages Are Important in Tumor Recognition The recognition of tumor cells by NK cells is not MHC restricted. Thus, the activity of these cells is not compro- mised by the decreased MHC expression exhibited by sometumor cells. In some cases, Fc receptors on NK cells can bindto antibody-coated tumor cells, leading to ADCC. The im- portance of NK cells in tumor immunity is suggested by themutant mouse strain called beige and by Chediak-Higashi syndrome in humans, as described in the Clinical Focus in Chapter 14. In each case, a genetic defect causes markedimpairment of NK cells and an associated increase in certaintypes of cancer.512 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 22-3Elevation of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum of patientswith various diseases No. of % of patients patients with high AFP Disease tested or CEA levels* AFP > 400/H9262/ML Alcoholic cirrhosis NA 0 Hepatitis NA 1 Hepatocellular carcinoma NA 69 Other carcinoma NA 0 CEA > 10ng/ml CEA > 10MG/ML Cancerous Breast carcinoma 125 14 Colorectal carcinoma 544 35 Gastric carcinoma 79 19 Noncarcinoma carcinoma 228 2 Pancreatic carcinoma 55 35 Pulmonary carcinoma 181 26 Noncancerous Alcoholic cirrhosis 120 2 Cholecystitis 39 1 Nonmalignant disease 115 0 Pulmonary emphysema 49 4 Rectal polyps 90 1 Ulcerative colitis 146 5 *Altough trace amounts of both AFP and CEA can be found in some healthy adults, none would have levels greater than those indicated in the table. Cancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 513 some of which are unique to melanoma (see Table 22-5). These observations are enhanced by the ability to create cDNAlibraries (see Chapter 23) from tumor cells. The cDNAs can be transfected intotarget cells expressing the appropriateMHC molecules and then used as targetsfor CTL-mediated killing. Once CTL reac-tivity is recognized, the transfected cDNAcan be isolated and identified as a poten-tial tumor antigen. The ability to isolategenes encoding tumor-associated anti-gens provides us with the opportunityto use these proteins as immunogensfor the induction of tumor-specificrespons es. Additionally, the identifica- tion of tumor-associated proteins allowsus to identify peptides that elicit anti-tumor responses. Over the past few years, several bio- tech companies have devised strategiesfor the development of vaccines againstmelanoma as well as other cancers. Thesestrategies have one thing in the com-mon; the induction of a cell-mediatedresponse to tumor-associated antigens.Antigens are derived from individualpatient tumors or established tumor celllines. The use of patient-derived tumorsis appealing for obvious reasons. Theresponse to that tumor should, in theory,be uniquely directed only at tumor anti-gens and not other, potentially allotypic,determinants. However, such individual-ized therapy could be very expensive andtime-consuming. In this scenario, thetumor would be biopsied or surgicallyremoved, placed into culture, and thenused as an immunogen. Establishing aprimary tumor in culture is not easy, evenfor melanoma, and the procedure cantake several weeks. The time factor, cou-pled with the realization that manytumors are not easy to grow in vitro,places this into the category of \"designer therapies\" that may or may not be feasi-ble under the reality of managed healthcare today. The use of established tumors as the source of the immunogen is much moreaccessible in cost and practicality. Sam-ples from several tumors can be grown inculture and protein extracts prepared andfrozen, providing a source of immuno-gen for many patients. In addition toreduced costs, this strategy also allowscareful assessment of the immunogenic-ity of the tumor antigens found in thecultured cells. It is possible that some tumors may express higher levels oftumor-associated antigens and be moreimmunogenic than others. Indeed onebiotech company in California, CancerVax(www.CancerVax.com), has derived threecell lines that express high levels of over20tumor-associated antigens. Addition- ally, these cells express MHC class I alle-les which are represented in the majorityof individuals in the population, meaningthat intracellular antigens will be present-ed properly. Cells are irradiated to renderthem incapable of cell division and usedas irradiated whole cells for immuniza-tion. The advantages of this approachlies in the ability to standardize the im- munogen as well as reducing the cost. Antigen presentation is a critical fea- ture of any immunization strategy and oneway to enhance to immunization againsttumor antigens is to manipulate the fash-ion in which the antigen is presented.Professional antigen-presenting cells suchas dendritic cells are excellent candidates to employ in vaccination protocols. Sever- al companies have developed novel uses for dendritic cells in cancer therapy. Den- dreon (www.Dendreon.com), a Seattle-based company, first isolates dendritic-cellprecursors from patient blood, then intro-duces the immunogen into the dendriticcells and returns the antigen-pulsed den-dritic cells to the bloodstream of the cancer patient. This company, throughgenomics-based drug discovery, has iden-tified tumor-associated antigens prevalenton a wide variety of cancers. Thus the THE realization that the verte- brate immune system evolved to distin-guish self from non-self led to the notionthat our immune system could recog-nize a tumor as foreign. In fact, a majorresearch effort amongst cancer immu-nologists during the latter half of the20th century was the identification and characterization of tumor specific mole-cules, the so-called tumor antigens. Thisarea of research was met with skepti-cism. First of all, the existence of tumor-specific antigens was questionable; manyantigens were identified as tumor specif-ic only to find that other cells alsoexpressed these antigens. Secondly, ear-ly investigations in the field of tumorimmunology necessarily employed ani-mal models that may or may not be rele-vant to human cancers. However, withadvances in biotechnology, genomics,and proteomics, coupled with our in-creased understanding of the cellular in-teractions in the immune system, tumorimmunology now offers us the promiseof new drugs that will aid in the treat-ment of cancer. We now understand thattumor-associated antigens do exist andthat focusing the cellular arm of theimmune system toward the recognitionthese proteins is a rational approach tothe development of a cancer vaccine. One of the best-studied tumor- immunity models is melanoma. Mela-noma has evolved as a model system forseveral reasons. First of all and paradox-ically, most human cancers are difficultto establish in tissue culture, making itdifficult to develop in vitro systems for experimental manipulation. Melanomais relatively easy to adapt to tissue cul-ture, which has led to the identification of several tumor-associated antigens,CLINICAL FOCUS Cancer Vaccines Promise Hope for the Future (continued)Numerous observations indicate that activated macro- phages also play a significant role in the immune response totumors. For example, macrophages are often observed tocluster around tumors, and their presence is often correlatedwith tumor regression. Like NK cells, macrophages are notMHC restricted and express Fc receptors, enabling them to bind to antibody on tumor cells and mediate ADCC. Theantitumor activity of activated macrophages is probably me-diated by lytic enzymes and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates.

This would not be the predicted re-sponse, since the exogenous antigensare almost uniformly presented by classII MHC molecules. However, an impres-sive amount of experimental datademonstrates that HSPs isolated and purified from tumor tissue are a potent inducer of tumor-specific CTLs. Theseobservations have led to phase by Antigenics (www.antigenics.com) of HSP/antigen com-plexes as immunogens for kidney cancer as well as melanoma. The mechanism bywhich HSP/antigen complexes bound toCD91are delivered to the class I presen- tation machinery is not well understood,but it is clear that HSP/antigen complex-es, when presented to APCs, result in thevigorous activation of CD 8 +T cells. The promise for cancer vaccines ap- pears very bright. Genomics and pro-teomic methodologies provide noveltools for identifying tumor antigens.Additionally, there is a variety of ap-proaches available to engage the im-mune system to respond to tumor anti-gens.

The advantage of this techniqueis that the hybrid cell has the antigen-presenting capability of a dendritic cellbut also contains the antigens from thepatient's tumor cells. The dendritic cellprocesses these tumor antigens and effi-ciently presents the processed antigen tothe immune system of the patient. A different but equally promising approach to the design of cancer vac-cines comes from observations mademany years ago that tumor cells areimmunogenic\u2014animals injected withkilled tumor cells do not grow tumorswhen challenged with live tissue. Whenthe basis of this protective immuno-genicity was explored, it was found thatheat-shock proteins (HSPs) are criticalin providing protection. Furthermore HSPs were found to carry immunogenic peptides, thus acting as molecular chap- erones. But how do HSP/peptide com-plexes in tumor tissue prime the hostimmune system? Recent data demon-strate that HSPs bind CD 91, a receptor found primarily on APCs such as dendrit- ic cells as well as on macrophages.

IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE THEORY The immune surveillance theory was first conceptualized inthe early 1900s by Paul Ehrlich. He suggested that cancer cellsfrequently arise in the body but are recognized as foreign andeliminated by the immune system. Some 50 years later, LewisThomas suggested that the cell-mediated branch of the im-mune system had evolved to patrol the body and eliminate cancer cells. According to these concepts, tumors arise only ifcancer cells are able to escape immune surveillance, either byreducing their expression of tumor antigens or by an impair- ment in the immune response to these cells. Among the early observations that seemed to support the immune surveillance theory was the increased incidence ofcancer in transplantation patients on immunosuppressivedrugs. Other findings, however, were difficult to reconcilewith this theory. Nude mice, for example, lack a thymus and consequently lack functional T cells. According to the im- mune surveillance theory, these mice should show an in- crease in cancer, instead, nude mice are no more susceptibleto cancer than other mice. Furthermore, although individu- als on immunosuppressive drugs do show an increased inci-dence of cancers of the immune system, other common can-cers (e.g., lung, breast, and colon cancer) are not increased in these individuals, contrary to what the theory predicts. Onepossible explanation for the selective increase in immune-system cancers is that the immunosuppressive agents them-selves may exert a direct carcinogenic effect on immune cells. Experimental data concerning the effect of tumor-cell dosage on the ability of the immune system to respond alsoare incompatible with the immune surveillance theory. Forexample, animals injected with very low or very high doses of tumor cells develop tumors, whereas those injected withintermediate doses do not. The mechanism by which a lowdose of tumor cells \"sneaks through\" is difficult to reconcilewith the immune surveillance theory. Finally, this theory as- sumes that cancer cells and normal cells exhibit qualitativeantigen differences. In fact, as stated earlier, many types oftumors do not express tumor-specific antigens, and any im-mune response that develops must be induced by quantitative differences in antigen expression by normal cells and tumorcells. However, tumors induced by viruses would be expected to express some antigens encoded by the viral genome. These antigens are qualitatively different from those expressed bynormal tissues and would be expected to attract the attentionof the immune system. In fact, there are many examples of spe-cific immune responses to virally induced tumors. Nevertheless, apart from tumors caused by viruses, the basic concept of the immune surveillance theory\u2014that malig-nant tumors arise only if the immune system is somehowimpaired or if the tumor cells lose their immunogenicity,enabling them to escape immune surveillance\u2014at this timeremains unproved. In spite of this, it is clear that an immune response can be generated to tumor cells, and therapeutic ap- proaches aimed at increasing that response may serve as a de-fense against malignant cells. Tumor Evasion of the Immune System Although the immune system clearly can respond to tumor cells, the fact that so many individuals die each year from cancer suggests that the immune response to tumor cells isoften ineffective. This section describes several mechanismsby which tumor cells appear to evade the immune system. Anti-Tumor Antibodies Can Enhance Tumor Growth Following the discovery that antibodies could be produced to tumor-specific antigens, attempts were made to protect ani-mals against tumor growth by active immunization withtumor antigens or by passive immunization with antitumorantibodies. Much to the surprise of the researchers, these im-munizations did not protect against tumor growth; in many cases, they actually enhanced growth of the tumor. The tumor-enhancing ability of immune sera subsequently was studied in cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) reactions invitro.Serum taken from animals with progressive tumor growth was found to block the CML reaction, whereas serum taken from animals with regressing tumors had little or noblocking activity. K. E. and I. Hellstrom extended these find-ings by showing that children with progressive neuroblastomahad high levels of some kind of blocking factor in their seraand that children with regressive neuroblastoma did not havesuch factors. Since these first reports, blocking factors havebeen found to be associated with a number of human tumors. In some cases, antitumor antibody itself acts as a blocking factor. Presumably the antibody binds to tumor-specific anti-gens and masks the antigens from cytotoxic T cells. In manycases, the blocking factors are not antibodies alone but ratherantibodies complexed with tumor antigens. Although theseimmune complexes have been shown to block the CTL re-sponse, the mechanism of this inhibition is not known. Thecomplexes also may inhibit ADCC by binding to Fc receptors on NK cells or macrophages and blocking their activity. Antibodies Can Modulate Tumor Antigens Certain tumor-specific antigens have been observed to dis- appear from the surface of tumor cells in the presence ofserum antibody and then to reappear after the antibody is nolonger present. This phenomen on, called antigenic modula- tion, is readily observed when leukemic T cells mice previously immunized with a leukemic T-cell anti-gen (TL antigen). These mice develop high titers of anti-TLCancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 515antibody, which binds to the TL antigen on the leukemic cells and induces capping, endocytosis, and/or shedding of theantigen-antibody complex. As long as antibody is present,these leukemic T cells fail to display the TL antigen and thuscannot be eliminated. Tumor Cells Frequently Express Low Levels of Class I MHC Molecules Since CD8+CTLs recognize only antigen associated with class I MHC molecules, any alteration in the expression ofclass I MHC molecules on tumor cells may exert a profoundeffect on the CTL-mediated immune response. Malignanttransformation of cells is often associated with a reduction (or even a complete loss) of class I MHC molecules, and anumber of tumors have been shown to express decreased lev-els of class I MHC molecules. The decrease in class I MHC expression can be accompanied by progressive tumor growth, and so the absence of MHC molecules on a tumor is gener-ally an indication of a poor prognosis. As illustrated in Figure22-10, the immune response itself may play a role in selectingtumor cells with decreased class I MHC expression. Tumor Cells May Provide Poor Co-Stimulatory Signals T-cell activation requires an activating signal, triggered by re- cognition of a peptide-MHC molecule complex by the T-cell receptor, and a co-stimulatory signal, triggered by the inter- action of B7 on antigen-presenting cells with CD28 on the T cells. Both signals are needed to induce IL-2 productionand proliferation of T cells. The poor immunogenicity of516 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Class I MHCCTL Killed firstProcessedtumor antigen EscapesTumor cell EscapesKilled laterCTL Moderate class I MHCModerate class I MHC Low I MHCHigh class I MHCCD8 CD8 FIGURE 22-10 Down-regulation of class I MHC expression on tu- mor cells may allow a tumor to escape CTL-mediated recognition.The immune response may play a role in selecting for tumor cells ex-pressing lower levels of class I MHC molecules by preferentially elim-inating those cells expressing high levels of class I molecules. With time, malignant tumor cells may express progressively fewer MHCmolecules and thus escape CTL-mediated destruction.many tumor cells may be due in large part to lack of the co-stimulatory molecules. Without sufficient numbers of antigen-presenting cells in the immediate vicinity of a tumor,the T cells will receive only a partial activating signal, whichmay lead to clonal anergy. Cancer Immunotherapy Although various immune responses can be generated to tumor cells, the response frequently is not sufficient to pre-vent tumor growth. One approach to cancer treatment is to augment or supplement these natural defense mechanisms.Several types of cancer immunotherapy in current use orunder development are described in this concluding section. Manipulation of Co-Stimulatory Signals Can Enhance Immunity Several research groups have demonstrated that tumor im- munity can be enhanced by providing the co-stimulatory sig- nal necessary for activation of CTL precursors (CTL-Ps).When mouse CTL-Ps are incubated with melanoma cells in vitro,antigen recognition occurs, but in the absence of a co- stimulatory signal, the CTL-Ps do not proliferate and differ-entiate into effector CTLs. However, when the melanomacells are transfected with the gene that encodes the B7 ligand, then the CTL-Ps differentiate into effector CTLs. These findings offer the possibility that B7-transfected tumor cells might be used to induce a CTL response in vivo.For instance, when P . Linsley, L. Chen, and their colleagues injected melanoma-bearing mice with B7 +melanoma cells, the melanomas completely regressed in more than 40% ofthe mice. S. T ownsend and J. Allison used a similar approachto vaccinate mice against malignant melanoma. Normal mice were first immunized with irradiated, B7-transfected mela- noma cells and then challenged with unaltered malignantmelanoma cells. The \"vaccine\" was found to protect a highpercentage of the mice (Figure 22-11a). It is hoped that asimilar vaccine might prevent metastasis after surgical re-moval of a primary melanoma in human patients. Because human melanoma antigens are shared by a num- ber of different human tumors, it might be possible to gener-ate a panel of B7-transfected melanoma cell lines that aretyped for tumor-antigen expression and for HLA expression. In this approach, the tumor antigen(s) expressed by a pa- tient's tumor would be determined, and then the patientwould be vaccinated with an irradiated B7-transfected cell line that expresses similar tumor antigen(s). Enhancement of APC Activity Can Modulate Tumor Immunity Mouse dendritic cells cultured in GM-CSF and incubated with tumor fragments, then reinfused into the mice, have been shown to activate both TH cells and CTLs specific forthe tumor antigens. When the mice were subsequently chal- lenged with live tumor cells, they displayed tumor immunity.These experiments have led to a number of approachesaimed at expanding the population of antigen-presentingcells, so that these cells can activa te TH cells or CTLs specific for tumor antigens.Cancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 517 (a) CTL-P CD8 CD28 B7 for cancer im- munotherapy. (a) Tumor cells transfected with the B 7gene express the co-stimulatory B 7molecule, enabling them to provide both acti- vating signal ( 1) and co-stimulatory signal ( 2) to CTL-Ps. As a result of the combined signals, the CTL-Ps differentiate into effector CTLs,which can mediate tumor destruction. In effect, the transfected tu-mor cell acts as an antigen-presenting cell. (b) Transfection of tumorcells with the gene encoding GM-CSF allows the tumor cells to se-crete high levels of GM-CSF. This cytokine will activate dendritic cellsin the vicinity of the tumor, enabling the dendritic cells to present tu-mor antigens to both TH cells and CTL-Ps.One approach that has been tried is to transfect tumor cells with the gene encoding GM-CSF. These engineered tumor cells, when reinfused into the patient, will secrete GM-CSF, enhancing the differentiation and activation of hostantigen-presenting cells, espe cially dendritic cells. As these dendritic cells accumulate around the tumor cells, the GM-CSF secreted by the tumor cells will enhance the presentationof tumor antigens to TH cells and CTLs by the dendritic cells(Figure 22-11b). Another way to expand the dendritic-cell population is to culture dendritic cells from peripheral-blood progenitor cellsin the presence of GM-CSF, TNF- /H9251,and IL-4. These three cytokines induce the generation of large numbers of den-dritic cells. There is some hope that, if these dendritic cellsare pulsed with tumor fragments and then reintroduced intothe patient, they can activate TH and TC cells specific for thetumor antigens. Whether these ho pes are justified will be determined by further investigation. A number of adjuvants, including the attenuated strains bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Corynebacterium parvuum, have been used to boost tumor immunity. These adjuvants activate macrophages, in-creasing their expression of various cytokines, class MHCmolecules, and the B7 co-stimulatory molecule. These acti-vated macrophages are better activators of TH cells, resultingin generalized increases in both humoral and cell-mediatedresponses. Thus far, adjuvants have shown only modest thera- peutic results. Cytokine Therapy Can Augment Immune Responses to Tumors The isolation and cloning of the various cytokine genes has facilitated their large-scale production. A variety of experi-mental and clinical approaches have been developed to userecombinant cytokines, either singly or in combination, to augment the immune response against cancer. Among thecytokines that have been evaluated in cancer immunother-apy Although these trials have producedoccasional encouraging results, many obstacles remain to thesuccessful use of this type of cancer immunotherapy. The most notable obstacle is the complexity of the cytokine network itself. This complexity makes it very difficult to knowprecisely how intervention with a given recombinant cytokinewill affect the production of other cytokines. And since some cytokines act antagonistically, it is possible that interventionwith a recombinant cytokine designed to enhance a particular branch of the immune response may actually lead to suppres-sion. In addition, cytokine immunotherapy is plagued by thedifficulty of administering the cytokines locally. In some cases,systemic administration of high levels of a given cytokine hasbeen shown to lead to serious and even life-threatening con-sequences. Although the results of several experimental andclinical trials of cytokine therapy for cancer are discussedhere, it is important to keep in mind that this therapeutic approach is still in its infancy. INTERFERONS Large quantities of purified recombinant preparations of theinterferons, IFN- /H9251,IFN- /H9252,and IFN- /H9253,are now available, each of which has shown some promise in the treatment ofhuman cancer. T o date, most of the clinical trials have in- volved IFN- /H9251.Daily injections of recombinant IFN- /H9251have been shown to induce partial or complete tumor regressionin some patients with hematologic malignancies such asleukemias, lymphomas, sarcoma, renal cancer, andbreast cancer. Interferon-mediated antitumor activity may involve several mechanisms. All three types of interferon have been shown toincrease class I MHC expression on tumor cells; IFN- /H9253has also been shown to increase class II MHC expression onmacrophages. Given the evidence for decreased levels of classI MHC molecules on malignant tumors, the interferons mayact by restoring MHC expression, thereby increasing CTL ac-tivity against tumors. In addition, the interferons have beenshown to inhibit cell division of both normal and malignantlytransformed cells in vitro. It is possible that some of the anti- tumor effects of the interferons are related to this ability todirectly inhibit tumor-cell proliferation. Finally, IFN- /H9253directly or indirectly increases the activity of TC cells, macrophages,and NK cells, all of which play a role in the immune responseto tumor cells. TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS In some instances, the tumor necrosis factors TNF- /H9251and TNF- /H9252have been shown to exhibit direct antitumor activity, killing some tumor cells and reducing the rate of prolifera-tion of others while sparing normal cells (Figure 22-12). Inthe presence of TNF- /H9251or TNF- hemorrhagic necrosis and /H9251has also been shown to inhibit tumor-induced vascularization (angiogene-sis) by damaging the vascular endothelial cells in the vicinityof a tumor, thereby decreasing the flow of blood and oxygenthat is necessary for progressive tumor growth. IN VITRO-ACTIVATED LAK AND TIL CELLS Animal studies have shown that lymphocytes can be acti- vated against tumor antigens in vitro by culturing them withx-irradiated tumor cells in the presence of IL-2 and addedtumor antigens. These activated lymphocytes mediate moreeffective tumor destruction than untreated lymphocyteswhen they are reinjected into the original tumor-bearing ani-mal. It is difficult, however, to activate in vitro enough lym-phocytes with antitumor specificity to be useful in cancertherapy. While sensitizing lymphocytes to tumor antigens by this method, S. Rosenberg discovered that, in the presence of high518 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Diseaseconcentrations of cloned IL-2 but without the addition of tumor antigens, large numbers of activated lymphoid cellswere generated that could kill fresh tumor cells but not nor- mal cells. He called these cells lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. In one study, for example, Rosenberg found that infusion of LAK cells plus recombinant IL-2 into tumor-bearing animals mediated effective are >90% ac-tivated NK cells. However, small numbers of TCR-bearingcells are present in LAK populations and it is possible that these may also contribute to their tumoricidal activity. Because large numbers of LAK cells can be generated in vitro and because these cells are active against a wide variety of tumors, their effectiveness in human tumor immunother-apy has been evaluated in several clinical trials. In these trials,peripheral-blood lymphocytes were removed from patientswith various advanced metastatic cancers and were activated in vitro to generate LAK cells. In an early study, patients werethen infused with their autologous LAK cells together withIL-2. In this trial, which involved 25 patients, cancer regres-sion was seen in some patients. Subsequently, a more exten-sive trial with 222 patients resulted in complete regression in16 patients. However, a number of undesirable side effects are associated with the high levels of IL-2 required for LAK-cell activity. The most noteworthy is vascular leak syndrome, in which lymphoid cells and plasma emigrate from theperipheral blood into the tissues, leading to shock. Tumors contain lymphocytes that have infiltrated the tu- mor and presumably are taking part in an antitumor response.By taking small biopsy samples of tumors, one can obtain a population of these lymphocytes and expand it in vitro withIL-2. These activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are called TILs. Many TILs have a wide range of antitumor activ- ity and appear to be indistinguishable from LAK cells. How-ever, some TILs cells have specific cytolytic activity against their autologous tumor. These tumor-specific TILs are of in-terest because they have increased antitumor activity and require 100-fold lower levels of IL-2 for their activity than LAK cells do. In one study, TIL populations were expanded invitro from biopsy samples taken from patients with malig- nant melanoma, renal-cell carcinoma, and TILs were reinjectedinto with continuous infusionsof recombinant IL-2.

Notethat, in the presence of TNF- /H9251, the cancer cells stop proliferating, whereas TNF- /H9251has no inhibitory effect on proliferation of the normal cells. [From L. J. Old, 1988, Sci. Am. 258 (5):59. ]melanomas showed partial regression in 29% and 23% of the patients, respectively. Monoclonal Antibodies Are Effective in Treating Some Tumors Monoclonal antibodies have been used in various ways as ex- perimental immunotherapeutic agents for cancer. For exam-ple, anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies have been usedwith some success in treating human B-cell lymphomas and T-cell leukemias. In one remarkable study, R. Levy and his colleagues successfully treated a 64-year-old man with termi- nal B-cell lymphoma. At the time of treatment, the lym-phoma had metastasized to the liver, spleen, bone marrow,and peripheral blood. Because this was a B-cell cancer, themembrane-bound antibody on all the cancerous cells hadthe same idiotype. By the procedure outlined in Figure 22-14,these researchers produced mouse monoclonal antibody spe-cific for the B-lymphoma idiotype. When this mouse mono- clonal anti-idiotype antibody was injected into the patient, itbound specifically to the B-l ymphoma cells, because these cells expressed that particular idiotype. Since B-lymphomacells are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis, the mon- oclonal antibody activated the complement system and lysed the lymphoma cells without harming other cells. After fourinjections with this anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody, thetumors began to shrink, and this patient entered an unusu-ally long period of complete remission. However,this approach requires that a custom monoclonal antibody be raised for each lymphoma patient. This is prohib-itively expensive and cannot be used as a general therapeuticapproach for the thousands of patients diagnosed each yearwith B lymphoma. Recently, Levy and his colleagues have used direct immunization to recruit the immune systems of pa-tients to an attack against their B lymphoma. In a clinical trialwith 41 B-cell lymphoma patients, the genes encoding the re- arranged immunoglobulin genes of the lymphomas of eachpatient were isolated and used to encode the synthesis ofrecombinant immunoglobulin that bore the idiotype typical of the patient's tumor. Each of these Igs was coupled to keyholelimpet hemocyanin (KLH), a mollusk protein that is oftenused as a carrier protein because of its efficient recruitment ofT-cell help. The patients were immunized with their own tumor-specific antigens, the idiotypically unique immuno-globulins produced by their own lymphomas. About 50% of the patients developed anti-idiot ype antibodies against their tumors. Significantly, improved clinical outcomes were seen inthe 20 patients with anti-idiotype responses, but not in theothers. In fact, 2 of these 20 experienced complete remission. Despite its promise, the anti-idiotypic approach is by its very nature patient-specific. A more general monoclonal- antibody therapy for B-cell lymphoma is based on the factthat most B cells, whether normal or cancerous, bear lineage-distinctive antigens. One such determinant, CD20, has beenthe target of intensive efforts; a monoclonal antibody to it,raised in mice and engineered to contain mostly human se- quences, has been useful in the treatment of B-cell lym-phoma (see Clinical Focus, Chapter 5). Aside from CD20, anumber of tumor-associated antigens (Table 22-4) are being tested in clinical trials for their suitability as targets for anti- body-mediated anti-tumor therapy. A variety of tumors express significantly increased levels of growth-factor receptors, which are promising targets foranti-tumor monoclonal antibodies. For example, in 25 to 30 percent of women with metastatic breast cancer, a geneticalteration of the tumor cells results in the increased expres-sion of HER2, an epidermal-growth-factor-like receptor. Ananti-HER2 monoclonal antibody was raised in mice and thegenes encoding it were isolated. Except for the sequencesencoding the antibody's CDRs, the mouse Ig sequences werereplaced with human Ig counterparts. This prevents the gen- eration of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs) and allows the patient to receive repeated doses of the \"human-ized\" anti-HER2 in large amounts (100 milligrams or more).Preparations of this antibody, called Herceptin, are now commercially available for the treatment of HER2-receptor- bearing breast cancers (see Clinical Focus, Chapter 5). Mon-oclonal antibodies also have been used to prepare tumor-520 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Cells transferred0Mean no. of pulmonary sarcoma metastases at day 13None150200 With IL-2250 100 50Without IL-2 LAK cells Cultured spleen cellsFresh spleen cells FIGURE 22-13 Experimental demonstration of tumor-destroying activity of LAK cells plus IL- 2. Spleen cells or LAK cells, in the pres- ence or absence of recombinant IL- 2, were infused into mice with pulmonary sarcoma. The animals were evaluated 13days later for the number of pulmonary sarcoma metastases.

Note that LAK cells caused tumor regression only when IL- 2was also infused. [Data from S. Rosenberg et al., 1988,Ann. Int. Med., 108: 853.]specific anti-tumor agents. In this approach, to tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens are coupled withradioactive isotopes, chemotherapy drugs, or potent toxins of biological origin. In such \"guided missile\" therapies, thetoxic agents are delivered spe cifically to tumor cells. This focuses the toxic effects on the tumor and spares normal tis-sues. Reagents known as immunotoxins have been con- structed by coupling the inhibitor chain of a toxin (e.g., diph-theria toxin) to an antibody against a tumor-specific ortumor-associated antigen (see Figure 4-23). In vitro studieshave demonstrated that these \"magic bullets\" can kill tumorcells without harming normal cells. Immunotoxins specific for tumor antigens in a variety of cancers (e.g., melanoma, col-orectal carcinoma, metastatic breast carcinoma, and variouslymphomas and leukemias) have been evaluated in phase I orphase II clinical trials. In a number of trials, significant num-bers of leukemia and lymphoma patients exhibited partial orcomplete remission. However in a number of cases, the clinical responses in patients with larger tumor masses were disap-pointing. In some of these patients, the sheer size of the tumor may render most of its cells inaccessible to the immunotoxin. SUMMARY Tumor cells differ from normal cells in numerous ways. In particular, changes in the regulation of growth of tumorcells allow them to proliferate indefinitely, then invade the underlying tissue, and eventually metastasize to other tis-sues (see Figure 22-1). Normal cells can be transformed invitro by chemical and physical carcinogens and by trans- forming viruses. Transformed cells exhibit altered growthproperties and are sometimes capable of inducing cancerwhen they are injected into animals. Proto-oncogenes encode proteins involved in control of normal cellular growth. The conversion of proto-oncogenesto oncogenes is one of the key steps in the induction of most human cancer. This conversion may result from mutation inCancer and the Immune System CHAPTER 22 521 Fuse and select for hybridoma 5 3Step an- tibody specific idiotypic determinants on the cancer cells. Because allthe lymphoma cells are derived from a single transformed B cell, they allexpress membrane-bound antibody (Ab- 1) with the same idiotype (i.e., the same antigenic specificity). In the procedure illustrated, monoclonalanti-idiotype antibody (Ab- 2) against the B-lymphoma membrane- bound antibody was produced (steps 1-4). When this anti-idiotype antibody was injected into the patient (step 5), it bound selectively to B-lymphoma cells, which then were susceptible to complement-plus-antibody lysis.an oncogene, its translocation, or its amplification (see proto-oncogenes. In translocated gene may come under the influenceof enhancers or promoters that cause its transcription athigher levels than usual (see Figure 22-5). Tumor cells display tumor-specific antigens and the more common tumor-associated antigens. Among the latter are oncofetal antigens, (see Table 22-3) and increased levels ofnormal oncogene products (see Figure 22-6). In contrast totumor antigens induced by chemicals or radiation, virallyencoded tumor antigens are shared by all tumors induced bythe same virus. The tumor antigens recognized by T cells fall into one offour major categories: antigens encoded by genes withtumor-specific expression; antigens encoded by variantforms of normal genes that have been altered by mutation;certain antigens normally expressed only at certain stages of differentiation or differentiation lineages; antigens thatare overexpressed in particular tumors. The use of a variety of genetic, biochemical, and immuno-logical approaches has allowed the identification of severaltumor-associated antigens (see Table 22-4). In many casesthe antigen is expressed on more than one type of tumor.Common tumor antigens offer hope for the design of better therapies, detection, and monitoring, and haveimportant implications for the possibility of anti-tumorimmunization. The immune response to tumors includes CTL-mediatedlysis, NK-cell activity, macrophage-mediated tumor de-struction, and destruction including TNF- /H9251and TNF- /H9252,help to mediate tumor-cell killing. Tumors may evade the immune responseby modulating their tumor antigens, by reducing their expression of class I MHC molecules, and by antibody- mediated or immune complex-mediated inhibition of CTLactivity. Experimental cancer immunotherapy is exploring a vari-ety of approaches. Some of these are the enhancement ofthe co-stimulatory signal required for T-cell activation (seeFigure 22-11a), genetically engineering tumor cells tosecrete cytokines that may increase the intensity of theimmune response against them (see Figure 22-11b), thetherapeutic use of cytokines (see Figure 22-12), and waysof increasing the activity of antigen-presenting cells. A number of encouraging clinical results have been ob-tained with therapy using monoclonal antibodies againsttumor-associated and (in a few cases) tumor-specific anti-gens (see Figure 22-14).

The expectation is that such strategies will focus the toxic effects of theseagents on the tumor and spare normal cells their deleteri-ous effects. Key elements in the design of strategies for vaccination against cancer are the identification of significant tumorantigens by genetic or biochemical approaches; the devel-opment of strategies for the effective presentation of tu-mor antigens; and the generation of activated populationsof helper or cytotoxic T cells.

Study Questions CLINICAL FOCUS QUESTION You are an oncologist and wish to treat a patient with one of the newly available cancer vaccines, but the only tumor from this patient is preserved in formalde-hyde. Can you still use a vaccine? If so, what type of vaccine is available for your use? If you have a tumor sample containing liv- ing cells, are there other types of vaccines available? 1.Indicate whether each of the following statements is true or false. If you think a statement is false, explain why. a. Hereditary retinoblastoma results from overexpression of a cellular oncogene. b.Translocation of c- myc gene is found in many patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. c. Multiple copies of cellular oncogenes are sometimes observed in cancer cells. d. Viral integration into the cellular genome may convert a proto-oncogene into a transforming oncogene. e. All oncogenic retroviruses carry viral oncogenes. f.The immune response against a virus-induced tumor pro- tects against another tumor induced by the same virus. g.LAK cells are tumor specific.2.You are a clinical immunologist studying acute lymphoblas- tic leukemia (ALL). Leukemic cells from most patients with ALL have the morphology of lymphocytes but do not expresscell-surface markers characteristic of mature B or T cells. Y ou have isolated cells from ALL patients that do not express mem-brane Ig but do react with mo noclonal antibody against a nor- mal pre-B-cell marker (B-200). Y ou therefore suspect that theseleukemic cells are pre-B cells. How would you use genetic analy-sis to confirm that the leukemic cells are committed to the B-celllineage? 3.In a recent experiment, melanoma cells were isolated from patients with early or advanced stages of malignant melanoma.At the same time, T cells specific for tetanus-toxoid antigen were isolated and cloned from each patient. a. When early-stage melanoma cells were cultured together with tetanus-toxoid antigen and the tetanus toxoid- specific T-cell clones, the T-cell clones were observed toproliferate. This proliferation was blocked by addition ofchloroquine or by addition of monoclonal antibody to HLA-DR. Proliferation was not blocked by addition antibody to HLA-A, -B, -DQ, or findings early-stage mela-noma cells in this experimental system? b.When the same experiment was repeated with advanced- stage melanoma cells, the tetanus-toxoid T-cell clonesfailed to proliferate in response to the tetanus-toxoidantigen. What might this indicate about advanced-stagemelanoma cells? c.When early and advanced malignant melanoma cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with pro-cessed tetanus toxoid, only the early-stage melanoma cells could induce proliferation of the tetanus-toxoid-T-cell clones.

In vivo systems, which involve the whole animal, provide the most natural experi-mental conditions. However, in vivo systems have a myriadof unknown and uncontrollable cellular interactions thatadd ambiguity to the interpretation of data. At the otherextreme are in vitro systems, in which defined populations of lymphocytes are studied under controlled and conse-quently repeatable conditions; in vitro systems can be sim-plified to the extent that individual cellular interactions canbe studied effectively. Y et they have their own limitations, themost notable of which is their artificiality. For example, pro-viding antigen to purified B cells in vitro does not stimulate maximal antibody production unless T cells are present.Therefore a study of antibody production in an artificial invitro system that lacks T cells could lead to the incorrect con- clusion that B cells do not synthesize high levels of antibod-ies. One must ask whether a cellular response observed invitro reflects reality or is a product of the unique conditions of the in vitro system itself. This chapter describes some of the experimental systems routinely used to study the immune system. It also covers some recombinant DNA techniques that have revolution-ized the study of the immune system in the past decade or so.Other chapters also cover experimental systems and tech-niques in detail. Table 23-1 lists them and directs the readerto the appropriate location for a description. Experimental Animal Models The study of the immune system in vertebrates requires suit- able animal models. The choice of an animal depends on itssuitability for attaining a particular research goal. If largeamounts of antiserum are sought, a rabbit, goat, sheep, orhorse might be an appropriate experimental animal. If thegoal is development of a protective vaccine, the animal cho-sen must be susceptible to the infectious agent so that theefficacy of the vaccine can be assessed. Mice or rabbits can beused for vaccine development if they are susceptible to thepathogen. But if growth of the infectious agent is limited tohumans and primates, vaccine development may require the use of monkeys, chimpanzees, or baboons. For most basic research in immunology, mice have been the experimental animal of choice. They are easy to handle,are genetically well characterized, and have a rapid breeding cycle. The immune system of the mouse has been character-ized more extensively than that of any other species. Thevalue of basic research in the mouse system is highlighted bythe enormous impact this research has had on clinical inter-vention in human disease. Inbred Strains Can Reduce Experimental Variation To control experimental variation caused by differences in the genetic backgrounds of experimental animals, immu-nologists often work with inbred strains\u2014that is, geneticallyidentical animals produced by inbreeding. The rapid breed-ing cycle of mice makes them particularly well suited for theproduction of inbred strains, which are developed by re-peated inbreeding between brother and sister littermates. Inthis way the heterozygosity of alleles that is normally foundin randomly outbred mice TK ART TK Eloci. Repeated inbreeding for 20 generations usually yields an inbred strain whose progeny are homozygous at more than98% of all loci. More than 150 different inbred strains ofmice are available, each designated by a series of letters and/or numbers (Table 23-2). Most strains can be purchased byimmunologists from such suppliers as the Jackson Labora-tory in Bar Harbor, Maine. Inbred strains have also been pro- duced in rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and domesticfowl. Because inbred strains of animals are genetically identi-cal (syngeneic) within that strain, their immune responses can be studied in the absence of variables introduced by indi-vidual genetic differences\u2014an invaluable property. With inbred strains, lymphocyte subpopulations isolated from oneanimal can be injected into another animal of the same strainwithout eliciting a rejection reaction. This type of experi- mental system permitted immunologists to first demonstratethat lymphocytes from antigen-primed animal could trans-ferimmunity to an unprimed syngeneic recipient.Adoptive-Transfer Systems Permit the in Vivo Examination of Isolated Cell Populations In some experiments, it is important to eliminate the im- mune responsiveness of the syngeneic host so that the re- sponse of only the transferred lymphocytes can be studied inisolation. This can be accomplished by a technique calledadoptive transfer: first, the syngeneic host is exposed to x-rays that kill its lymphocytes; then the donor immune cellsare introduced. Subjecting a mouse to high doses of x-rays(650-750 rads) can kill 99.99% of its lymphocytes, afterwhich the activities of lymphocytes transplanted from thespleen of a syngeneic donor can be studied without inter-ference from host lymphocytes. If the host's hematopoieticcells might influence an adoptiv e-transfer experiment, then higher x-ray levels (900-1000 rads) are used to eliminate theentire hematopoietic system. Mice irradiated with such doseswill die unless reconstituted with bone marrow from a syn- geneic donor. The adoptive-transfer system has enabled immunologists to study the development of injected lymphoid stem cells in various organs of the recipient, and have facilitated the studyof various populations of lymphocytes and of the cellular in-teractions required to generate an immune response. Such ex- periments, for instance, first enabled immunologists to showthat a T helper cell is necessary for B-cell activation in thehumoral response. In these experiments, adoptive transfer of purified B cells or purified T cells did not produce antibody inthe irradiated host. Only when both cell populations weretransferred was antibody produced in response to antigen. SCID Mice and SCID-Human Mice Are a Valuable Animal Model forImmunodeficiency An autosomal recessive mutation resulting in severe com- bined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) developed sponta- neously in a strain of mice called CB-17. These CB-17 SCIDmice fail to develop mature T and B cells and consequentlyare severely compromised immunologically. This defect isdue to a failure in V(D)J recombination. SCID mice must behoused in a sterile (germ-free) environment, because theycannot fight off microorganisms of even low pathogenicity.The absence of functional T and B cells enables these mice toaccept foreign cells and grafts from other strains of mice oreven from other species. Apart from their lack of functional T and B cells, SCID mice appear to be normal in all respects. When normal bone-marrow cells are injected into SCID mice, normal T and B cells develop, and the mice are cured of their immunodeficiency.This finding has made SCID mice a valuable model system forthe study of immunodeficiency and the process of differentia-tion of bone-marrow stem cells into mature T or B cells. Interest in SCID mice mushroomed when it was found that they could be used to study the human immune system.In this system, portions of human fetal liver, adult thymus,526 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease TABLE 23-1Immunological methods described in other chapters Method Location Bone-marrow transplantation Ch. 2Clinical Focus Preparation of immunotoxins Fig. 5-20 and chimeric mouse-human Ch 5Clinical Focus monoclonal antibodies Determination of antibody affinity Fig. 6.2 by equilibrium dialysis Precipitation reactions Fig. 6.4 Immunodiffusion and Figs. 6.5and 6.6 immunoelectrophoresis Hemagglutination Fig. 6.7 Fig. 6.9 ELISA assays Fig. 6.10 ELISPOT assay 6.11 6.13 Immunofluorescence Fig. 6.14 Flow cytometry of 18-5 Production of multivalent Fig. 18-7 subunit vaccines HLA typing Fig. 21-4and adult lymph nodes are implanted into SCID mice (Fig- ure 23-1). Because the mice lack mature T and B cells of theirown, they do not reject the transplanted human tissue. The implanted human fetal liver contains immature lymphocytes(stem cells), which migrate to the implanted human tissues,where they mature into T and B cells, producing a SCID- human mouse. Because the human lymphocytes are exposed to mouse antigens while they are still immature, they later recognize mouse cells as self and do not mount an immuno- logic response against the mouse host.Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 527 TABLE 23-2 Some inbred mouse strains commonly used in immunology Strain Common substrains Characteristics A A/He High incidence of mammary tumors in some substrains A/JA/WySn AKR AKR/J High incidence of leukemia AKR/NAKR/Cum Thy BALB/c radiation BALB/c AnN Used in hybridoma technologyBALB/cBy Many myeloma cell lines were generated in these mice CBA CBA/J Gene ( rd) causing retinal causing retinal degeneration C3H/HeJ High incidence of mammary tumors in many substrains (these carry a C3H/HeN mammary-tumor virus that is passed via maternal milk to offspring) C57BL/6 C57BL/6J High incidence of hepatomas after irradiation C57BL/6By High complement activity C57BL/6N C57BL/10 C57BL/10JV ery close relationship to C 57BL/6but differences in at least two loci C57BL/10ScSn C57BL/10NF requent partner in preparation of congenic mice C57BR C 57BR/cd j High frequency of pituitary and liver tumors Very resistant to x-irradiation C57LC 57L/J Susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) C57L/N frequency of pituitary and reticular cell tumors C58 High incidence of C58/LwN DBA/ 2N to pneumococcal polysaccharide type ( hr) gene, usually in heterozygous state NZB incidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and lupus-like nephritis NZB/N Autoimmune disease similar to systemic lupus erythematosus F 1progeny from crosses with NZW NZW NZW/N SLE-type autoimmune disease in F 1progeny from crosses with NZB P P/J High incidence of leukemia SJL SJL/J High level of aggression and severe fighting to the point of death, especially in males Tendency to develop certain autoimmune diseases, most susceptible to EAE SWR SWR/J Tendency to develop several autoimmune diseases, especially EAE129 129 /J High incidence of spontaneous teratocarcinoma 129/SvJ SOURCE: Adapted from Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, 1979 , Biological Handbooks, Vol. III: Inbred and Genetically Defined Strains of Laboratory Animals.The beauty of the SCID-human mouse is that it enables one to study human lymphocytes within an animal model.This valuable system has proved useful in research on thedevelopment of various lymphoid cells and also as an impor-tant animal model in AIDS research, since mouse lympho-cytes cannot be infected with HIV , whereas the lymphocytesof a SCID-human mouse are readily infected. Cell-Culture Systems The complexity of the cellular interactions that generate an immune response has led immunologists to rely heavily onvarious types of in vitro cell-culture systems. A variety of cellscan be cultured, including primary lymphoid cells, clonedlymphoid cell lines, and hybrid cells. Primary Lymphoid Cell Cultures Primary lymphoid cell cultures can be obtained by isolating lymphocytes directly from blood or lymph or from variouslymphoid organs by tissue disp ersion. The lymphocytes canthen be grown in a chemically defined basal medium (con- taining saline, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, trace elements,and other nutrients) to which various serum supplementsare added. For some experiments, serum-free culture condi-tions are employed. Because in vitro culture techniques re-quire from 10- to 100-fold fewer lymphocytes than do typicalin vivo techniques, they have enabled immunologists toassess the functional properties of minor subpopulations oflymphocytes. It was by means of cell-culture techniques, forexample, that immunologists were first able to define the functional differences between CD4 +T helper cells and CD8+T cytotoxic cells. Cell-culture techniques have also been used to identify numerous cytokines involved in the activation, growth, and differentiation of various cells involved in the immune re-sponse. Early experiments showed that media conditioned,or modified, by the growth of various lymphocytes or antigen-presenting cells would support the growth of other lymphoidcells. Conditioned media contain the secreted products from actively growing cells. Many of the individual cytokines thatcharacterized various conditioned media have subsequently been identified and purified, and in many cases the genes thatencode them have been cloned. These cytokines, which play acentral role in the activation and regulation of the immune response, are described in Chapter 12 and elsewhere. Cloned Lymphoid Cell Lines A primary lymphoid cell culture comprises a heterogeneous group of cells that can be propagated only for a limited time. This heterogeneity can complicate the interpretation of ex-perimental results. T o avoid these problems, immunologistsuse cloned lymphoid cell lines and hybrid cells. Normal mammalian cells generally have a finite life span in culture; that is, after a number of population doublings char-acteristic of the species and cell type, the cells stop dividing. Incontrast, tumor cells or normal cells that have undergone transformation induced by chemical carcinogens or viruses can be propagated indefinitely in tissue culture; thus, they aresaid to be immortal. Such cells are referred to as cell lines. The first cell line\u2014the mouse fibroblast L cell\u2014was de- rived in the 1940s from cultured mouse subcutaneous con- nective tissue by exposing the cultured cells to a chemicalcarcinogen, methylcholanthrene, over a 4-month period. In the 1950s, another important cell line, the HeLa cell, was de-rived by culturing human cervical cancer cells. Since these early studies, hundreds of cell lines have been established, eachconsisting of a population of genet ically identical (syngeneic) cells that can be grown indefinitely in culture. Table 23-3 lists some of the cell lines used in immunologic research and briefly describes their properties. Some were derived from spontaneously occurring tumors of lympho-cytes, macrophages, or other accessory cells involved in the im-mune response. In other cases, the cell line was induced by transformation of normal lymphoid cells with viruses such as Abelson's murine leukemia virus (A-MLV), simian virus 40528 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease SCID mouse Transplant human thymus and lymph-node tissueunder kidney capsule Inject with human fetal liver cells (stem cells) Stem cells migrate tothe human thymus Human thymus releases mature human T cellsinto circulation SCID-human mouse FIGURE 23-1 Production of SCID-human mouse. This system permits study of human lymphocytes within an animal model. In thisexample, human T-cells are transferred to SCID mouse, but B-cellsalso can be transferred by the use of bone-marrow precursors.(SV40), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1(HTLV-1). Lymphoid cell lines differ from primary lymphoid cell cultures in several important ways: They survive indefinitelyin tissue culture, show various abnormal growth properties,and often have an abnormal number of chromosomes. Cellswith more or less than the normal diploid number of chro- mosomes for a species are said to be aneuploid. The bigadvantage of cloned lymphoid cell lines is that they can begrown for extended periods in tissue culture, enabling im- munologists to obtain large numbers of homogeneous cells in culture. Until the late 1970s, immunologists did not succeed in maintaining normal T cells in tissue culture for extendedperiods. In 1978, a serendipitous finding led to the observa-tion that conditioned medium containing a T-cell growthfactor was required. The essential component of the condi-tioned medium turned out to be interleukin 2 (IL-2). By cul-turing normal T lymphocytes with antigen in the presence ofIL-2, clones of antigen-specific T lymphocytes could be iso-lated. These individual clones could be propagated and stud-ied in culture and even frozen for storage. After thawing, theclones continued to grow and express their original antigen-specific functions. Development of cloned lymphoid cell lines has enabled immunologists to study a number of events that previouslycould not be examined. For example, research on the molec- ular events involved in activation of naive lymphocytes byantigen was hampered by the low frequency of naive B and T cells specific for a particular antigen; in a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes, the molecular changes occurringin one responding cell could not be detected against a back-ground of 10 3-106nonresponding cells. Cloned T- and B-cell lines with known antigenic specificity have provided immu-nologists with large homogeneous cell populations in whichto study the events involved in antigen recognition. Similarly, the genetic changes corresponding to different maturationalstages can be studied in cell lines that appear to be \"frozen\" atdifferent stages of differentiation. Cell lines have also beenuseful in studying the soluble factors produced by lymphoidcells. Some cell lines secrete large quantities of various cyto- kines; other lines express membrane receptors for particularcytokines. These cell lines have been used by immunologiststo purify various cytokines and their receptors and eventu- ally to clone their genes. With the advantages of lymphoid cell lines come a number of limitations. Variants arise spontaneously in the course ofprolonged culture, necessitating frequent subcloning to limitthe cellular heterogeneity that can develop. If variants areselected in subcloning, it is possible that two subclones derivedfrom the same parent clone may represent different subpopu-lations. Moreover, any cell line derived from tumor cells ortransformed cells may have unknown genetic contributions characteristic of the tumor or of the transformed state; thus, researchers must be cautious when extrapolating results ob- tained with cell lines to the normal situation in vivo. Neverthe-less, transformed cell lines have made a major contribution tothe study of the immune response, and many molecular eventsdiscovered in experiments with transformed cell lines havebeen shown to take place in normal lymphocytes.

Ran- dom loss of some chromosomes and subsequent cell prolifer-ation yield a clone of cells that contain a single nucleus withchromosomes from each of the fused cells; such a clone is called a hybrid oma. Historically, cell fusion was promoted with Sendai virus, but now it is generally done with polyethylene glycol. Normalantigen-primed B cells can be fused with cancerous plasmacells, called myelo ma cells (Figure 23-2). The hybridoma thus formed continues to express the antibody genes of thenormal B lymphocyte but is capable of unlimited growth, acharacteristic of the myeloma cell. B-cell hybridomas that secrete antibody with a sing le antigenic specificity, called monoclonal antibody, in reference to its derivation from asingle clone, have revolutionized not only immunology butbiomedical research as well as the clinical laboratory. Chapter4 describes the production and uses of monoclonal antibod-ies in detail (see Figures 4-21). T-cell hybridomas can also be obtained by fusing T phocytes with cancerous T-cell lymphomas. Again, the result-ing hybridoma continues to express the genes of the normalT cell but acquires the immortal-growth properties of the can- cerous T lymphoma cell. Immunologists have generated a number of stable hybridoma cell lines representing T-helper and T-cytotoxic lineages. Protein Biochemistry The structures and functions of many important moleculesof the immune system have been determined with the tech-niques of protein biochemistry, and many of these tech-niques are in constant service in experimental immunology.For example, fluorescent and radioactive labels allow immu- nologists to localize and visualize molecular activities, andthe ability to determine such biochemical characteristics of aprotein as its size, shape, and three-dimensional structure hasprovided essential information for understanding the func-tions of immunologically important molecules. Radiolabeling Techniques Allow Sensitive Detection of Antigens or Antibodies Radioactive labels on antigen or antibody are extremely sen- sitive markers for detection and quantification. There are anumber of ways to introduce radioactive isotopes into pro- teins or peptides. For example, tyrosine residues may be labeled with radioiodine by chemical or enzymatic proce-dures. These reactions attach an iodine atom to the phenolring of the tyrosine molecule. One of the enzymatic iodina- tion techniques, which uses lactoperoxidase, can label pro-teins on the plasma membrane of a live cell without labeling proteins in the cytoplasm, allowing the study of cell-surfaceproteins without isolating them from other cell constituents.530 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Polyethylene glycolChromosomes Normal T or B cell (dies after 7-10days in culture)Cancerous T or B cell (grows continuously in culture) HeterokaryonNucleus of cancer cellNucleus of normallymphocyte Random chromosomal loss Hybridoma (expresses some normal B-cell or T-cell genes but grows indefinitely like a cancer cell) B-cell hybridoma T-cell hybridomaMonoclonal antibody Interleukin hybridization. The resulting hybridomas express someof the genes of the original normal B or T cell but also exhibit the immortal-growth properties of the tumor cell. This procedure is usedto produce B-cell hybridomas that secrete monoclonal antibody andT-cell hybridomas that secrete various growth factors.A general radiolabeling of cell proteins may be carried out by growing the cells in a medium that contains one or more radiolabeled amino acids. The amino acids selected for this application are those most resistant to metabolic modificationduring cell growth so that the radioactive label will appear inthe cell protein rather than in all cell constituents. Leucinemarked with 14C or 3H, and cysteine or methionine labeled with 35S, are the most commonly used amino acids for meta- bolic labeling of proteins. Table 23-4 lists some properties ofthe radioisotopes used in immunologic research. Biotin Labels Facilitate Detection of Small Amounts of Proteins In some instances direct labeling of proteins, especially with enzymes or other large molecules, as described in Chapter 6,may cause denaturation and loss of activity. A convenient la- beling system has been developed which may be used in con-junction with the ELISA and ELISPOT assays described inChapter 6. This labeling technique exploits the high affinity ofthe reaction between the vitamin biotin and avidin, a largemolecule that may be labeled with radioactive isotopes, withfluorescent molecules, or with enzymes. Biotin is a smallmolecule (mol. wt. 244) that can be coupled to an antibody (or to any protein molecule) by a gentle chemical reaction that causes no loss of antibody activity. After the biotin-coupledantibody has reacted in the assay system, the labeled avidin isintroduced and binding is measured by detecting the label onthe avidin molecule (Figure 23-3). The reaction between bio-tin and avidin is highly specific and of such high affinity thatthe bond between the two molecules under most assay condi-tions is virtually irreversible. Gel Electrophoresis Separates Proteins by Size and Charge When subjected to an electric field in an electrophoresis chamber, a charged molecule will move toward the oppo- sitely charged electrode. The rate at which a charged mole-cule moves in a stable field (its electrophoretic mobility)depends upon two factors specific to the molecule: one is thesign and magnitude of its net electrical charge, and the otheris its size and shape. All other factors being equal, if mole-cules are of equal size the one with higher net charge willmove faster in an applied electrical field due to the molecularseiving properties of the solid medium. It also follows thatsmall molecules will move faster than large ones of the samenet charge. Although there are exceptions in which the shapeof a molecule may increase or decrease its frictional drag andcause atypical migration behavior, these general principlesunderlie all electrophoretic separations. Most electrophoretic separations are not conducted in free solution but rather in a stable supporting medium, suchas a gel. The most popular in reseach laboratories is a poly-merized and crosslinked form of acrylamide. Separation onpolyacrylamide gels, commonly referred to as polyacrylamideExperimental Systems CHAPTER 23 531 TABLE 23-4Radioisotopes commonly yrs /H9252 - * /H9253(gamma) radiation may be detected in a solid scintillation counter. /H9252(beta) radiation is detected in a liquid scintillation counter by its ability to convert energy to photons of light in a solution containing phosphorescentcompounds.

An antibody prepara- tion is mixed with a biotin ester, which reacts with the antibody. The biotin-labeled antibody can be used to detect antigens on a solid sub-strate such as the well of a microtiter plate. After washing away unboundantibody, the bound antibody can be detected with labeled avidin. The avidin can be radioactively labeled or linked to an enzyme that catalyzesa color reaction, as in ELISA procedures (see Figure 6-10).gel electrophoresis (PAGE), may be used for analysis of pro- teins or nucleic acids (Figure 23-4a). In one common application, the electrophoresis of pro- teins through a polyacrylamide gel is carried out in the pres- ence of the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Thismethod, known as SDS-PAGE, provides a relatively simpleand highly effective means of separating mixtures of proteinson the basis of size. SDS is a negatively charged detergent thatbinds to protein in amounts proportional to the length of theprotein. This binding destroys the characteristic tertiary andsecondary structure of the protein, transforming it into anegatively charged rod. A protein binds so many negativelycharged SDS molecules that its own intrinsic charge becomes insignificant by comparison with the net charge of the SDSmolecules. Therefore, treatment of a mixture of proteins withSDS transforms them into a collection of rods whose electriccharges are proportional to their molecular weights. This has two extremely useful consequences. First, it is possible to sep-arate the components of a mixture of proteins according to molecular weight. Second, because the electrophoretic mobil-ity,or distance traveled by a species during SDS-PAGE, is in- versely proportional to the logarithm of its molecular weight, that distance is a measure of its molecular weight. The gel isstained with a dye that reacts with protein to visualize thelocations of the proteins. The migration distance of a proteinin question is then compared with a plot of the distancesmigrated by a set of standard proteins (Figure 23-4b). Another electrophoretic technique, isoelectric focusing (IEF), separates proteins solely on the basis of their charge.This method is based on the fact that a molecule will move inan electric field as long as it has a net positive or negativecharge; molecules that bear equal numbers of positive and negative charges and therefore have a net charge of zero willnot move. At most pH values, proteins (which characteristi-cally bear a number of both positive and negative charges)have either a net negative or a net positive charge.

(a) A standard PAGE apparatus with cathode at the top and anode at the bottom. Samples are loadedon the top of the gel in sample wells and electrophoresis is accom-plished by running a current from the cathode to the anode. (b) Theelectrophoretic mobility, or distance traveled by a species during SDS-PAGE, is inversely proportional to the log of its molecular weight. Themolecular weight of a protein is readily determined by the log of its migration distance with a standard curve that plots the migration dis-tances of the set of standard proteins against the logs of their molecu-lar weights. (c) Isoelectric focusing, or IEF, separates proteins solely bycharge. Proteins are placed on a stable pH gradient and subjected toelectrophoresis. Each protein migrates to its isoelectric point, the pointat which its net charge is zero. [Part (b) after K. Weber and M. Osborn, 1975, The Proteins, 3rd ed., vol. 1, p. 179. Academic Press.]for each protein there is a particular pH, called its isoelectric point (pI), at which that protein has equal numbers of posi-tive and negative charges. Isoelectric focusing makes use of agel containing substances, called carrier ampholytes, that ar-range themselves into a continuous pH gradient when sub- jected to an electric field. When a mixture of proteins is ap-plied to such a gel and subjected to electrophoresis, eachprotein moves until it reaches that point in the gradientwhere the pH of the gel is equal to its isoelectric point. It then stops moving because it has a net charge of zero. Isoelectricfocusing is an extremely gentle and effective way of separat-ing different proteins (Figure 23-4c). A method known as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D gel electrophoresis) combines the advantages of SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing in one of the most sensitive and discriminating ways of analyzing a mixture of proteins.In this method, one first subjects the mixture to isoelectric focusing on an IEF tube gel, which separates the moleculeson the basis of their isoelectric points without regard to mol-ecular weight. This is the first dimension. In the next step,one places the IEF gel lengthwise across the top of an SDS-polyacrylamide slab (that is, in place of the sample wells inFigure 23-4a) and runs SDS-PAGE. Preparatory to this step,all proteins have been reacted with SDS and therefore mi-grate out of the IEF gel and through the SDS-PAGE slab ac- cording to their molecular weights. This is the second dimen- sion. The position of the proteins in the resulting 2D gel canbe visualized in a number of ways. In the least sensitive the gel is stained with a protein-binding dye (such as Coomassieblue). If the proteins have been radiolabeled, the more sensi-tive method of autoradiography can be used. Alternatively,silver staining is a method of great sensitivity that takes ad- vantage of the capacity of proteins to reduce silver ions to aneasily visualized deposit of metallic silver. Finally, immuno-blotting\u2014blottin g of proteins onto a membrane and detec- tion with antibody (see Figure 6-13)\u2014can be used as a way oflocating the position of specific proteins on 2D gels if an ap-propriate antibody is available. Figure 23-5 shows an autora-diograph of a two-dimensional gel of labeled proteins frommurine thymocytes. X-Ray Crystallography Provides Structural Information A great deal of information about the structure of cells, parts of cells, and even molecules has been obtained by light micro-scopy.The microscope uses a lens to focus radiation to form an image after it has passed through a specimen. However, apractical limitation of light microscopy is the limit of resolu-tion. Radiation of a given wavelength cannot resolve struc-tural features less than about 1/2 its wavelength. Since theshortest wavelength of visible light is around 400 nm, eventhe very best light microscopes have a theoretical limit of res-olution of no less than 200 nm. Because of the much shorter wavelength (0.004 nm) of the electron at the voltages normally used in the electronmicroscope, the theoretical limit of resolution of the electron microscope is about 0.002 nm. If it were possible to build aninstrument that could actually approach this limit, the elec-tron microscope could readily be used to determine the detailed atomic arrangement of biological molecules, sincethe constituent atoms are separated by distances of 0.1 nm to0.2 nm. In practice, aberrations inherent in the operation ofthe magnetic lenses that are used to image the electron beamlimit the resolution to about 0.1 nm (1\u00c5). This practical limitcan be reached in the examination of certain specimens, par-ticularly metals. Other considerations, however, such as specimen preparation and contrast, limit the resolution forbiological materials to about 2 nm (20 \u00c5). T o determine thearrangement of a molecule's atoms, then, we must turn to x-rays, a form of electromagnetic radiation that is readilygenerated in wavelengths on the order of size of interatomicdistances. Even though there are no microscopes with lensesthat can focus x-rays into images, x-ray crystallography canreveal molecular structure at an extraordinary level of detail. X-ray crystallography is based on the analysis of the diffrac- tion pattern produced by the scattering of an x-ray beam as itpasses though a crystal. The degree to which a particular atomscatters x-rays depends upon its size. Atoms such as carbon,oxygen, or nitrogen, scatter x-rays more than do hydrogen atoms, and larger atoms, such as iron, iodide, or mercury giveintense scattering. X-rays are a form of electromagnetic waves;Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 533 Acidic Basic FIGURE 23-5 Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total cell proteins from murine thymocytes. These proteinswere first subjected to isoelectric focusing (direction of migration indi-cated by red arrow) and then the focused proteins were separated bySDS-PAGE (direction of migration indicated by blue arrow). The gelwas exposed to x-ray film to detect the labeled proteins. [Courtesy of B. A. Osborne.]as the scattered waves overlap, they alternately interfere with and reinforce each other. An appropriately placed detectorrecords a pattern of spots (the diffraction pattern) whose dis- tribution and intensities are determined by the structure of the diffracting crystal. This relationship between crystal structureand diffraction pattern is the basis of x-ray crystallographicanalysis. Here is an overview of the procedures used: OBTAIN CRYSTALS OF THE PROTEIN OF INTEREST. To those who have not experienced the frustrations of crystallizing proteins,this may seem a trivial and incidental step of an otherwisehighly sophisticated process. It is not. There is great variationfrom protein to protein in the conditions required to producecrystals that are of a size and geometrical formation appro-priate for x-ray diffraction analysis. For example, myoglobinformed crystals over the course of several days at pH 7 in a 3M solution of ammonium sulfate, but 1.5 M ammonium sulfate at pH 4 worked well for a human IgG1. There is no setformula that can be applied, and those who are consistentlysuccessful are persistent, determined, and, like great chefs,have a knack for making just the right \"sauce.\" SELECTION AND MOUNTING. Crystal specimens must be at least 0.1 mm in the smallest dimension and rarely exceed a fewmillimeters in any dimension. Once chosen, a crystal is har-vested into a capillary tube along with the solution from which the crystal was grown (the \"mother liquor\"). This keeps the crys-tal from drying and maintains its solvent content, an importantconsideration for maintaining the internal order of the speci- men. The capillary is then mounted in the diffraction apparatus. GENERATING AND RECORDING A DIFFRACTION PATTERN. The precisely positioned crystal is then irradiated with x-rays ofa known wavelength produced by accelerating electrons againstthe copper target of an x-ray tube. When the x-ray beam strikesthe crystal, some of it goes straight through and some is scat-tered; sensitive detectors record the position and intensity of the scattered beam as a pattern of spots (Figure 23-6a,b). INTERPRETING THE DIFFRACTION PATTERN. The core of diffraction analysis is the mathematical deduction of thedetailed structure that would produce the diffraction patternobserved. One must calculate to what extent the waves scat-tered by each atom have combined to reinforce or cancel each other to produce the net intensity observed for each spot inthe array. A difficulty arises in the interpretation of complexdiffraction patterns because the waves differ with respect tophase, the timing of the period between maxima and min-ima. Since the pattern observed is the net result of the inter-action of many waves, information about phase is critical tocalculating the distribution of electron densities that is re-sponsible. The solution of this \"phase problem\" looms as amajor obstacle to the derivation of a high-resolution struc-ture of any complex molecule. The problem is solved by derivatizing the protein\u2014mod- ifying it by adding heavy atoms, such as mercury, and thenobtaining crystals that have the same geometry as (are iso-534 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease X-ray source X-ray beam Crystal Detector (e.g., film)Diffracted beams(a) (b) Tyr 100H Gly 97 Gly 96 Asp Tyr 102Tyr 100I 100J (a) Schematic diagram of an x-ray crystallographic experiment in which an x-ray beam bombardsthe crystal and diffracted rays are detected.

The dif- fraction pattern of the isomorphous crystal is obtained andcompared with that of the native protein. Usually, armed with a knowledge of the diffraction patterns of two or more isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives, the phases for the na-tive protein can be calculated by reference to the characteris-tic diffraction patterns generated by heavy-atom landmarks.The phases established, it is possible to move on to a calcula-tion of the distribution of electron density. This is accom-plished by Fourier synthesis, a mathematical treatment par-ticularly suited to the analysis of periodic phenomena such asthose involving waves. In this case, it is used to compute thedistribution of electron density along the x, y, and z axes within a unit cell of the crystal. The deduced electron density can then be visualized on a computer (Figure 23-6c). DERIV ATION OF THE STRUCTURE. The resolution of a model depends upon a number of factors. First of all, theultimate resolution possible is set by the quality of the crystaland the internal order of the crystal. Even the highest-qualitycrystals have a degree of internal disorder that establishes alimit of resolution of about 2 \u00c5. Second, a factor of para-mount importance is the number of intensities fed into theFourier synthesis. A relatively small number of spots may produce a low-resolution (6 \u00c5) image that traces the courseof the polypeptide chain but provides little additional struc-tural information. On the other hand, the processing of dataprovided by tens of thousands of spots allows the tracing ofvery detailed electron-density maps. Provided one knows the amino-acid sequence of the protein, such maps can guide theconstruction of high-resolution, three-dimensional models. Amino-acid sequence data is necessary because it can be dif- ficult, and in some cases impossible, to unambiguously dis-tinguish among some amino-acid side chains on even themost detailed electron-density maps. Since 1960, when the first detailed structures of proteins were deduced, the structures of many thousands of proteins have been solved. These range from small and (relatively) sim-pleproteins such as lysozyme, consisting of a single polypep- tide chain, to poliovirus, an 8,500,000 dalton, stunninglycomplex nucleoprotein made up of RNA encased by multiple copies of four different polypeptide subunits. Of particular importance to immunologists are the large number of immu-nologically relevant molecules for which detailed crystal struc-tures are now available. These include many immunoglob-ulins, most of the major and minor proteins involved in theMHC and T-cell-receptor complexes, and many other impor-tant immunological macromolecules, with new structures andstructural variants appearing every month. Recombinant DNA Technology The various techniques called recombinant DNA technologyhave had an impact on every area of immunologic research.Genes can be cloned, DNA can be sequenced, and recombi-nant proteins can be produced, supplying immunologists withdefined components for study of the structure and function of the immune system at the molecular level. This section brieflydescribes some of the recombinant DNA techniques com-monly employed in immunologic research; examples of theiruse have been presented throughout the book. Restriction Enzymes Cleave DNA at Precise Sequences A variety of bacteria produce enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, that degrade foreign DNA (e.g., bacteriophage DNA) but spare the bacterial-cell DNA, which containsmethylated residues. The discovery of these bacterial enzymesin the 1970s opened the way to a major technological ad-vance in the field of molecular biology. Before the discoveryof restriction endonucleases, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)could be cut only with DNases. These enzymes do not recog- nize defined sites and therefore randomly cleave DNA into avariable series of small fragments, which are impossible to sortby size or sequence. In contrast, restriction endonucleases rec- ognize and cleave DNA at specific sites, called restriction sites,which are short double-stranded segments of specific se-quence containing four to eight nucleotides (Table 23-5).Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 535 TABLE 23-5Some restriction enzymes and their recognition sequences Sequence* 5/H11032n3/H11032 Microorganism source Abbreviation 3/H11032n5/H11032 Bacillus amyloliquefaciens H Bam HI G G A T C C C C T A G G Escherichia coli RY13 EcoRI G A A T T C C T T A A G Haemophilus aegyptius Hae III G G C C C C G G Haemophilus influenzae Rd HindIII A A G C T T T T C G A A Haemophilus parainfluenzae Hpa IG T T A A C C A A T T G Nocardia otitidis-caviarum Not IG C GGCCGC C GCCGGCG Providencia stuartii 164 PstIG T G C A G G A C G T C Staphylococcus aureus 3A Sau3AG A T C CT A G *Blue lines indicate locations of single-strand cuts within the restriction site. Enzymes that make off-center cuts produce fragments with short single-stranded extensions at their ends. SOURCE: New England Biolabs, http://www.neb.com.A restriction endonuclease cuts both DNA strands at a spe- cific point within its restriction site. Some enzymes, such asHpaI, cut on the central axis and thus generate blunt-ended fragments. Other enzymes, such as EcoRI, cut the DNA at staggered points in the recognition site. In this case, the end ofeach cleaved fragment is a short segment of single-strandedDNA, called a sticky end. When two different DNA molecules are cut with the same restriction enzyme that makes staggeredcuts, the sticky ends of the fragments are complementary;under appropriate conditions, fragments from the two mole-cules can be joined by base pairing to generate a recombinantDNA molecule. Several hundred different restriction endonu-cleases have been isolated and many are available commer-cially, allowing researchers to purchase enzymes that cut DNAat defined restriction sites. Cloning of DNA Sequences The development of DNA-cloning technology in the 1970sprovided a means of amplifying a given DNA fragment tosuch an extent that unlimited amounts of identical DNA frag-ments (cloned DNA) could be produced. Cloning Vectors Are Useful to Replicate Defined Sequences of DNA In DNA cloning, a given DNA fragment is inserted into an autonomously replicating DNA molecule, called a cloningvector, so that the inserted DNA is replicated with the vector. A number of different viruses have been used as vectors,including bacterial viruses, insect viruses, and mammalianretroviruses. A common bacterial virus used as a vector is bacteriophage /H9261.Ifa gene is inserted into bacteriophage /H9261 and the resulting recombinant /H9261phage is used to infect E. coli, the inserted gene will be expressed by the bacteria. Retroviruses, which can infect virtually any type of mam- malian cell, are a common vector used to clone DNA inmammalian cells. Retroviruses are RNA viruses that containreverse transcriptase, an enzyme that catalyzes conversion of the viral RNA genome into DNA. The viral DNA then inte-grates into the host chromosomal DNA, where it is retained as a provirus, replicating along with the host chromosomalDNA at each cell division. When a retrovirus is used as a vec-tor in research, most of the retroviral genes are removed so that the vector cannot produce viral particles; the retroviralgenes that are left include a strong promoter region, locatedat the 5 /H11032end of the viral genome, in a sequence called the long terminal repeat (LTR). If a gene is inserted into such a retro- viral vector and the vector is then used to infect mammalian cells, expression of the gene will be under the control of the retroviral pro moter region. Plasmids are another common type of cloning vector. A plasmid is a small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA mole-cule that can replicate independently in a host cell; the mostcommon host used in DNA cloning is E. coli. In gene ral, the DNA to be cloned is inserted into a plasmid that contains anantibiotic-resistance gene. After the recombinant plasmid is incubated with bacterial cells, the cells containing the recom-binant plasmid can be selected by their ability to grow in thepresence of the antibiotic. Another type of vector that is often used for cloning is called a cosmid vector. This type of vector is a plasmid thathas been genetically engineered to contain the COS sites of/H9261-phage DNA, a drug-resistance gene, and a replication ori- gin. COS sites are DNA sequences that allow any DNA up to 50 kb in length to be packaged into the /H9261-phage head. Cloning of cDNA and Genomic DNA Allows the Isolation of Defined Sequences Messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from cells can be tran- scribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with the enzymereverse transcriptase. The cDNA can be cloned by inserting it into a plasmid vector carrying a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic, such as ampicillin. The resulting recombi- nant plasmid DNA is subsequently transferred into specially treated E. coli cells by one of several techniques; the transfer process is called transfection. Ifthe foreign DNA is incor- porated into the host cell and expressed, the cell is said to be transformed. When the cells are cultured on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformed cells containing the ampicillin-resistance gene will survive and grow (Figure 23-7).A collection of DNA sequences within plasmid vectors repre-senting all the mRNA sequences derived from a cell or tissue iscalled a cDNA library. A cDNA library differs from a genomic library (see Figure 23-8) by virtue of the fact that it containsonly the sequences derived from mRNA, the sequences cloning of the entire genome of an ani- mal, requires specialized vectors. E. coli plasmid vectors are impractical for cloning of all the genomic DNA fragmentsthat constitute a large genome because of the low efficiency ofE. coli transformation and the small number of transformed colonies that can be detected on a typical petri dish. Instead, cloning vectors derived from bacteriophage /H9261are used to clone genomic DNA fragments obtained by chromo-somal DNA with restriction enzymes (Figure 23-8). Bacterio-phage /H9261DNA is 48.5 kb long and contains a central section of about 15 kb that is not necessary for /H9261repli cation in E. coli and can therefore be replaced with foreign genomic DNA. Aslong as the recombinant DNA does not exceed the length ofthe original /H9261-phage DNA by more than 5%, it can be pack- aged into the /H9261-phage head and propagated in E. coli. This means that somewhat more than 1.5 /H1100310 4base pairs can be cloned in one particle of /H9261phage. A collection of /H9261clones that includes all the DNA sequences of a given species is called a genomic library. It has been calculated that about 1 million different recombinant /H9261-phage particles would be needed to form a genomic DNA library representing an entire mam-malian genome, which contains about 3 /H1100310 9base pairs. Often the 20-25 kb stretch of DNA that can be cloned in bacteriophage /H9261is not long enough to include the regulatory536 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseExperimental Systems CHAPTER 23 537 Plasmid vectorDNA fragment to be clonedAmpicillin-resistance gene Enzymatically insert DNA into plasmid vector Recombinant plasmid Mix E. coli cells with plasmids in presence of CaCl2 Culture on nutrient agarplates containing ampicillinBacterial chromosome Transformed E. coli cell survivesCells that do not take up plasmid die on ampicillin plates Independent plasmid replication Cell multiplication Colony of cells each containing copies of the same recombinant plasmid+Human DNA (~3 \u00d7 109 bp) Recombinant DNA Package into headAnneal and ligateCut with Bam HIReplaceable region Partially digest withSau3A49 kbBacteriophage DNA 20 kb fragment with sticky ends vector arms with sticky ends FIGURE 23-7 cDNA cloning using a plasmid vector.

Afteraddition of a poly-C tail to the 3/H11032ends of the cDNA and of a comple- mentary poly-G tail to the 3/H11032ends of the cut plasmid, the two DNAs are mixed, annealed, and joined by DNA ligase, forming the recom-binant plasmid. Uptake of the recombinant plasmid into E. coli cells is stimulated by high concentrations of CaCl 2. Transformation occurs with a low frequency, but the transformed cells can be selected in thepresence of ampicillin. [Adapted from H. Lodish et al., 1995, Molecu- lar Cell Biology, 3rd ed.

As noted already, larger genomic DNAfragments\u2014between 30 and 50 kb in length\u2014can be cloned ina cosmid vector. A recombinant cosmid vector, although not afully functional bacteriophage, can infect E. coli and replicate as a plasmid, generating a cosmid library. Recently, a larger E. coli virus, called bacteriophage P1, has been used to pack- age DNA fragments up to 100 kb long. Even larger DNA frag- ments, greater than a megabase (1000 kb) in length, can becloned in yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), which are lin-ear DNA segments that can replicate in yeast cells (Table 23-6).The BAC, or bacterial artifical chromosome, is another usefulvector. BACs can accept pieces of DNA up to 100-300 kb in length. Although YACs accept larger inserts of foreign DNA,BACs are much easier to propagate and are the vector of choice for many large-scale cloning efforts. Selection of DNA Clones Once a cDNA or genomic DNA library has been prepared, itcan be screened to identify a particular DNA fragment by atechnique called in situ hybridization. The cloned bacterial colonies, yeast colonies, or phage plaques containing the re- combinant DNA are transferred onto nitrocellulose or nylon filters by replica plating (Figure 23-9). The filter is thentreated with NaOH, which both lyses the bacteria and dena- tures the DNA, allowing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tobind to the filter. The filter with bound DNA is then incu-bated with a radioactive prob e specific for the gene of inter- est. The probe will hybridize with DNA in the colonies orplaques on the filter that contain the sought-after gene, andthey can be identified by autoradiography. The position ofthe positive colonies or plaques on the filter shows where thecorresponding clones can be found on the original agar plate. Various radioactive probes can be used to screen a library. In some cases, radiolabeled mRNA or cDNA serves as the probe. If the protein encoded by the gene of interest has beenpurified and partly sequenced, it is possible to work backwardfrom the amino-acid sequence to determine the probable nu-cleotide sequence of the corresponding gene. A known se-quence of five or six amino-acid residues is all that is neededto synthesize radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes with which to screen a cDNA or genomic library for a particular gene. T o cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code, peptide seg- ments containing amino acids encoded by a limited numberof codons are usually chosen.

A nitrocellulose or nylonfilter is placed against the plate to pick up the bacterial colonies orphage plaques containing the cloned genes. After the filter is placedin a NaOH solution and heated, the denatured ssDNA becomes fixed to the filter. A radioactive probe specific for the gene of interestis incubated with the filter. The position of the colonies or plaquescontaining the desired gene is revealed by autoradiography.all possible codons for the peptide are then synthesized and used as probes to screen the DNA library. Southern Blotting Detects DNA of a Given Sequence DNA fragments generated by restriction-endonuclease cleav- age can be separated on the basis of length by agarose gel electrophoresis. The shorter a fragment is, the faster it movesin the gel. An elegant technique developed by E. M. Southerncan be used to identify any band containing fragments with agiven gene sequence (Figure 23-10). In this technique, called Southern blotting, DNA is cut with restriction enzymes and the fragments are separated according to size by electro-phoresis on an agarose gel. Then the gel is soaked in NaOH todenature the dsDNA, and the resulting ssDNA fragments aretransferred onto a nitrocellulose or nylon filter by capillary action. After transfer, the filter is incubated with an appropri-ate radiolabeled probe specific for the gene of interest. Theprobe hybridizes with the ssDNA fragment containing thegene of interest, and the position of the band containingthese hybridized fragments is determined by autoradiogra-phy. Southern-blot analysis played a critical role in unravel-ing the mechanism by which diversity of antibodies and T-cell receptors is generated (see Figures 5-2 and 9-2). Northern Blotting Detects mRNA Northern blotting (named for its similarity to Southern blotting) is used to detect the presence of specific mRNAmolecules. In this procedure the mRNA is first denatured toensure that it is in an unfolded, linear form. The mRNA mol- ecules are then separated according to size by electrophoresisand transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, to which the mRNAswill adhere. The filter is then incubated with a labeled DNA probe and subjected to autoradiography. Northern-blot analy-sisis often used to determine how much of a specific mRNA is expressed in cells under different conditions. Increased lev-els of mRNA will bind proportionally more of the labeledDNA probe. Polymerase Chain Reaction Amplifies Small Quantities of DNA The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tech- nique for amplifying specific DNA sequences even when theyare present at extremely low levels in a complex mixture (Fig-ure 23-11). The procedure requires that the DNA sequencesthat flank the desired DNA sequence be known, so that shortoligonucleotide primers can be synthesized. The DNA mix-ture is denatured into single strands by a brief heat treat-ment. The DNA is then cooled in the presence of an excess ofthe oligonucleotide primers, which hybridize with the comple-mentary ssDNA. A polymerase isthen added, together with the four deoxyribonucleotide tri-phosphates, and each strand is copied. The newly synthesized DNA duplex is separated by heating and the cycle is repeated.In each cycle there is a doubling of the desired DNA se- quence; in only 25 cycles the desired DNA sequence can beamplified about a million-fold. The DNA amplified by the PCR can be further character- ized by Southern blotting, restriction-enzyme mapping, andExperimental Systems CHAPTER 23 539 Gel electrophoresisHybridizewith labeledDNA RNAprobeDNA Cleave with restriction to GelFilter fragments DNA fragmentsDNA of interest FIGURE 23-10 The Southern-blot technique for detecting specific sequences in DNA fragments. The DNA fragments produced by restriction-enzyme cleavage are separated by size by agarose gel elec-trophoresis. The agarose gel is overlaid with a nitrocellulose or nylon filter and a thick stack of paper towels. The gel is then placed in an al-kaline salt solution, which denatures the DNA. As the paper towelssoak up the moisture, the solution is drawn through the gel into the fil- ter, transferring each ssDNA band to the filter. This process is calledblotting. After heating, the filter is incubated with a radiolabeled probespecific for the sequence of interest; DNA fragments that hybridize withthe probe are detected by autoradiography. [Adapted from J. Darnell et al., 1990,Molecular Cell Biology, 2nd ed., Scientific American Books.]direct DNA sequencing. The PCR technique has enabled im- munologists to amplify genes encoding proteins that are important in the immune response, such as MHC molecules,the T-cell receptor, and immunoglobulins. Analysis of DNA Regulatory Sequences The transcriptional activity of genes is regulated by promoter and enhancer sequences. These sequences are cis-acting, mean- ing that they re gulate only genes on the same DNA molecule. The promoter sequence lies upstream from the gene it regu-lates and includes a TATA box, where the general transcrip-tion machinery, including RNA polymerase II, binds and begins transcription. The enhancer sequence confers a highrate of transcription on the promoter. Unlike the promoter, which always lies upstream from the gene it controls, theenhancer element can be located anywhere with respect tothe gene (5 /H11032of the promoter, 3 /H11032of the gene, or even in an in- tron of the gene). The activity of enhancer and promoter sequences is con- trolled by transcription factors, which are DNA-binding pro- teins. These proteins bind to specific nucleotide sequences within promoters and enhancers and act either to enhance or suppress their activity. Enhancer and promoter sequencesand their respective DNA-binding proteins have been identi-fied by a variety of techniques, including DNA footprinting,gel-shift analysis, and the CAT assay.540 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Region to be amplified Primer 1 Primer 1 and 2 Heat to 95 \u00b0 to melt strands Cool to 60 \u00b0 to anneal primers Heat to 95 \u00b0 to melt strandsAdd dNTPs and Taq polymerase to extend primers Cool to 60 \u00b0 to anneal primersCycle 1 Cycle 2Add dNTPs and Taq polymerase to extend primers Repeat annealing and extension steps After multiple cycles, desired region is amplified: FIGURE 23-11 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA is de- natured into single strands by a brief heat treatment and is thencooled in the presence of an excess of oligonucleotide primers com-plementary to the DNA sequences flanking the desired DNA seg-ment. A heat-resistant DNA polymerase is used to copy the DNAfrom the 3/H11032ends of the primers. Because all of the reaction compo- nents are heat stable, the heating and cooling cycle can be repeatedmany times, resulting in alternate DNA melting and synthesis, andrapid amplification of a given sequence. [Adapted from H. Lodish et al., 1995,Molecular Cell Biology, 3rd ed., Scientific American Books.]DNA Footprinting Identifies the Sites Where Proteins Bind DNA The binding sites for DNA-binding proteins on enhancers and promoters can be identified by a technique called DNAfootprinting (Figure 23-12a). In this technique, a cloned DNAfragment containing a putative enhancer or promoter se-quence is first radiolabeled at the 5 /H11032end with 32P. The labeled DNA is then divided into two fractions: one fraction is in-cubated with a nuclear extract containing a DNA-bindingprotein; the other DNA fraction is not incubated with theextract. Both DNA samples are then digested with a nucleaseor a chemical that makes random cuts in the phosphodiester bonds of the DNA, and the strands are separated. The result-ing DNA fragments are run on a gel to separate fragments of different sizes. In the absence of DNA-binding proteins,a complete ladder of bands is obtained on the electrophoreticgel. When a protein that binds to a site on the DNA fragmentis present, it covers some of the nucleotides, protecting thatstretch of the DNA from digestion. The electrophoretic pat-tern of such protected DNA will contain blank regions (or footprints). Each footprint represents the site within an en-hancer or promoter that binds a particular DNA-bindingprotein.Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 541 Protected from footprinting (b) Gel-shift analysis GC FIGURE 23-12 Identification of DNA sequences that bind protein by DNA-footprinting and gel-shift analysis. (a) In the footprinting tech-nique, labeled DNA fragments containing a putative promoter or en-hancer sequence are incubated in the presence and absence of aDNA-binding protein (e.g., Sp 1protein, which binds to a \"GC box,\" a GC-rich region of DNA). After the samples are treated with DNase andthe strands separated, the resulting fragments are electrophoresed; thegel then is subjected to autoradiography. A blank region (footprint) in the gel pattern indicates that protein has bound to the DNA. (b) In gel-shift analysis, a labeled DNA fragment is incubated with a cellular extract containing transcription factors. The electrophoretic mobility of the DNA-protein complex is slower than that of free DNA fragments.[Adapted from J. D. Watson et al., 1992,Recombinant DNA, 2nd ed., W. H. Freeman and Company.]Gel-Shift Analysis Identifies DNA-Protein Complexes When a protein binds to a DNA fragment, forming a DNA- protein complex, the electrophoretic mobility of the DNAfragment in a gel is reduced, producing a shift in the positionof the band containing that fragment. This phenomenon isthe basis of gel-shift analysis. In this technique, radioactivelylabeled cloned DNA containing an enhancer or a promoter se-quence is incubated with a nuclear extract containing a DNA-binding protein (Figure 23-12b). The DNA-protein complex isthen electrophoresed and its electrophoretic mobility is com-pared with that of the cloned DNA alone. A shift in the mobil-ity indicates that a protein is bound to the DNA, retarding itsmigration on the electrophoretic gel. CAT Assays Measure Transcriptional Activity One way to assess promoter activity is to engineer and clonea DNA sequence containing a reporter gene attached to the promoter that is being assessed. When this sequence, or con-struct, is introduced into eukaryotic cells, transcription willbe initiated from the promoter if it is active, and the reportergene will be transcribed and its protein product synthesized.Measuring the amount of this protein produced is thus a way to determine the activity of the promoter. Most reporter genes are chosen because they encode pro- teins that can be easily measured, such as the enzyme chloram- phenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which transfers the acetylgroup from acetyl-CoA to the antibiotic chloramphenicol (Figure 23-13). The more active the promoter, the more CATwill be produced within the transfected cell. By introducing mutations into promoter sequences and then assaying for pro- moter activity with the corresponding reporter gene, con-served sequence motifs have been identified within promoters.Another reporter gene, the firefly luciferase gene, is also conve- nient and easy to use. Luciferase activity is analyzed by theemission of light, which is detected by a luminometer. Gene Transfer into Mammalian Cells A variety of genes involved in the immune response havebeen isolated and cloned by use of recombinant DNA tech-niques. The expression and regulation of these genes hasbeen studied by introducing them into cultured mammaliancells and, more recently, into the germ line of animals. Cloned Genes Transferred into Cultured Cells Allow in Vitro Analysis of Gene Function Diverse techniques have been developed for transfecting genes into cells. A common technique involves the use of a retrovirusin which a viral structural gene has been replaced with thecloned gene to be transfected. The altered retrovirus is thenused as a vector for introducing the cloned gene into cultured cells. Because of the properties of retroviruses, the recombi- nant DNA integrates into the cellular genome with a high fre-quency. In an alternative method, the cloned gene of interest iscomplexed with calcium phosphate. The calcium-phosphate- DNA complex is slowly precipitated onto the cells and theDNA is taken up by a small percentage of them. In anothertransfection method, called elec troporation, an electric cur- rent creates pores in cell membranes through which the cloned DNA is taken up. In both of these latter methods, the trans-542 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Promoter CAT gene Transfect into cells mRNA CAT FIGURE 23-13 CAT assay for assessing functional activity of a pro- moter sequence. In this assay, a DNA construct consisting of the pro-moter of interest and the reporter gene encoding chloramphenicolacetyltransferase (CAT) is introduced (transfected) into eukaryotic cells.If the promoter is active, the CAT gene will be transcribed and the CATenzyme will be produced within the transfected cell. The presence of theenzyme can easily be detected by lysing the cell and incubating the celllysate with [ 14C] chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA. If present, the CAT en- zyme will transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the chloram-phenicol, forming can be easilydetected by thin-layer chromatography. [Adapted from J. D. Watson et al., 1992, Recombinant DNA, 2nd ed., W. H. Freeman and Company.]fected DNA integrates, apparently at random sites, into the DNA of a small percentage of treated cells. Generally, the cloned DNA being transfected is engineered to contain a selectable marker gene, such as one that confers resistance to neomycin. After transfection, the cells are cul- tured in the presence of neomycin. Because only the trans-fected cells are able to grow, the small number of transfectedcells in the total cell population can be identified and selected. Transfection of cloned genes into cells has proved to be highly effective in immunologic research. By transfectinggenes involved w ith the immune response into cells that lack those genes, the product of a specific gene can be studied apartfrom interacting proteins encoded by other genes. For example,transfection of MHC genes, under the control of appropriate promoters, into a mouse fibroblast cell line (L929, or simply L, cells) has enabled immunologists to study the role of MHCmolecules in antigen presentatio n to T ce lls (Figure 23-14). Transfection of the gene that encodes the T-cell receptor hasprovided information about the antigen-MHC specificity of the T-cell receptor. Cloned Genes Tranferred into Mouse Embryos Allow in Vivo Analysis of GeneFunction Development of techniques to introduce cloned foreign genes (called transgenes ) into mouse embryos has permitted im- munologists to study the effects of immune-system genes in vivo.Ifthe introduced gene integrates stably into the germ-line cells, it will be transmitted to the offspring. Two techniques for producing transgenic mice are described in this section; one ofthese has been used to produce knockout mice, which cannot express a particular gene product (Table 23-7). Transgenic Mice Aid in the Analysis of Gene Function The first step in producing transgenic mice is injection of for- eign cloned DNA into a fertilized egg. In this technically de-manding process, fertilized mouse eggs are held under suctionat the end of a pipet and the transgene is microinjected intoone of the pronuclei with a fine needle. The transgene inte-grates into the chromosomal DNA of the pronucleus and is passed on to the daughter cells of eggs that survive the pro-cess. The eggs then are implanted in the oviduct of \"pseudo- pregnant\" fe males, and transgenic pups are born after 19 or Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 543 Class II MHC chain DNA Class II MHC chain DNA Transfection Fibroblasts Selection with G418 and mycophenolic acid Class II MHCneogpt FIGURE 23-14 Transfection of the genes encoding the class II MHC /H9251chain and /H9252chain into mouse fibroblast L cells, which do not nor- mally produce these proteins. Two constructs containing one of theMHC genes and a selectable gene were engineered: the with the guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene ( gpt), which confers resistance to the drug G 418, and the /H9252-chain gene with a neomycin gene ( neo), which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid. After trans- fection, the cells are placed in medium containing both G 418and my- cophenolic acid. Only those fibroblasts containing both the neoand gpt genes (and consequently the genes encoding the class II MHC /H9251and /H9252chains) will survive this selection. These fibroblasts will express both class II MHC chains on their membranes. Some tumor-associated antigens under examination as potential targets for mono Characteristic Transgenic mice Knockout mice Cells receiving DNA Zygote Embryonic stem (ES) cells DNA constructs used Natural gene or cDNA Mutated geneMeans of delivery Microinjeciton into zygote and Transfer of ES cells to blastocyst implantation into foster mother and implantation into foster mother Outcome Gain of a gene Loss of gene TABLE 23-7 Comparison of transgenic and knockout mice20 days of gestation (Figure 23-15). In general the efficiency of this procedure is low, with only one or two transgenic miceproduced for every 100 fertilized egg collected. With transgenic mice, immunologists have been able to study the expression of a given gene in a living animal. Al-though all the cells in a transgenic animal contain the trans-gene, differences in the expression of the transgene in differ-ent tissues has shed light on mechanisms of tissue-specificgene expression. By constructing a transgene with a particularpromoter, researchers can control the expression of a giventransgene. For example, the metallothionein promoter is acti- vated by zinc. Transgenic mice carrying a transgene linked to a metallothionein promoter express the transgene only if zinc is added to their water supply. Other promoters arefunctional only in certain tissues; the insulin promoter, for in-stance, promotes transcription only in pancreatic cells. Trans-genic mice carrying a transgene linked to the insulin pro-moter, therefore, will express the transgene in the pancreasbut not in other tissues. Because a transgene is integrated into the chromosomal DNA within the one-celled mouse embryo, it will be inte-grated into both somatic cells and germ-line cells. The result- ing transgenic mice thus can transmit the transgene to theiroffspring as a Mendelian trait. In this way, it has been possi-ble to produce lines of transgenic mice in which every mem-ber of a line contains the same transgene. A variety of suchtransgenic lines are currently available and are widely used in immunologic research. Included among these are lines carry-ing transgenes that encode immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor,class I and class MHC molecules, various foreign antigens,and a number of cytokines. Several lines carrying oncogenesas transgenes also have been produced. Gene-Targeted Knockout Mice Assess the Contribution of a Particular Gene One of the limitations with transgenic mice is that the trans- gene is integrated randomly within the genome. This meansthat some transgenes insert in regions of DNA that are nottranscriptionally active, and hence the gene is not expressed. To circumvent this limitation, researchers have developed a technique in which a desired gene is targeted to specific sites within the germ line of a mouse. The primary use of this tech- nique has been to replace a normal gene with a mutant allele ora disrupted form of the gene, thus knocking out the gene'sfunction. Transgenic mice that carry such a disrupted gene,called knockout mice, have been extremely helpful to immu- nologists trying to understand how the removal of a particulargene product affects the immune system. Various knockoutmice are being used in immunologic research, including micethat lack particular cytokines or MHC molecules. Production of gene-targeted knockout mice involves the following steps: Isolation and culturing of embryonic stem (ES) cells from the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst544 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease Collect fertilized eggs OffspringImplant injected eggs into oviduct of pseudo-pregnantfemale Pseudo-pregnant female Test for presence of transgene Breed transgenicsAbout 10-30% of offspring contain transgene\u00d7 Inject cloned DNAinto one of the pronuclei \u00d7 FIGURE 23-15 General procedure for producing transgenic mice. Fertilized eggs are collected from a pregnant female mouse. Cloned DNA (referred to as the transgene) is microinjected into one of thepronuclei of a fertilized egg. The eggs are then implanted into theoviduct of pseudopregnant foster mothers (obtained by mating nor-mal females with a sterile male). The transgene will be incorporatedinto the chromosomal DNA of about 10%-30% of the offspring and will be expressed in all of their somatic cells. If a tissue-specific pro-moter is linked to a transgene, then tissue-specific expression of thetransgene will result.Introduction of a mutant or disrupted gene into the cultured ES cells and selection of homologousrecombinant cells in which the gene of interest has been knocked out (i.e., replaced by a nonfunctional form ofthe gene) Injection of homologous recombinant ES cells into a recipient mouse blastocyst and surgical implantation of the blastocyst into a pseudo-pregnant mouse Mating of chimeric offspring heterozygous for the disrupted gene to produce homozygous knockout mice The ES cells used in this procedure are obtained by culturing the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst on a feeder layer offibroblasts or in the presence of leukemia-inhibitory factor.Under these conditions, the stem cells grow but remain pluri- potent and capable of later differentiating in a variety of di-rections, generating distinct cellular lineages (e.g., germ cells, myocardium, blood vessels, myoblasts, nerve cells). One of the advantages of ES cells is the ease with which they can begenetically manipulated. Cloned DNA containing a desiredgene can be introduced into ES cells in culture by various transfection techniques. The introduced DNA will be in- serted by recombination into the chromosomal DNA of asmall number of ES cells. The insertion constructs introduced into ES cells contain three genes: the target gene of interest and two selection genes,such as neo R,which confers neomycin resistance, and gene from simplex to gancyclovir, a cytotoxic nucleotideanalog (Figure 23-16a). The construct often is engineered withthe target-gene sequence disrupted by the neo Rgene and with the tkHSVgene at one end, beyond the sequence of the target gene. Most constructs will insert at random by nonhomolo-gous recombination rather than by gene-targeted insertion through homologous recombination. As illustrated in Figure23-16b, a two-step selection scheme is used to obtain those EScells that have undergone homologous recombination, where- by the disrupted gene replaces the target gene. The ES cells obtained by this procedure are heterozygous for the knockout mutation in the target gene. These cells areclonally expanded in cell culture and then injected into aExperimental Systems CHAPTER 23 545 (b) Selection of ES cell carrying knockout gene Recombinants with randominsertionRecombinants withgene-targetedinsertionNonrecombinant cells Treat with neomycin (nonrecombinant ES cells die) Treat with gancyclovir (nonhomologous ESrecombinant cells die) Homologous ES recombinants with targeted disruption in gene X survive(a) Formation of recombinant ES cells Blastocyst Blastocyst ES cellsTarget gene insertion constructIntroduceinto tkHVS FIGURE 23-16 Formation and selection of mouse recombinant ES cells in which a particular target gene is disrupted. (a) In the engineeredinsertion construct, the target gene is disrupted with the neo R gene, and the thymidine kinase tkHSVgene is located outside the target gene. The construct is transfected into cultured ES cells. If homologous recombi-nation occurs, only the target gene and the neo Rgene will be inserted into the chromosomal DNA of the ES cells. If nonhomologous recom-bination occurs, all three genes will be inserted. Recombination occursin only about 1% of the cells, with nonhomologous recombination much more frequent than homologous recombination. (b) Selectionwith the neomycin-like drug G 418will kill any nonrecombinant ES cells because they lack the neo Rgene. Selection with gancyclovir will kill the nonhomologous recombinants carrying the tkHSVgene, which confers sensitivity to gancyclovir. Only the homologous ES recombinants willsurvive this selection scheme. [Adapted from H. Lodish et al., 1995, Molecular Cell Biology, 3rd ed., Scientific American Books.]mouse blastocyst, which subsequently is implanted into a pseudo-pregnant female. The transgenic offspring that de-velop are chimeric, composed of cells derived from the geneti- cally altered ES cells and cells derived from normal cells of the host blastocyst. When the germ-line cells are derived from thegenetically altered ES cells, the genetic alteration can be passed on to the offspring. If the recombinant ES cells are homozy-gous for black coat color (or other visible marker) and they are injected into a blastocyst homozygous for white coat color,then the chimeric progeny that carry the heterozygous knock-out mutation in their germ line can be easily identified (Figure23-17). When these are mated with each other, some of the off-spring will be homozygous for the knockout mutation. \"Knock-In\" Technology Allows the Replacement of an Endogenous Gene In addition to deleting a gene of choice, it also is possible to replace the endogenous gene with a mutated form of that gene. As in the strategy for knocking out a gene, DNA con-structs that carry mutations in a particular gene can be ex-changed for the endogenous gene. It also is possible to re- place all of an endogenous gene with a DNA sequence ofchoice. In a recent report, for example, the CD4 gene was replaced with the one for /H9252-galactosidase. In these experi- ments, the CD4 promoter was left intact to drive the expres-sion of /H9252-galactosidase, which catalyzes the color change of certain reporter chemicals to blue. Because the CD4 pro- moter drove the expression of /H9252-galactosidase, only those thymic cells destined to express CD4 turned blue in the pres-ence of the reporter chemicals. Data from these experimentswere useful in tracing CD4/CD8 lineage commitment in developing T cells. Inducible Gene Targeting, the Cre/ Lox System, Targets Gene Deletion In addition to the deletion of genes by gene targeting, recent experimental strategies have been developed that allow the specific deletion of a gene of int erest in precisely the tissue of choice. These technologies rely on the use of site-specific recombinases from bacteria or yeast. The most commonly used recombinase is Cre, isolated from bacteriophage P1. Crerecognizes a specific 34-bp site in DNA known as loxP and, upon recognition, catalyzes a recombination. Therefore, DNAsequences that are flanked by loxP are recognized by Cre and546 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease \u00d7Mate chimeric mice to homozygouswhite miceSurgically transfer embryo intopseudopregnant mouse Inject ES cells into blastocoel cavity of early embryo.

White areas are derived from recipient blastocoel cells, black areas from ES cells Black progeny develop from germ-line cells derived from ES cells and are heterozygous for disrupted gene X FIGURE 23-17 General procedure for producing homozygous knockout mice. EScells homozygous for a marker gene (e.g.,black coat color) and heterozygous for a dis-rupted target gene (see Figure 23-18 ) are in- jected into an early embryo homozygous foran alternate marker (e.g., white coat color).The chimeric transgenic offspring, whichhave black-and-white coats, then are matedwith homozygous white mice. The all-blackprogeny from this mating have ES-derivedcells in their germ line, which are heterozy-gous for the disrupted target gene. Mating ofthese mice with each other produces ani-mals homozygous for the disrupted targetgene, that is, knockout mice. [Adapted from M. R. Capecchi, 1989, Trends Genet. 5:70.]the recombinational event results in the deletion of the inter- vening DNA sequences. In other words, animals that ubiqui- tously express Cre recombinase will delete all loxP- flanked sequences. The real innovation of this technique is that ex-pression of the Cre recombinase gene can be controlled by theuse of a tissue specific promot er. This allows tissue-specific expression of the recombinase protein and thus tissue-specific deletion of DNA flanked by loxP. For example, one could ex-press Cre in B cells using the immunoglobulin promoter, and this would result in the targeted deletion of loxP- flanked DNA sequences only in B cells. This technology is particularly useful when the targeted deletion of a particular gene is lethal. For example the DNApolymerase /H9252gene is required for embryonic development. In experiments designed to test the Cre/ lox system, scientists flanked the mouse DNA polymerase /H9252gene with loxP and mated these mice with mice carrying a Cre transgene underthe control of a T-cell promoter (Figure 23-18a). The results ofthis mating are offspring that express the Cre recombinasespecifically in T cells. Using such mice, the scientists were ableto examine the effects of deleting the enzyme DNA polymerase /H9252specifically in T cells. The effe cts of the deletion of this gene could not be examined in a conventional gene-targeting ex- periment, because deletion of DNA polymerase /H9252throughout the animal would be lethal. However, with the Cre/ lox system, it now is possible to examine the effects of the deletion of thisgene in a specific tissue of the immune system. The Cre/ lox system also can be used to turn on gene ex- pression in a particular tissue. Just as the lack of a particulargene may be lethal during embryonic development, the ex-pression of a gene can be toxic. T o examine tissue-specificexpression of such a gene, it is possible to insert a translational stop sequence flanked by loxP into an intron at the beginning of the gene (Figure 23-18b). Using a tissue-specific promoterdriving Cre expression, the stop sequence may be deleted inthe tissue of choice and the expression of the potentially toxicgene examined in this tissue. These modifications of gene-targeting technology have been very useful in determining the effects of particular genes in cells and tissues of the immunesystem.Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 547 Collect fertilized eggs OffspringImplant injected eggs into oviduct of pseudo-pregnantfemale Pseudo-pregnant female Test for presence of transgene Breed transgenicsAbout 10-30% of offspring contain transgene\u00d7 Inject cloned DNAinto one of the pronuclei \u00d7 FIGURE Gene targeting Cre/ loxP (a) Conditional dele- tion by Cre recombinase. The targeted DNA polymerase /H9252gene is modified by flanking the gene with loxP sites (for simplicity, only one al- lele is shown). Mice are generated from ES cells by standard proce-dures. Mating of the loxP-modified-mice with a Cre transgenic will generate double transgenic mice in which the loxP-flanked DNA poly- merase /H9252gene will be deleted in the tissue where Cre is expressed. In this example, Cre is expressed in thymus tissue (striped) so that dele-tion of the loxP-flanked gene occurs only in the thymus (white) of the double transgenic. Other tissues and organs still express the loxP- flanked gene (orange). (b) Activation of gene expression using Cre/ lox. A loxP-flanked translational STOP cassette is inserted between the pro- moter and the potentially toxic gene, and mice are generated from EScells using standard procedures. These mice are mated to a transgenicline c arrying the Cre gene driven by a tissue-specific promoter. In this example, Cre is expressed in the thymus, so that mating results in ex-pression of the toxic gene (blue) solely in the thymus. Using thisstrategy, it is possible to determine the effects of expression of the potentially toxic gene in a tissue-specific fashion. [Adapted from B. Sauer, 1998, Methods 14:381.]Microarrays\u2014An Approach for Analyzing Patterns of GeneExpression In the past few years, a new approach has emerged designed to assess differences in gene expression between various celltypes or the same cells treated in different fashions. This tech- nology, referred to as microarray technology or gene profiling, has the ability to rapidly and reliably scan large numbers ofdifferent mRNAs. The principle is simple and is derived fromwhat we already know about RNA and DNA hybridization. mRNA is isolated from a given sample. Then, when cDNAsynthesis is initiated the first strand of the cDNA is labeledwith the tag. This forms the pool of target sequences. The next step is to hybridize the labeled cDNA to a microarray. There are many microarrays commercially avail-able, which fall mainly into two classes; those composed ofcDNA, and those composed of oligonucleotides. Microarraysof cDNAs are, as the name suggests, a collection of cDNAthat have been arranged, or arrayed, on a solid substrate indefined locations. The substrate varies but usually is a nylonmembrane or a glass slide. If a very small amount of cDNA isused, the spots of cDNA arrayed on the substrate can be assmall as 100-300 /H9262m in size; it is relatively simple to array as many as 30,000 cDNAs on a single microscope slide (Figure23-19a). The actual process of arraying the cDNA is usually ac-complished using robotics. The cDNAs are most frequently obtained from available cDNA libraries and, in some cases, arePCR products amplified from the cDNA library using primersspecific for certain known genes. The oligonucleotide arrays are usually a collection of oli- gos 20-25 nucleotides long (Figure 23-19b). The advantageof this type of array is that one only needs sequences of genesof interest. No cDNA library is needed. However, the cost ofassembling such an array is high, since the oligos have to bemade and then spotted onto the filter or glass slide. Anotherproblem with this approach is, depending upon the length ofthe oligo, there can be a degree of non-specific hybridizationthat hinders the final analysis of the data. This problem canbe avoided by making longer oligos\u2014which further increasesthe cost. For these reasons, oligo arrays are used most oftenby large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. Although the source of the targets used for both cDNA and oligo arrays are cDNA, the preparation of the target dif-fers depending upon the microarray. The target preparationfor cDNA arrays labeling are conjugated tonucleic acids and are highly stable and emit less background fluorescence than conventional fluorescent dyes. Supposeyou wish to compare two different cell types, or one cell type in two different states of activation. cDNA from one popula-tion is prepared using mRNA as a template. First strand syn-thesis of the mRNA is performed using one nucleotide con-jugated to Cy3. Then, using mRNA from the second ulation, cDNA is prepared using a nucleotide conjugated toCy5. These two populations of cDNA, one marked with Cy3 and the other with Cy5, are hybridized to the microarray. Ifone of the targets hybridizes to a cDNA on the array, a green(Cy3) or red (Cy5) fluorescence emission is detected. If bothhybridize to the cDNA, yellow fluorescence is detected (the combination of the red and green emissions from both dyes). The arrays are analyzed by scanning the array at two differentwavelengths to distinguish between the Cy3 and Cy5 signals.Once scanned at two wavelengths, the signals are comparedand the signal intensity of each dye is determined and com-pared. The results are presented as a ratio between the twosamples. In the case of oligo-based microarrays, the usual approach is to label the target cDNA with a biotin-labeled nucleotideduring first-strand synthesis of biotin-labeled hybridized to the oligo array use of the fluorescent strepavidin (Figure 28-19b). Theprocedure is then repeated with cDNA from the other celltype and another microarray is used. The resultant microar- rays are analyzed by either phosphoimaging or fluorescent- based scanning. This is most commonly accomplished usingspecialized scanners developed for scanning microarrays. The difference between this procedure and the cDNA- based array described above is that two microarrays are used.This is possible since the method for producing the oligo-based microarrays is more precise and it is possible to ensurethat the same oligo will be present in precisely the same posi-tion on two separate microarrays. This is not possible withthe technology used to prepare cDNA microarrays. There-fore, both targets must be hybridized to the same array toderive an accurate comparison. There is an advantage to us-ing two microarrays. Quantitation of expression levels is eas-ier when using one labeled target per microarray. When twotargets are hybridized to the same array, it is always necessaryto \"subtract\" the fluorescence of one target from the other before it is possible to obtain quantitative data. Since onlyone target is hybridized to a single oligo microarray, subtrac-tion is not necessary. The application of microarray technology to immunology is apparent. One could easily ask what is the difference betweenT cells and B cells. Or what is the difference between an acti- vated T cell and a resting T cell? The list of possible compar-isons is immense. T o begin to answer some of the interestingimmunology questions, Louis Staudt and co-workers at theNIH have developed an array they term \"Lymphochip.\" TheLymphochip is an array that consists of more than 10,000 human genes and is enriched in genes expressed in lymphoid cells. It also includes genes from normal as well as transformed lymphocytes. This particular microarray has provided a greatdeal of useful information, including a profile of T cells com-pared to B cells, plasma cells compared to germinal center Bcells, and gene expression pattens induced by various signaling pathways. The Lymphochip and other clinical applications ofmicroarrays are described in the Clinical Focus box. 548 PART IV The Immune System in Health and DiseaseSUMMARY Inbred mouse strains allow immunologists to work rou- tinely with syngeneic, or genetically identical, animals.With these strains, aspects of the immune response can be studied uncomplicated by unknown variables that couldbe introduced by genetic differences between animals. In adoptive-transfer experiments, lymphocytes are trans- ferred from one mouse to a syngeneic recipient mouse thathas been exposed to a sublethal (or potentially lethal) dose of x-rays. The irradiation inactivates the immune cells ofthe recipient, so that one can study the response of only thetransferred cells. With in vitro cell-culture systems, populations of lympho- cytes can be studied under precisely defined conditions. Suchsystems include primary cultures of lymphoid cells, clonedlymphoid cell lines, and hybrid lymphoid cell lines. Unlikeprimary cultures, cell lines are immortal and homogene ous.Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 549 Isolate mRNA Synthesize labeled cDNA targets,denature Spot onto substrateSpot onto substrate DNA microarrayAmplify by microarray of microarrays (b). As described inthe text, microarray analysis relies on the isolation of RNA from thetissues or cells to be analyzed, the conversion of RNA into cDNA,and the subsequent labeling of DNA during target preparation. The labeled target sequences are hybridized to either a cDNA microarray(a) or an microarray (b).Biochemical techniques provide tools for labeling impor- tant proteins of the immune system. Labeling antibodieswith molecules such as biotin and avidin allows accurate determination of the level of antibody response. Gel elec-trophoresis is a convenient tool for separating and deter- mining the molecular weight of a protein.The ability to identify, clone, and sequence immune-sys-tem genes using recombinant DNA techniques has revolu- tionized the study of all aspects of the immune response.Both cDNA, which is prepared by transcribing mRNA withreverse transcriptase, and genomic DNA can be cloned. cDNA is cloned using a plasmid vector; the re-550 PART IV The Immune System in Health and Disease RNA from 38samples of acute leukemia, labeled the RNA with biotin, and hybrid-ized the biotinylated RNA to commercialhigh-density microarrays that containedoligonucleotides corresponding to some6817 human genes. Whenever the biotin- labeled RNA recognized a homologousoligonucleotide, hybridization occurred.Analysis revealed a group of 50genes that were highly associated with eitherAML or ALL when compared with con-trol samples. These 50genes were then used to sample nucleic acid from 34in- dependent leukemias as well as samplesfrom 24presumed-normal human bone- marrow or blood samples. The result? Aset of markers that clearly classified atumor as ALL or AML. The results of the microarray analysis further suggested that the treatments forAML and ALL can be targeted more pre-cisely. For example, an AML expressinggenes x, y, and z might respond to one treatment modality better than an AMLthat expresses a, b, and c. Several phar- maceutical companies have establishedresearch groups to evaluate differenttreatments for tumors based on the tu-mor's microarray profile. This designer-approach to oncology is expected to pro-duce much more effective treatments ofindividual tumors, and ultimately, en-hanced survival rates. Microarray analysis is likely to be very useful in the diagnosis of tumors of theimmune system. Most notably, a labora-tory at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a specialized DNAmicroarray containing more than 10,000 human cDNAs that are enriched forgenes expressed in lymphocytes. Someof these cDNAs are from genes of knownfunction, others unknown cDNAsderived from normal or malignantlytransformed lymphocyte cDNA libraries.This specialized array is called the\"Lymphochip\" because the lymphocytecDNAs are arrayed on a silicon wafer. Thegroup at NIH asked whether they coulduse the Lymphochip to divide the B-cellleukemia known as diffuse large B-celllymphoma (DLBCL) into subgroups, animportant question because this type oflymphoma has a highly variable clinicalcourse, with some patients respondingwell to treatment while others respondpoorly. Earlier attempts to define sub-groups within this group had beenunsuccessful. A definition of subgroupswithin DLBCL could be useful in design-ing more effective treatments. Using theLymphochip, the group at NCI identified two genotypically distinct subgroups ofDLBCL. One group was comprised oftumors expressing genes characteristicof germinal-center B cells and was called\"germinal-center-B-like DLBCL (see Fig-ure). The other group more resembled activated B cells and was termed \"acti-vated B-like DLBCL.\" Significantly, pa-tients with germinal-center-B-like B-like DLBCL. Normally allpatients with DLBCL receive multi-agentchemotherapy. Patients notrespond well to chemotherapy are thenconsidered for bone-marrow transplanta-tion. The data obtained from this studysuggests that patients with activated B-like DLBCL will not respond as well to chemotherapy and may be better served It is almost impos- sible to distinguish visually between B and T cells without molecular analysis.Similarly, it can be quite difficult to dis-tinguish one tumor from another. Twoof the best-known acute leukemias are AML, which arises from a myeloid pre-cursor (hence the name, acute myeloid leukemia) and ALL (acute lymphoid leukemia), which arises from lymphoid precursors. Both leukemias are derivedfrom hematopoietic stem cells, but theprognosis and treatment for the two dis-eases are quite different. Until recently,the two diseases could be diagnosedwith some degree of confidence using acombination of surface phenotyping,karotypic analysis, and histochemicalanalysis, but no single test was conclu-sive; reliable diagnosis depended uponthe expertise of the clinician. The difference between an ALL diag- nosis and an AML diagnosis can meanthe difference between life and death.ALL responds best to corticosteroids such cytarabine. Thecure are dramatically diminished ifthe less appropriate treatment is deliv-ered due to misdiagnosis. In 1999 , a breakthrough in diagnosis of these two leukemias was achieved us-ing microarray technology. Todd Golub,Eric Lander, and their colleagues isolatedCLINICAL FOCUS Microarray Analysis as a Diagnostic Tool for Human Diseasescombinant DNA containing the gene to be cloned is prop- agated in E. coli cells. Genomic DNA can be cloned within a bacteriophage vector or a cosmid vector, both of whichare propagated in E. coli. Even larger genomic DNA frag- ments can be cloned within bacteriophage P1 vectors,which can replicate in E. coli, or yeast artificial chromo-somes, which can replicate in yeast cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a convenient tool for amplifying small quantities of DNA. Transcription of genes is regulated by promoter and enhancer sequences; the activity of these sequences is Experimental Systems CHAPTER 23 551 vides us with a unique opportunity to examine differences between any dis-tinct populations of cells. One can com-pare which genes are expressed in com-mon or differentially in a na\u00efve T cell anda memory T cell. What is the differencebetween a normal T cell and a T cell dy-ing by apoptosis? Comparisons like these will be a rich source of insight intodifferences in cell populations. The keyto using this valuable information will bethe development of tools to analyze thevast quantities of data that can beobtained from this new approach.by bone-marrow transplantation shortly after diagnosis. As a direct result of thiswork, ongoing clinical trials are evaluat-ing how best to treat patients with acti-vated B-like DLBCL. Gene profiling is not restricted to diagnosis of cancer.

Promoter activity can be assessed bythe CAT assay. Cloned genes can be transfected (transferred) into cul-tured cells by several methods. Commonly, immune-sys-tem genes are transfected into cells that do not normally express the gene of interest. Cloned genes also can be in- corporated into the germ-line cells of mouse embryos, yielding transgenic mice, which can transmit the incorpo- rated transgene to their offspring. Expression of a chosen gene can then be studied in a living animal. Knockout miceare transgenics in which a particular target gene has beenreplaced by a nonfunctional form of the gene, so the gene product is not expressed. The Cre/ lox system provides a mechanism that allows tissue-specific expression or dele-tion of a particular gene. Microarrays are a powerful approach for the examination of tissue-specific gene expression and comparison of geneexpression in different cells. It has already begun to revolu- tionize the study of gene regulation and gene expression. References Alizadeh A. A., et al. 2000.
