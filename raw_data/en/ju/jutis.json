When the body is stressed, its defenses and energy production are negatively affected, pushing the body away from health and creating opportunities for disease progression. At Hands on Health, we focus on natural detoxification along with nutrition to disrupt these opportunities and return the body to a state of wellness. When you have a deep-seated health challenge such as a chronic pain condition, immune system dysfunction, or systemic disease, you may need to make changes on multiple levels. In addition to chiropractic care, you may need a functional medicine plan that includes nutritional counseling and dietary changes. Hands on Health Wellness Center can provide all of these strategies in a customized package to help you get well and stay healthy for life. "}
