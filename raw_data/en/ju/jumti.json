exploration beyond low Earth orbit. The Human Research Program (HRP) is essent ial to enabling extended periods of space exploration because it provides knowledge and to ols to mitigate risks to human health and performance. Risks include physiological and be havioral effects from radiation and hypogravity environments, as well as unique challenges in medi cal support, human factors, and behavioral or psychological factors. The Human Research Program (HRP) delivers human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologi es and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration. Wit hout HRP results, NASA will face unknown and unacceptable risks for mission success and post-mission crew health. This Integrated Research Plan (IRP) describes HRP's approach and research activities that are intended to address the needs of human space exploration and serve HRP customers and how they are integrated to provide a risk mitigati on tool. The scope of the IRP is limited to the activities that can be conducted with the resour ces available to the HR P; it does not contain activities that would be performed if additional resources were available. The timescale of human space exploration is envisioned to take many decades. The IRP illustrates the program's research plan through the timescale of ear ly lunar missions of extended duration. The IRP serves several purposes for th e Human Research Program. The IRP... provides a means to assure that the most significant risks to huma n space explorers are being adequately mitigated and/or addressed; shows the relationship of research activities to expected outcomes and need dates; shows the interrelationships among research activities that may interact to produce products that affect multiple HRP Elemen t, Project or research disciplines; accommodates the uncertain outcomes of research and technology activities by including decision points that lead to potential follow-on activities; shows the assignments of responsibility within the program organization and, as practical, the proposed acquisition strategy; shows the intended use of research platform s such as the International Space Station (ISS), NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (N SRL), and various space flight analog environments; and shows the budgeted research activities of the Human Res earch Program, but does not show all budgeted activities, as some of these are enabling functions, such as management, facilities, and infrastructure. 1.1 CONTEXT OF THE INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN There are three foundational documents to the HRP: 1. Program Requirements Document (PRD) 2. Evidence Book 3. Integrated Research Plan (IRP) The PRD describes the high-level requirements th at the program must meet. The Evidence Book provides the scientific basis for the risks that ar e contained in the PRD, and the IRP describes the approach to addressing the requi rements in the PRD. The relationship of these HRP documents is illustrated in Figure 1.1. HRP-47065 2 Figure 1.1: HRP Requirements and Content Alignment HRP-47065 3 1.2 PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT The HRP's top-level requirements are maintained in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Exploration Architecture Requirements Document (EARD), ESMD-EARD-08-07, Rev.-. The purpose of the EARD is to translat e the expectations of stakeholders , both inside and outside NASA, for the next generation U.S. Space Exploration missi on, into requirements that will flow down to the implementing organizations. The EARD allocates the following top requirements to the HRP. [Ex-0061] NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) shall develop knowledge, capabilities, countermeasures, and technologies to mitigate the highest risks to crew health and performance and enable human space exploration [Ex-0062] NASA's HRP shall provide data and analysis to support the definition and improvement of human spaceflight medical, environmental and human factors standards [Ex-0063] HRP shall develop technologies to reduce medical and environmental risks and to reduce human systems resource requirements (mass, volume, power, data, etc.) The PRD decomposes those requirements into lower le vel requirements that are then allocated to the HRP Elements. The requirements in the PRD are divi ded into three categories: requirements related to human system standards, requirements related to human health and performance risks, and requirements related to provision of enabling capabilities. The HRP comprises the following major Program Elements: Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP), Explorati on Medical Capability (ExMC), Human Health Countermeasures (HHC), I SS Medical Project (ISSMP), Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH), and Space Radiation (SR). Each element incorporates their respective PRD requirements into their specific element management pl ans. The research elements subsequently derive a research plan to address the requirements. 1.2.1 STANDARDS The PRD requires that the HRP make recommendations for updates to the Space Flight Human System Standards (SFHSS). The SFHSS, Volume 1 (NASA-STD-3001, Vol. 1), describes Levels of Care required for human spaceflight missions, Permissibl e Exposure Limits, Permissible Outcomes, and Fitness for Duty Standards for crewmembers on exploration missions, among other things, and was first baselined on March 5, 2007, by the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO). Essentially, these are the definition of acceptable le vels of risk for human health and performance associated with spaceflight. By comparing thes e standards with the exis ting evidence and knowledge base, the HRP can identify and quantify the risks associated with human exploration missions, and derive the research necessary to lower the risk. SFHSS, Volume 2 (Spaceflight Habitability and Human Standards) provides the comprehensive set of requirements associated with Human Factors and Ha bitability. These standards must be met by the Constellation program in development of each ve hicle and supporting equipm ent utilized in space exploration. Through comparison of these standards w ith the state of the art in engineering design, the HRP can identify areas where resear ch is necessary to help the C onstellation prog ram meet these requirements. The HRP has two main responsibilities concerning th e standards. In some cases, the SFHSS has a wide band of uncertainty. The HRP mu st conduct research to help re fine and narrow the uncertainty associated with the standard. In other cases, emerging evidence or knowledge may indicate that the standards are not written in a way that captures a comp lete set of relevant considerations. The HRP is HRP-47065 4 required to address the modification of such standards. Additional resear ch may be required to facilitate this. The PRD decomposes the top-level requirement into the specific standards and allocates the requirement to inform these standa rds to the appropriate HRP Element. 1.2.2 RISKS The HRP identifies risks relevant to the Chief Health and Medical Officer and to the health and human performance aspects of the Constellation Program . The HRP utilizes the Chief Medical Officer's Human System Risk Board (HSRB) to identify risks requiring research. The PRD allocates requirements to quantify, mitigate, or monitor thes e human system risks to the appropriate Element within the HRP. The PRD, however, does not establish priority for the risks. The risks in the PRD are arranged in two groups based on the level of available evidence. Risks for which substantial evidence exists ar e listed in Table 1 while those that cannot be supported or refuted by available information at this time are in Table 2. This IRP addresses each of the risks in the priority order described in Section 2.0 in the PRD. 1.3 EVIDENCE BOOK The HRP Evidence Book documents WHY the risks are contained in the PRD. It is a record of the state of knowledge for each risk in the PRD and, therefore, provides bases for analyses of the likelihoods and consequences for each of the risks. As such, the Evidence Book, a compilation of all the evidence-based risk reports, makes important da ta accessible and available for periodic review. The Evidence Book is publicly available at the following internet address - http://humanresearch.jsc.nasa.gov/ elements/smo/hrp_evidence_book.asp . The documentation of evidence for each risk in the PRD is in the form of a review article that is aimed at a scientifically-educat ed, non-specialist reader. The docum entation is broken into the following parts: The body of each risk review contains a narrative di scussion of the risk and its supporting evidence. 1. Declarative statements concer ning the risk are supported by a description of the evidence, whether published or unpublished. 2. Relevant published references are listed at the end of the report. 3. Data that are significant or pivotal are summarized in text, tables, and charts in sufficient detail to allow the reader to critique and draw conclu sions, especially when a published reference is not available. 4. In a similar fashion, the authors indicate, as appropriate, whether the data are from human, animal, or tissue/cell/molecular studies. 5. Evidence from space flight (including biomedical research, Medical Re quirements Integration Document [MRID] data, and operational performance or clinical observations) is presented first, followed by ground-based evidence (including space analog research and non-space analog biomedical or cl inical research). 6. When evidence is from ground-based studies, author s discuss why these results are likely to be applicable in the space environment, offering available validation information for the use of these ground-based systems. The National Academies of Sciences Institute of Medicine reviewed th e risk reports to validate that they provide sufficient evidence that the risk is relevant to long-ter m space missions. Their conclusions HRP-47065 5 and recommendations are given in the IOM publication, Review of NASA's Human Research Program Evidence Books. A Letter Report, Washington DC: The National Academies Press, 2008. Some Risk Reports will be published through refereed journals specific to the appropriate disciplines. In some cases, when the evidence reports are not pub lished in a journal, the HRP will publish them in NASA Technical Reports. Further, all evidence re ports will be made available on the HRP external website. As new evidence is gathered, the Risk Reports will be updated. If new eviden ce indicates that a risk should be retired or that a new risk should be added, the HRP will, after thorough review with the HSRB, take the appropriate acti on to modify the PRD and update the Evidence Book accordingly. 1.4 THE INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN The IRP documents the CRITICALITY of each risk: WHAT tasks are necessary to fill gaps, WHEN those tasks will be accomplished and their deliverables provided to the stakeholder, WHERE they will be accomplished (e.g., use th e International Space Station, use a ground analog, etc.), WHO will accomplish them (which pr oject or organization within the HRP), and What is being PRODUCED. 1.4.1 Criticality to Missions Three categories of criticality have been developed for the mitigation of each of the risks: 1) Critical, 2) Important , and 3) Desirable. Each of the three categories is applied to two different mission scenarios, the lunar mission(s) (including the lunar outpost missions) and the Mars mission. The criticality of a risk for either a lunar or a Mars mission alone is not sufficient to determine the optimum level of activity (or budget) or timing for research investme nts. Other factors combine to determine the research approach, such as limited avai lability (of certain necessary resources like the Space Shuttle and the ISS), exceptionally long le ad times (needed to improve understanding and mitigation of radiation risks), or the amount of risk reduction that can be obtained with a specific set of resources. All of the factors needed to determine th e research approach are not explicitly represented in the IRP, only the resultant research plan. For reference, each risk heading in this document is labeled with an abbreviated version of the Lunar and Mars criticalities. Criteria for criticality of the risks applicable to the lunar outpost and Mars mission(s) are: Critical to Quantify and Reduce Prior to the Lunar Outpost or Mars Missions . Absence of additional data or risk mitigation co untermeasures (beyond what is available at the approval date of this document) would likely delay Lunar Outpost or Mars Missions, even if all other elements of the mission were ready (e.g., if the launch systems, Extravehicular Activity (EVA) systems, landing and life support systems were r eady). The lack of this data or an adequate additional mitigation would leave NASA with unacceptable uncertainty in the residual risk, and/or with unacceptable absolute risk to human health and performance, thus precluding NASA's ability to embark on the mission. Critical risks for lunar outpost are identified by the abbreviation LUNAR OUTPOST-C and for Mars by the abbreviation MARS-C . HRP-47065 6 Important to Quantify and Reduce Prior to the Lunar Outpost or Mars Missions . Absence of additional data or risk mitigation counte rmeasures in this area (beyond what is available at the approval date of this document) would like ly not delay lunar outpost or Mars missions, if all other elements of the mission were ready (e.g., if the launch systems, EVA systems, landing and life support systems were ready). This would l eave the mission with significant residual or unknown risk however. Mission loss or major impact to post-mission crew health could occur if this risk is not quantified and reduced. Im portant risks for lunar outpost are abbreviated LUNAR OUTPOST-I , and for Mars as MARS-I . Desirable to Quantify and Reduce Prior to the Lunar Outpost or Mars Missions . The absence of data or risk mitigation countermeasur es in this area (beyond what is available at the approval date of this document) would not delay the lunar outpost or Mars missions if all other elements of the mission were ready (e.g., if th e launch systems, EVA systems, landing and life support systems were ready). However, quantifying and reducing the risk w ould reduce the risk for that particular discipline. E ngineering or operational workarounds/c onstraints could be avoided if this risk were quantified and/or reduced. De sirable risks for lunar outpost are abbreviated LUNAR OUTPOST-D , and Mars as MARS-D . Ultimately, assessment of the critic ality is based on the likelihood and consequence of the risks, the gaps, and the tasks, coupled with the uncertainty in risk projections . Assessment involves integration and comparison of risk factors and the impact each task may have on th e reduction of the overall risk to the mission or the crew, given different mission scen arios, research approaches, and outcomes. The HRP will use the Risk Management Analysis Tool (RMAT) to categorize and document the assessment of the risks and to document priority. At present, the RMAT is a two-dimensional tool. There is no integrated or validated assessment tool that will allow the use of the RMAT for cross- comparison or prioritization of risks or gaps now. Until the availability of such a tool, the HRP will rely on expert opinion, with consid eration of the RMAT and existing evidence. The HRP's Science Management Office has the responsib ility of prioritizing th e HRP's research portfol io as described in the HRP Science Management Plan (HRP-47053 Rev. C), Paragraph 3.1. 1.4.2 Tasks Required To Fill The Gaps (WHAT) For each risk, the appropriate HRP Elements identif ied gaps in the risk's state of knowledge and NASA's ability to mitigate the ris k. Further, the HRP Elements id entified specific research tasks required to fill each gap and the product(s) resulting from the tasks. This Integrated Research Plan lays out the risk, gaps, tasks, and resulting products in a notional schedule tied to the appropriate Exploration milestones for which the products will be needed. The rationale for the selected approach is documented in the text portions of the IRP. This plan includes activities that are more than \"Research or Te chnology Development.\" In some cases, the activities repo rted in this document are not e xplicitly \"research\" or \"technology development,\" but are included to en sure logical completeness in desc ribing those activ ities necessary to mitigate the risks. Examples are data mining ac tivities, the results of which are pivotal in defining further steps in the research path, and hardware evaluations that woul d further the engineering approach to risk mitigation. Key Decision Points are built into the IRP, wherein the HRP will evalua te data with respect to closing the research gap, as well as the im pact on the overall likelihood or cons equence of the risk. The results of this analysis help formulate the next steps. In some cases, likelihood with existing countermeasures HRP-47065 7 will not be high enough to warrant proceeding with more research. This risks- gaps-tasks-deliverables detail is required to ensure completeness in addressing the risks. 1.4.3 Schedule Drivers (WHEN) The Integrated Research Plan describes a plan of knowledge production and technology development to address risks associated with hum an space flight. As new knowledge is gained, the required approach to research and development may change. The IRP a ttempts to describe a plan of research looking forward many years into the future. The fidelity of the IRP is quite high in the near term (2009-2010), but decreases with time. The IRP will be revise d and updated annually based on available resources, Constellation mission development, other schedule constraints, achie vement of key milestones, and consideration of new evidence ga ined from the previous year. 1.4.4 Research Platforms (WHERE) The HRP uses various research platforms and data s ources to address gaps in knowledge. Historical data derived from ground and spaceflight studies form the basis of the HRP Evidence Reports, with the intention of ensuring that the HRP does not duplicate effort already e xpended. Many of these activities appear in this IRP as \"data mining,\" although not explicitly \"research.\" Data mining involves gathering and analyzing data from historical space flights via the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health and othe r sources, spaceflight ope rational data such as landing performance and simulator performance data to identify possi ble correlation with physiologic or psychological function, and relevant data from ground st udies (NASA sponsored and otherwise). The HRP utilizes the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station to conduct research requiring the unique environment of space. The spaceflight da ta primarily identify and/or quantify physiological and behavioral changes to the human system occu rring in the microgravity environment. The ISS is utilized to both validate potenti al countermeasures and as an anal og for long-duration Mars missions. NASA has laid out specific schedule milestones/constraints for implem entation of the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). The Shuttle retirement in 2010, the Orion vehicle use in 2014, and the first lunar sortie by 2020 together create urgency for the acqui sition of knowledge. The use of the Shuttle and ISS platforms, in several cases, is critical to obtai ning the required knowledge to build products supporting longer, more challenging missions. The Shuttl e retirement in 2010 and the uncertainty in the completion of ISS operations levies significant constraints on availabl e flight resources, thus some research is accelerated to take advantage of these vehicles while available. Where possible, the HRP will utilize analog environments to perform the research required to fill gaps in knowledge, preserving the limited flight resources for only those that cannot be addressed else where. These data are used as an analog to a long-duration Mars mission because th e ISS is the only resource of its kind. The HRP will accelerate some of the research from this resource to facilitate future long-term stays in microgravity on exploration missions that could otherwise be delayed pending such a mission design. There are several analog environments utilized by the HRP, some owned and operated by HRP, some by NASA, and others operated by other agencies. Each analog environment is assessed for its characteristics that mimic portions of the flight environment, the fi delity of the analog. No ground- based analog can serve to simulate the flight envi ronment completely, thus each analog use is selected based on its important flight-like ch aracteristics specific to the task ob jectives. Several analogs often will be required to fill a gap, and, in all cases, analog findings are validated in the space flight environment. HRP-47065 8 The Flight Analogs Project coordinates utilization of ground base d research analogs to complement space research. Throughout the IRP, tasks requiring the use of specific analogs are identified. The bed rest analog mimics some of the physiological changes induced by we ightlessness, using a bed rest model with a 6o head-down tilt. The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) analog and Antarctic missions provide mission-like settings and interactions that incorporate the constraints of working in extreme environments . The Haughton-Mars and Devon Island analogs to provide rugged terrain and mission-like interactions to address specifi c lunar surface system concepts related to EVA and other factors related to behavioral health and performance. In some cases, the HRP also utilizes operational mission environments, such as the Phoenix Mars Scout Lander, to obtain data relevant to the behavioral he alth and performance of the gr ound crews supporting long duration spaceflight missions. Such data provide valuable le ssons for future exploration missions. Isolation chambers also provide mission-like ground-to-crew a nd crew-to-crew interactions that facilitate behavioral studies of team cohesion, workload, fatigue, and sleep. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) is a unique gr ound-based analog. This facility is owned and operated by the Department of Energy's (DoE) Brookhaven National La boratory, under a contract with the HRP. HRP utilization of the NSRL is managed by the Space Radiation Program Element. As NASA prepares to send crewmembers back to e xplore the Moon for periods of up to six months, questions arise regarding the imp acts of the lunar environment on th e health, safety, and performance of the explorers. Among the environmental character istics of concern is the relatively small force of gravity on the Moon, which is approximately one-sixth of that on Earth. \"Space normal\" is defined for this document as the normal human response to prolonged space flight. While the normal human response to prolonged microgravity exposure has been fairly well characterized during (and after) orbital space flight missions, little is known about the human physiological responses to prolonged fractional gravity exposure. Thre sholds, non-linearities, and system-s ystem interactions/dependencies are all likely to affect these responses. These things will certainly be studied in crewmembers participating in Lunar missions; however, it would be useful to know ahead of time whether any of the effects could be severe enough to cause functionally si gnificant decrements in crew health, safety, or performance during these missions, so that appropri ate countermeasures could be provided from the outset. Various lunar gravity simulation techniques were developed during the Apo llo era (e.g., parabolic flight, mechanical off-loading, vertical counter-wei ghting, underwater activities); these techniques can be used only for short-term simulations (seconds -to-hours). All are capab le of simulating the musculoskeletal loading on the Moon, but only parabol ic flight can provide a high-fidelity simulation of the physiological loading for the cardiovascula r and sensory-motor systems. The long-term exposures (weeks-to-months) required to simulate lunar outpost missions have been attempted in humans only by using head-up-tilt (HUT) bed rest m odels. While such models can provide accurate static loading along the long body axis, they cannot eliminate th e (nearly) orthogonal components of the gravity vector, nor can they allow for high-fidelity dynamic simulations. Nevertheless, within limits, they might provide insight into the expected adaptive responses of the bone, muscle, and cardiovascular systems to prolonged lunar gravity exposure. The Flight Analogs Project is investigating the HUT model as a potential analog to physiologica l changes induced by the partial gravity environment of the lunar surface. 1.4.5 Elements and Projects Responsible For The Research (WHO) Each risk is allocated to one of the five research elements within the HRP, and the IRP identifies which Element is responsible for the identified risk. Thr ee of the HRP Elements are single project elements: Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP), E xploration Medical Capability (ExMC) and Space HRP-47065 9 Radiation, and the responsible Element is identified at the risk level, but they are responsible also for all gaps and tasks addressing the risks. Two HRP Elements, Huma n Health Countermeasures (HHC) and Space Human Factors and Habitability (SHFH) ar e multi-project Elements. Thus, the Element is identified at the risk level, and th e responsible project within the Elemen t is identified at the Gap level. The following HHC abbreviations are used throughout the IRP to desi gnate the responsible project: EPSP (EVA Physiology and Systems Performance), ECP (Exercise Countermeasure Project), NxPCM (Non-Exercise Physiological Countermeasures), a nd FAP (Flight Analogs Project). designate the respons ible SHFH project: AEH (Advanced Environmental Health), AFT (Advanced Food Technology), and SHFE (Space Human Factors Engineering). The HRP's intent is that each study is procured through competitive means, i.e., a NASA Research Announcement (NRA), Request for Proposal (RFP), etc. In some cases, due to timeliness of data, or close interconnectedness with operations or other NASA entities, the HRP will direct a specific study be done. Criteria for these decisions are given in the HRP Science Ma nagement Plan. The current and planned procurement method for each task in this re search plan is identifi ed. Identification of any investigation as a directed study within the IRP does not signify a commitment on the part of the HRP to implement that study as a dir ected study without furthe r consideration by the Program Scientist as specified in the Science Management Plan. It is the HRP's policy that al l investigations sponsored by the program will undergo independent scientific merit review. This includes pr oposals submitted in response to NASA Research Announcements, all directed study proposal s, and all unsolicited proposals. Each Element or Project within an HRP will be reviewed by an independent Standing Review Panel. The Panel's primary responsibility is to revi ew the Element Research Plan and provide recommendations on the scientific or technological appro ach and portfolio content. Those element research plans ultimately serve as the input to the IRP. Modifications to el ement research plans will result in modifications to the annual update of the IRP. 1.4.6 Deliverable Of The Research (DELIVERABLES) The focus of this document is to identify deliverab les necessary to complete the exploration (lunar and Mars) missions. This plan is NOT intended to mitigate risks associated with the ISS. The ISS is used as a platform to conduct research aimed at mitigati ng risks to the exploration missions. Some of the research may identify countermeasures, engineeri ng, or operational solutions that would enhance the ISS and reduce risk in use (including to users) of that platform. In those cases, the HRP identifies the necessary deliverables and insertion points for the ISS. Human health and performance risks can best be mitigated through the space system design. The HRP works closely with the Constellation program to communicate the areas of human health and performance risks, and to help inform engineerin g and development of the Constellation systems. Mitigation of many human health and performan ce risks can be accomplished through engineering design and operational constraints, and do not need further research. Decision points in the research schedules are placed to evaluate the adequacy of th e approach, research results, and deliverables to meet the intended application. The first and most desirable approach to mitigating a human health and performance risk is to engineer the risk out of the system. HRP research is intended to reduce the uncertainty in the risk and free mission timelines and design from unnecessary conservatism. To facilitate risk avoidance, the HRP identifies requirements for crew selection, vehicle or mission design. HRP-47065 10 Some human health and performance risks can be mitigated through application of special space medicine operations procedures. The HRP works cl osely with the Space Medici ne Division at JSC to evaluate the relative risks and to determine if the risks can be mitigated through known procedures. This coordination occurs through HRP participation on the HSRB, and interaction at the Human Systems Risk Forum (HSRF). This board and forum have been set up by the Chief Health and Medical Officer with chairmanship delegated to the JSC Chief Medical Officer. Members of this board consider the range of human health and performance risks, and identify those that can be mitigated through operational procedures vs. thos e that require further research. The risks addressed in this IRP are those identified by the HSRB as requiring researc h. The \"inform medical op erations\" deliverables are the results of forum discussions , and research results are integrat ed into medical requirements or flight operations procedures. The HSRB is also used to evaluate the \"deliver countermeasure\" deliverable to ensure countermeasures can be adequately transitioned to medical practice. The HSRB/HSRF is also used to evaluate data at various decision points in the research. The deliverables identified in the plan for \"HSRB\" utili ze the board to concur with the next steps in the research plan. Several other deliverables are iden tified throughout this IRP. Two designations are used for standards deliverables. The deliverable to \"inform standard s\" represents the HRP's intent to communicate information to the OCHMO and medical operations th at may help interpret the existing standard. The \"recommend update for standard\" deliver able is used when the research results are expected to change the standard. 2.0 ORIENTATION SUMMARY OF THE RESEARCH PLAN The IRP describes a plan of re search that addresses both human physiology and the interconnected system of the human and spacecraft in a highly integrat ed manner. It is often not possible to address the risks simply as stand-alone units. The knowledge or mitigation gaps often appear in multiple risks. Many of the specific research tasks address multiple gaps. As such, it is instructive to rearrange the PRD risks into top-level themes characterizing the expected outcom e. Sections 2.1 through 2.5 provide a high-level view of the research approach to the risks in these themes. Section 3.0 arranges the detailed research plans, including text and graphics , for each PRD risk (according to the themes with which the risks are most closely associated). The themes are: 1) Ensure the crew can accomplish the physical tasks of the mission. 2) Ensure the crew can accomplish the cognitive, behavioral, and team aspects of the mission. 3) Ensure the crew receiv es adequate nutrition. 4) Protect the crew from environmental hazards. 5) Provide adequate medical care for the crew. Appendix A gives the risks for each theme, a nd shows which gaps address multiple risks. The interactions between the risks, gaps, and task s are not readily shown in a printed book. The HRP intends to include the IRP in a publicly accessible da tabase (the Human Research Roadmap). In this database, the user will be able to identify quickly th e gaps associated with a risk, the tasks associated with a given gap, the cross-integration of a task across multiple gaps or risks, deliverables associated with a gap or task, etc. HRP-47065 11 2.1 ENSURE THE CREW CAN ACCOMPLISH THE PHYSICAL TASKS OF THE MISSION (Return to Table of Contents) 2.1.1 Risk of Impaired Performance Due to Re duced Muscle Mass, Strength and Endurance 2.1.2 Risk of Reduced Physical Performance Capa bilities Due to Reduced Aerobic Capacity 2.1.3 Risk of Compromised EVA Performance and Crew Health Due to Inadequate EVA Suit Systems 2.1.4 Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Du e to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment Risk of Impaired Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength and Endurance and Risk of Reduced Physical Performance Capabilities Due to Reduced Aerobic Capacity Sections 2.1.1 through 2.1.2 are highly interrelated. Occurrence or mitigation of a risk can be a contributing factor affecting another. Their research appr oaches are given together. Human physiology's \"normal\" response to spaceflight has not been determ ined for these risks. Several studies have been implemented to determine how muscle and aerobic capacity are affected by microgravity; these studies include the new ISS Exercise Prescripti on study, the Functional Task Test and the ISS VO 2max study. The ISS Prescription study will apply principles l earned from ground-based fli ght analogs to an in- flight platform in order to improve exercise coun termeasures efficacy and efficiency by increasing exercise intensity and re ducing exercise volume. Data will guide decision of whether current exercise countermeasures are protective or if improved count ermeasures requiring flight validation studies are needed. The Functional Task Test will be implemented as a flight study as well as a bed rest study. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an integrated set of functional a nd physiological tests and then use these tests to determine how postf light changes in sensorimotor, car diovascular and muscle physiology impact postflight functional performance. Th ese tests will be performed pre and postflight on astronauts exposed to short and long-duration sp ace flight. The Functional Task Test will assess operational relevance of these changes by measuri ng the performance of specific exploration tasks (e.g., simulated seat egress, ladder climb, hatch ope ning, etc.). Additionally changes in functional performance will be mapped standard muscular, neurological, and cardiovascular measures. Data obtained from this study will facilitate the design of countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems responsible for impaired functional performance. The specific aims of the ISS VO 2max study are to measure VO 2max during and following long duration missions and to assess the validity of usin g submaximal measurements of heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO 2) to track changes in aerobic capacity. In addition, non-invasive measurements of cardiac output (Qc) will be performed during exercise to determine if measurement of Qc will improve the accuracy of the submaximal estimations of VO 2max. Results from this study will determine if the current countermeasures are pr otective and need only optimization (e.g., reduced volume, time) or if improved countermeasures and flight validation studies are needed. Due to HRP-47065 12 scheduling constraints with the loss of the Mars tr ansit analog in 2020, several concurrent studies are ongoing. Risk of Compromised EVA Performance and Crew Health Due to Inadequate EVA Suit Systems To ensure completion of the physical tasks of th e mission, the EVA suit system must allow safe and efficient performance of critical mi ssion activities outside the habitat or vehicle. The Human Research Program has tasked the EVA Physiology, Systems a nd Performance (EPSP) Project to work with the Constellation EVA Systems Project Office to develop and execute an integrated human testing program across multiple environments to collect objective da ta needed to make informed design decisions in creating an EVA suit system that will optimize human health and performance. The research approach is to evaluate various parameters affecting hum an EVA performance, such as metabolic cost and biomechanics of different suit designs and operational concepts; impacts of suit weight, mass, pressure, center of gravity (cg), and the quant ities of consumables required to s upport EVA. Other research tasks will determine biomedical monitoring requirements, methods to minimize suit-induced trauma, and operational concepts to improve work and task efficien cy. This work will be done as a series of inter- related ground studies using multiple analog envir onments including, but not limited to, the Partial Gravity Simulator (Pogo) and Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) at the Johnson Space Center, parabolic flight, Desert Research and Technol ogy Studies (D-RATS), the Haughton Mars Project (HMP), and NEEMO. Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to In adequately Designed Vehicles, Environments, Tools, or Equipment This risk focuses on the overall environment in whic h the crew lives and works, which influences the development of hardware and interfaces, as well as how those interf aces will facilitate human performance and efficiency. Displays, controls, and procedures need to be appropriately designed and developed to allow for safe and efficient execution of tasks. Specific studies investigate the environment(s) surrounding the crew, namely the ac oustic environment that can influence both health and performance. Other studies focus upon the vibr ation, acceleration, and microgravity environments, again all having potential to impact human health and performance. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop a thorough understanding of the operational concepts, dete rmine the methods, the metrics, and the verification strategies to ensure that both hardware and environment are designed for human safety and productivity. 2.2 ENSURE THE CREW CAN ACCOMPLISH TH E COGNITIVE, BEHAVIORAL, AND TEAM ASPECTS OF THE MISSION (Return to Table of Contents) 2.2.1 Risk of Behavioral a nd Psychiatric Conditions 2.2.2 Risk of Performance Errors Due to Sleep Lo ss, Circadian Desynchronization, Fatigue, and Work Overload 2.2.3 Risk of Performance Errors Due to Poor Team Cohesion and Performance, Inadequate Selection/Team Composition, Inadequate Training, and Poor Psychosocial Adaptation 2.2.4 Risk of Errors Due to Poor Task Design HRP-47065 13 2.2.5 Risk of Error Due to Inadequate Information 2.2.6 Risk of Impaired Ability to Maintain Cont rol of Vehicles and Other Complex Systems Risk of Behavioral a nd Psychiatric Conditions , Risk of Performance Errors Due to Sleep Lo ss, Circadian Desynchronization, Fatigue, and Work Overload Risk of Performance Errors Due to Poor Team Cohe sion and Performance, Inadequate Selection/Team Composition, Inadequate Training, and Poor Psychosocial Adaptation Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.3 are highly interrelated. Occurrence or mitigation of a risk can be a contributing factor a ffecting another. Risk of Behavioral a nd Psychiatric Conditions Early detection of stress or other risk factors during spaceflight is im perative to deter development of behavioral or psychiatri c conditions which could se riously harm and negatively impact the individual or the crew, and pose serious consequences for a ccomplishing mission objectiv es or jeopardizing the mission altogether. Toward this end, BHP is de veloping methods for monito ring behavioral health during a Lunar and Mars Mission, a nd adapting and refining various tool s and technologies for use in the spaceflight environment. These measures and tools will be used to monitor, detect, and treat early risk factors. BHP will utilize analogs to test, furthe r refine, and validate these measures for Exploration Missions. BHP also develops countermeasures fo r maintaining behavioral health and enhancing performance during long duration isolated, confined, and highly autonomous missions and provides updates for behavioral health a nd performance standards. Risk of Performance Errors Due to Sleep Lo ss, Circadian Desynchronization, Fatigue, and Work Overload Ground evidence clearly demonstrates that performance impairments can occur when sleep is attained in quantities similar to that attained by astronaut s in flight. A correlation between sleep quantity and performance during spaceflight however has not been documented. BHP research aims to accurately characterize and quantify this Risk by implementing studies on ISS that utilize validated measures for assessing performance relative to fatigue. BHP research efforts further investigate contributors to sleep loss, fatigue, circadian desynchronization, and work overload, by evaluating environmental factors, individual vuln erabilities, and various aspects of mission operations. Such investigations help to inform the optimal countermeasure strategy for mitigating the health and performance effects of sleep loss and related issues in flight. As an example, preliminary studies indicate that li ght exposure can correct difficulties in sleep patterns that occur with shift work, jet lag and sleep disord ers. Current efforts aim to inve stigate optimal lighting requirements for the space vehicle, as well as safe and e fficacious methods for implementing lighting as a countermeasure. Other countermeasures that are currently being investigated include recommendations around sleep hygiene, optimal work-res t schedules, flight ru les and requirements, and the effectiveness and safety of sleep-wake medication use in flight. Risk of Performance Errors Due to Poor Team Cohe sion and Performance, Inadequate Selection/Team Composition, Inadequate Training, and Poor Psychosocial Adaptation HRP-47065 14 While little empirical data have been collected regarding the impact of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors on spaceflight performance, it is possible th at crew conflict could jeopardize long duration Exploration Missions. Reports from Mir reveal that several missions may have been terminated earlier than planned due to interpersonal frictions between crewmembers, and some veteran NASA astronauts have reported crew conflict during previous sp ace travels. Understand ing the potential negative impacts of interpersonal and intrapersonal issues from spaceflight and releva nt, high fidelity analog environments is important for identifying countermeasures to aid crewmembers (ground and space) during exploration missions (e.g., moon and Mars) where operations will require more autonomy. BHP will conduct literature reviews and interviews of crew and opera tions personnel to determine the most likely and most serious threats to crew cohe sion, crew performance, and crew-ground interaction that might be expected for exploration missions. The interviews will be used to formulate objective measures for monitoring crew cohesion and develop approaches to enhance current training and build upon the current highly successful in-flight support services and countermeasures. These measures will be tested for feasibility and acceptability in the appropriate analog environment(s). These tests w ill be followed by studies of ISS crew composition and crew cohesion/performance. As crews begin operations for long duration missions be yond low Earth orbit, they will need to exercise increasing command and control of their daily activiti es. The distance for Mars Missions will result in loss of capability for real-time communication, dow nlink, and commanding. Likewise, the crew will have to augment and adapt their schedules based on real time changes in their schedules. The extreme distance and the duration of the planned Mars mi ssion, are at the boundaries of our current knowledge. A better understanding of how to approach and address autonomous operations and its impact on crew dynamics and performance will help inform standard s and countermeasures. BHP is collaborating with Space Medicine in a study of crew autonomy while we are still in low Earth orbit, to identify the impact (if any) of increased autonomy on crew dynamics and performance. The BHP will test conflict management approach es in ground and analog environments, and subsequently on the ISS. Risk of Error Due to Poor Task Design, Risk of Error Due to Inadequate Information , and Risk of Impaired Ability to Maintain Cont rol of Vehicles and Other Complex Systems Sections 2.2.4 through 2.2.6 are highly interrelated. Occurrence or mitigation of a risk can be a contributing factor a ffecting another. The strategies for addressing these three risks are in tertwined. The work described under the first risk (Task Design) focuses on planning how a given task or mission objective will be accomplished, as well as on how to decide what skills, tools, equipment, and information are needed to accomplish a task. It also provides tools and guidelines for determin ing optimal combinations of automation and human involvement. Work under the second risk (Inadequate Information) contributes to the crew having adequate knowledge, skills, and info rmation at the time the task needs to be performed. The third risk, (Impaired Ability to Maintain Control) specifical ly addresses impairment in the sensorimotor system due to changes in gravity, and searches for m eans to minimize the impact of these changes on performance. HRP-47065 15 Risk of Error Due to Poor Task Design The risk associated with designing tasks focuses specifically on the proce ss of assigning roles and responsibilities to individual cr ewmembers, a group of crewmembers, automation, ground support or various combinations of actors. SHFE specifically studies issues in designi ng tasks to be performed jointly by humans and automation, and deciding how much responsibility to assign to an automated system. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop and specify \"best practices\" for human- automation function allocation, crew/automation in terface design, incorporation considerations for crew workload and situational awareness in mixed-initiative operations concept design, and determination methods that ensure effective levels of trust between the crew and automation while avoiding unacceptable levels of crew complacency. To mitigate this risk, it is necessary to develop an adequate understanding of human characteristics with respect to automation, determin e optimal workload levels, and understand situational awareness. Mitigations to this risk will include requirements and guidelines for human in terfaces to automation. This leads into the Risk of Error Due to Inadequate Information. Risk of Error Due to Inadequate Information The risk focuses on identifying the sources of crew performance erro rs. The lack of situational awareness that might be due to poorly designed interfaces or tasks is such an example. The subsequent development of information-presentation standards reduces operator errors in spaceflight through adequate understanding of the causes and mitigations of the errors. As the topic of inadequate information is comprehensive, the approach to mitigating this risk is to focus on the display of information, the types of controls that interf ace between the human and the displays, and the procedures to accomplish tasks. It is not possible to separate the strategy for mitiga ting this risk from the strategy for dealing with the risk of Errors due to Poor Task Design. The inform ation that is needed to perform a task at a given time depends substantially on the natu re of the task and the crewmembers' roles and responsibilities. The work described under this risk presumes the task is well designed, and focuses on the problems of ensuring the necessary information is presented so a timely, accurate performance is accomplished. Risk of Impaired Ability to Maintain Cont rol of Vehicles and Other Complex Systems New evidence regarding landing performance indicates that research into these types of issues is not a high priority for Shuttle or ISS. However, since Mars operational scenarios are still TBD, it is agreed that the ISS should be utilized to gath er the data required to define the research that might be needed to enable future Mars mission operations. It first must be determined what releva nt spaceflight data exist and if it is accessible. If so, this data must be analyzed; if not, the data must be collected. In addition, performance related to neurosenso ry dysfunction should be used to determine the need for further research and countermeasure development. Space normal must first be defined for this risk; da ta mining tasks are ongoing. Once the definition is in place, the data will be presented to the HSRF, and a determination made on whether countermeasures need to be devel oped. In addition, the NR A solicitation process was utilized to obtain proposals to determine any manual and visual control deficits. 2.3 ENSURE THE CREW RECEIV ES ADEQUATE NUTRITION (Return to Table of Contents) HRP-47065 16 2.3.1 Risk Factor of Inadequate Nutrition 2.3.2 Risk of Inadequate Food System Risk Factor of Inadequate Nutrition As mission duration increases, the risk of nutrient deficiencies becomes greater. Nutrient requirements, delivery requirements, and the need to preserve the nutrient content in f ood will increase as the frequency and duration of EVAs increase and long Mars missions. Nutritional countermeasures can influence all systems. Space normal must be defined for this risk; the Nutrition SMO is ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the HSRF and it will be decide d if countermeasures need to be developed. In addition, several studies are ongoing to determine the optimal dose of vitamin D. Risk of Inadequate Food System Studies of the stability of food nut rients will identify vitamins and am ino acids at risk for degradation in space food supply; identify changes in fatty acids of foods flown on ISS, and characterize degradation profiles of the unstabl e nutrients. A ground study uses radiation exposure to test the stability of various food and pharmaceutical components; the results of the study will be compared to ongoing flight data being collected. The shelf life of the current thermostabilized food products have never been determined. Food items with varied formulations and bulk ingredients are now in accelerated shelf life testing. The approach will provide critical inform ation about the susceptibility of vitamins in the space food system to adverse e nvironmental factors and storage encountered during space missions. The Advanced Food Technology Project is responsibl e for optimizing methods required to preserve, package, and ship, stow, and prepare the food wh ile still preserving the nutritional value. The nutritional content of the flight f ood items is not currently measured. However the reto rt, irradiation, and freeze-drying processes used to produce shelf stab le products, reduce the nutrient content. The nutrient levels in prepared foods w ill be measured to ensure that they meet the requirements of nutrition as specified by the nutrition standards and as dete rmined through the Nutrition SMO mentioned above. If the nutrient levels are not ade quate, other preservation methods that maintain the nutrient content of the foods will be investigated. Reducing the flight resources required for the food sy stem is a major goal due to the significant ratios of rocket size to mass per pound of cargo delivere d on an exploration mission. Methods to reduce packaging mass and volume overhead will be studied. These studies must overcome challenges such as storing food for extended periods (i .e., 18 months for ISS, up to 5 years for a long duration mission having pre-positioned food). Food packaging materi als must be developed that minimize the mass required, while providing an adequate oxygen and moisture barrier to maintain the required shelf lives. 2.4 PROTECT THE CREW FROM ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS (Return to Table of Contents) 2.4.1 Risk of Carcinogenesi s from Space Radiation 2.4.2 Risk of Acute Radiation Syndromes Due to Solar Particle Events HRP-47065 17 2.4.3 Risk of Acute or Late Central Nervous System Affects from Radiation Exposure 2.4.4 Risk of Degenerative Tissue or Other He alth Effects from Radiation Exposure 2.4.5 Risk of Adverse Health Eff ects from Lunar Dust Exposure 2.4.6 Risk of Accelerated Osteoporosis 2.4.7 Risk of Bone Fracture 2.4.8 Risk of Renal Stone Formation 2.4.9 Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems 2.4.10 Risk of Adverse Health Effects Due to Alt erations in Host-Microorganism Interactions 2.4.11 Risk of Crew Adverse Health Event Due to Altered Immune Response 2.4.12 Risk of Intervertebral Disc Damage 2.4.13 Risk of Orthostatic Intolerance during Re-Exposure to Gravity Risk of Carcinogenesis from Space Radiation , Risk of Acute Radiation Syndromes Due to Solar Particle Events , Risk of Acute or Late Central Nervous System Effects from Radiation Exposure , and Risk of Degenerative Tissue or Other H ealth Effects from Radiation Exposure Sections 2.4.1 through 2.4.4 are highly interrelated. Th e occurrence or mitigation of one risk can be a contributing factor affecting a nother, so the research appro aches are given together. Radiation research does not fo llow the standard Risk-Gap-Task- Deliverable approach defined elsewhere in this document. The radiation element uses data from all funde d studies and provides the integrating component through development of risks assessment tools and design tools. When critical deliverables are needed such as at mission or vehicl e SRR/SDR, crew selection, or for key development of operational products, the radiation element will serve as an advisory function, using the output of the latest independently verified and validated tools. Thus, the many deliverables will not usually map to the end of a specific study, but rather are planned to occur at the key milestones when they are needed. However, tools utilized in the de sign and development of vehicles wi ll be delivered prior to PDR and CDR to be utilized during th e design and analysis cycles. Near-term goals for cancer research focus on reducing the uncertaintie s in risk projections through the development of tissue specific models of cancer ri sks, the underlying mechanistic understanding of these models, and appropriate data collection at the NSRL. In the long-term, extensive validation of these models with mixed radiation fields is envi sioned and research on biological countermeasures and biomarkers will be pursued if needed. Research on improving cancer projections has two major emphases: 1) testing the correctness of the National Council on Ra diation Protection (NCRP) model and 2) reducing the uncertainties in the coefficients that enter into the ca ncer projection model. Research on the validity of th e NCRP model relies on studies at the NSRL observing qualitative differences in biological damage between HZE nucl ei and gamma rays and the establishment of how these differences relate to cancer risk. There are distinct mechanisms of cancer induction across and within major tissue sites, and uncertainty reduction requires tissue specific risk estimates. NRA and HRP-47065 18 NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) sele ctions focus on these major sites: lung, breast, colon, stomach, esophagus, the blood system (leukemias), liver, bladder, skin, and brain. There are differences in radiation sensitivity based on genetic and epigenetic factors and research in these areas aids the development of tissu e specific cancer models. The approach to risk quantifica tion and uncertainty reduction is based on modifying the current model for projecting cancer incidence and mortality risk s for space missions. The cancer rate is the key quantity in the evaluation, represen ting the probability at a given age and years since exposure of observing a cancer. The life-span study of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb is the primary source for gamma ray data. More recently, however , meta-analysis data of patients exposed to radiation or reactor workers for several tissue types has become available. This newer data is being used to check or replace the Japanese data. Other a ssumptions in the model are made with regard to the transfer of risk across populations , the use of average rates for the U.S. population, age, and age-after exposure dependence of risk on radi ation quality and dose-rate, etc. Collaborative research with the DoE Low Dose Resear ch Program is a key component of the strategy. The DoE program focus is on low Linear Energy Transf er (LET) irradiation; collaborative grants are also being selected from proposals that contain one or more Speci fic Aims addressing NASA interests using the NSRL. This research augments SR research with a large number of gr ants that use state-of- the art approaches, i.e., genetics, proteomics, and transgenic animal models, etc. The DoE research is an important part of the goal to id entify biomarkers of cancer risk. Determining the shape of the dose-response model fo r cancer induction is a near-term focus that is enumerated in biological terms through various cancer Gaps. In the NCRP model, the dose-response is linear and the slope coeffici ent is modulated by radiation shielding. Non-targeted models of cancer risk describe processes where cells traversed by HZE nuclei or protons produce cancer phenotypes in regions of tissue not limited to the traversed cells. Non-targeted effects are the major mechanism that has been identified that is in di sagreement with the NCRP model, and leads to a sub-linear dose response. The implications of such a dose response for cancer risk are large since such a model predicts a reduced effectiveness for radiation shielding. The impor tance of mission length is also affected by the sub-linear dose response. Research in this area is a major focus of studies at NSRL. For some cancer sites and exposure conditions, for proton exposures, the NCRP model may be adequate. NSRL research is focused on reduc ing the uncertainties in the model through the establishment of tissue-specific models of human cancer s, and collection of data at NSRL for a variety of ground-based analogs for Solar Particle Even t (SPE) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). Systems biology models provide a framework to inte grate mechanistic studies of cancer risk across multiple levels of understanding (molecu lar, cellular, and tissues), and are the most likely approach to replace the NCRP model. Systems biology models are being developed by the Risk Assessment Project and several NSCORs, and, in conjunction with data collection, will improve the descriptions of cancer risk, laying a framework fo r future biological countermeas ure evaluations and biomarker identification. A critical question for the current ph ase of research is to establish pos sible threshold doses for specific CNS risks. Central Nervous System (CNS) risks fr om GCR are a concern due to the possibility of single HZE nuclei traversa ls causing tissue damage as evidenced by the light -flash phenomenon first observed during the Apollo missions. Also, as survival prognosis for patients irradiated for brain tumor treatment has improved, patients have shown persistent CNS changes at long times after treatment with gamma rays suggesting a possible CNS risk for a larg e SPE. Furthermore, animal studies of behavior and performance with HZE radiation suggest detr imental changes may occur during long-term GCR exposures. Currently, there is no pr ojection model for CNS risks of concern to NASA. The values of HRP-47065 19 possible thresholds for CNS risks and knowledge on how to extrapolate possible thresholds to individual astronauts is a key milestone in the long-term research plan. Cataracts have long been a research focus of SR . More recently, several epidemiological studies, including results from the atomic-bomb survivors and nuclear reactor workers, have identified an increased risk of stroke and cor onary heart disease (CHD) for low LET radiation at doses comparable to those of a Mars mission, or a lunar mission incurri ng a large SPE. Because th e risk of heart disease is a recent finding, preliminary studies in these areas are seeking to establish possible distinctions in mechanisms for this risk between protons, HZE nucle i, and gamma rays. As an adjunct, SRPE will take advantage of studies by the European Union in this area, wherein the Union is supporting large- scale mouse studies of CHD. These studies should present new insights into the nature of the low LET (gamma-ray) risk at low dose-rates comparable to space conditions, and identify appropriate mouse strains to be used in future SR studies. An increased risk of cataracts a ssociated with low dose space radia tion has been reported from past NASA missions, and is being followed up with a clinical study of cataract progres sion rates in current or retired astronauts. Several NSRL studies of risks are supported to improve the understanding of how protons and HZE nuclei induce cata racts, and to identify possible countermeasure approaches. A variety of acute radiation syndr omes are of concern following a large SPE exposure. Radiation sicknesses, i.e., the prodromal risk s, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. These effects are manifested within 4 to 24 hours post-exposure for sub-lethal doses, with a latency time inversely correlated with dose. Furthermore, there is a reasonable concern of a compromised immune system, due to high skin doses from a SPE leading to burns, or other flight factors, albeit the possibility of acute death through the collapse of the blood forming syst ems is negligible. One research emphasis is to pursue the role of the immune system in acute ri sks. Animal and cell culture models and possible countermeasure approaches to acute risks are expected to be distinct from cancer and other radiation risks. In the long-term, the SR will consider research on fertility, sterility, and hereditary risks from space radiation, and may request the NSBRI support these areas becaus e of their unique nature. Risk of Adverse Health Eff ects from Lunar Dust Exposure The toxicological effects of lunar dusts have not been studied in sufficient depth to develop an exposure standard for operations on the lunar surface. Lunar dust is somewhat similar to volcanic ash, which is used by NASA as a lunar-dust stimulant; how ever, dusts on the lunar surface have worrisome properties in regards to human health . Lunar dusts have a high content in the respirable size range, they have a high surface area that is chemically reactiv e, and elemental iron \"nano-particles\" are imbedded in the dust. These unusual properties may cause the resp irable dusts to be at l east moderately toxic to the respiratory system, and the larger grains to be abrasive to the skin & eye. NASA needs to set airborne exposure standards based on scientific evid ence so that vehicle desi gns can effectively control exposure. Operations must be designed to minimize the risk of abrasion to skin and eyes. The research approach is to evaluate and characteri ze each factor contributing to toxicity of the lunar dust, and then synthesize these data into a recomme nded standard via the Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Assessment Group (LADTAG). The HRP has committe d to recommending this standard in 2010, when it is needed prior to developm ent of Lunar Operations concepts. Focused studies have already commenced to determ ine size distributions, shap e characteristics, and chemical composition of lunar particulates. L unar dust surface activation studies will attempt to HRP-47065 20 replicate solar wind and micrometeorite bombardment ., Understanding the process of both activation and of passivation in a habitable environment (water vapor and oxygen) will dete rmine potential health effects and exposure limits occurri ng during mission-related tasks, as we ll as the mode of action within the human system. The generation of reactive oxyge n species (ROS) will be one marker of potential toxicity. Active vs. non-active dust will be tested to determine the differences in toxicity due to chemical activation. In vivo studies include inhalation to xicity and intratrachael instillati on (ITI) testing of lunar dust. Gross pathology and histopathology will be performed to gather evidence of the degree and nature of lunar dust toxicity. Lung lavage will be used to determine the biochemical and cellular response of the lung to insult by lunar dust. Several crewmembers reported derm al and ocular issues resulting from lunar dust exposure during Apollo missions. Other than these anecdotal reports, there is no objectiv e scientific data to support an understanding of the dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dusts. Ground studies will determine the extent to which dermal and ocular hazards may be present for visual decrement and vapor barrier loss during lunar operations, especially EVAs with dus t inside. Periodic cleaning of the EVA suit is expected to mitigate this hazard. Risk of Accelerated Osteoporosis and Risk of Bone Fracture The two risks listed above comp rise Sections 2.4.6 and 2.4.7, and are highly interrelated; the occurrence or mitigation of one risk possibly affects th e other. The combined research risk approaches are presented below. It is currently possible to 1) tr ack the course of changes in bone mineral density and bone quality during long duration missions, 2) determine if bone losse s will occur during a Mars visit, and 3) know such information to determine the risk of fracture upon return to Earth after a Mars mission. However, these capabilities are not a part of any requirements documents for Lunar or Mars missions. Even after 6-month missions, currently there are indications that bone quality/strength does not recover as quickly as bone mineral density. This may represent a long- term health effect (inc reased osteoporosis and fracture risk) related to this disc ordant recovery dynamic. This information is required to assess long- term health risks to returning crew. While bone atrophy during spaceflight is known and requires mitigation; the time course of in-flight bone changes, the time course of post-flight recovery, and individual suscep tibilities have not been determined. The 2007 NASA Research Announcement was utilized to solicit a nd select proposals to gather these space normal data. In addition, work is ongoing with the Spa ce Medicine Division to obtain long-term recovery data. The long-term goal s are to develop and deliver countermeasures for long-term missions while tracking th e efficacy of these countermeasures to prevent increased lifetime health risk. Due to schedule cons traints, countermeasure development has been started in parallel with space normal data collection and technology development. The fracture risk for bone is related to the applied load-to-bone ratio a nd to the fracture load of bone. Thus, the increased fracture risk induced by spacef light is suggested collectively as an adaptive response by the accelerated loss of bone mass, by weightlessness, and by reduced gravity fields experienced during missions, as well as by the loads and torques that the skeleton is subjected to during tasks performed during the missions. The most critical work needed for this risk is the measures of in- flight changes in bone mass over the course of ISS mi ssions. This allows the prediction of temporal changes in bone mass during Mars missions. Those da ta will provide a basis for evaluating whether the HRP-47065 21 expected loads/torques to bone during human perfor mance on a mission will exceed the failure load of bone (i.e., fracture load). This knowledge will drive mission operations planning. The Risk of Bone Fracture deals with a fracture occu rring during a mission. A fracture considered of \"high\" risk is characteristic of osteoporosis, a disease characterized by losses in bone mass and in structural deterioration. Therefore, gaps and tasks that fall un der the Risk of Accel erated Osteoporosis are also mapped to the Risk of Bone Fracture. Th e only current independent gap for the Risk of Bone Fracture is the unknown incidence of vertebral compression fractures. The task associated with this independent gap is being complete d by the Space Medicine Division. Risk of Renal Stone Formation Space normal must first be defined for this risk. Data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space \"normal\" is defined, the data will be presented to the HSRF and a decision of whether countermeasures need to be developed will be made. The evidence establishing the risk factors and/or the likelihood of risk occurrence for renal stone formation is either known or in-progress. The activities in this area are intended to compile data related to the risk of renal stone formation, from medical da ta and from raw research data used for previously published reports. From this data, th e task is to determine primary and other risk factors for renal stone formation, particularly regarding th e types of stones formed (to iden tify the specific risk factor and appropriate countermeasure), the correlation with diet, a nd the time course for formation. Ground data mining and final analysis of the previous Renal Stone Flight Study will be used to determine if further work is warranted for this risk. Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems Heart rhythm disturbances have been seen among astr onauts. Most have been related to cardiovascular disease, but it is unclear whether this was due to pre- existing conditions or to the effects of space flight. It is believed that advanced screening for coronary disease has greatly mitigated this risk. Other heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibrillation, can de velop over time, necessitati ng periodic screening of crewmembers' heart rhythms. Beyo nd these terrestrial heart risks, so me concern exists that prolonged exposure to microgravity may lead to heart rhythm disturbances. A lthough this has not been observed to date, further surveillance is warranted. Space normal must first be defined for this risk and data mining ta sks are ongoing. Once the definition is determined, the data will be presented to the HSRF and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. The HRP will conduct a comprehensive study that integr ates the objectives of two NRA investigations and a SMO, involving both intramural and extramural investigators. In-fli ght testing will require Holter monitoring, two-dimensional (2D) echoc ardiography, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. After completion of the study, the clinical expres sion of cardiac atrophy during long duration spaceflight will be define d clearly, and its significance for cardiac systolic and diastolic function at rest and during gravit ational transitions will be elucid ated. In addition, preliminary information will be obtained regarding ventricula r conduction and re-polarization that will provide either strong clinical r eassurance, or pathophysiologic insight into the risk for cardi ac arrhythmias. Based on the outcome of this investigation, the HRP will determine if countermeasures are necessary to prevent these conditions. HRP-47065 22 Risk of Adverse Health Effects Due to Alte rations in Host-Microorganism Interactions Current preventative measures limit the presence of many of the medically significant microorganisms during a mission, although infections are not completely eradicated. Alterations in some microbial characteristics have been observed in organisms gr own in flight, including virulence (disease-causing potential), as indicated by recent evidence. Due to the evidence, the HRP plans to compare samples collected on the ground samples with on-orbit samples co llected aboard ISS. Particular attention will be paid to equipment, the SHFH element, and air a nd water systems. This comparison will clarify the extent of possible altera tion by microbes in spaceflight. Given operational controls th at are in place onboard spacecraft now, the HRP will de termine if potential microbial changes warrant retaining this risk, whether the existing controls are adequate, and whether additional mitigation techniques should be developed. Risk of Crew Adverse Health Even t Due to Altered Immune Response There are no procedures currently in place to monitor immune function or its effect on crew health. Immune dysregulation has been demonstrated to o ccur during spaceflight, yet l ittle in-flight immune data has been generated to assess whether or not this may be a clinical problem. Thus, HRP will conduct the \"Integrated Immune SMO\" to assess the clinical risks resulting from the adverse effects of space flight on the human immune system and will validate a flight-compatible immune monitoring strategy. The correlation between in-flight immunity, physio logical stress and a measurable clinical outcome (viral reactivation) will be determined for l ong- vs. short-duration space flight. Data from this study will be combined with the Shuttle-based immune studies to inform and update health standards. Additionally, ground analogs such as NEEMO will be evaluated to determine if they represent a good analog for short-duration spaceflight. This immune dysregulation analog will be validated for some aspects of that dysregulati on if it is observed in the NEEMO crew s (similar to that already observed in flight crews during/following spaceflight). Data from ground studies and the Integrated Immune SMO will be assessed to determine countermeasure development needs. Risk of Intervertebral Disk Damage Evidence from medical operations indicates that astr onauts have a higher incidence of intervertebral disk damage than the general population. Additional work to determine the extent of this problem should be done. Once completed, the findings will be used to guide the design of re-entry and post- flight protocols, as well as future re-entry spacecraft, as appropriate. Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence, data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to th e HSRF and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. Risk of Orthostatic Intoleran ce due to Re-Exposure to Gravity Twenty percent of Shuttle crewmembers and up to 83% of returning ISS crewmembers suffer hypotension and presyncope or syncope during 10 mi nutes of upright tilt on landing day. This may constitute a risk when crewmemb ers experience Earth's gravity af ter exposure to microgravity. Currently available countermeasures are not effectiv e in all crewmembers; in particular, women are more susceptible than men are. While it is we ll known that crewmembers can be incapacitated by orthostatic intolerance after six-month missions when th ey return to Earth's grav ity, it is not known the degree to which this may be ameliorated in the gr avity environment on the Martian surface. Early HRP-47065 23 surface operations may require astronauts to be upright and active soon after landing on Mars. A combination of countermeasures, both physical and pharmaceutical, should be pursued for this risk. It is not known if exposure to 1/6 g and 3/8 g will cause orthostatic intolerance or will have mitigating effects on orthostatic intole rance upon return to 1 g. Space normal has been defined for this risk. Current research efforts are investigations for the efficacy of new countermeasures (i.e., Jobst stockings a nd pharmacological agents). The new lunar analog currently under development will be utilized to unde rstand the role of the lunar gravity as protection from orthostatic intolerance. In addition, gende r effects and the possibility for gender-specific countermeasures are also being investigated. 2.5 PROVIDE ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE FOR THE CREW (Return to Table of Contents) 2.5.1 Risk of Inability to Adequately Tr eat and Ill or Injured Crew Member 2.5.2 Risk of Therapeutic Failure Due to Ineffectiveness of Medication Risk of Inability to Adequately Tr eat an Ill or Injured Crew Member To address this broad risk, the ExMC has broken it down into seven categories that correspond with the seven requirements allocated to the ExMC from the HRP Program Requirements Document (PRD). Each of the seven categories is th en analyzed individually to determ ine where gaps exist in satisfying the PRD requirements. Below are the seven categories into which the risk has been separated and an explanation of the strate gy for addressing the different categories of gaps. 1.0 Validate Standards : The NASA HQ OCHMO Standards fo r Crew Selection and Retention will require changes as new medical information and spaceflight technology becomes available. Additionally, NASA exploration missions may re quire new knowledge and/or new technology development either to support current standards or to modify standards for mission success. In either situation, the ExMC Element Scientist, through Space Medicine, will determine research needs and develop the research requirements and/or tasks necessary to fulfill this responsibility. The NASA HQ OCHMO standards that pertain to th is risk are Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. The Space Medicine Me dical Operations Lead for sta ndards, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determines gaps in knowledge in the current Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. Tasks are then identifi ed to close those knowledge gaps. 2.0 Quantify the Risk: Because of the limited available ope rational and research data, incidence rates and outcomes for relevant medical conditions have large uncertainties associated with them. The Space Medicine Exploration Condition Li st is analyzed to determine gaps in our knowledge about medical conditions' incidence rates and outcomes in spaceflight. Tasks are then assigned to further study, model, and use analog population data to better quantify the medical conditions. 3.0 Mitigate the Risk: Gaps in this section deal with our knowledge about effective training and telementoring programs for Exploration missions . The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for training, working with the ExMC Elemen t Scientist, determines gaps in knowledge and techniques for developing future crew, f light surgeon and biomedical ground controller training and telementoring programs. Tasks are then identified to cl ose those knowledge gaps. HRP-47065 24 4.0 Monitor and Treat the Unmitigated Risk: Based on the Space Medicine Exploration Condition List, each condition is analyzed for each Constellation Design Reference Mission (DRM) for the capabilities required to monito r and treat the conditi on. An analysis is performed to determine where gaps exist in current technologies or where efficiencies could be realized in the future. Based on when a techno logy needs to come online, a technology watch is implemented or a technology development project is initiated to deli ver the technology to enable the mission. 5.0 Provide Enabling Capabilities: Provide data integration and management for HRP to ensure proper handling of data (e.g. Life Sciences Data Archive, Mission Extended Medical Enterprise). Gaps exist where these capabi lities are either insufficient or incomplete. 6.0 Comply with Agency Standards: Follow best practices a nd programmatic guidelines as levied by the HRP PRD. There are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. 7.0 Reduce Resource Requirements: Wherever possible, reduce in flight and funding resources. There are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. Risk of Therapeutic Failure due to Ineffectiveness of Medication Better recordkeeping of medication us e, its effectiveness, and the side effects produced (if any) should be instituted. This will provide evidence for or an d should be a precursor to a formal assessment of Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) on-orbit. It is thought that the reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) motility and f unction, is not an issue after the fi rst few days of flight, and is offered as the first piece of evidence for this gap. In general, Space Medicine avoids prescribing oral medications during this period of the mission. It is not known to what extent different volumes of distribution might be a factor in flight. Drugs selected for th e PK/PD studies should be commonly used, have few side effects, and different metabolic pathways. External consultants should be used to determine which drugs to test and to design testing protoc ols. Space Medicine needs to develop a process and procedures to systema tically track crew medi cation use, including subjective comments on efficacy and side effects, particularly for ISS. It is very important to know what pharmaceuticals are taken prior to in-flight tasks. The overarching strategy for this risk is to obtain better record keep ing of medication use, efficacy, and side effects. This includes several data mining tasks, which will provide evidence for or against this risk. If evidence indicates the ineffectiveness of medications, a pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics study will be performed in flight to obtain further information. 3.0 ELEMENTS INPUT DESCRIPTIO N LOCATED IN APPENDIX A The format for the Elements' inputs includes graphical depiction via Gantt charts and written discourse to clarify the Element approach. Each input follows the same form. The Risk is reported, along with the criticality to the Lunar Outpost mission and the Mars mission; the Operational Relevance is described; the strategy for mitigation is given; the gaps in knowledge are reported with a brief description; and the activity or act ivities necessary to address the ga p are described. For each activity, the resulting product/deliverable, the required delivery milestone fo r the deliverable, the required platform, and the Project or organization responsib le for implementing the activity are all defined. HRP-47065 25 3.1 RISKS Each text description has a descript ion of the risk. These descriptions are verbatim from the PRD, and are reprinted in the IRP as a matter of convenience for the reader. With the title of each risk, the criticality is given. Crit icality ratings correspond to the criteria given in Section 1.4.1 of this document. 3.2 CONTEXT OF RISK FOR EXPLORATION After each risk and description, a paragraph occurs en titled \"Operational Relevance and Risk Context.\" In this paragraph, a description of the relevance to the exploration mission is given. This section also provides the context of how the research plan is built for that risk and describes the need for the research at a very high level. 3.3 STRATEGY FOR MITIGATION The approach strategy for the mitigation of the risk is outlined in this section. For instance, the strategy may be to first determine space normal physiol ogy, then identify specific countermeasures. 3.4 GAPS Gaps in our knowledge or in the evidence base exist for each risk. These gaps have several different forms. A gap may exist in our evidence base, whic h leaves greater uncertain ty regarding the likelihood of the risk. A gap may exist in the identification of the appropriate countermeasure. For others, the gap may be in the flight validation of the appropriate countermeasure. For the purposes of this IRP, the gaps are not delineated by type; rather they are simply identified as a gap that must be filled before the risk is mitigated. In some cases, the gap may not re quire research to close it; the gap can be avoided altogether through specific C onstellation design selection. 3.5 TASKS For each gap, the task (s) required to fill that gap are listed. The task is named and a short description is given. In some cases, a task can address multiple ga ps across multiple risks. To limit the size of this document, a task that addresses more than one gap is named and described once and the description is referred to in the other gaps that it is intended to fill. In addition, the project responsible for implementation of the task is list ed, along with the antici pated procurement method. In some cases, the project is not within the Element re sponsible for the risk. The responsible Element will coordinate with the appropriate project in those cases. 3.6 DELIVERABLES Each task is designed to culminate in a deliverable. These deliverables are structured to feed into the Constellation Program, the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer, or the Mission Operations Directorate. Several different t ypes of deliverables exist. The following are the types of deliverables used: Information for Standards An \"Information for Standards\" deliverable is used for a task that pr oduces part of the information to update a standard. Because this in formation is incomplete, the program would not be in a position to recommend a standard update, but it would represent a significant step toward such a recommendation. HRP-47065 26 These tasks can feed into other tasks that also have information for standards, or they can be combined with other \"Information for Standa rds\" deliverables to result in a recommended standard update (next deliverable) Recommended Standard Update A \"Recommended Standard Update\" deliv erable is mandated when the program is ready to provide the OCHMO with a recommended update to health or perf ormance standards. This is usually done using the results of several tasks and th en integrated into one recommendati on for update. A key test of when to use this as a deliverable is that the program should be ready to actually write the text for the recommended standard update. Since the standards are applied in a broad spectrum for design and operations, these deliverables ca n be linked to any of the syst em design or mission operations milestones shown in the blue section at the top of the chart. They should be applied as early in the design phase or mission operations deve lopment phase as is possible, so , most often, they are necessary prior to Systems Requirements Review. Informing Mission Operations This form of deliverable is needed when the informa tion is directly useful to affect mission planning. Examples include when a deliverable may impose mi ssion operations timelining c onstraints, such as a new flight rule for sleep schedules or exercise timelines. As the name implies, these deliverables will most often affect the Mission Operations line shown in the blue section of the top of the Gantt charts. Countermeasure When a specific protocol is developed and validated to prevent or reduce th e severity of a negative outcome identified in one of the ri sks, this is the form of deliv erable. A countermeasure may be medical, physical, or operational entities, such as pharmaceuticals, a device, or a specific exercise routine, respectively. Note that in some cases th e countermeasure will also affect mission operations (in areas like timelines). Though ther e is no fixed rule on this crossover, the demarcation used for the countermeasure deliverable is that the protocol is specific and extens ive enough to require validation in spaceflight. For instance, if a ground task results in a spaceflight task that is called \"flight validation studies,\" it likely is a countermeasure. Similarly, there is no set rule for determining to which Constellation milestone a counterme asure would apply. Some genera l direction on this, however, is that the countermeasure usually does not affect th e design of the spacecraft, and is applied in the mission operations phase as a solution to a problem; thus, the countermeasure deliverables generally affect the mission operations PDR or CDR phases. Information to Other Elements This deliverable is used when the task result f eeds a gap in some other HRP element. As the IRP matures, we will identify critical dependencies fo r each gap. These critical dependencies will include, in some cases, information developed under another gap. The need dates for these deliverables are determined by when the other element needs th e information, not by Constellation milestones. Requirements to Other Programs or Elements The \"Requirements to Other Programs or Elements\" deli verable is chosen when a task will result in a requirement (or requirements set) given to another program (usually the Constellation Program) or to HRP-47065 27 another element. The task may end up in the require ments on the lighting spectrum in the vehicle, or a requirement may apply to the radiation shielding de sign, or requirements may be identified that apply to the food system from nutritional ri sk work. These deliverables often feed the design of the vehicle and its sub-systems. As requirements, they primar ily are applied in the Systems Requirements Review timeframe. Updates to the Human Systems Risk Forum When a task results in information that must be considered by the medical operations community and/or OCHMO, this deliverable is used. This deliverable is applicable when the rating of the likelihood or consequences of the RM AT may be affected. It is also applied when the results of the study are anticipated by the space medical operations community. As such, the deliverable often is applied in conjunction with the \"Infor ming Mission Operations\" deliverable. 3.7 REQUIRED DELIVERY MILESTONE Key milestones within the Conste llation Program development drive the required date for the HRP deliverables. For instance, design requirements typically must be defined by the appropriate System Requirements Review. Design soluti ons and technology typically must be defined to a TRL6 level by the Preliminary Design Review. This section documents the schedule drivers for the delivery milestones. 3.8 REQUIRED PLATFORMS This section defines the platform required to perf orm the research. Platforms can be designated as ground analog environments, such as NEEMO, Antarctic a, etc., or the platform may be a space-based one, such as the Shuttle or the ISS. Also, the luna r surface is a platform that is anticipated in some research efforts. If the ISS is required, a summ ary of the following resource requirements is given: Number of subjects, Initial Up mass, Upmass/Subject, Downmass, Crew Time/Subject, and Post-Flight Baseline Data Collection Time. 3.9 PROJECT OR ORGANIZATION RESPON SIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY Within the HRP elements, there are one or many projects chosen to implement the element research plan. The project is identified in this section. In some cases, or ganizations outside the element are responsible for implementation of the research, such as the NSBRI or even an international partner. These organizations are iden tified within this section. This section indicates the project with primary responsibility for im plementing the activity. In some cases, the project is not within the element responsible for the risk. The el ement responsible will coordinate with the appropriate project in those cases. Discipline teams include the participation of operations personnel, the NASA research discipline experts, and the NSBRI. In seve ral cases, the primary responsibil ity is shown as that of NASA; however, that does not mean that th e NSBRI is not participating at al l. The NSBRI participates through the discipline teams, as well as through future solicitations. HRP-47065 28 3.10 GRAPHIC INPUT Each graphic is supported with text that provides a more thorough leve l of detail. Figure 2 shows an example of a Gantt chart, la beling each section of the ch art. Each Gantt chart is associated with one of the 27 PRD Risks. The element to which the risk is allocated is identified in the upper left corner. The research gaps are identified by name and number al ong the left side for each risk. Under each gap are the identified activities required to fill the gap. Each activity is identified by name and the acronym of the project or organization responsible for implemen ting the activity. In some cases, the organization responsible for implementing the activ ity may not be directly controlle d by the element responsible for the risk. The schedule of each activity is shown on the graphic and an arrow shows deliverables resulting from the activity. The activities are co lor-coded per the legend give n. A number on each text deliverable description relates the deliverable to th e need date, shown by the gray numbered arrows at the top of the chart. 3.11 DECISION POINTS Several key decision points have been placed in the pl an. At these key decision points, the appropriate forward path for the research will be reevaluated. The decision points are cast in a \"Yes/No\" form, and it is anticipated that at these points, the responsible element will review the ove rall, current state of the evidence, and review the appropriate approach to the forward plan. Where applicable, the Science Management Office will concur a nd, if necessary, the a ppropriate Project Sta nding Review Panel may be convened to deliberate and make recommenda tions. Criteria for making the decision will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will be consistent with the overall management structure documented in the Science Management Plan. In many cases, a task addresses more than one risk. HRP-47065 29 HRP-47065 30 HRP-47065 31 HRP-47065 32 APPENDIX A: Risks HRP-47065 The Risks in this part of th e Appendix are aligned w ith Section 2.1 - Ensure That the Crew Can Complete the Physical Tasks of the Missions 33 HRP-47065 RISK OF IMPAIRED PERFORMANC E DUE TO REDUCED MUSCLE MASS, STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - I, MARS - C There is a growing research database that suggests that skeletal muscles, particularly postural muscles of the lower limb, undergo atrophy and structural and metabolic alterati ons during space flight. However, the relationships between in-flight exercise, muscle changes, and performance levels are not well understood. Efforts should be made to try to unders tand the current status of in-flight and post-flight exercise performance capability and what the goals/ta rget areas for protection are with the current in- flight exercise program. Context of Risk for Exploration Successful lunar outpost and Mars missions will be dependent on the performance of human tasks that will require an adequate level of physical fitness. These tasks may range from simple intra-vehicular activities, to ambulation on a planetary surface, to c onstruction of long standing outpost habitats. The decrements that occur to skeletal muscle strength and endurance in response to reduced gravitational forces could potentially make associated tasks difficu lt to perform. Thus, impaired muscle performance may affect crew performance and mission success, an d in worst-case off-nominal scenarios may impact crewmember health and safety (e.g., muscle soreness, muscle injury). It is therefore essential to identify Critical Mission Tasks, evaluate the muscle performance costs of these tasks (as related to provided tools and equipment), quantify the expected muscle performance decrements during lunar and Mars missions, and design effective exercise countermeasures (exe rcise hardware and exercise prescriptions) that maintain physical fitness at a levels that allow for mission success and safety with minimal time cost to additional mission operations. Strategy for Mitigation This muscle performance data will be taken to the HSRF for review and direction. Due to scheduling constraints with the loss of the Mars transit an alogue in 2020, concurrent exercise prescription optimization studies are ongoing on the ground and will be validated in flight. Similarly, research is ongoing to characterize activiti es of different mission scenarios to help determine the fitness levels required to perform those tasks a nd therefore, determine the exercise prescription for crewmembers. Current research is defining metabolic co sts of some of the critical tasks. In addition, gender effects, hydration effects and lunar EVA effe cts are all being examined as well as the possibility for gender specific countermeasures. Gaps M1: What is the current state of knowledge regarding exercise performance? This gap is closed; the deliverable has been met. M7: Can the current in-flight performance be maintained with reduced exercise volume? This gap should determine the effects of reduced in-flight exerci se; this is a high priority gap. Efforts should be made to try to improve efficiency of the current I SS regime. Identification of which combinations of CEVIS, TVIS, and RED will result in the optimum balance of fitness in the least amount of time could decrease the amount of required exercise time. These studies should be performed in combination with in-flight measurements of exercise performance, and will give broader insight into what is truly required for the maintenance of fitness with the current de vices, as well as into what exercise hardware and exercise prescriptions will be required for the moon and Mars. 34 HRP-47065 M8: What is the minimum exercise regimen ne eded to maintain fitness levels for tasks? This gap is also asking if exercise, in addition to EVA tasks, is required during 6-month stays on the moon. If exercise is required, what exercise hardware would be required and what would be the correct exercise prescription? In addition, assessment of reduced ex ercise volume on in-flight performance should be completed. The following questions should also be examined: a) how can suit/task related injuries be prevented b) is the current exercise regimen appropria te for 1/6g and c) is the current exercise regimen appropriate for 3/8g - this is a lowe r priority question for future work. M9: What is the minimum set of exercise hardware needed to maintain those (M8) fitness levels? This gap should be filled in three parts. The sec ond treadmill that is being built for ISS can be assessed for performance and reliability. New hardware should be developed as soon as possible for lunar missions. Development of hardware for Mars can be developed using information from the ISS and Lunar hardware. The Moon will serve as a test bed for the equipment that is selected for Mars. M10: What is the correct set of ground-based studies (bed rest and others) to optimize exercise prescriptions for Lunar Outpost and Mars? Ground-based work should be conducted to carefully build and test potential exercise equipment. In ad dition to the physiologic outcomes, equipment should be designed and tested so that hardware reliability a nd functionality are ensured. A series of bed rest and other ground-based studies should be designed to supp lement the work discussed above. All bed rest studies should employ a multi-discipline, multi-project approach. The studies should include appropriate multi-disciplinary performance measures. Listed are so me suggestions for issues that could be addressed in bed rest studies: optimum loading on treadmill; optimum volume vs. intensity of exercise; multidisciplinary performance enhancers (pharmaceuti cal/diet, mechanical, etc.); develop EVA tasks during bed rest and test effects on physiological and performance measures; 1/6 g bed rest and performance measures; 3/8 g bed rest and performance measures. Task: (ECP - via directed study) Flywheel Prescription Optimization - TBD A flywheel exercise device has been shown to be an effective countermeasure for muscle mass and strength in multiple ground-based flight analogs (lower limb suspension and bed rest), although to date it has not prevented the atrophy of the soleus muscle in humans during prolonged periods of unloading. Currently, the flywheel-based exercise device has only been used as a resistance exercise device. Recent modifications to the flywheel exercise device now accommodate aerobic exercise in a rowing machine configuration. New bed rest studies will compare a multi-functional flywheel to a flywheel for resistance exercise alone with the addition of traditional modes of aerobic exercise (e.g., flywheel for resistance exercise and cycl e ergometer for aerobic exercise). Deliverables: Results will determine if a single multifunctional flywheel device can adequately protect muscle function, bone health, and aerobic cap acity or whether multiple pieces of exer cise hardware will be required. The initial results will determine if follow-on flight validation studies to optimize the prescription further are required. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: The bed countermeasure optimization.rest ground analog (6\u00b0 head down tilt) is required for ground studies for ISS will be required to validate any optimized countermeasures. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass (kg/subject) Downmass (kg/subject) Crew Time/Subject Post-Flight BDC Time (hrs) 12 (bed rest and ISS) 75 kg (if ISS required) none (if ISS required) none (if ISS required) 9 hours (if ISS required) 2 hours (if ISS required) 35 HRP-47065 36 Task: (ECP - via directed study) ISS Exercise Prescription Study This study will apply principles learned from ground-based flight analogs to an in-flight platform in order to improve exercise countermeasures efficacy and efficiency by increasing exercise intens ity and reducing exercise volume. Deliverables: Data will guide decision of whether current exer cise countermeasures are protective or if improved countermeasures requiring flight validation studies are needed.

A common complaint from returning ISS crewmembers is that the current harness is uncomfortable. The pain and chafing that occurs with the use of the current harness contributes to sub-optimal subject loading (approximately 65% of body weight). A new harness design will be tested to determine if it is more comfortable than the current harnes s and will allow for greater loading which is expected to result in better maintenance of muscle mass and bone density of the lower extremities Deliverables: activities Decision to change to newer CSM harness or continue with current harness during treadmill Required Delivery Milestone : N/A Required Platforms: harness.

Task: (NSRBI) Integrated Endurance and Resistance Exercise Countermeasures Using a Gr avity-Independent Training Device Extended spaceflight as well as existence on the moon and Mars will require exercise equipment and training protocols designed to maintain physical fitness and general health. NASA has determined that current flight-rated exercise hardware is not appropriate for use on the future Crew Exploration Vehicle. These studies will investigate protocols designed to maintain both card iovascular and musculoskeletal fitness using a gravity- independent multi-mode exercise device (M-MED), which has been identified by NASA as potential flight hardware. M-MED can provide high-resistance either stre ngth or low-resistance endu rance-mode exercises.

What are the mechanisms of the gender effects on loss of exercise capacity and musc le function (including muscle mass, strength, power, and fatigability) during long-duration bed rest? Are gender specif ic countermeasures needed? If so, what are the best countermeasures to protect both men and women? Deliverables: This data will feed into the ISS Exercise Prescription Study. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms : TBD M3: What tasks will be required for Exploration missions? The muscle discipline should be part of a larger, multi-disciplinary group to define these tasks. They will be primarily EVA tasks, and study groups are currently evaluating these proposed EVA tasks. M4: What are the physiologic costs of Exploration mission tasks? Much of this data exists within other groups (Desert Research and Technology Study (D-RATS), EPSP EVA Physiology, Systems and Performance, etc). The fitness effort for given tasks can be bracketed with available information. This information can be used to assess fitness requirements. M6: Can a standardized performance measure of readiness for Exploration mission tasks be developed? This should be a cross-disciplinary protocol th at includes sub-tasks and measures that cover all affected disciplines. Work should be done in conjunction with ongoing EPS P activities. The team emphasizes that the testing of individual should not be continued unless this data can be directly related to performance and function. HRP-47065 Task: (ECP - via directed study; collaborators include Constellation Program Ground and Mission Ops SIG and Constellation Program working groups (e.g., CEV Cockpit Working Group, etc.)) Critical Mission Task (CMT) Assessment The human performance tasks that will be required in order to assure mi ssion success and safety will be identified (e.g., post landing egress, suited 10-kilometer walk-bac k, and emergency crewmember rescue). The muscle performance requirements to perform these tasks will th en be determined by biomechanical and metabolic analyses obtained during performance of these tasks. Deliverables: Results from this study will feed into the Function Task Test task as well as the Lunar EVA task. It will also be used to provide information regarding the muscle standard. Required Delivery Milestone : FY2013 - performance decrements information needed to support mission operations definition. Required Platforms: Ground based studies utilizing the partial gravity simulator (POGO) and the Neutral Buoyancy Lab. Bed rest facilities including the lunar analog will be utilized if required. Validation of the tasks will require lunar surface operations. 39 M10: What is the correct set of ground-based studies (bed rest and others) to optimize exercise prescriptions for Lunar Outpost and Mars? Ground-based work should be conducted to carefully build and test potential exercise equipment. In ad dition to the physiologic outcomes, equipment should be designed and tested so that hardware reliability a nd functionality are ensured. A series of bed rest and other ground-based studies should be designed to supp lement the work discussed above. All bed rest studies should employ a multi-discipline, multi-project approach. The studies should include appropriate multi-disciplinary performance measures. Listed are so me suggestions for issues that could be addressed in bed rest studies: optimum loading on treadmill; optimum volume vs. intensity of exercise; multidisciplinary performance enhancers (pharmaceuti cal/diet, mechanical, etc.); develop EVA tasks during bed rest and test effects on physiological and performance measures; 1/6 g bed rest and performance measures; 3/8 g bed rest and performance measures. Tasks : Lunar EVA Study - TBD This task is referenced within the HHC Infr astructure section - see gaps HHC1 and HHC2. Lunar Analog Bed Rest Development This task is referenced within the HHC Infr astructure section - see gaps HHC1 and HHC2. An Integrated Musculoskeletal Countermeasure Battery for Long-Duration Lunar Missions This task is referenced within the Risk of Accelerated Osteoporosis section - see gap B15. SM7: Can an integrated post-flight functional ta sk performance test be used on returning ISS crewmembers to obtain performance decrements? This gap is meant to develop and validate operational tests to define the linkage between func tional capabilities and physiological changes. This test should include planetary EVA-like activities The goal of this product is to define crewmembers' post-flight capabilities and disabilities, and to educate th em about their risk of injuries, which will help them consciously avoid potentially dangerous activities. This might also define capabilities during early days on a planetary surface. This product will al so provide crewmembers and the rehabilitation team members with more objective information regarding their recovery. This test is not germane to understanding how crewmembers will perform during Lunar EVAs since the conditions (duration of microgravity exposure) during this testing are dissimilar to the Lunar surface. HRP-47065 Task: (ECP - via directed study) STS/ISS Functional Task Test During space flight, astronauts experi ence alterations in multiple physiolog ical systems due to exposure to microgravity. These physiological changes include sensorimotor disturbances, cardiovascular deconditioning, loss of muscle mass, and strength. These changes lead to disruption in the ability to ambulate and perform functional tasks during the initial reintroduction to a gravitational environment and may cause significant impairments in performance of operational tasks immediately following landing on a planetary surface. To date changes in functional performance that result from physiological changes have not been systematically documented. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an integrated set of functional and physiological tests and then use these tests to determine how post-flight changes in sensorimotor, cardiovascular and muscle physiology impact post-flight functional performance. These tests will be performe d pre and post-flight on astronauts exposed to short and lo ng-duration space flight. The STS/IS S Functional Task Test will assess operational relevance of these changes by measuring the performance of specific exploration tasks (e.g., simulated seat egress, ladder climb, hatch opening, etc.). Additionally changes in functional performance will be mapped standard muscular, neurological, and cardiovascular measur es. Data obtained from this study will facilitate the design of countermeasures that specifically target the physiological systems responsible for impaired functional performance. Deliverables: Crew performance space normal da ta and physiological systems th at require countermeasures in order to preserve performance of func tional tasks will be identified. Information will also be provided to the muscle standard as well as to HSRF.

Deliverables: Results will feed into the Functional Task Test Study. Required Delivery Milestone : There is no required delivery milestone for this task. Required Platforms: This is a ground-based study. N9: Can nutritional countermeasures mitigate muscle loss? This is a medium priority gap. Proposals for nutritional supplementation are appropriate for bed rest studies. They should contain protocols that can be easily implemented in an operational environment. All groups working on this gap should standardize their techniques and measurements. The te am should rely on the clinical literature in support of this gap. N15: Can nutrition/nutrients mitigate O2/radiation risks? This is a low priority gap; flight work should not go forward until the nutrition SMO and related ground studies are complete. Expanded collaboration with the radiation team is recommended. HRP-47065 Task: (NSBRI) Redox Modulation of Skeletal Muscle Function in Microgravity The current project evaluates selected compounds, nutr itional supplements, and pharmacologic agents that may oppose oxidative stress in muscle and protect against weakness and fatigue. The experimental approach is designed to identify and develop countermeasures for human testing in the near-to-mid term. Initial experiments will define the loss of oxidant regulation that occurs w ith muscle unloading. Subsequent studies will evaluate compounds for protective effects on musc le function. The efficacy of each co mpound tested in this project is supported by preliminary data from animal studies, human trials or both. Each compound is approved for systemic administration to humans. Deliverables: Based on results of this activity; HHC is determine if any future work will be done in this area. Required Delivery Milestone : There is no required delivery milestone for this task. Required Platforms: This is a ground-based study. 42 HRP-47065 43 HRP-47065 44 HRP-47065 45 HRP-47065 46 HRP-47065 RISK OF REDUCED PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES DUE TO REDUCED AEROBIC CAPACITY - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - L, MARS - C Astronauts' physical performance during a mission, including tasks in microgravity and fractional gravity, is critical to mission success Setting minimum fitness standards and measuring whether crew can maintain these standards will document the effectiveness of maintenance regimens. Context of Risk for Exploration 47 In addition to reduced skeletal muscle strength a nd endurance, reduced aerobic capacity may put mission success at risk. Evidence demonstrates that aerobic capacity is markedly reduced in response to space flight and space flight analogs. Sustained sub-maximal activities (even walking on a planetary surface) could become difficult to perform given large enough decrements in aerobic capacity. As outlined for muscle performance it will also be essential to iden tify Critical Mission Task s and associated aerobic costs in order to design and validate effective ex ercise countermeasures for mission success. Current collaborative efforts with ESA are obt aining in-flight measurements of VO 2max aboard ISS. These measurements can be used as a baseline for future research to \"optimize\" or reduce the amount of in- flight exercise necessary to maintain perfo rmance. It was also recommended that VO 2max should be obtained during 6\u00b0 head down tilt bed rest for comparison purposes. Strategy for Mitigation Although the strategy to mitigate this risk will follow the general strategy of defining space normal, determining mechanisms and then de veloping countermeasures, the research planned will be closely tied to efforts investigating impaired performance due to reduced muscle mass, strength and endurance as well as hardware development. Gaps M1: What is the current state of knowledge regarding exercise performance? This gap is closed; the deliverable has been met and can be refere nced in the TBR HRP Deliverables Database. M7: Can the current in-flight performance be maintained with reduced exercise volume? This gap should determine the effects of reduced in-flight exerci se; this is a high priority gap. Efforts should be made to try to improve efficiency of the current I SS regime. Identification of which combinations of CEVIS, TVIS, and RED will result in the optimum balance of fitness in the least amount of time could decrease the amount of required exercise time. These studies should be performed in combination with in-flight measurements of exercise performance, and will give broader insight into what is truly required for the maintenance of fitness with the current de vices, as well as into what exercise types will be required for the Moon and Mars. M8: What is the minimum exercise regimen ne eded to maintain fitness levels for tasks? This gap is also asking if exercise, in addition to EVA tasks, is required during 6-month stays on the Moon. If exercise were required, what would be the correct prescription? In addition, assessment of reduced exercise volume on in-flight performance should be comp leted. The following questions should also be examined: a) how can suit/task related injuries be prevented B) is the current exercise regimen appropriate for 1/6g and c) is the current exercise re gimen appropriate for 3/8g - this is a lower priority question for future work. M9: What is the minimum set to equipment needed to maintain those (M8) fitness levels? This gap should be filled in three parts. The second treadmill that is being built for ISS can be assessed for performance and reliability. New ha rdware should be developed as s oon as possible for lunar missions. HRP-47065 Development of hardware for Ma rs can be developed using information from the ISS and Lunar hardware. The Moon will serve as a test bed for the equipment that is selected for Mars. M10: What is the correct set of ground-based studies (bed rest and others) to optimize exercise prescriptions for Lunar Outpost and Mars? Ground-based work should be conducted to carefully build and test potential exercise equipment. In ad dition to the physiologic outcomes, equipment should be designed and tested so that hardware reliability a nd functionality are ensured.

Lunar Analog Bed Rest Development This task is referenced within the HHC Infr astructure section - see gaps HHC1 and HHC2. An Integrated Musculoskeletal Countermeasure Battery for Long-Duration Lunar Missions This task is referenced within the Risk of Accelerated Osteoporosis section - see gap B15. 49 CV2: What is VO 2max in-flight and immediately post-flight? It has been discouraged to measure VO 2max on R+0, because of the possibility of injury to the crewmember, so it h as been suggested that a reasonable compromise would be to obtain in-flight measurements as late as feasible and obtain plasma volume measurements after landing. Also, the cardiovascular laboratory should work with the exercise physiology laboratory to ensure that muscle perfo rmance is measured in a similar timeframe as VO 2max is measured. No further research into this area is recommended until this gap is filled. However, it is recommended that the cardiovascular discipline work with the muscle discipline and the Exercise Physiology Laboratory to find the minimum exerci se prescription necessary to maintain in-flight VO 2max. M2: What is the current status of in-flight and post-flight exercise performance capability? What are the goals/targets for protection with the current in -flight exercise program? The relationships between in-flight exercise and fitness and performance levels are not well understood. It is not clear how the combination of the three types of available exercise (Crew Exercise Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS), Treadmill Vibration Isolation System (TVIS), and Resi stive Exercise Device (RED)) lead to maintenance of fitness. Factors that limit understanding of crewme mber fitness are: 1) the ISS exercise equipment has not been uniformly available to all crewmembers; 2) exercise programs are individualized for each crewmember, based on their individual preferences; 3) in-flight VO 2max has not been possible; and 4) an arbitrary minimum amount of daily exercise time (2.5 hours) has been set and enforced. The impact of this limited knowledge is that it is difficult to make detailed recommendations about what types of exercise will be needed for future missions to the M oon and Mars, other than to recommend that the same suite of exercise equipment be manifested for these missions. HRP-47065 Task: (ECP - via directed study) Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake (VO 2max) and Submaximal Estimates of VO 2max Before, During and After Long Duration International Space Station Missions The specific aims of this evaluation are to measure VO 2max during and following long duration missions and to assess the validity of using submaximal measurements of heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO 2) to track changes in aerobic capacity. In addition, non-invasive measurements of cardiac output (Qc) will be performed during exercise to determine if measurement of Qc w ill improve the accuracy of the submaximal estimations of VO 2max. For this proposed evaluation, crew members participating in ISS missions of 90 days will perform graded cycle exercise tests to their volitional maximum effort prior to, every 30 days during, and following flight. Measurements obtained during these tests will include HR, VO 2 and Qc. During these tests, ECG will be monitored real-time as a safety precaution. Expected results from this evaluation will include accurate VO 2max measurements from astronauts participa ting in long duration space flight and ob servation of the pattern of change across mission duration. Additionally, the evaluation will allow NASA to determine if submaximal exercise testing data will provide results that allow accurate estim ation of the crewmembers' aerobic capacity status during and after space flight. Deliverables: Results from this study will determine if the cu rrent countermeasures are protective and need only optimization (e.g., reduced volume, time) or if improved countermeasures and flight validation studies are needed. In addition, results will be used to provide information to the aerobic capacity standard as well as inform the HSRF. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: ISS is required for the initial flight study; a co ncurrent ground-based flight analog bed rest will be initiated if initial results indicate an improved countermeasure is needed. The improved countermeasures will be validated on board the ISS. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass (kg/subject) Downmass (kg/subject) 12 None 9.5kg/Inc None 9 3 50 Task: (ECP - via directed study) Hypovolemia as A Model Of Space Fligh t: Cardiovascular Exercise Effects Loss of plasma volume is hypothesized to be a major contributing factor to reduced aerobic capacity in response to space flight.

Deliverables: Results from this study will feed into the VO 2max flight study. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission.

Suit devel opers must fully understand the impact of the suit design on crew performance and health to ensure pr operly designed mobility, pressures, nutrition, life support, etc. Operational Relevance and Risk Context 53 Constellation Missions to the moon and Mars will include frequent EVAs involving exploration, science, construction and maintenance tasks. These missions may include up to 30 times more EVA hours than during the Apollo era. The effectiveness and su ccess of these missions is dependent on designing EVA systems and protocols that maximize human performance capabilities. It would not be feasible to perform the Constellation EVAs using Apollo suit designs. Limited mobility, dexterity, center of gravity and other features of the suit required significant crew compensation to accomplish mission objectives. Strategy for Mitigation The Human Research Program has recommended that the EVA Physiology, Systems and Performance Project work with the Constellation EVA Systems Proj ect to develop and execute an integrated human testing program across multiple environments. The t esting program will collect the objective data needed to make informed design decisions to create EVA systems that optimize human health and performance across the spectrum of anticipated e xploration operational concepts. Gaps EVA1 (new): What models & techniques are re quired to evaluate various suit designs and operational concepts to optimize crew health and performance? Replaces old gaps: EPSP6: What work efficiency indices (WEI) metrics of EVA can be used to measure evolution of EVA systems? EPSP7: What surface ops concepts could maximize human performance of mission tasks as well as protect crew health? M3: What tasks will be required for lunar sortie, outpost, and Mars missions? SM8: No functional requirements for lunar a nd Mars surface ambulation have been devised HRP-47065 Task : (EPSP some studies will be in collaboration with Constellation EVA Systems Project Office (ESPO)) EVA Human Performance Data Collection Series I - Mark-III Suit Conduct a se ries of studies to examin e factors that may affect human perform ance while working in an EVA suit. Parameters to be examined include suit weight, mass, cen ter of gravity (CG), pressure, biomechanics and mobility. Studies will be performed in a number of analog environmen ts in both unsuited/'shirt-sleeve' conditions and using the Mark-III technology demonstrator suit. Multiple analog environm ents are required because no single analog environment adequately simulates the range of partial gravity conditions required to evaluate all aspects of human performance contributing to EV A success. Each analog w ill provide a piece of the puzz le that will allow a more thorough understanding of EVA performance. NBL Parabolic Flight NEEMO Pogo Field Analogs Test activities will include characterizations of ambulation and exploration type activities, such as ambulation on level and inclined surfaces, ambulation wh ile carrying a load, rock collection, shoveling, kneeling, recovery from a fall, and simple exploration and construction tasks using hand tools and power tools. Data collected will include metabolic rates, subject anthropometrics, time series mo tion capture, ground r eaction forces, subj ective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and operator compensation using the modified Cooper-Harper rating scale. Any conditions that result in suit-induced trauma will also be noted. Data collected in these studies will be used to create an EPSP human performance database, a repository in which data from a variety of operational concepts and testing conditions can be accessed and shared with other projects and Elements as necessary. Data from these studies will al so be used to generate the suit controllability predictive algorithm, which is a model that can be used to predict several human performance variables based on suit characteristics, subject anthropometrics, and operations con cepts. The algorithm is planned as a design tool to enable development of suits that increase effi ciency in crew health and performance. Deliverables : EPSP human performance database and database inputs Post-test reports resulting from individual tests within the data collection series Suit controllability predictive algorithm Data delivery to ECP, NxPCM, and SH FH per TBD data sharing agreements Required Delivery Milestone : A majority of the studies will be completed by the end of FY09 in order to provide inputs to Suit Configuration 1 (initial capability: launc h/abort/entry (LAE) and microgravity EVA) Preliminary Design Review (PDR) (TBD FY09-10) and Suit Configuration 2 (l unar surface operations) Systems Design Review (SDR) (FY11). Follow-on studies to validate the algorithm will be conducted as needed to provide inputs to subsequent design reviews. Studies to refine requirements for Mars suits may be performed during lunar operations (FY20 and beyond). 54 HRP-47065 Task : (EPSP some studies will be in collaboration with Constellation EVA Systems Project Office (ESPO)) Human Performance Data Collection Series I - Mark-III Suit (cont'd) Required Platforms : Lunar analogs such as Partial Gravity Simulator (Pogo/ ARGOS), Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL), parabolic flight, and NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) Lunar surface operations Resources Required : Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD) personnel s upport and facility usage are required for all tests and provision of Mark-III suit is required for suited tes ting. Crewmembers assigned to the EVA Branch of the astronaut office are required as test subjects for all suited and matched shirtsleeve control tests and are desired for all other tests. 55 Task : (EPSP some studies will be in collaboration with Constellation ESPO) EVA Human Performance Data Collection Series II - I-Suit or Alternate Suit Where possible, EPSP will collect data comparable to the Mark-III testing series in using the I-Suit or alternate suit and during selected unsuited trials. The anthropometric range (95th percentile male) that the Mark-III suit effectively accommodates is limited due to the suit's structure and weight. According to JSC Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) recommendations, further testing is required to allow expansion of subject population demographics.

Any inadequacies in the design of the environment or architecture can restrict or prevent the user from surviving in such extreme conditions and may impact safety and performance. Factors that affect the habitability must be assessed and properly addressed to ensure all potential hazards are mitigated or monitored. If th e workspace, equipment and tools are not designed to be usable by the full range of crewmembers, and are not properly laid out, the likelihood of errors or crew inability to complete a task in a timely manner in creases. Inconsistent design among subsystems and vehicles leads to negative transfer of training and increased likelihood of errors. Operational Relevance and Risk Context 83 One of the most critical components for human presence in space has been ensuring that there are human systems standards in place that will provide for crew health as well as standards for habitability, environmental, and human factors. The Space Flight Human System Standards - SFHSS - (and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook - HIDH) require that each human spaceflight program derive program-specific, verifiable requirements to comply with the standards, and require that each human spaceflight program establish a human factors pr ocess involving health and human factors experts. This is to ensure that there will be identification of any standards in the SFHSS that are not applicable (or altered) and the rationale for non-applicability; th at all program level health and human factors requirements are based on the HIDH, cited empirical evidence, or known best practices; and that end-items are in compliance with SFHSS, and agency a nd program level requirements and specifications. The activities cited reflect the need to work toward the mitigation of identified SHFE risks by continuing to inform the standards, by engagement in the de velopment of the requirements that will implement the standards based upon the resulting products, as well as providing content to the HIDH that will serve as the implementation guide. In addition, products resulting from these activities may provide valuable information to spaceflight programs that can inform the requests for trade studies. To ensure operational relevance of the deliverabl es from the tasks, all tasks leaders will identify stakeholders who will work with them in framing th e questions and approach. The stakeholders will participate by identifying specific issues requiring research or technology development, by reviewing progress, and by suggesting operational evaluations. Depending on the specific tasks, stakeholders may include engineers or operations personnel. Strategy for Mitigation The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop an understanding of the factors that contribute to this risk, identify gaps in our knowledge about these factor s, and prioritize these gaps based on various criteria systematically applied. Then the highest priority ga ps are addressed through directed or solicited research depending on the time frame and the complexity and sp ecificity of the gap. Where there is a disconnect between critical gaps requiring addressing and a lack of funding, efforts are made to re-examine the programmatic priorities to ensure those of highest concern are being investigated. The risk associated with reduced safety and efficiency due to inadequately designed vehicles, environments, tools or equipment focuses on the overall environment that the crew will live and work in. The focus can surround the development of hardwa re and interfaces, and how those interfaces will facilitate human performance and efficiency. Displays, controls, and procedures need to be appropriately designed and developed to allow for safe and efficient execution of tasks. Specific studies investigate the environment surrounding the crew, namely the acoustic environment, which can impact both health and performance. Other studies focus upon the vibration, acceleration and microgravity environment, again all having potential to impact human health and perform ance. The approach to mitigating this risk is to HRP-47065 develop a thorough understanding of the operational concepts, and determine methods, metrics and verification strategies to ensure that the hardware and environment are designed for human safety and productivity. The strategy for mitigating this risk is closely connect ed to the strategy for addressing the Risk of Errors Due to Poor Task Design. The work captured unde r this risk contributes to understanding the capabilities and limits of human performance, which is essential to appropriate task design. When a task is designed, it is critical to determine if it can be accomplished by a single person or requires additional personnel, or assistance from robots or automation. When the spacecraft and equipment are designed, both the requirements of the task and the capabilities and limits of the crew have to be considered. The specific selection choices of the highest priority gaps and tasks are based primarily on gap analyses. The SHFE project updates its gap analyses on an annual basis. This is necessar y as research results and continual information drawn from cr ew debriefings has the potential of discovering additional gaps in knowledge. These updates assist in the preparation for the annual Science Review Panel. The original analysis carried out in 2006 was published as NASA/TP-2007-213739 (\"Space Human Factors Engineering Gap Analysis Project Final Report,\" C. Hudy and B. Woolford, 2007). An update was completed in spring 2007. The gaps are identified through reviews of the lite rature, of crew debrief summaries, and through interviews with more than a hundred users of human factors results, representing Engineering, Mission Operations, Flight Medicine, Training, the Crew Office, and others. We place particular emphasis on interviewing representatives from Constellation Program Office, the Human-System Integration Group, the Orion Project Office, the Cockpit Display Working Group, and other programmatic users of our products. The 'small' gaps or specific concerns identified from these sources are aggregated into more appropriate levels for wh ich a specific task can be designed. For example, numerous users report gaps in design for workload: lack of consistency of definition; lack of easy to use methods to assess workload; lack of a way to verify that a requirement for workload has been met. These various individual-level concerns ar e captured in a gap, \"There is no standardized non-intrusive measure of workload.\" After all concerns are mapped to gaps, the gaps are prioritized according to a number of criteria. Key criteria are importance to Constellation Program and n eed date. When we identify 'TBRs' or 'TBDs\" in the Human Systems Integration Requirements, for example, these are assigned a very high priority. Ratings are solicited from management representatives of the offices from which gaps were identified. After prioritization, the gaps that can be addressed within the budget are initiated through directed research or solicited through research announcements. Directed research is chosen for time critical results. Solicitations are used for gaps that are longe r term and that can benefit from wider participation.

Tasks : (SHFE - Directed) Acoustic Modeling Acoustic modeling can be used to identify key noise sources, determine/analyze sub-allocated requirements, keep track of the accumulation of minor noise sources, and to predict vehicle noise levels at various stages in the development, first with estimates of noise sources, later with experimental data. Bench testing of isolated systems alone is not sufficient, as the installation effects are ofte n not known. Acoustic modeling will be used to determine installation effects, reverberation (room geometry) effects, and will be used to identify propagation paths and possible noise controls, as well as develop an understanding of the resulting acoustic levels in the composite environment. Finally, acoustic modeling will be used to assist with the development and implementation of spaceflight acoustic materials and to predict their effectiveness including sound containment, absorption, and vibration isolation.

Tasks : (SHFE - Directed) Effects of Architecture on Safety and Performance One of the first decisions made for any spacecraft module design is, what is the required habitable volume? This task will develop the knowledge to support this decision. Effects of volume on task efficiency will be one topic of study. Psychological effects of volume and architecture during long missions will be addressed. A decision support tool that organizes the results of this study will be developed. A standardized approach to evaluation of habitability features and to assessing their interactions will be developed in later work.

HRP-47065 88 Tasks : (SHFE - Directed) Semantic Language and Tools for Reporting Human Factors Incidents Operations in confined, isolated, and foreign environments can lead to impairments of human performance. This subtopic seeks methods for monitoring, modeling, and predicting human performance in the spaceflight environment for accurate and valid human system integration into vehicle design and operations. In particular, the Space Human Factors Engineering Project within the HRP is interested in obtaining timely and context-specific Human Factors (HF) incident data. Currently, space HF data come from crew debriefs. Such debriefs rely on retrospective recall, which could suffer delays of up to six months. Furthermore, opportunities to discuss HF issues in detail during these debriefs are limited. Cons equently, the HRP sees the need to develop an automated human factors incident-reporting tool. Deliverables: Design, development, and implementation of informational database for reporting of human factors incidents Required Delivery Milestone : FY11 Preliminary database tool provided for Lander SRR FY13 Final tool delivery for Lander PDR Required Platforms: Ground: Laboratory Test bed SHFE 2.3.1.1: How can we determine the e ffect of microgravity on spinal elongation? Tasks : (SHFE - Directed) Spinal Elongation and its Effects on Seated Height in a Microgravity Environment The purpose of the Spin al Elongation and its Effects on Seated Height in a Microgravity Environment study is to provide quantitative data as to the amount of change that occurs in seated height due to spinal elongation in microgravity environments. Spinal elongation has been observed to occur in crewmembers during space flight; however, it has only previously been recorded in the st anding position with a limited number of subjects. Seated height data in microgravity is considered necessary to id entify correctly the seated height projections of the crew in the Orion configuration. Correct projections of seated height should lead to a) proper positioning of the seats within the vehicle; b) maintaining ad equate clearance for seat stroke in hi gh acceleration impacts; c) providing proper fit in seats; d) proper placement of seats with respect to each other; and e) proper orie ntation to displays and controls. Additionally, data concerning the effects of spinal elongation on seated height would aid in the design of suit components as well as requirements for habitations and other vehicles. Deliverables: Spinal elongation induced seated height data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments. Information relating to the seated height rate of change over time for astronauts subjected to microgravity. Provide new information concerning seated height forward into the design of Constellation systems.

Di splays must meet the crew's needs and be easy to use as Exploration missions may face the grea test autonomy challenge to date. The focus of visual displays is readability and usability of text, as well as display navigation. The focus of auditory displays is alarms. This is a requirements development activity, supplemented by some research or validation activities on the ground and in flight. This will result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced information display soluti ons currently contemplated for the various Constellation Program spacecraft systems consistent with the smaller cockpit environments of the Orion CEV, the La nder, and surface rovers. These requirements and appropriate information will be provided to Orion, Constellation documentation (CxP70024 Human System Integratio n Requirements; Orion Display Stan dards) and the Space Flight Human System Standards Human Integration Design Handbook.

This becomes especially important when the majority of the controls w ill be software based. Crewmembers must be very aware of what they are manipulating on the screen, and must be able to do so under vibration and high-g, as well as in microgravity. They must be able to operate controls ungloved and with pressurized gloved hands. During launch and entry, crews will have no choice other than to use a remo te cursor control device. If devices are inadequate for any of the above operational scenarios, crew safety w ill be compromised and risk loss of productivity. These requirements and appropriate information will be provided to Orion, Constellation documentation (CxP70024 Human System Integration Requireme nts; Orion Display Standards) an d the Space Flight Human System Standards Human Integration Design Handbook.

With crewmembers' arms strapped to armrests, a \"seated\" operations mode will necessitate all cr ew-vehicle interactions being accompl ished through one or more handheld devices. There will also be considerably less real estate available bringing r eal pressure to consolidate information onto as few displays formats as possible. Combined, thes e factors, along with hard pressures on the allowable mass of the vehicles, are forcing fundam ental changes to the vehicle cockpits, dictating new and different concepts of vehicle operations. The design pressures are being strongly felt on operations that include performing and completing checklists of nominal and off-nominal procedures, and all check lists will be accessed and view on a customized electronic display format call an electronic procedures viewer (EPV). This task supports development, testing and validating the cockpit users interfaces needed to support procedure-related vehicles operations. Deliverables : Evaluation of advanced concepts for electronic procedures formatting and fault management Summary report on impacts of serial versus parallel acce ss to fault-management related display information on fault management performance. Report will include pre liminary recommendations and guidelines for the size and content of the EPV window during ascent/entry operations.

When combined with the steady advances that are ta king place in huma n-machine interface technologies, for any particular task or vehicle opera tion, the increasing options for human-machine functional allocation, and the increasing suite of interfaces that could support those options, something close to a combinatorial explosion in the space of possible operational concepts and supporting interfaces is occurring. Both potential deficiencies with targeted designs, and optimal design solutions, could well be missed in a highly resource-limited development environment that targets only a small number of candidate designs for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Fully validated Human Performance Modeling tools could be used to more exhaustively explore and prune the design space for ta rgeted operational concepts, particul arly those that involve performance shaping functions (such as vibration or sustained g) that render human-in-the-loop evaluations of more than a small handful of point solutions impractical. Deliverables: Model-based capability to generate complete sequence of behavioral primitives associated with the task of detecting, isolating, and recovering from ADAPT test bed malfunctions during dynamic phases of flight.

HRP-47065 93 Tasks : (SHFE - New Directed Study or NRA) Model Development and Applicability During equipment design and task planning, graphical computer models of humans can save time and avoid numerous design flaws by enabling visualization of the human interaction with the physical environment. Aircraft designers, automobile designers, and other industries rely heavily on human modeling. For NASA's needs, the target population is different than the standard ones used by industry, and the varying gravity environments affect stature and posture, and may affect strength. This task w ill identify the critical differences that need to be captured in adapting commercially available models to NASA's application. Deliverables : Determine what population characteristics are critical to model development Model modification/test/validation/application Required Delivery Milestone : FY13: Initial input based on results from model development to Lander PDR FY15: Final model delivered for use in Lander CDR FY15: CR to HIDH and HSIR based on information obtained from model development and application FY16: Final model delivery for use with Habitat Required Platforms : Ground: Laboratory Test Ground: Mockups beds HRP-47065 99 HRP-47065 100 HRP-47065 101 HRP-47065 The Risks in this part of the Appendix are aligned with Section 2.2 - Ensure That the Crew Can Accomplish the Cognitive, Behavioral, and Team Aspects of the Mission 102 HRP-47065 RISK OF BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHIA TRIC CONDITIONS - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - C Behavioral issues are inevitable among groups of people, no matter how well selected and trained. Spaceflight demands can heighten these issues. The In stitute of Medicine (IOM) report, Safe Passage, notes that Earth analog studies show an incidence rate of behavioral problems ranging from 3-13 percent per person per year. The report transposes these fi gures to 6-7 person crews on a 3-year mission to determine that there is a significant likelihood of ps ychiatric conditions emerging. Impacts of behavioral issues are minimized if they are identified and addr essed early. The HRP must provide the best measures and tools to monitor and assess mood and to predic t risk for and management of behavioral and psychiatric conditions prior, during and following spaceflight. Operational Relevance Assessment and Recommendations 103 BHP research addresses the risk of behavioral and psychiatric conditions developing during or following an Exploration Mission. Early detection of stress or other risk factors during spaceflight is imperative to deter development of behavioral or psychiatric c onditions which could seriously harm and negatively impact the individual or the crew, and pose serious consequences for accomplishing mission objectives or jeopardizing the mission altogether. Toward this end, BHP is developing methods for monitoring behavioral health during a Lunar and Mars Mission, and adapting/refining various tools and technologies for use in the spaceflight environment. These measures a nd tools will be used to monitor, detect and treat early risk factors. BHP will utilize analogs to t est, further refine, and validate these measures for Exploration Missions. BHP also develops counterme asures for maintaining behavioral health and enhancing performance during long duration isolated , confined, and highly autonomous missions; provides recommendations regarding space medicine best practices; and, provides updates for behavioral health and performance standards. The BHP element includes two additional risks - increased human performance errors due to sleep loss, fatigue, work overload, and circadia n desynchronization; and, increased errors due to poor team cohesion and performance, inadequate selection/team composition, inadequate training, and poor psychosocial adaptation. The three risks are interre lated; the occurrence or mitigation of one risk can be a contributing factor affecting another. As a result, BHP gap-re lated activities and deliverables may sometimes address more than one risk. Risk Mitigation Strategy The risk mitigation strategy of the BHP Element follows the larger strategy of the HRP \"from Evidence to Products\" principle, while being driven primarily by Medical Operations. BHP holds an annual working group meeting of subject matter experts who work with BHP and Medical Operations, and Mission Ops to identify gaps in knowle dge and gaps in mitigation. Specific ta sks are defined to address the gaps and provide clear, deliverables for Constellation, ensuri ng an evidence and operationally-based end item. Working with research and operational experts, BHP systematically identifies the appropriate analog to address the gaps prior to validating in spaceflight. To ensure relevancy, stakeholders are engaged in the process at the beginning. Findings from BHP research inform operations and standards as well as update the evidence base for the BHP Risks. Gaps BMed1: What are the optimal methods to preven t decrements in behavioral health (which may negatively affect performance) during exploration missions? HRP-47065 104 BMed2: What are the optimal methods to predic t decrements in behavioral health (which may negatively affect performance) during exploration missions? Individuals with the greatest likelihood of having a behavioral and psychiatric emergency in flight are eliminated during the selection process; they never be come astronauts. While the current NASA select- out system is very thorough, the predictive ability of all selection systems diminishes over time. Therefore, new criteria may be necessary for astronaut selection for long duration exploration missions. Neuropsychiatric assessment may be helpful in this process, as the biological basis of mood disorders suggests neural biomarkers may provide a more objective method for assessing some psychiatric conditions such as depression. Tasks : (NSBRI) Near-infrared Neuroimaging (NIN ) for Predicting Depression 2008-2011: Lab Studies: Biomarkers of Depression (Strangman) Laboratory study validating a flight-capable, noninvasive neuroimaging technology (near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging, or NIRS imaging) for its ability to detect biomarkers of depression, and its severity. 2012: Determine if technology is r eady for spaceflight.

Required Delivery Milestone : Updates to Human System Risk Forum / Recommendations for Medical Ops to be delivered by 2011. Required Platforms: This ground effort primarily involves evidence gatherin g. Findings from this activity will inform what additional tasks need to be conducted to address this gap. 105 BMed3: What are the optimal methods to detect and assess decrements in behavioral health (which may negatively affect performance) during exploration missions? Astronauts must maintain high-level performance while experiencing demanding workload and work schedules, extreme environmental risks, and psychosoc ial stressors in space (for example, isolation and confinement). Stress, affect, and fatigue can jeopardize their cognitive performance and neurobehavioral status. Due to the delayed communication that will exist between the space crew and the ground during an Exploration Missions, flight surgeons have stated the need for unobtrusive monitoring tools that will help detect if an astronaut is demonstrating or otherwise evidencing continual high leve ls of stress, fatigue, and negative mood. These tools are to require minimal crew time and effort. The tools should allow the crewmember the ability for self-assessment, providing immediate feedback so that countermeasures can be administered in a timely manner, if necessary. Currently, two monitoring technologies are planned. These technologies are to be adapted specifically for Exploration Missions. The facial monitoring tool (known as the optical computer recognition (OCR) system) is currently under development through prev ious work of the researcher with other agencies. NASA is able to leverage such technologies, and with some refinement, adaptations, and validation, provide these tools for Lunar and Mars Missions.

If there are changes -do they persist post-mission? If so, for how long? BMed5: What are the optimal methods for det ecting and assessing cognitive performance during exploration missions? Based on past spaceflight experiences, various types of behavioral and psychiatric conditions are expected to be a risk for future exploration missions. While current selection and countermeasure strategies have prevented the occurrence of any behavioral health emergencies that could jeopardize mission success, the uniquely long durations and distances of future expl oration missions necessitates comparisons with analog environments that might indicate what other types of occurrences could be expected. Some evidence from Antarctic research suggests clinical cognitive ch anges may occur in individuals exposed to ICE environments, such as space, for long periods of time. Investigators studying animal research have further speculated that behavioral changes in such environments may even be attributable to the effects of chronic stress on the hippocampus. Physical aspects of the environment can also result in cognitive changes. Exposure to radiation, for exam ple, can damage the subcortical basal ganglia and hippocampus, both of which are critical to cognitive functioning.

In order to select individuals most likely to be successful in long duration exploration missions, it is helpful to understand the psychosocial characteristics (including personality data) of individuals who have already proven to be successful in isolated, confin ed, and extreme environments. These individuals may include, but are not necessarily limited to, submariners, navy seals, firemen, and wintering-over Antarctic personnel. Essential to this task is establishing an operationally accurate definition of \"success\". Training can subsequently be designed to targ et the traits that are most malleable. HRP-47065 Tasks : (TBD) Identify Trait/Malleable Characteristics of High-Performing Individuals 2009-2010: Review of Literature/Assessment of Operations Review literature on ICE population groups to define and outline what psychosocial characteristics are most predictive of success.

If studies are needed, determine whether BHP will be able to gather data needed from previous interviews and sources; or, if it is necessary to interview astronauts for additional information. Revise and define the gap and activities with goal of providing training recommendations to Ops by 2015. Deliverables : Updates to Human System Risk Forum / Recommendations to Medical information that may help determine training criteria. Operations regarding Required Delivery Milestone : Updates to Human System Risk Forum / Recommendations for Medical Operations to be delivered for long duration exploration missions. Required Platforms : Review is ground study, with future tasks/deliverables to be subsequently defined. 110 BMed7: What are the optimal countermeasures for maintenance, restoration and enhancement of behavioral health during exploration missions? As discussed in the B-Med Evidence Book, although the incidence of reported psychiatric disorders on short duration missions has not been significant, as the length of the mission increases, the incidence of behavioral and psychiatric disorders is also expect ed to increase. Additionally, the ramifications of a disorder developing inflight are severe if left unresolved, particularly for long duration exploration missions. Anecdotal and empirical evidence from spaceflight and incidence rates from space analogs suggest that assessing, preventing, and treating behavi oral health problems are essential to protecting the health of crewmembers, and consequently, the success of the mission. HRP-47065 Tasks: (NSBRI) Tool: Mitigation of Depression, and Task: Tool : Mitigation of Stress and Anxiety Currently a computerized \"psychologist\" is under development through the NSBRI, in conjunction with Medical Operations; this \"smart\" technology allows a crewmember on a long duration Lunar or Mars Mission to evaluate signs or symptoms of early depression and anxiety, and receive therapy as desired. The computer-based aid for addressing depression (based on problem-solving therapy), is not designed to replace the clinician; rather, it w ill complement the service of the aerosp ace psychiatrist during a long duration Exploration Mission. The tool enhances privacy, confidentiality, and support of the astronaut during autonomous missions such as the Mars Mission which will have considerable communication delays between space crew and ground support. It allows the astr onaut to educate him/herself, augmenting the one-on-one private physician consultation. At times when such consultation is not feasible, it will serve as a diagnostic tool and autonomous countermeasure that is available 24/7, with feedback to the individual, aerospace psychiatrist, and the crew surgeon. There is a second NSBRI task developing self-direct ed, autonomous, interactive, multi media module to train crewmembers how to recognize, assess, prevent and ma nage stress and anxiety on extended spaceflights. The countermeasure could be used in preflight training, with booster sessions on interventions available in orbit as needed. In this model of implementation, the skills learne d prior to a mission would help to inoculate crews to severe stress reactions thereby enhancing flight-task pe rformance and crew health, safety and efficiency. The countermeasure will comprise empirically support ed stress and anxiety-management strategies. 2008-2012: Two NSBRI ground based studies (laboratory and Antarctic) to refine and test the effectiveness and feasibility of tool. 2012: Prepare for Flight 2013-2016: ISS validation/feasibility study 2017: Determine if additional co untermeasure studies are needed 2017-2020: Conduct ground studies, if needed 2023+ Validate in Lunar Long environment Deliverables : Countermeasure: technology to detect and treat depression, as well as stress and anxiety Update to HSRF for operationalizing protocol for ISS Required Delivery Milestone : Update HSRF/Flight Med missions to Constellation in 2016.

Space analogs, such as Antarctica, confirm mood deteriora tion and increased stress occur in individuals in isolated, confined and extreme environments (ICE). Psychotropic medications may be considered helpful in mediating these deleterious effects and in treating behavioral or psychiatric conditions that may arise during Exploration Missions. Over the next decade, the field of psychopharmac ology will undoubtedly continue to develop new medications for the treatment of behavioral and psychiatric disorders. In preparation for long duration Exploration Missions, BHP will collaborate with Me dical Operations to review state-of-the-art medications and provide a compendium of best practices. A pharmaceutical armamentarium that covers a broad range of mental disorders, produces minimal si de effects, requires no laboratory monitoring and has minimal storage requirements will be needed for long duration Exploration Missions.

This risk may be influenced by artificial and transmitted light exposure , individual vulnerability to sleep loss and circadian dynamics, and work/sleep schedules. Efforts are n eeded to improve sleep hygiene, and to identify and improve conditions that interfere with sleep quality. Research areas may include: development of a self- assessment tool for cognitive function and fatigue, light therapy for phase shifting, alertness and mood disorders, and other means to improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue. Operational Relevance Assessment and Recommendations Research demonstrates that aspects of the spaceflight environment may disrupt circadian rhythms and reduce sleep; anecdotal evidence from spaceflight reveals that fatigue and work overload can also occur. Ground research has consistently demonstrated that lack of adequate amounts of good quality sleep, as well as circadian desynchronization, can adversely affect performance capability and safety. Lunar surface activities will be both strenuous and fatiguing, and will involve shift work. Furthermore, sleep and fatigue are risk factors for the other tw o Behavioral Health and Performance Risks (Risk of Performance Errors Due to inadequate Team Coh esion and Performance, Inadequate Selection/Team Composition, Inadequate Training, and Poor Psychosocia l Adaptation; Risk of Behavioral and Psychiatric Conditions), as well as other aspects related to human health. It is therefore essential to develop countermeasures for issues related to sleep loss, fati gue, circadian desynchronization and work overload. BHP research activity aims to assess this risk as well as provide ade quate standards and countermeasures for Exploration Missions. Risk Mitigation Strategy The risk mitigation strategy of the BHP Element follows the larger strategy of the HRP \"from Evidence to Products\" principle, while being driven by Operatio ns. BHP holds an annual working group of subject matter experts who work with BHP and Medical Opera tions to identify gaps in knowledge and gaps in mitigation. Specific tasks are defined to address the gaps and provide clear, specific deliverables for Constellation, ensuring an evidence and operationa lly-based end item. Working with research and operational experts, BHP systematically identifies th e appropriate analog to address the gaps prior to validating in spaceflight. To ensure relevancy, stakeholders are engaged in the process at the beginning. Findings from BHP research inform operations and st andards as well as update the evidence base for the BHP Risks. Gaps Sleep 1: What are the best measures and tools to use for assessing performa nce relative to fatigue and other aspects of spaceflight? Ground evidence clearly demonstrates that performance im pairments can occur when sleep is attained in quantities similar to that attained by astronauts in flight. A correlation between sleep quantity and performance in spaceflight however has not been documented. A means to objectively assess decrements during mission operations and provide information to th e crew surgeon and astronaut may be helpful, so that appropriate countermeasures, if necessary, can be implemented. The assessment of performance in space relative to fatigue, using the right measures, will also aid in accurately characterizing and quantifying this human health risk.

Therefore, to accurately assess to what degree sleep is disrupted on-orbit, an unobtrusive, objec tive measure of sleep-wake activity is needed. Objective sleep data during the course of a missi on provides important operational feedback for the astronaut as well as the flight surgeon, particular ly prior to performing critical mission tasks, and planning slam shifting during mission operations. Deliverables : Actiwatch Protocol to ISS Me (See Sleep 6): Recommendatidical Operations ons based on evidence Required Delivery Milestone : Update HSRF/Medical Operations in 2010 for operationalizing Actiwatch protocol as an ISS medical requirement.

The Actiwatch also requires a skilled inve stigator to download, analyze, and interpret the data before the feedback can be of use to flight surgeons an d astronaut crews. There is a need for an individualized meter that precisely measures environmental (e.g., light exposure) and physiological signals (e.g., sleep wake activity, heart rate, etc.) to determine individual fatig ue levels, and automatically provides the user (e.g., astronaut/flight surgeon, MOD/ground support) with fee dback about potential decrements in performance ability. Such a measure will also provide information on circadian phase to indicate levels of potential risk due to fatigue. 2009: Phase I, Evaluation/ Requirements Definition Market analysis and literature review document to assess physiological and e nvironmental sensors; pe rformance test analysis; a review of existing models and identification of any major gaps in current modeling knowledge; and a technical development plan for developing a spaceflight ready Individualized Fatigue Meter. 2010-2011: Phase II, Prototype Development Develop spaceflight ready prototype of Individualized Fatigue Meter. 2012: Prep fo r Spaceflight 2013-2017: Phase III, Validate Fa tigue Meter in Spaceflight - TBD 2020-2023: Validate PVT Se lf-Test on Lunar Surface Collect and analyze data on Lunar Surface in or der to validate the PVT in Lunar environment.

As discussed in the Sleep Evidence Book, ground evidence clearly demonstrates that performance impairments can occur when sleep is attained in quantities similar to that attained by astronauts in flight. A correlation between sleep quantity and performance in spaceflight however has not been documented. The assessment of performance in sp ace relative to fatigue, using the right measures, will also aid in accurately characterizing and quantifying this human health risk, and helping to determine what additional countermeasures need to be developed, as necessary, and/or policies/standards enforced.

Gaps and future activities to be subsequently revised/defined. Deliverables : Inform BHP regarding subsequent tasks/gaps. Required Delivery Milestone : TBD Required Platforms : TBD Sleep3: Does sleep loss continue on long duration missions or is there adaptation? Previous studies have revealed that space crews are at times not sleeping for the duration of their scheduled sleep period. Crewmembers experience freque nt shifts in their sleep/wake schedules, and in addition, various environmental factors affect sleep quality and quantity. Studies have shown that self-HRP-47065 126 report of just how much sleep one is actually getti ng can be inaccurate. Therefore, in order to assess accurately to what degree sleep is disrupted on-orb it, an unobtrusive, objective measure of sleep-wake activity is needed. Objective sleep data during th e course of a mission provides important operational feedback for the astronaut as well as the flight surgeo n, particularly prior to performing critical mission tasks. Tasks : (NRA) Sleep/Wake Activity Study (Czeisler/Barger) 2007-2011: ISS/STS Data Collection Collect inflight data using an Actigraph watch to objectively document sleep and wake times and capture light exposure relative to sleep/wake activity, and a sleep log for subjective information on countermeasure use, and factors related to sleep loss during spaceflight.

Required Platforms: Requires the STS and ISS because of sleep -related issues associated with spaceflight. Requires continued participation by STS crews because of the wide variation across missions. Requires ISS because to date, relatively little is known about sleep quantity and quality on the ISS. Will require lunar environment to accurately assess the nature of sleep in lunar setting. Study provides information important for exploration planning. There is a high acceptability for participating in this study and high compliance among the astronauts participating in study. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass Wake Actigraphy Study 2020-2023: Lunar Su rface data collection See Sleep 1- Enhanced Actiwatch Upmass per subject = [Complete if ISS or Lunar Surface is re quired.

Sp ecify Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low where Very High = 100 kg; High = 50 kg; Medium = 25kg; Low = 12 kg; Very Low = 6 kg] Sleep4: How can individual astronauts' vulnerabilities to sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption best be determined? HRP-47065 While it is necessary to determine how to best mitigat e the impact of environmental factors on sleep and performance, individual characteristics also contribute to the quality and quantity of sleep, and the depth of disruption to circadian system, in space. As discussed in the Sleep Eviden ce Book, recent studies have documented that there are large stable (trait-like) di fferences among individuals in the degree of cognitive deficits experienced during sleep loss (Van Dongen, Baynard et al. 2004; Klerman and Dijk 2005).

Required Delivery Milestone : TBD Required Platforms : TBD Tasks : (Directed Study) Evaluate Individual Risk Factors for Circadian Entrainment to Martian Sol- Ground Crews 2008-2010: Phoenix Mars Lander Study (Barger) Ground crews supporting Mars robotic missions have chosen to maximize the use of the rovers on the surface of Mars by adopting the Mars sol. As a result, these engi neers and scientists live/work on a 24 hour and 39 minute schedule. After 10 days, these individuals are shifted by six and a half hours. Trying to maintain such a schedule has proven challenging for crews. Those supporting the Mars Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity Rovers have struggled with fatigue and other issues. NASA BHP is conducting a directed study with the ground crew supporting the Mars Phoenix Scout Lander. This study will evaluate individual vulnerabilities to sleep loss and circadian desynchronization. Urine samples for instance will be evaluated in order to observe the relationship between melatonin and morningness/eveningness, for instance. Educational material and light exposure will be utilized as countermeasures for sleep loss, circadian alignment, fatigue, and workload problems. 2011: Determine if additional studies are needed. If so, 2013-2015: Ground Studies: Crews Supporting Mars Mission Follow-up study from Phoenix Mars Lander, implementing \"lessons learned\" and new relevant aims to protocol.

HRP-47065 129 Sleep5: How can light be used to optimally minimize circadian problems in space? Preliminary studies indicate that light exposure can correct difficulties in sleep patterns that occur with shift work, jet lag, and sleep disorders. The timing, duration, intensity, geomet ry and wavelength of the light impact countermeasure effectiveness. Current efforts aim to investigate optimal lighting requirements for the space vehicle, as well as safe an d efficacious methods for implementing lighting as a countermeasure. Tasks : (NSBRI) Studies to Determine Efficacy of Shorte r-Wavelength-Enriched for Phase Shifting (NSBRI/Czeisler) 2009-2012: Lab Studies, RCS-105 Research has shown shorter-wavelength-enriched white light to facilitate circadian phase shifts.

While blue light therapy to facilitate circadian adaptatio n and alertness has been proposed based largely on the effects of melatonin suppression at night, these data may not be transferable to the effects at other times of day (when melatonin is not produced) or for other effects of light. 2013- Follow up tasks to be outlined below Deliverables : Inform Standards Inform Requirements to Constellation for Lander Lighting Characteristics Inform updates to HRFS/ Medical Operations on best operational approach entrainment and alertness. for utilizing light for circadian Required Delivery Milestone : Requirements due by 2013 for Lunar Lander PDR.

As discussed in the Sleep Evidence Report, spaceflight evidence shows that sleep medications are one of the most commonly used medications during spaceflight. Flight surgeons have requested an electronic database that will make information regarding the effects of sleep-wake medications readily available to them. Some medications are suspected to work differe ntly in space than on Earth; other medications may be required in-flight, and the potential interactions between these and sleep medications are yet to be determined. HRP-47065 132 Tasks : (BHP Directed study) Develop Electronic Sleep Wake Medication Database (Dinges) 2007-2009: Develop database and provide to operations.

Tasks : (BHP Directed study / Ops (TBD)) Individualized Protocols Sleep/Wake Medications 2009-12: Pilot and Ground Study, Develop and Implement Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut Sleep Medicati on Efficacy and Individual Effects (Johnston) This task is a ground based study to test the percentage change in sleep inertia from using a medications (commonly used during spaceflight) compared to normal sleep inertia. The study will test the feasibility of a protocol for use with astronauts and other NASA personnel (e.g., flight surgeons, flight directors and flight controllers) to assess potential carry over effects from sleep medications used during spaceflight operations, overseas training periods, and following an abrupt awaken ing from sleep. This information is needed to establish optimal and individually tailored protocols for usage of sleep medications by key personnel relative to operational demands. 2012: Determine if Spaceflig ht studies are needed If so, prepare for spaceflight study 2013: Prep for spaceflight 2014-2017: Validate protocols in-flight If not, determine if ground studies are needed If so, 2013-2016: Additional ground studies If not, stop tasks 2020-2023: Lunar study to assess effects of medications in Lunar environment Deliverables : Recommendations for best operational approach for utilizing sleep medications individualized recommendations for sleep medications.

While the evidence is largely anecdotal, strict adhere nce to timelines has been reported to be fatiguing and stressful for astronauts. Furthermore, indivi duals on analog missions where there are unusual light HRP-47065 134 cues (i.e. twenty-four hour sunlight in the Arctic) have reported that they continue to work for hours on end without feeling a need for sleep, a potential con cern since lack of sleep and fatigue can affect performance. In future space missions to the Moon or Mars, crewmembers will be given more autonomy to plan and carry out their activities due to the long distances involved and the tasks that will be needed to explore a planetary surface, and they will also be exposed to light cues unlike those on Earth. Recommended optimal work rest schedules need to be provided so that crews can make informed decisions around work and rest.

Sleep9: What are the countermeasures needed to recover from chronic partial sleep loss and/or slam shifting? Despite medication use, sleep loss does occur dur ing spaceflight, with some crewmembers reporting minimal amounts of sleep, particularly prior to conduc ing critical mission tasks. Many factors can affect sleep quality and quantity in the spaceflight mission environment including high noise levels, shifting schedules, high tempo workloads, thermal temperat ure changes, microgravity adjustment, and close proximity to others. Flight surgeons have request ed information that can aid individual astronauts on improving their sleep quality and quantity during spaceflight. Given the complexity of spaceflight missions, and the effects of sleep loss on fatigue and performance, such information will be instrumental for not only crewmembers, but also their families, ground support teams, and other medical personnel regarding strategies to improve sleep quantity and qual ity. Information will help inform current standards as well as those for future missions. Tasks : (NSBRI) Sleep Dose Recovery 2008-2009: Lab studies This laboratory effort evaluates the e ffect of different doses of sleep time on performance and cognition.

Sleep10: What flight rules and requirements improve sleep, circadian desynchronization, fatigue and work overload, to reduce performance errors? Aspects of spaceflight missions and the spaceflight environment can adversely impact sleep and circadian rhythms. While some factors (such as noise) cannot be controlled, others (such as lighting and schedules) may be informed by research. BHP aims to assess current flight rules and requirements in order to develop recommendations for constellation. Tasks : (Directed Study/Locke) Sleep Quality and Strategies Questionnaire 2009: Systematic review of flight rules and requirements regarding sleep 2008-2011: Ground Studies Data collection from crews returning from flight regarding their sleep quality on-orbit, and in comparison to their terrestrial sleep and during various training activities.

Required Platforms : Primarily ground effort with validation on lunar surface. Th is includes a data mining effort in collaboration with CB and Med Ops. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass ndations on lunar surface 20 Very Low HRP-47065 137 Tasks : (Directed Study) Determine Sleep Performance Countermeasures for Martian Sol - Flight and Ground Crews 2008-2010: Ground Studies Ground crews supporting Mars robotic missions have chosen to maximize the use of the rovers on the surface of Mars by adopting the Mars sol. As a result, these engi neers and scientists live/work on a 24 hour and 39 minute schedule. After 10 days, these individuals are shifted by six and a half hours. Trying to maintain such a schedule has proven challenging for crews. Those supporting the Mars Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity Rovers have struggled with fatigue and other issues. NASA BHP is conducting a directed study with the ground crew supporting the Mars Phoenix Scout Lander. This study will evaluate countermeasure effectiveness for attempting to manage sleep over a Mars schedule. 2011: Determine if additional studies are needed.

HRP-47065 138 HRP-47065 139 HRP-47065 145 HRP-47065 146 HRP-47065 147 HRP-47065 148 RISK OF PERFORMANCE ERRORS DU E TO POOR TEAM COHESION AND PERFORMANCE, INADEQUATE SE LECTION/TEAM COMPOSITION, INADEQUATE TRAINING, AND POOR PSYCHOSOCIAL ADAPTATION - CRITICALITY: LUNAR POST - D, MARS - I Human performance errors may occur due to problems associated with working in the space environment and incidents of failure of crews to cooperate and work effectively with each other or with flight controllers have been observed. Interpersonal c onflict, misunderstanding a nd impaired communication may impact performance and mission success. However, the history of spaceflight crews regarding team cohesion, team performance, and ground-crew intera ction has not been systematically documented. Tools, training, and other support methods should be provided to reduce the likelihood of this risk and improve crew performance, crew cohesion, and crew-ground interaction. Operational Relevance Assessment and Recommendations While little empirical data have been collected regard ing the impact of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors on spaceflight performance, it is possible th at crew conflict could jeopardize long duration Exploration Missions. Reports from MIR reveal that several missions may have been terminated earlier than planned due to interpersona l frictions between crewmembers, and some veteran NASA astronauts have reported crew conflict during previous space travels. Understanding the potential negative impacts of interpersonal and intrapersonal issues from spaceflight and relevant, high fide lity analog environments is critical for identifying actions required to help crewmembers succeed during new types of missions (e.g., Mars Missions). Few individuals have spent one year or longer in isolated and confined environments, and a Mars Mission could be as long as three years in duration. Thus, observations and \"lessons learned\" from previous space missions and from relevant analog environments are important sources of information required to inform these effo rts. In preparation for Exploration Missions, BHP research focuses on preventing and mitigating the risk of performance errors due to inadequate Team Cohesion and Performance, Inadequate Selection/Te am Composition, Inadequate Training, and Poor Psychosocial Adaptation. Monitoring tools, countermeasures, training requirements, and selection/composition recommendations are needed to ai d flight crews and ground support teams so that optimal performance may be realized. Strategy for Mitigation The risk mitigation strategy of the BHP Element follows the larger strategy of the HRP \"from Evidence to Products\" principle, while being driven by Operatio ns. BHP holds an annual working group of subject matter experts who work with BHP and Medical Opera tions to identify gaps in knowledge and gaps in mitigation. Specific tasks are defined to address the gaps and provide clear, specific deliverables for Constellation, ensuring an evidence and operationa lly based end item. Working with research and operational experts, BHP systematically identifies th e appropriate analog to address the gaps prior to validating in spaceflight. To ensure relevancy, stakeholders are engaged in the process at the beginning. Findings from BHP research inform operations and st andards as well as update the evidence base for the BHP Risks. The strategy for mitigation for this area of research is to develop an empirical-based approach to first identify the most relevant and serious threats to team performance, team cohesion, and crew-ground interaction. Utilizing a common set of criteria will allow for the systematic review and analysis of knowledge as well as current practices/policies in impl ementing BHP operations. Once these threats have been identified, the most effective ways to monitor and measure these threats as well as the identification of optimal countermeasures to mitigate these threats w ill be determined. To further mitigate the risk, specific factors have been identified (e.g., crew composition, communication, autonomy, etc.) as highly HRP-47065 149 relevant to long duration space missions. Thus, th ese gaps will focus specifically on understanding the true impact of these factors on long duration missions. Gaps BHP Gap Team1: What are the most likely a nd most serious threats to crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew-ground interaction expect ed for exploration missions? (Priority 1) The most serious and relevant threats to crew pe rformance, crew cohesion, and crew-ground interaction have not been systematically analyzed and documente d. This approach will take an empirically based approach to identify which threats ar e most relevant and serious to the set criteria. As noted in the Team Evidence Book, existing threats may negatively affect cohesion and crew-ground interaction, both of which ultimately preclude optimal performance. Thus, it is necessary to identify those threats that are most likely to influence these criteria negatively. Tasks : (Directed Study, BHP In-House) Systematic Query: Crew History 2010: Literature/Ops Review Review of existing crew information and literature from analogs to examine small groups in extreme environments. 2011: Develop Questionnaire Develop questionnaire for current and future long-duration crews regarding their experiences, emphasizing interpersonal factors.

Required Platforms : Ground based data collection BHP Gap Team2: What are the most optimal w ays to monitor and measure crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew-ground interaction for exploration missions? (Priority 1) Given the importance of threats identified in the first gap in relation to crew performance, crew cohesion, and crew-ground interaction, monitoring tools and other measures will need to be developed to assess these relationships. During Exploration Missions, and especially during a Mars Mission, real time communication between the crew and flight surgeons will not be available as it is now on ISS. Flight surgeons have stated the need for unobtrusive mon itoring tools that are transparent to crews, require minimal crew time or effort, and that help detect if crews are having difficulties coping with the spaceflight environment by utilizing indicators of perfo rmance, cohesion, and crew-ground interaction. The aim of the current gap is to identify the most optim al tools that will detect changes in crew cohesion, crew performance, and/or crew-ground interaction. One task specifically relates to the creation of a tool that will monitor changes in crew cohesion. Monitori ng tools identified in the Risk of Behavioral and Psychiatric Conditions may also provide an assessment of team cohesion. These tools (e.g., voice acoustics and facial expression recognition) will be validated in ground studies through 2010, and validated in flight through 2017 if deemed necess ary (more information can be found in BMed3). HRP-47065 151 Tasks : (NRA) Assess measures for Monitoring Crew Cohesion 2009-2012: Test Measures in Analogs: Activities include evaluating various existing techniques for assessing team cohesion through crew communication, validating these techniques in analog and/or operational environments (i.e. during astronaut training), and validating on ISS. 2013: ISS Prep 2014-2016: ISS Validation Studies: Preferred techniques will be developed into Requirements for an automated, unobtrusive tool to be utilized during Exploration Missions. 2017-2023: Ground and Flight Studies, if needed If after undergoing validation utilizing ISS Studies these techniques are found to be not effective, additional ground studies and flight validation st udies to identify optimal tools will be conducted. The optimal technological tools from these studies will be validated in lunar studies. New Requirements will then be delivered by 2023 for informing Human Subjects Risk Forum/Med Ops and Input to Mars Ops Development.

BHP Gap Team3: What additional approaches would enhance current in-flight interventions and countermeasures for supporting crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew-ground interaction for exploration missions? (Priority 1) Once the threats have been identified and the optimal ways to measure and monitor these threats and their impact on crew performance, crew cohesion, and crew -ground interaction has been developed, it may be necessary to develop additional countermeasures that e nhance current practices to mitigate these threats, particularly for long duration exploration missions. The Team Evidence Book clearly states that countermeasures are needed in order to reduce any negative impact on crew performance. Thus, the development of strategies and countermeasures, in cluding development of training protocols and new monitoring methods and tools, ma y be addressed in this gap. HRP-47065 153 Tasks : (BHP In-House) Identify Optimal Countermeasures to Support Crew Cohesion 2010-2011: Literature/Ops Review Review of past and current literature and assessment of operations to ascertain current best practices/policies to identify optimal countermeasures to support crew cohesion Deliverables : Countermeasure Report - provides a summary of literature and current operations and identifies optimal countermeasures to support crew cohesion.

HRP-47065 154 BHP Gap Team4: What are the most optimal ways to compose crews to ensure crew cohesion, optimize crew performance, and facilitate crew -ground interaction for exploration missions? (Priority 2) Group composition plays an important role in team performance: research included in the Team Evidence Book indicates that team composition is a key differen tiating factor between high- and low-success teams. Furthermore, research demonstrates that composition can also influence cohesion and interpersonal interaction among crewmembers. Therefore, it seems necessary to examine and implement practices to secure the best crew composition for Exploration Missions. BHP places this gap as a second priority within the Team Risk to address recommendations for team composition for Exploration Missions. Tasks : (BHP In-House (Review); NRA (ISS Study)) Crew Composition Studie s 2010-2011: Literature/Ops Review Review of past and current literature and assessment of operations to ascertain current best practices/policies to identify optimal composition factors that influence crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew-ground interaction.

Required Delivery Milestone : Inform HSRF/Med Ops for Lunar Habitat missions in 2021. Recommendations required by 2025. Required Platforms : This effort is primarily ground studies although lunar studies will also be utilized to validate the tool. BHP Gap Team5: What are the optimal ways to train crews, leaders, and ground support to ensure crew cohesion, optimize crew performance, and fa cilitate crew-ground interaction for exploration missions? (Priority 2) Crews on ISS are diverse (multiculturally, racially, etc. ), and this diversity will most likely continue for Exploration Missions. As noted in the Team Eviden ce Book, finding adequate time for crews to train together continues to remain a challenge. Current plans for astronaut teams include reducing the times spent together training even further, and subse quently these changes will likely increase conflict and performance-related decrements. These factors make it essential to determine what ac ceptable alternatives to traditional team training methods (i.e. virtual team training) exist. In additio n, the type of team training activities (role playing, etc.) and the duration of the training are important f actors in designing the most efficient and effective training model that will improve cr ew performance, crew cohesion, and crew-ground interaction. It is critical to capture what type, dose, style and lengt h of training can most adequately cover multiple competencies to ensure efficiency of the astronaut s' time while promoting mastery of the required competencies for a successful mission. Tasks : (Directed) Training Studies: Crew Cohesion and Crew Performance 2009-2013: Evaluate Training Evaluate training using analog studies (and/or studies in operational environment) to validate optimal training methods. Analogs may include NEEMO and HMP. 2013-2014: ISS Prep 2014-2018: ISS Studies Evaluate Training Requirements during spaceflight on ISS to determine if Tr aining Requirements are adequate. If further Training Requirements are needed, studie s will commence and will be followed by a phase of simultaneous in-flight and lunar studies.

Required Platforms : Activities include assessing training in an alog and/or operational environments), and validating on ISS and in lunar studies. # of Subjects Initial Upmass Upmass Downmass Crew Post-Flight (kg) (kg/subject) (kg/subject) Time/Subject teams Medium : (TBD) Training Studies: Crew-Ground Interaction 2010-2013: Evaluate Crew-Ground Interaction TBD Deliverables : Requirements for crew-ground interaction TBD Update to Standards, if applicable. Required Delivery Milestone : TBD Required Platforms : TBD BHP Gap Team6: How does increased work autono my impact crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew-ground interaction for exploration missions? (Priority 3) As crews begin operations for long duration missions beyond low Earth orbit, they will need to exercise increasing command and control of their daily activiti es. The distance for Mars Missions will result in loss of capability for real-time communication, downli nk, and commanding. Likewise, the crew will have to augment and adapt their schedules based on real tim e changes in their schedules. Medical Operations has requested a study of crew autonomy while we are still in low Earth orbit, to identify the impact (if any) of increased autonomy on crew dynamics and performance. Tasks : (Directed) Task: Impact of Increase Work Autonomy on Performance 2008-2010: Analog Studies Conduct studies in NEEMO to evaluate impact of increased autonomy on cohesion and performance. 2009-2010: RCS Conduct studies in the Russian-Chamber 105 day study, observing impact of increased autonomy on cohesion and performance. 2010: Autonomy Workshop Conduct Autonomy Workshop to examine preliminary resu lts from analog studies and further define role of autonomy in Mars exploration and its effects on crew performance and crew dynamics. 2010-2011: Prep 2011-2015: ISS Studies Studies on ISS to observe crew performance and cohesion, working under a low autonomy condition versus a high autonomy condition. If evidence exists that increased autonomy impact s crew dynamics and performance, the need for countermeasures in addition to what BHP has developed/is developing, will be considered. Recommendations will be provided and ground and flight studies will then commence with plans to validate in lunar missions. Deliverables : Recommendations based on the impact (if any) of increased autonomy in analogs and spaceflight.

Required Delivery Milestone : Initial Autonomy Report based on literature review and assessment of current practices completed at the end of 2011. Report/Recommendations required by the beginning of 2012 to determine if studies are needed. Required Platforms : Ground based data collection TBD. BHP Gap Team7: What aspects of communication impact crew cohesion, optimize crew performance, and facilitate crew-ground interaction for exploration missions? When considering the context of long duration missi ons, communication is likely to be a key factor to positive interpersonal interactions and will likely infl uence crew cohesion, crew performance, and crew- ground interaction. This is especially true when considering the communication delay between crewmembers and ground control during long durati on missions. Data summarized in the Team Evidence Book suggests that communication can affect inter actions among crewme mbers when dealing with task- related issues and/or interpersonal-related issues. Thus, it is necessary to identify in what way communication may impact the identified criteria. HRP-47065 158 Tasks : (NSBRI) Conflict Management for Crew Cohesion NSBRI funded the development of a technology that guides astronauts through conflict resolution. 2009-2012: Analog Tests The effectiveness of this technology should be evaluate d in analogs, such as the Antarctic, where groups of individuals are stationed for months at a time, in extreme, isolated environments where conflict has been known to occur. 2012-2013: ISS Prep 2013-2015: ISS Studies The technology should then be made available on ISS, and its effectiveness with astronauts, when used, should be evaluated. If flight data collected reveals that additional countermeasures are needed to address cohesion and communication, additional studies will be developed to help design and test new stra tegies. If necessary, will utilize ground and flight stud ies, with a desire to validate those op timal countermeasures in lunar missions.

HRP-47065 160 HRP-47065 161 HRP-47065 HRP-47065 165 HRP-47065 166 HRP-47065 167 RISK OF ERRORS DUE TO POOR TASK DESIGN - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - I If roles and responsibilities for accomplishing tasks are not clearly defined, there will be a risk of serious errors of omission or commission. This risk may rela te to interaction between multiple crewmembers, to interactions between crew, robotics, and automa tion, and between crew and ground control. Understanding the characteristics of the elements involved, how each communicates, and establishing guidelines to adhere to during task design and procedure development are all essential to mission success. Operational Relevance and Risk Context One of the most critical enablers of human presence in space is human systems standards that provide for crew health as well as standards for habitability, e nvironmental, and human factors. The Space Flight Human System Standards - SFHSS - (and the comp anion Human Integration Design Handbook - HIDH) require that each human spaceflight program derive pr ogram-specific, verifiable requirements to comply with the standards, and require that each human spaceflight program establish a human factors process involving health and human factors experts. This is to ensure identification of any standards in the SFHSS that are not applicable (or altered) and the rationale for non-applicability; that all program level health and human factors requirements are based on the HIDH, c ited empirical evidence, or known best practices; and that end-items are in compliance with SFHSS, and agency and program level requirements and specifications. The activities cited reflect the need to work toward the mitigation of identified SHFE risks by continuing to inform the standards, by engagement in the de velopment of the requirements that will implement the standards based upon the resulting products, as well as providing content to the HIDH that will serve as the implementation guide. In addition, products r esulting from these activities may provide valuable information to spaceflight programs that can inform the requests for trade studies. To ensure operational relevance of the deliverabl es from the tasks, all tasks leaders will identify stakeholders who will work with them in framing the questions and approach. The stakeholders will participate by identifying specific issues requiring research or technology development, by reviewing progress, and by suggesting operational evaluations. Depending on the specific tasks, stakeholders may include engineers or operations personnel. Strategy for Mitigation The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop an understanding of the factors that contribute to this risk, identify gaps in our knowledge about these factor s, and prioritize these gaps based on various criteria systematically applied. Then the highest priority ga ps are addressed through directed or solicited research depending on the time frame and the complexity and sp ecificity of the gap. Where there is a disconnect between critical gaps that should be addressed and a l ack of funding, efforts are made to re-examine the programmatic priorities to ensure those of highest concern are being investigated. The risk associated with designi ng tasks focuses specifically on the process of assigning roles and responsibilities to individual crewmembers, a group of crewmembers, automation, and ground support alone or in combination. The Behavioral Health and Performance Element has primary responsibility for addressing risks related to team dynamics. SHFE sp ecifically studies issues in designing tasks to be performed jointly by humans and automation, or deciding how much responsibility to assign to an automated system. The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop and specify \"best practices\" for human-automation function allocation; -crew-automation interface design, , how to incorporate considerations of crew workload and situational aw areness in mixed-initiative op erations concept design, and determining methods to ensure effective levels of trust betw een the crew and automation while avoiding unacceptable levels of crew complacency. HRP-47065 168 The strategy for addressing this risk is intertwined w ith the strategies for addressing the Risk of Reduced Safety and Efficiency Due to an Inadequately Desi gned Vehicle, Environment, Tools or Equipment, and the Risk of Errors due to Inadequate Information. The work described under this risk focuses on planning how a given task or mission objective will be accomp lished. This risk addresses how to decide what skills, tools, equipment and information are needed to accomplish a task, and what amounts of automation or human involvement are required. The Risk Due to an Inadequately Designed Vehicle, Environment, Tools, or Equipment captures the f actors that lead to inappropriate human interfaces for the habitat and equipment. Work under the Risk of Errors due to Inadequate Information contributes to the crew having adequate knowledge, skills, and in formation at the time the task needs to be performed. The specific selection choices of the highest priority gaps and tasks are based primarily on gap analyses. The SHFE project updates its gap analyses on an annual basis. This is necessar y as research results and continual information drawn from cr ew debriefings has the potential of discovering additional gaps in knowledge. These updates assist in the preparation for the annual Standing Review Panel. The original analysis carried out in 2006 was published as NASA/TP-2007-213739 (\"Space Human Factors Engineering Gap Analysis Project Final Report,\" C. Hudy and B. Woolford, 2007). An update was completed in spring 2007. The gaps are identified through reviews of the lite rature, of crew debrief summaries, and through interviews with more than a hundred users of human factors standards and guidelines, representing Engineering, Mission Operations , Flight Medicine, Training, the Crew Office, and others. We place particular emphasis on inte rviewing representatives from Constellation Program Office, the Human-System Integration Group, the Or ion Project Office, the Cockpit Display Working Group, and other programmatic users of our products. The 'small' gaps or specific concerns identified from these sources are aggregated into more appropriate levels for which a specific task can be designed. For example, numerous users report gaps in design for workload: lack of consistency of definition; lack of easy to use methods to assess work load; lack of a way to verify that a requirement for workload has been met. These various individual-level concerns are captured in a gap, \"There is no standardized non-intrusive measure of workload.\" After all concerns are mapped to gaps, the gaps are prioritized according to a number of criteria. Key criteria are importance to Constellation Program and n eed date. When we identify 'TBRs' or 'TBDs' in the Human Systems Integration Requirements, for example, these are assigned a very high priority. Ratings are solicited from management representatives of the offices from which gaps were identified. After prioritization, the gaps that can be addressed within the budget are initiated through directed research or solicited through research announcements. Directed research is chosen for time critical results. Solicitations are used for gaps that are longe r term and that can benefit from wider participation. Gaps SHFE 1.1.1.2.1: How can standard measures or t ools be developed that can unobtrusively measure workload? Tasks : (SHFE - Directed, Collaboration with HRP BHP) Development of Workload and Human Performance Evaluation Methods Available research shows that the relationship between workload and performance is a nuanced one. Simple approaches that attempt to maintain overall workload at an intermediate value are unlikely to achieve the desired results. The successful management or evaluation of workload must include a consideration of the nature of individual tasks that operators must perform, the combinations of tasks that are performed during a work period, priorities among tasks, and individual differences among operators. This task will look at the relationship between workload and performance with the goal of producing more effective methods for evaluating proposed designs and operating proced ures for space applications. HRP-47065 169 Tasks : (SHFE - Directed, Collaboration with HRP BHP) Development of Workload and Human Performance Evaluation Methods (cont'd) Deliverables : A review of all workload measurement techniques, simple task analysis techniques, and operator performance metrics.

Tasks : (SHFE - New Directed Research or NRA) Situational Awareness Evaluation Situational awareness is a complex concept that combines both consciously identifying all salient aspects of a current state, and connecting those as pects to prior knowledge about the task. It focuses on the connections between perceptions and long-term memory - are the im portant cues perceived? Are they matched to the appropriate responses? Issues with re spect to situational awareness arise when tasks are complex and cues to the exact state of the system are not suffici ently strong. In partially automated tasks, deficiencies in recognizing the state of the automated system or the state of the enviro nment are common sources of errors that can result in loss of mission objectives. This task w ill identify the best available methods to assess situational awareness and develop an approach to evaluating task and equipment designs to ensure that sufficient cues for situational awareness are available.

Tasks : (SHFE - Directed) Automation Interface The automation design community needs methods that are usable by designers early in the design process to meet demands for the development and testing of automation for space exploration. The objec tive of this task is to develop a set of methodologies and tools to automate the design and evaluation of the human-computer interaction concepts. The research plan is to integr ate existing foundational research results into Human Automation Interaction (HAI) methods and tools usable by designers. Deliverables : Documentation of Application Domain - To adequately model the process and perform the task decomposition, researchers have to develop a deep knowledge of the domain , the process, and culture of the organization. This is vital to ensuring that the resulting method/toolset is compatible with the end-users enterprise environment.

Integrate the methods that have been developed in the previous tasks into tool suites that are usable by designers without requiring extensive Human Co mputer Interaction expertise. Pr ovide quantitative assessments of the performance of an automation design and its in terface for a specific task on a given design. Demonstration & Testing - All of the studies are focu sed on delivering tools to help designers make better Human-Automation Interaction decisions early in the op erations concept design process. Specifically, as described earlier, the first year of the task will focus on developing tools that are usable by the ISS Attitude Direction and Control team.

Usability refers to the quality of an interfa ce or hardware. It can be re presented by five quality components: learnability, efficiency, me morability, errors, and satisfaction (Nie lsen, 2003). Learnability refers to the ease of accomplishing basic tasks when users encounter the design for the first time. Efficiency is the time needed to accomplish a task after users are already famili ar with the design. Memorability can be measured by the change in performance following a period of not using th e interface. Errors can be counted during task execution and rated based on severity. User satis faction is a metric indicating how pleasant the design is to use. Some of these can be represented by objectiv e measures, while others are subjectiv e. However, they provide a good picture of the overall usability of a system. Furthermore, they can provide evidence for any return on investment that may result from redesigns of a system, thus making usability and human factors quantifiable. Deliverables : Develop and propose usability metrics that can be app lied in the space science area, along with recommended usability methodologies for collecting the metrics. The fo cus will be on challenges such as error definition, acceptable error rates, and error classification and weighting. Research and develop a consistency scale that can be validated and standardized. Field test and validate usability measures, metrics, and meth odologies in one or more real life projects. Document methodology and measurement techniques in a standardized way that will help NASA practitioners to used them in a reliable way. Define requirements language based on proposed usability metrics.

Tasks : (SHFE - Directed) Information Presentation - Displays (Visual and Auditory)**** Optimal displays are critical to crew performance and vehicle operations. Di splays must meet the crew's needs and be easy to use, particularly as Exploration mission operations venture farther from the Earth and real-time ground-based operational assistance becomes degraded or unavailable. The focus for visual displays is readability and usability of text, and effective display navigation. The focus of auditory displays is caution and warning system alarms. This is a requirements development activity, supplemented by some research or validation activities on the ground and in flight. This w ill result in the development of guidelines, requirements, and validation techniques for advanced information display solutions currently contemplated for the various Constellation Program spacecraft systems c onsistent with the smaller cockpit en vironments of the Orion CEV, the Lander, and surface rovers. These requ irements and appropriate informat ion will be provided to Orion, Constellation documentation (CxP70024 Human System Integration Requirements; Orion Display Standards) and the Space Flight Human System Standard s Human Integration Design Handbook.

This becomes especially important when the majority of the controls w ill be software based. Crewmembers must be very aware of what they are manipulating on the screen, and must be able to do so under vibration and high-g, as well as in microgravity. They must be able to operate controls ungloved and with pressurized gloved hands. During launch and entry, crews will have no choice other than to use a re mote cursor control device. If the input control devices are inadequate for any of the above operational scenar ios, crew safety will be compromised and operational capability will be compromised. These requirements and appropriate information will be provided to Orion, Constellation documentation (CxP70024 Human System Integration Requirements; Orion Display Standards) and the Space Flight Human System Standard s Human Integration Design Handbook.

The extent to which information needed to support a t ask or mission operation can be easily accessed and easily processed is vital to all space missions. Theref ore, further research regarding proper information presentation will enable development of requireme nts and guidelines to optimize presentation of information, its timeliness, the user's level of aw areness of the information, modes of information presentation, proper information comprehension, tr aining methods, and development of procedures. Operational Relevance and Risk Context One of the most critical enablers of human presen ce in space has been ensuring that there are human systems standards in place that will provide for crew health as well as standards for habitability, environmental, and human factors. The Space Flight Human System Standards - SFHSS - (and the companion Human Integration Design Handbook - HIDH) require that each human spaceflight program derive program-specific, verifiable requirements to comply with the standards, and require that each human spaceflight program establish a human factors process involving health and human factors experts. This is to ensure that there will be identification of any standards in the SFHSS that are not applicable (or altered) and the rationale for non-applicability; th at all program level health and human factors requirements are based on the HIDH, cited empirical evidence, or known best practices; and that end-items are in compliance with SFHSS, and agency a nd program level requirements and specifications. The activities cited reflect the need to work toward the mitigation of identified SHFE risks by continuing to inform the standards, by engagement in the de velopment of the requirements that will implement the standards based upon the resulting products, as well as providing content to the HIDH that will serve as the implementation guide. In addition, products r esulting from these activities may provide valuable information to spaceflight programs that can inform the requests for trade studies. To ensure operational relevance of the deliverabl es from the tasks, all tasks leaders will identify stakeholders who will work with them in framing the questions and approach. The stakeholders will participate by identifying specific issues requiring research or technology development, by reviewing progress, and by suggesting operational evaluations. Depending on the specific tasks, stakeholders may include engineers or operations personnel. Strategy for Mitigation The approach to mitigating this risk is to develop an understanding of the factors that contribute to this risk, identify gaps in our knowledge about these factor s, and prioritize these gaps based on various criteria systematically applied. Then the highest priority ga ps are addressed through directed or solicited research depending on the time frame and the complexity and sp ecificity of the gap. Where there is a disconnect between critical gaps requiring addressing and a lack of funding, efforts are made to re-examine the programmatic priorities to ensure those of highest concern are being investigated. The risk associated with error due to inadequate information focuses on identifying the causes of risk, for example, the lack of situational awareness that might be due to poorly designed interfaces or tasks, and the subsequent development of information presen tation standards for reducing operator errors in spaceflight through adequate understanding of the causes a nd mitigations of the errors. As the topic of inadequate information is co mprehensive, the approach to mitigating this risk is to focus on the display of information, the types of controls that interface between the human and the displays, and the procedures to accomplish tasks. HRP-47065 181 It is not possible to separate the strategy for mitigating this risk from the strategy for dealing with the risk of Errors due to Poor Task Design. The informati on that is needed to perform a task at a given time depends substantially on the nature of the task and the crewmember s' roles and responsibilities. The work described under this risk presumes the task is well designed and focuses on the problems of ensuring the necessary information is presented in such a way as to en able timely, accurate performance. The specific selection choices of the highest priority gaps and tasks are based primarily on gap analyses. The SHFE project updates its gap analyses on an annual basis. This is necessar y as research results and continual information drawn from cr ew debriefings has the potential of discovering additional gaps in knowledge. These updates assist in the preparation for the annual Science Review Panel. The original analysis carried out in 2006 was published as NASA/TP-2007-213739 (\"Space Human Factors Engineering Gap Analysis Project Final Report,\" C. Hudy and B. Woolford, 2007). An update was completed in spring 2007. The gaps are identified through reviews of the lite rature, of crew debrief summaries, and through interviews with more than a hundred users of human factors results, representing Engineering, Mission Operations, Flight Medicine, Training, the Crew Office, and others. We place particular emphasis on interviewing representatives from Constellation Program Office, the Human-System Integration Group, the Orion Project Office, the Cockpit Display Working Group, and other programmatic users of our products. The 'small' gaps or specific concerns identified from these sources are aggregated into more appropriate levels for wh ich a specific task can be designed. For example, numerous users report gaps in design for workload: lack of consistency of definition; lack of easy to use methods to assess workload; lack of a way to verify that a requirement for workload has been met. These various individual-level concerns ar e captured in a gap, \"There is no standardized non-intrusive measure of workload.\" After all concerns are mapped to gaps, the gaps are prioritized according to a number of criteria. Key criteria are importance to Constellation Program and n eed date. When we identify 'TBRs' or 'TBDs' in the Human Systems Integration Requirements, for example, these are assigned a very high priority. Ratings are solicited from management representatives of the offices from which gaps were identified. After prioritization, the gaps that can be addressed within the budget are initiated through directed research or solicited through research announcements. Directed research is chosen for time critical results. Solicitations are used for gaps that are longe r term and that can benefit from wider participation. Gaps SHFE 3.1.1.a: How can we develop objective trai ning measures to determine operator proficiency during and after ground training? Tasks : (SHFH - Directed) Training for Effective Space F light Resource Management Ground-based pre-flight training and in-space just-in-tim e training and task rehearsal will continue to be an important driver for exploration missions. On-board training systems will enhance the autonomy and effectiveness of exploratio n crews. Long-duration missi ons preclude the possibility of easily substituting new crewmembers from the ground that have been specially trained on specific emerging problems, new tasks, and scientific or mission operations. Human spaceflight will continue to depend even more on the deep knowledge astronauts acquire of the idiosyncrasies of the flight systems they live with and th e tasks they have to perform. However, given the nature of the missions, onboard training opportunities for individuals and teams will be necessary, such as in reconfigurable training and mission rehearsal systems. These systems will enable the crews to keep their skill levels up to par and to develop new skills or practice ne w procedures to resolve new challenges as they arise. HRP-47065 182 Deliverables : Develop an MOD-specific non-technical (i.e., independent of spacecraft systems) framework (such as a game structure) that can be used to train SFRM skills (suc h as situation awareness, communication, and decision- making). Development of training events using the SFRM Paper Sim that could be used to reliably predict the likelihood of a trainee's success in acquiring good SFRM skills. Required Delivery Milestone : FY09: SFRM Generic Paper Sim - Proof of Concept Study FY09: Interim delivery of SFRM tool to Mission Ops and MOD FY10: SFRM Generic Paper Sim - Predictive Training Events Concept Study.

Although there are very good reasons to feel confident in this approach, it is critical to assess the effectiveness of the changes to the Mission Operations flight controllers' training flow. As the changes are introduced into the training, the study will be tracking students' performance and continuously evaluating the success of the training. However, it will take time to appreciate the full ef fect of the new training approach. It will require having enough flight controllers who complete the new training flow and start working on console to be able to compare the results of this new training with those obtained in the previous training flow. This will provide for a continuous feedback loop and ongoing revisions and improvements to the new training program as soon as it is implemented. A training continuum spans a full range from initial training , to recurrent and refresher training, to just-in-time training (JITT). Previous work examined aspects of th e initial medical training, focused on JITT, explored the issues relevant to refresher training, and will now address requirements for the full medical training continuum and develop metrics to assess training methods and proficiency.

Deliverables : Exploratory Evaluation of Tools of Just-In-Time Training for an Emergency Procedure- provides a better understanding of performance times and types of errors associated with display devices. Evaluation of the Flight Surgeon Performance Support Tool prototype - \"Flight Surgeon Response to ISS Emergencies.\" A detailed task analysis examining the role of the flight surgeon during an on-board emergency will be completed. The task analysis will contribute to updated design options. Computer implementation for Just-in-Time training - The paper prototype that will be evaluated in FY09 will be implemented in a computer program in FY10. This implementation will allo w the Flight Surgeon to have access to the tool on their laptop computers, and will allow us to embed layers of information providing further details beyond the necessary immediate actions.

Need for on-board crew to semi-autonomously plan a nd dynamically replan their schedules and activities. Scheduling, rescheduling, and real-time changes are done manually and are labor intensive. HRP-47065 184Tasks : (SHFE - Directed, Partnership with HRP BHP) Science Planning Interface to Engi neering (SPIFe) - Scheduling Tool Future mission concepts will require a significantly more efficient planning process and tools. The ultimate goal of this effort is to allow an on-board crew to semi-autonomously plan and dynamically replan their activity. Based on a firm understanding of ground-bas ed replanning in several domains, the activity will be well positioned to understand and develop tools for on-board use. The SPIFe tool considers a wide range of the dynamic resources constraining schedule and allows the crewmember to schedule tasks and check that the resources required to execute the task will be available, an d that there are no unintended consequences of scheduling the task at a particular time (such as not being able to execute another required task at a later time). Development of this tool is almost complete, and then a decision will be made re garding its utility for spacecraft operations planning and if required, the tool will be validated in an operationa lly intensive ground analog (e.g. NEEMO). A functional prototype could be run alongside existing tools to collect valuable data on the tool and its capability to optimize a schedule. Deliverables : The product is an understanding of at least one additional Constellation analog domain that will implement tools and processes that improve planning efficiency by an order of magnitude, and to understand and prototype tools that can be used for tactical on-board re-planning by the crew of Constellation missions.

Tasks : (NSBRI - Sensorimotor Adaptation Team) Sensorimotor Display and Controls - Enhancing the Safety of Human/Machine Cooperation During Lunar Landing (SM11) Lunar landing depends on the selection and identification of an appropriate location that is level and free of hazards, along with a stable controlled descent to the surface. During crewed landings, astronauts are expected to interact with automated systems, based upon improved terrain maps and sensor updates, to perform tasks such as manual re-designation of landing point, adjustment of descent trajectory or direct manual control. However, sensorimotor limitations, both vestibular and visual, are likely to interfere with performance and safety. This integrated project examines the nature of the anticipated spatial disorientation and terrain perception limits as they affect the transition from automatic to manual control and develops advanced display countermeasures to overcome these limitations. Deliverables : Examination of the nature of anticipated sensorimotor di fficulties (e.g., spatial disorientation, limits on terrain perception) as they affect the transition from automatic to manual control. Development and evaluation of advanced display countermeasures for enhancing situation and terrain awareness and for overcoming performance limitations caused by redu ced visibility associated with lunar lighting, terrain reflectivity and the absence of atmosphere utilizing Draper Laboratory's fixed-base lunar lander cockpit simulator for full human-in-the-loop evaluation.

Improved training methods provide a framework for designing future in- flight training procedures during long-duration missions. The project will also demonstrate how individual differences affect performance of a critical operational skill and will provide initial designs of controls, displays, and procedures that better match the operators' cognitive sk ills with task demands. The long term objectives of this project are: to develop tests of astronaut spatiomotor abilities that predict the need for remedial training or performance in final telerobotic qualification tests; and to improve teleoperation training techniques and develop new teleoperator interfaces that improve the efficien cy of teleoperation training and flight operations. HRP-47065 187 Deliverables : To improve NASA teleoperation training efficiency by scientifically customizing remedial training based on the measured spatial abilities of individual astronauts. We ha ve examined whether NASA JSCs current Aptitude for Robotics Test (ART) predicts the need for remedial work in Generic Robotic Training (GRT) and Shuttle manipulator training or whether additional psychom etric tests will sharpen performance predictions. To perform a series of experiments using the MIT Remote Manipulation System Simulator to quantify how a trainees individual spatial and manual control abilities, use of camera views and choice of hand controller reference frame impacts learning and final level of pe rformance as a primary oper ator.

Usability refers to the quality of an interfa ce or hardware. It can be re presented by five quality components: learnability, efficiency, me morability, errors, and satisfaction (Nie lsen, 2003). Learnability refers to the ease of accomplishing basic tasks when users encounter th e design for the first time. Efficiency can be defined as time needed to accomplish a task after users are already familiar with the design. Memorability can be measured by the change in performan ce following a period not using the inte rface. Errors can be counted during task execution and rated based on sever ity. User satisfaction is a metric indicating how pleasant the design is to use. Some of these can be represented by objective measur es, while others are subjectiv e. However, they provide a good picture of the overall usability of a system. Furthermore, they can provide evidence for any return on investment that may result from redesigns of a system, thus making usability and human factors quantifiable. Deliverables : Develop and propose usability metrics that can be app lied in the space science area, along with recommended usability methodologies for collecting the metrics. The fo cus will be on challenges such as error definition, acceptable error rates, and error classification and weighting. Research and develop a consistency scale that can be validated and standardized. Field test and validate usability measures, metrics, and meth odologies in one or more real life projects.

Tasks : (NSBRI - Sensorimotor Adaptation Team) Modeling and Mitigating Spatial Disorientation in Low-Gravity Environments (SM11) The goal of this industry-university research and technology development project is to extend Alion's spatial disorientation (SD) mitigation software, originally developed for aeronautical use, to NASA applications in the Shuttle, Crew Exploration Vehicle, Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) , and Mars exploration mission programs. Alion's Spatial Disorientation Analysis Tool (SDAT) is used for post-hoc analyses of aircraft trajectory data mishaps from the United States Navy, United States Air Force, and National Transportation Safety Board to determine the presence or absence of vestibular SD. The Spatial Orientation Aiding System (SOAS) is a real- time cockpit aid that has been evaluated in simulators with rated pilots. Both tools incorporate models of the vestibular system and assessor heuristics to predict the epoch and probability of an SD event such as leans, coriol is or graveyard spiral illusions, and any other disparities between actual and perceived pitch attitude (somatogravic ), roll rate or yaw/heading rate. SOAS assesses multi- sensory workload to determine the types of countermeasures to trigger and when to trigger them. SDAT also will help human factors engineers analyze past Shuttle landing incidents and will aid CEV/LSAM landing and ascent trajectory planning. It can aid LSAM cockpit displays, caution and warning system design, workload evaluation, and crew training and mission simulation. SDAT could assist flight surgeons with post-flight medical debriefings. Deliverables : Enhance the utility of SDAT/SOAS by including comprehensive mathematical models for vestibular and visual sensory cues, help translate CNS gravitoinertial force re solution into perceived tilt and translation estimates, and revalidate existing aeronautical data sets Extend the models to describe zero gravity and Shuttle/LSAM landing illusions, validating the models using Shuttle data sets and existing (e.g. ROTTR) theory Extend SDAT/SOAS to consider multiple visual frames of reference (inside and outside), panel and heads-up (HUD) orientation displays, the effects of visual atte ntion and sensory workload, and the cognitive costs of mental rotation and reorientation. The enhanced SDAT /SOAS from Aims 1-3 will be validated via flight experiments SOAS will be tailored for a lunar landing using multi-sensory workload to choose appropriate countermeasures and their timing.

Supported by LASOIS, astronauts will be capable of overcoming disorientation in lunar surface operations caused by microgravity and the altered visual environment through spatial information provided by the Earth control center and collected by a coordinated group of sensors from lunar orbit, descending path and ground. The developed spatial orientation strategy, system, and training will allow astronauts to have a systematic preparation for complex mission scenarios where spatial operations, efficient interactions and communications are required among the Earth-based control center, lander(s), lunar vehicle(s), outposts and astronauts. This capability is ex tremely important for lunar operations that will have an extensive traversing region (around 100 km). This project directly supports the key sensorimotor risk by providing the advanced LASOIS to reduce/remove the disorientation risk. Risks can be significantly reduced by improving the spatial orientation capability th rough use of the proposed LASOIS system. Deliverables : To investigate methods for removal a nd/or alleviation of astronaut disori entation in a lunar surface operations setting by using integrated information technology, and psychological and cognitive research on spatial orientation and navigation; To develop the LASOIS; and To train astronauts to enhance their spatial orientation capability in a LASOIS-supported simulated lunar environment.

Tasks : (New SHFE - Directed) Interface Design and Commonality As the development of Constellation ve hicles (Orion, Lander, surface system habitats, rovers) spans years, it is fairly certain that technologies will advance and multiple contractors will be involved in the design development and eventual construction. With the desire to use the most current hardware and soft ware system technology and materials, there is a risk that disconnects between the vehicles will occur - disconnects that have the potential to demand increased training for the cr ew, limited utility amongst and between the vehicles if replacements and spares are required, and that interface conventions may not be common. A simple hardware example is a light switch that when activated in the upwar d direction is an indicator for \"on\" in one vehicle, but when activated upward is an indicator for \"off\" in another vehicle. Th is will introduce confusion and risks for the safety of the crew, as well as their performance. What is desire d are common conventions across these interfaces no matter where they are utilized? Computer interfaces are no diffe rent in approach. Common computer interface design solutions and standards need to be developed.

The possible alterations in sensorimotor performance are of interest for Mars missions due to the prolonged microgravity exposure during transit followed by landing tasks. This risk must be better documented and NS changes must be better correlated with performance issues. Context of Risk for Exploration New evidence regarding landing performance indicates th at research into these types of issues is not a high priority for Shuttle or ISS. However, since Mars operational scenarios are still TBD, it is agreed that the ISS should be utilized to gather the data required to define the research that might be needed to enable future Mars mission operations. Therefore, this risk is considered to have a higher priority than the others within the sensorimotor discipline do. Spaceflight data should be collected (RMS, SSRMS, docking, glove box ops, Soyuz landings, etc.). In addition, performance related to neurosensory dysfunction should be used to determine the need for furt her research and countermeasure development. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence, data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to th e Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. In additio n, the NRA solicitation process was utilized to obtain proposals to determine any manual and visual control deficits. Gaps SM1: What is the relationship between the mode of in-flight exercise and post-flight sensorimotor performance? The sensorimotor team should data mi ne to determine if data exist for this gap. Task : (NxPCM - via directed study) Sensorimotor Performance Data Mining It is proposed that the type and amount of in-flight exercise performed by crewmembers may influence post-flight disturbance in balance and locomotion. Exercise lo gs for both US and Russian crewmembers will be evaluated to determine the relationship between the types of in-flight exercise performed and post-flight sensorimotor performance.

Deliverables : Data will be collected and passed to HSRF. It w ill also be used to inform Flight Medicine of any recommended recovery protocols and used to provide any updates to the sensorimotor standard. Required Delivery Milestone : There is no required delivery milestone for this task. Required Platforms : Access to Flight Medicine, JSC Biomedical Research Laboratory data, and LSDA databases is necessary for the data mining study. 201 SM4: Can previous performance data be correlated with clinical observations? Attempts should be made to obtain ISS EVA performance data from previous missions. If that is not feasible, a strategy should be developed to gather forw ard data.

No research should be undertaken until this evidence is obtained. Task : (NxPCM - via directed study) Performance Data Mining This study will compile data recorded from previous missions regarding manual control and landing. The purpose of this data-mining task is to gain additional operational data and insight regarding Shuttle landings that occurred outside the operational limits to determine the multi-factorial causes that led to the landing outcomes. Lessons learned from this analysis can be applied to the Constellation Program to ensure that the evidence for sensorimotor changes in crew performa nce as a result of space flight is thor oughly assessed. Data will also be gathered from available data from RMS operations, EV As, and Shuttle/Soyuz docking operations relevant to manual control.

HRP-47065 202 SM6: Can a seated manual/visual performance as sessment after long-dur ation spaceflight be completed? It is necessary to determine if a crewmember can land a vehicle after six months in microgravity. This gap needs to be placed in the context of the expected operating environment of future vehicles. Design of future vehicles should account for human factors in the cockpit and task design to avoid provocative movements or physically difficult tasks. Task : (NxPCM - via NRA) Manual/Visual Control Study - TBD Proposals were solicited in the 2008 NRA to answer the following questions. What is the decrement in manual/visual performance following long-duration spacefli ght? What are the mechanis ms of the decrement? What countermeasures are needed?

HRP-47065 204 HRP-47065 205 HRP-47065 206 HRP-47065 207 The Risks in this part of the Appendix are aligned with Section 2.3 - Ensure That the Crew Receives Adequate Nutrition HRP-47065 208 RISK FACTOR OF INADEQUATE NUTR ITION - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - C It is critical that crewmembers be adequately nour ished before and during missions. Critical research areas within this risk include validation of the corr ect nutritional needs; assessment of the stability of nutrients during long duration flight; correct p ackaging and preservation techniques; effects of countermeasures on nutrition; and use of nutrients as countermeasures. Context of Risk for Exploration As mission duration increases, the risk of nutrient defi ciencies becomes greater. Nutrient requirements, nutrient delivery requirements, and the need to pr eserve the nutrient content in food will increase as the frequency and duration of EVAs in crease and during the very long Mars missions. Nutritional countermeasures can influence all systems. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must be defined for this risk; hence, the Nutrition Supplemental Medical Objective (SMO) is ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. In addition, several studies are ongoing to determine the optimal dose of vitamin D. Gaps N1: Are nutrients in food are stable during space flight? This gap and all the tasks associated with it are being filled by AFT within SHFH; please refer to the Risk of Inadequate Food System, Gap AFT2 for further information. N2: What is the optimal dose of vitamin D supplementation? It is unknown if the current vitamin D dosage is optimized, further wo rk needs to be completed. Task : (NxPCM - via directed study) Vitamin D Status in an Antarctic Ground Analog of Spaceflight This task will support a vitamin D supplementation study that will evaluate efficacy in this model. Ultimately, the findings will provide long-duration spaceflight crewmembers with evidence-based vitamin D supplement recommendations for optimal vitamin D status before, during, and after flight. Deliverables : Initial product is ground-based study to determine optimal vitamin D dosing. Required Delivery Milestone : No delivery milestone is required for this task. Required Platforms : Ground-based models with limited sunlight exposure are necessary for evaluating vitamin D supplementation efficacy. One such m odel is subjects spending the winter in Antarctica, where UV-B radiation levels are zero during the winter. HRP-47065 209 Task : (NxPCM - via directed study) Vitamin D Supplementation in an Antarctic Ground Anal og of Space Flight: Study of Supplementation Protocol and Relationship to Immune System Function A supplement of 2000 IU/d raised se rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to acceptable levels, but compliance was an issue that needs to be overcome. In the study proposed here, we will investigate whether a weekly dose of 10000 IU vitamin D could be substituted for this daily 2000-IU do se, and we will investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on immune function in an environment known to suppress immune function. The proposed ground analog study will enable us to provide long duration spaceflight crewme mbers with evidence-based vitamin D supplement recommendations for optimal vitamin D status before, during, and after flight. Deliverables : Initial product is ground-based study to determine optimal vitamin D dosing. Required Delivery Milestone : No delivery milestone is required for this task. Required Platforms : Ground-based models with limited sunlight exposure are necessary for evaluating vitamin D supplementation efficacy. One such m odel is subjects spending the winter in Antarctica, where UV-B radiation levels are zero during the winter. Task : (NxPCM - via directed study) Vitamin D Supplementation: Evaluation of Dosing Regimen In this study, we will investigate whether a weekly or monthly dose of vitamin D could be substituted for a daily dose. Data from this study will help us to provide long -duration space flight crewmembers a safe, effective, and evidence-based recommendation for vitamin D supplementation to achieve and maintain optimal vitamin D status before, during, and after flight. Deliverables : Initial product is ground-based study to determine optimal vitamin D dosing. Required Delivery Milestone : No delivery milestone is required for this task. Required Platforms : Ground-based models with limited sunlight exposure are necessary for evaluating vitamin D supplementation efficacy. One such m odel is subjects spending the winter in Antarctica, where UV-B radiation levels are zero during the winter. Task : (NxPCM - via Directed Study) Nutrition Status Assessment - SMO O16E: Nutrition SMO This is a directed study that seeks to expand the Medical Requirement 016L testing in three ways: 1) include in- flight blood and urine collection, 2) expand nominal testing to include makers of normative markers of nutritional assessment, and 3) add an R+30 session to allow evaluation of post flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation. Additional markers of bone metabolism (helical peptide, OPG, RANKL, IGF-1) will be measured to better monitor bone health and countermeasure efficacy. New marker s of oxidative damage will be measured (8-iso-prostaglandin F2a, protein carbonyls, oxidized and reduced glutathione) to better assess the type of oxidative insults during space flight. The array of nutritional assessment parameters will be expanded to include serum folate, plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and homocysteine to understand better changes in folate, vitamin B6 status, and related cardiovascular risk factors during and after flight. Additionally, stress hormones and hormones that affect bone and muscle metabolism will be also measured (DHEA, DHEA-S, Cortisol, testosterone, estradiol). This additional assessment would allow for better health monitoring, and allow for more accurate recommendations to be made for crew rehabilitation. These additional parameters were added due to the recommendation of an extramural panel that met to define nutritional standards and requirements in 2005. If data indicate countermeasures are necessary for cardiovascular issues and/or bone loss, additional ground-based studies will be initiated. These countermeasures will be validated on board the ISS Deliverables : The SFHSS nutrition standard will be updated and nutritional requirements will be delivered to AFT. Updates regarding nutritional status in-flight will be delivered to the Human System Risk Forum. All deliverables are scheduled for delivery in the FY2011 timeframe. Required Delivery Milestone : ISS is required to ensure that the data represents space normal.

Task : (NxPCM - via directed study) NEEMO Rapid Operational Investigation (ROI) study: Ch aracterization of Oxidative Damage during a 12-day Saturation Dive Oxidative damage resulting from radiation and or oxygen exposure (e.g., during EV As) is a concern for space travelers. The underwater analog, NEEMO, is a valuable ground-based model for space flight in terms of oxidative damage and changes in iron metabolism. In six (6) subjects from NEEMO5, there was evidence of oxidative damage similar to what is observed during long-duration spaceflight. In this study, the main objective is to confirm and extend the physiological systems that were affected during the previous NEEMO study. Oxidative damage will be assessed before, during, and after the 12-day mission in the NEEMO habitat. As a result of this study, we will have a better understanding of the type of oxidative damage that occurs in an elevated oxygen environment, and the data can be used to better design countermeasures against this type of damage. Deliverables : Initial product is completion of NEEMO study and final report of findings. Study results will be combined fed into the solicitation for the oxidative damage study being solicited through NIH. Required Delivery Milestone : There is no required delivery milestone for this task. Required Platforms : Ground-based studies, NEEM O underwater analog facility HRP-47065 211 Task : (NxPCM - via TBD) Oxidative Damage Stud - TBD This work is to be solicited through NIH. Deliverables : TBD Required Delivery Milestone : If a countermeasure is required, it is needed as soon as possible. Required Platforms : Ground-based studies, ISS required for validation of any needed countermeasures N4: Do countermeasures impact nutrition? This gap is closed; nutritional requirements are constantly being modified and updated. HRP-47065 212 HRP-47065 213 214 HRP-47065 RISK OF INADEQUATE FOOD SYST EM - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - C If the food system does not adequately provide for fo od safety, nutrition, and acceptability, then crew health and performance and the overall mission may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if the food system uses more than its allocated mission resources, then total required mission resources may exceed capabilities, the mission deemed unfeasible, or allocati on of resources to other systems may be unduly constrained. The Advanced Food Technology (AFT) Project is responsible for optimizing methods required to preserve, package, and ship, stow and prepare the food while still preserving the nutritional value. The nutritional content of the flight food items is not curre ntly measured. However the retort, irradiation, and freeze-drying processes used to produ ce shelf stable products, reduce the nutrient content. The nutrient levels in prepared foods will be measured to ensure that they meet the requirements of nutrition. If the nutrient levels are not adequate, other preservation methods that maintain the nutrient contents of the foods will be investigated. Further, shelf lives of the current thermostabilized food products have never been determined. Food items with varied formula tions and bulk food ingredie nts have been placed in accelerated shelf life testing. The approach will provi de critical information about the quality changes of the food items and susceptibility of vitamins in the space food system to adverse environmental factors and storage encountered during space missions. Reducing the flight resources required for the food syst em is a major goal due to the significant ratios of rocket size to mass per pound of cargo delivered on an exploration mission. Methods to reduce packaging mass and volume overhead will be studied. These studies must overcome significant challenges of storing food for long periods of time (18 months for ISS to 5 years for a long duration exploration mission with pre-positioned food). Food packaging material s must be developed that minimize mass required while providing an adequate oxygen and moisture barrier to maintain the required shelf lives. Operational Relevance and Risk Context The paramount importance of the food system in a long duration manned expl oration mission cannot be underestimated. The food system provides not only the nut rients needed for the survival and health of the astronauts, but it also enhances the psychological well be ing of the crew by being a familiar element in an unfamiliar and hostile environment. Inadequacy of a food system can be influenced by four criteria: safety, nutrition, acceptability and an imbalance of vehi cle resources such as mass, volume and crew time. Since quality loss, which includes the critical com ponents of nutrition and acceptability, will occur over the shelf life of the food, additional research is needed to improve the understanding of the nutritional content of the food when consumed and how much va riety, acceptability, and ease of use is required for different duration missions. Research areas may include shelf life studies including the effects of time, temperature, and radiation; improvement in food preservation; improvement in food packaging, and evaluating the effect of the space environment and le ngth of mission on food acceptability, variety, and ease of use. Research is also required for the f ood systems necessary to support EVA and contingency suited operations. The research will consider requireme nts to comply with the mission resources such as mass, volume, power, and crew time. There is considerable overlap between the food syst em, nutrition requirements, and crew behavior and performance. The nutrition an astronaut receives is a function of both the nutritio nal content of the food and the amount of food that is actually consumed. Nutritional requirements are determined by looking at the physiological needs of the crew due to microgravity, space radiation, or stress, as examples. The food system delivers nutrition in the food. Any nutritional losses in the food due to shelf life, exposure to the outside environment, or through processing, need to be taken into account. The acceptability of the food system is closely related to crew performance si nce higher acceptability or variety of the food will HRP-47065 improve the well-being of the crewmember. Crewmembers tend to reduce food consumption when confronted with a lack of variety or unacceptable foods. Strategy for Mitigation 215 The approach the AFT Project has taken is to determin e the technology gaps for a given mission. It may be that for missions of short duration there is no need for mitigation. Another type of mitigation is one based on less available upmass and volume allowed for food. Once the risk for the specific mission has been identified, then the AFT Project determines wh ether there are commercially available technologies that can mitigate the risk. If that is the case, then the project further evaluates the technology to determine whether the technology must be modified to approve the technology for flight. If there is not a commercially available technology, then the AFT Project must develop the technology by initially determining the requirements of the new tec hnology. Once the requirements are identified, the AFT Project determines whether to develop the technology internally in the Space Food Systems Laboratory, partner with other HRP Projects, or th rough a contract with external researchers. An alternative approach, which leverages Human Rese arch Program funding by partnering with the Department of Defense Combat Feeding Director ate (DoD CFD), uses a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) between the AFT Project and DoD CFD. Gaps AFT1: How can the food system deliver the require d level of nutrition throughout the mission? The nutrition requirements, determined by the Hu man Health and Countermeasures Element, are delivered via the food system and through supplementation. There are requirements for nominal operations and contingency ope rations, as well as EVAs. Packaged foods, rehydratables, thermostabilized, and irradiated products, are process ed, which can reduce the nutritional content. In addition, extended storage of these foods and exposure to a variety of environmental conditions such as heat, oxygen, and space radiation will often affect the stability of the vitamins. Tasks : (AFT - Directed) In-Suit Food for Contingency Operations HSIR Requirement [HS11008] - The system shall provide the capability for nutrition consumption as specified in HS6062 by a crewmember in a pr essurized suit during unpressurized vehicle survival operations Deliverables : Requirements for food structure (gel, bars, thick liquid) and shelf life on suited food delivery system Nutrient-dense foods needed for food delivery system Required Delivery Milestone : Requirements for food delivery system for EVA Suit Configuration-1 needed by SRR. Foods needed for food delivery for EVA Suit Configuration-1 needed by CDR. Required Platforms : Ground HRP-47065 216 Tasks : (AFT - Directed) In-Suit Food for Lunar EVA Operations HSI Requirement [HS11007] - The system shall provide th e capability for nutrition consumption as specified in HS6062 during the EVA by a crewmember performing surface EVA operations Deliverables : Requirements for food structure (gel, bars, thick liquid) and shelf life on suited food delivery system Nutrient-dense foods needed for food delivery system Required Delivery Milestone : Requirements for food delivery system for EVA Suit Configuration-2 needed by SRR. Foods needed for food delivery for EVA Suit Configuration-2 needed by CDR. Required Platforms : Ground Tasks : (AFT - Directed) Effect of Processing on the Nutritional Content of Food The nutritional content of the flight food items is not m easured for NASA's flight fo od. The actual macronutrients and some minerals are determined chemically. However, the other nutrients such as vitamins are determined through a computer program that calculates the combined nutritional content based on the food products formulation. The computer program does not take into account the loss of nutrients during the thermostabilization process. Deliverables : Review literature to better understand th e potential effects of the retort, irra diation, and freeze drying processes Optimize time/temperature processing conditions for eac h specific thermostabilized an d freeze-dried food product that NASA produces Measure nutritional content of the finished product at time of production, 1 year and 3 years Develop improvements to the current ISS flight food using highly nutritious foods or emerging technologies such as high pressure processing and microwave sterilization if nutritional content of the foods do not meet the nutritional requirements Required Delivery Milestone : Provide nutritional content post-processing and after 1 and 3 years FY2015 - Required as a design solution to support the food system for operations on the Lunar surface. However, if information is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for the ISS. Required Platforms : Ground Tasks : (NxPCM with collaboration by AFT - Directed) Stability of Pharmacotherapeutic and Nutritional Compounds: Stability SMO (Flight) This protocol involves investigative physical/chemical analyses of both medications and food items returned from STS and ISS along with corresponding lot-matched controls stored on ground in a controlled environment. This experiment has two (2) sub-payloads attached to it. See th e Risk of Therapeutic Failure Due to Ineffectiveness of Medications for the Pharmacology sub-payload. The Nu tritional Sub-Payload will id entify vitamins and amino acids at risk for degradation in the space food supply; id entify changes in fatty acids of foods flown on ISS; and characterize degradation profiles of the unstable nutrient s. This study will provide critical information about the preservation of vitamins and nutrients in food during space flight and susceptibility of vitamins in the space food system to adverse environmental factors and storage conditions encountered during space missions. Deliverables : Analyses will determine whether low earth orbit environment (radiation) content of the food. affects the nutritional Required Delivery Milestone : The data will determine whether further ground based studies will be required to develop a design solution for Lunar mission CDR. If the re sults suggest that the loss in nutrients is not due to space radiation but instead to time or processing, the results will be fed into the DoD Collaboration task. Required Platforms : ISS required for proper radiation doses on food samples. HRP-47065 AFT2: How can the nutrition and acceptability of th e food system be maintained throughout the mission? Nutrition and acceptability are related. The literature suggests that food quality (color, texture, etc.) may provide a general indication of nutritional loss of the food. The activities in this gap are those that measure both nutrition and acceptability. If the food is not acceptable to the crew, the crew will not eat an adequate amount of the food and will be compromi sed nutritionally. Freeze-dried, thermostabilized, and irradiated foods are processed, which can redu ce the quality including acceptability and nutritional content. In addition, extended storage of these foods and exposure to a variety of environmental conditions such as heat, oxygen, and space radiation will often affect the quality of the products. Tasks: (AFT - Directed) Thermostabilized Shelf-Life Study Shelf lives of the current thermostabilized food products have never been determined. Thirteen food items with varied formulations have been placed in accelerated shelf life testing. In addition, three bulk ingredients (for preparation for a Lunar outpost mission) were placed into accelerated shelf life testing. Sensory and analytical changes are measured througho ut the three-year test. Deliverables: This task will ultimately result in a list of foods and/or preparation methods that maintain their stability to support a Lunar mission. It will also identify weaknesses of product types used in the current system allowing for enhancement of existing products or development of improved products. Information about food product weaknesses will also support the DoD Collaboration task. Required Delivery Milestone: FY2015 - Required as a design solution to support the food system for operations on the Lunar surface (Lunar Mission CDR). However, if inform ation is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for ISS. Required Platforms: Ground 217 Tasks: (AFT - Directed Study in collaboration with DoD) Department of Defense (DoD) Collaboration Although NASA's food requirements are not compatible w ith those of the commercial food industry, they are compatible with those of the Combat Feeding Program (D oD). Both NASA and DoD require long shelf life, shelf stable food items with high barrier packaging. Both also require minimal packaging. The DoD Combat Feeding Program, when conducting their research, uses collaborations of subject matter experts from industry, government, and academia experts. Currently, the DoD has an on-going packaging rese arch program as well as a program to investigate emerging preservation technologi es. These preservation technologies should result in FDA approval of high-pressure processing and microwave sterilization for shelf stable products. Both processes have a high potential for long duration Space Flight missions. Deliverables: Testing of advanced food packaging and preservation technologies for shelf stable foods Recommendations for advanced food packaging and preservation technologies for shelf stable foods Required Delivery Milestone: FY2023 (NOT E: Need date for Lunar outpost CDR is TBD) - Food system requirements definition needed for long-duration Lunar outpost and Mars Missions. However, if information is available prior to this, it could be applied to the ISS food system if it would positively impact its long-term nutrient stability or reduce food logistics. 56 HRP-47065 Required Platforms: Ground HRP-47065 218 Tasks: (Directed Study for Summary; Additional resear ch, if required, will be External Research) Effect of Space Radiation on Shelf Life Destruction of even a single vitamin in the space food system could be catast rophic to astronau ts on a 3-year mission to Mars. Although about 60 different foods have been approved for irradiation to ensure the safety of these foods from microorganisms, very little testing has been conducted on the effect of radiation on the stability of nutritional content. The Joint Expert Committee on Food Irradiation (JECFI) convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, concluded in 1980 \"the irradiation of any food commodity\" up to an overall average dose of 10 kGy \"presents no toxicological hazard\" and requires no further testing. In other words, the research has been concentrated on the toxicological effects and not nutritional stability. Preliminary results from so me NASA-funded research indicate that some functionality and quality changes occur in foods and food ingredients at lower radiation levels. If results from the ground and flight stability studies indicate nutrient loss due to radiation, further research will be required to determine quality changes at appropriate dosage levels for Mars and Lunar missions and the appropriate countermeasures. Deliverables: Summary of radiation effects on food us ing literature and NASA-funded research. If the data suggests that there is a nutritional or quality lo ss due to radiation exposure to the food, then further research will be conducted to determine the changes in quality and nutritional content of foods over time when exposed to the appropriate dose of radiation. Food system design solutions as countermeasures to the effects of radiation. 53 HRP-47065 Required Delivery Milestone: Constellation Program informed of food system requirements in as a design solution to support food system for ops on lunar surface (Lunar mission CDR). 2010. Required Required Platforms: Ground based study. Further ISS or Lunar testing collected. may be required dependin g on results from ISS Stability Study and other data AFT3: How can the acceptability of the food syst em be maintained throughout the mission? If the food is not acceptable to the crew, the crew will not eat an adequate amount of the food and will be compromised nutritionally. Anecdotal reports have su ggested that the food does not taste the same in microgravity. Other reports indicate that the crew craves different foods on-orbit as compared to on-Earth. In addition, the crew has reported that they tire of certain foods over the 6-month ISS mission.

However, if information is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for the ISS. Required Platforms: Ground Tasks : (BHP - Directed Study or External) Psychosocial Requirements of Food Operations (eating together, holiday foods, etc) Requirements and guidelines development process requir ing little if any research. The requirements development will consist of recommendations to mission ops for eating times, group meals, special foods, holiday foods, etc. Requirements will be developed in conjunction with the crew office and the AFT Project. Deliverables : Requirements of food system and mission operations Required Delivery Milestone: FY2017 (NOTE : Need date for Lunar outpost PDR is TBD) - Food system requirements definition needed for long-duration Lunar outpost and Mars Missions. However, if information is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for ISS. Required Platforms: Ground AFT4: What technologies can be developed that will efficiently balance appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, and crew time during exploration missions with the safety, nutrition, and acceptability requirements? The balancing of resources with nutrition and accepta bility is dependent on the specific mission. For example, the 2-week initial missions to the Moon will consider mission resource utilization of primary importance due to the small usable volume in the ve hicle. Since the missions are shorter, nutrition and acceptability may not be as critical. Ineffective use of vehicle resources such as mass, waste, and crew time can jeopardize mission success. Mass of the packag ed food system is based on mass of the food and the packaging surrounding the food. Food packag ing produces a significant amount of waste. A bioregenerative food system, while providing the crew with fresh foods and using less packaged food, will require more crew time, power needs and water. Trade studies will be required to determine the best use of resource utilization while balancing the other food system requirements. Current preflight procedures and existing resear ch plans incorporate good manufacturing processes (GMP) to insure food safety. However, with new processes planned Lunar and Mars missions, GMP will need to be developed to reduce the risk of food borne illness. HRP-47065 Tasks : (AFT - Directed for Packaging Workshop and Comparative Packaging Study, SBIR is funded through SBIR Program and Extern al Research Project) Advanced Packaging Material Development Currently the packaging used for freeze-dried foods and natural fo rm foods does not have adequate oxygen and moisture barrier properties to allow for an 18-month shelf life for ISS. Therefore, those foods are over wrapped with a second foil-containing package that has higher barrier properties. The packaging material used for the thermostabilized, irradiated, and beverage items contain a foil layer to maintain product quality over at least the required 18-month shelf life. Althoug h foil in the packaging material provides excellent oxygen and moisture barrier properties, it is not compatible with microwave sterilization and high pressure processing. These emerging preservation technologies have the potential of providing NASA with a higher quality food system. The foil layer within the food package may also provide complications if the decision is made to incinerate the trash on the Lunar or Martia n surface. Therefore, research to develop a packaging material that has the barrier properties of foil without the pr esence of foil is necessary. Comparative Packaging Study - determ ine whether any current flight pack aging can be used as the primary package for freeze-dried and natural form foods. Small Business Innovative Research (S BIR) Program - evaluate SBIR deliv erables and integrate if acceptable with current food system External Research Project - development of new high barrier, foil-free packaging material Deliverables : Food packaging technologies that reduce the overall mass and volume required for the food system Required Delivery Milestone: FY2015 - Required as a design solution to support the food system for operations on the Lunar surface (Lunar Mission CDR). However, if info rmation is available prior to this, it could be used to influence the food system for ISS. Required Platforms: Ground 220 Tasks : (AFT - Directed) Packaged food mass reduction trade study In order to provide a lower mass and volume food system for the Constellation Program, changes in product formulation may be necessary. Changes under consideration include removing some water from the total food system, increasing fat content, or increasing nutrient density of the food items. Deliverables : Trade study to consider options to reduce mass of food. Determine best-case scenario for further development. Determine commercial availability of foods with prefe rred scenario. Develop technologies for food product development if not commercially available. Required Delivery Milestone: Food system requirements for first Orion mission (2015) Required Platforms: Ground HRP-47065 221 Tasks : (AFT - Directed) Total System Approach to P ackaging Material Selection There is a need for a total systems approach when th e goal is maximizing shelf life and minimizing packaging mass. The packaging material is only one portion of the system, and must not be consid ered the main focus of the packaging system.

Deliverables : Define existing packaging system - temperature, heat seal width, times, vacuum, materials, septums, gases, packaging design Literature review - available materials, pinholes/defects, modified atmosphere or gas flushing, shelf life Document possible improvements to existing system Recommendations for future work Required Delivery Milestone: Packaging options to reduce mass and improve food quality by Lunar mission PDR Required Platforms: Ground Tasks : (AFT - Directed) Bulk Overwrap Packaging Alternative Using a bulk overwrap system instead of individual package overwrap will save on mass and volume for longer duration missions. The overwrap can also be used as a flexible container to save on mass and volume in the shorter duration Orion missions. Deliverables : Select materials to test Develop efficient method for packaging - vacuum packaging, gas flushi Evaluate scavenger systems Evaluate the possibility of creating innovatively shaped packages Compare mass of bulk overwrap system vs. individual overwrap Compare mass of bulk overwrap system vs. current ISS rigid container ng, heat sealing system Required Delivery Milestone: Required as a design solution to support food system Orion missions as \"food container\" for Orion CDR Food system requirements for Lunar SRR and Mars missions Required Platforms: Ground HRP-47065 222 Tasks : (AFT - Directed or External) Partial Pressure Effects on Food Processing and Preparation Heat and mass transfer are affected by reduced atmos pheric pressure. When preparing raw foods into edible ingredients, it is necessary to reach a certain temperature/time combination to ensure safety and functionality. It is being proposed that the Lunar habitat will maintain an 8-psi atmospheric pressure. At that pressure, the boiling temperature for water is 181oF. If incomplete heating does occur, research will be required to determine countermeasures. Deliverables : Determine whether there is incomplete cooking. If there is incomplete cooking, what is the mitigation strategy? Used as an input to the trade study (see next task). Ultimately results in requirements on the Lunar Outp ost Food System processing equipment. regarding food preparation and/or Required Delivery Milestone: Lunar Outpost SRR is scheduled for early FY2012. At that time, the trade study for which this task is to feed into would require completion by end of FY 2011. This task and the upcoming trade study are not scheduled in time to provide input by Lunar Outpost SRR. Required Platforms: Ground with validation on ISS or Lunar surface Tasks : (AFT - Directed) Food Processing vs. Packaged F ood System Trade Study (TBR-9) Preliminary studies suggest total mass of the food system can be reduced if the food system moves towards a bioregenerative food system. In a bioregenerative food system, vegetables, and fruit would be grown on the Lunar or Mars surface and baseline crops such as soybeans, wheat, rice, peanuts, and dried beans would be grown or launched in bulk from Earth. The baseline crops would be processed into edible ingredients. The edible ingredients and freshly grown fruits and vegetables would be used in preparing meals in the galley. Some packaged food would likely be required. Further studies are required to determine the magnitude of mass savings and the effect on other mission resources such as power, crew time, and recycling of water used for food processing. These studies will also identify the equipment that would be required to be built for the Lunar surface test. A trade study that considers efficien cies and adequacies of the two food systems with a recommendation to the Program is required. Deliverables : Requirements on vegetable, fruit and baseline crops growth - could range from hobby to full bioregenerative food system Requirements for the Lunar Outpost Food System regarding food preparation and/or processing equipment Mass and volume requirements for various levels of food processing and food preparation Recommendation to Constellation Program on whether to develop food preparation and food processing technologies for the Lunar Outpost Required Delivery Milestone: Lunar Outpost SRR is scheduled for early FY2012. This trade study supports the decision process on whether to develop food preparation and food processing technologies and if so, to what extent. This trade study is not scheduled in time to provide input by Lunar Outpost SRR. Required Platforms: Ground HRP-47065 223 Tasks : (AFT - Directed or External) Develop Processing and Prepara tion Equipment and Procedures If a bioregenerative food system is used, then miniaturized processing equipment will need to be built. It is unlikely that there will be commercial equipment appr opriately sized for a Lunar or Mars mission. The preparation equipment for the galley will likely be commer cially available gourmet kitchen appliances that will need to be modified for the Lunar missions. Deliverables : Food system processing and packaging technologies for a Lunar outpost or Mars mission.

Significant research has been conducted to determine growth conditions and plant se nsitivities to environmental changes. However, further research is required to finalize the environmental conditions for plant growth. Since the fruits and vegetables may be consumed uncooked, research is required to determin e the handling procedures pre- and post-harvest to ensure safety. Deliverables: Growth procedures for fresh vegetables and fruits Handling procedures to ensure safe, uncooked foods Required Delivery Milestone: FY2019 (NOTE : Need date for Lunar outpost SRR is TBD) to provide design solution for the food system for long-duration Lunar outpost and Mars Missions. Required Platforms: Ground with validation on Lunar surface HRP-47065 224 HRP-47065 HRP-47065 227 HRP-47065 228 HRP-47065 229 HRP-47065 230 HRP-47065 231 The Risks in this part of the Appendix are aligned with Section 2.4 - Protect the Crew from Environmental Hazards HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 232 RISK OF RADIATION CARCINOGENESIS FROM SPACE RADIATION - C X C Near-term goals for cancer research focus on reducing the uncertainties in risk projections through the development of tissue specific models of cancer ri sks, understanding the underlying mechanisms of these models, and appropriate data collection at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). In the long- term, extensive validation of these models with mi xed radiation fields is envisioned and research on biological countermeasures and biomarkers will be pursued if needed. Research on improving cancer projections has two major emphases: 1) validating the application of the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) model and 2) reducing the uncertainti es in the coefficients th at enter into the cancer projection model. Validation of the NCRP model relies on studies at the NSRL observing qualitative differences in biological damage between HZE nuclei and gamma rays and the establishment of how these differences relate to cancer risk. There are distinct mechanisms of cancer induction across and within major tissue sites, and uncertainty reduction requires tissue specific risk estimates. NRA and NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) selec tions focus on these major sites: lung, breast, colon, stomach, esophagus, the blood system (leukemias), liver, bladder, skin, and brain. There are differences in radiation sensitivity b ased on genetic and epigenetic factor s and research in these areas aids the development of tissue specific cancer models. The approach to uncertainty reduction is based on eval uations of the assumptions in the current model for projecting cancer incidence and mortality risks for space missions. The cancer rate is the key assumption in the evaluation; representing the probability at a given age and years since exposure of observing a cancer. The life-span study of the atomic-bomb surv ivors is the primary source for gamma-ray data, however more recently meta-analysis of patients exposed to radiation or reactor workers for several tissues has become available and is used to check or replace the Japanese data. Other assumptions in the model are made with regard to the transfer of risk across populations, the use of average rates for the US population, the age, and age-after exposure dependence of risk on radiation quality and dose-rate, etc. Collaborative research with the Department of Energy (DoE) Low Dose Research Program is a key component of the strategy. The DoE program focus is on low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) irradiation; however, collaborative grants are selected from proposals that contain one or more Specific Aims addressing NASA interests using the NSRL. This research augments SR research with a number of grants using state-of-the art approaches including ge netics, proteomics, and transgenic animal models. The DoE research is an important component in reachi ng the goal to identify biomarkers of cancer risk. Determining the shape of the dose-response model fo r cancer induction is a near-term focus that is enumerated in biological terms through various cancer Gaps. In the NCRP model, the dose-response is linear and the slope coefficient is modulated by radiation shielding. Non-targeted models of cancer risk describe processes where cells traversed by HZE nucle i or protons produce cancer phenotypes in regions of tissues not limited to the traversed cells. Non-targeted effects are the major mechanism that has been identified that is in disagreement with the NCRP m odel, and leads to a sub-linear dose response. The implications of a sub-linear dose response for cancer ri sk are large since such a model predicts a reduced effectiveness for radiation shielding, and on the importa nce of mission length. Research in this area is a major focus of studies at NSRL. For some cancer sites and exposure conditions , e.g., proton exposures, the NCRP model may be adequate, and research here is focused on reducing the uncertainties in the model through the establishment of tissue specific mode ls of human cancers, and collection of data at NSRL for a variety of ground-based analogs for Sola r Particle Event (SPE) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). Systems biology models provide a framework to in tegrate mechanistic studies of cancer risk across multiple levels of understa nding (molecular, cellular, and tissues), and are the most likely approach to replace the NCRP model. Systems biology models are being developed by the Risk Assessment Project and several NSCOR's, and in conjunction with data collection will improve the descriptions of cancer HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 233 risks and to lay a framework for future biological countermeasure evaluations and biomarker identification. Operational Relevance and Contex t of Risks for Exploration Permissible exposure limits (PEL) for Space Radiation limit the allowable mission and career exposure to the space radiation environment based on the projected risk of developing cancer. The PEL's protect against the upper 95% percent confidence level in th e career radiation limits because the uncertainties in risk projection models are significant (>4-fold) such th at the use of a median risk estimate could greatly over-estimate or under-estimate the actual risk to crews. Mission, vehicle, and crew selection requirements are outcomes of the Space Radiation PELs, including requirements on vehicle design, mission duration, and age, gender, or past mission history for crew selection. Current estimates of mission duration limits that result from cancer fatality risks alone are shown in Table 1, comparing estimates made in 2001 without the benefit of the most recent research knowledge, to current estimates.

INCREASING SAFE DAYS IN SPACE WITH REDUCTION IN UNCERTAINTIES Research to reduce uncertainties in risk projection models are expe cted to increase NASA's ability to select crew, extend mission duration, and reduce cost through possible reductions in shielding requirements. Improved knowledge of dose-rate and radiation effects will allow for EVA time lines to be extended in deep space and on the l unar or Mars surface. Furthermore, research approaches that narrow uncertainties in risk models will no-doubt evolve into countermeasure di scovery and validation approaches that have large benefits on crewmembers. The NASA PEL's for fatal cancer risk may be exceeded for several lunar scenarios including a large SPE, cumulative career exposure, and mission length depe ndent on crew age and gender. The Operational relevance of these conditions is obviously critical and could delay, reduce the length of missions, or make the costs to prevent PEL violation far too excessive. Reducing the uncertainties in risk projections through NSRL research, which are part of the ra diation PELs, could possibly alleviate cancer risk projections below PELs. Possible mitigation approach es such as parasitic radiation shielding are very costly for SPE's and may prove prohibitive for GCR. The final solution may be a combination of uncertainty reduction, shielding, mission length, and crew selection with effective biological countermeasures. Biological countermeasures to mitigate the risk or improve treatment are in early stages HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 234 of development and proj ections of their effectiveness highly uncertain. The NASA PELs for fatal cancer risk are projected to be violated under all possible Mars scenarios at this time making the radiation cancer risk critical as the mission cannot be undertaken without further breakthrough leading to uncertainty reduction in risk projection models or to the development of biological countermeasures. Dependent on new research results, the cumulative ri sk from CNS and Degenerative when combined with Cancer risks will likely have ma jor negative impacts on mission design, costs, schedule, and crew selection. Thus risk projection model development and PELs will begin with Cancer Risks, but eventually incorporate projection capabilities for Acute, CNS, and Degenerative Tissue Risks. Strategy for Mitigation SRPE plans to conduct a phased implementation approach to reduce the uncertainty associated with space radiation effects and develop counte rmeasure recommendations in suppor t of Lunar and Mars vehicle and mission planning. A breakthrough research strategy is utilized because of the la rge scientific challenges needed to understand and mitigate human risks to space radiation. Examples of breakthroughs that have occurred in recent years are the hallmark molecular ch anges in cancer stem cells in cancer research. Breakthroughs create large perturbations in research plans and schedules, and have large benefits to achieving SPRE goals. Future breakthroughs are expected, albeit not possible to predict. Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near-term, however will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are established and uncertainties are significantly reduced. This is due to a need to un derstand the biological targets for countermeasures and to ensure the ability to assess properly their potential effectiveness. Similar phased approaches are followed for biomarker research. The SRPE established a scientific approach that follows a progression of activities designed to feed the development of an integrated risk model with acceptable uncertainty for exploration missions, followed by activities targeting risk mitigation and monitoring. These activities are not necessarily implemented in serial, but emphasis is placed on 1 to 3, the su ccessful completion of which should facilitate model development to enable mission durations require d for currently planned lunar missions. Successful completions of 4 to 7 are needed to enhance model development to enable Mars missions. Items 4 to 7 are being pursued at a minimal level in the current program. As activities essential for lunar missions are completed, greater effort will be spent in activities essential for Mars missions. The activities required to develop the cancer risk projection model are as follows: 1) Establish Mechanisms of Cancer and CM Action 2) Develop Tissue and Risk Specific Experimental Models 3) Understand radiation quality effects on biological damage to quantify risk 4) Understand the dependence of risk on dose-rates in space 5) Extrapolation from experimental data to humans to quantify risk 6) Understand individual radiation-sensitivity to quantify risk 7) Develop countermeasures, technologies, and models for Ri sk Mitigation and Monitoring HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 235 Figure 1 graphically illustrates components of the research approach.

Flow Chart of Components in the SRPE Research Approach Overview of Research Approach The level of tolerance in projection model uncertain ties depends on the acceptable level of mortality risk (3%) and the projection of risk for each class of mi ssion. Cancer projections for 40-yr females on STS, ISS, and 180-day lunar, and Mars missions are curre ntly estimated at about 0.01, 0.35, 0.7, and 5%, respectively. Therefore, a much lower tolerance can be accepted for lunar or Mars mission than mission in LEO to assure risk acceptance levels are not exceed ed, and more accurate and mechanistic models of risk must be developed for these missions. This constraint leads to a major goal for research approaches followed by SRPE with uncertainties le ss than 2-fold needed for long-te rm lunar stays, and less than +50% for a Mars mission. See Figure 2 for the timeline for reducing uncertainties. In order to understand whether research has achieved the level of tolerance in cancer risk projections required; interactions are needed between risk assessment research and biological mechanisms and data research. The first Gantt chart in Appendix D shows a major decision point in the research plan related to assessment of uncertainty reduction. If sufficient un certainty reduction is achieved in the near-term, research on biological countermeasures and minor tissue sites is envisioned to occur in 2014 and out. Biological Risk Research The large number of GCR nuclei type, energies, SPE doses, and dose-rates, in combination with the multiple tissue and cancer types makes the performance of large-scale animal or 3D human cell culture studies of cancer risk at NSRL prohibitive. Therefor e, a mechanistic approach is needed and has been segmented into major mechanistic research areas (Gaps Cancer 1, 2, and 7-9). These areas may find synergy in the types and range of biological mode ls employed however will differ in the complicated hypothesis questions being addressed. Ultimately, mechanistic studies must progress to determine quantitative data sets for estimating probabilities for in crease risk of carcinogenesis that in conjunction with research on Risk Assessment models will be used to extrapolate risks from experimental model to risks in astronauts on specific exploration missions. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 236 There are distinct mechanisms of cancer induction across and within major tissue sites; thus uncertainty reduction requires tissue specific risk estimates (Gap Cancer 3-5). NRA and NSCOR selections focus on current estimates of major sites for cancer risks, which include lung, breast, colon, stomach, esophagus, the blood system (leukemias), liver, bladder, skin, an d brain. There are differences in radiation sensitivity based on genetic and epigenetic factors (Gaps Cancer 5) and research in these areas aids the development of tissue specific cancer models. Hypothesis direct ed studies to establish the underlying mechanisms for the risks, and the possibility of synergistic effects with SPE's or other flight factors may also be considered. NRA, NSCOR, or joint DoE-NASA studi es in this area will use state-of-the art animal models (including transgenic mice) and genetically engineered human cell culture models to answer a variety of questions related to the Gaps in bi ological mechanisms. These studies are critical in establishing the level of proof that underlies NASA ri sk projection models. As research understanding is improved, extended duration validation studies with a fi nite number of animal or 3D human cell culture models using mixed fields representing GCR and SPE will be performed at NSRL using the existing exposure cave or potentially a new cave with improved capability for extended duration GCR simulations. The cancer risk related NSCOR studi es are 5-year studies and allow for long-term animal or sequential mechanistic studies with multiple components. Risk Assessment The SRPE approach to uncertainty reduction is b ased on studying the current model NASA uses as model recommended by the NCRP for projecting cancer incidence and mortality risks for space missions. This model employs the double-detriment life table for calcu lating the risk of radiation induced cancers against the background of cancers in the general population and competing mortality risks. The cancer rate (Hazard function) is the key quantity in the evalua tion; representing the probability at a given age and years since exposure of observing a cancer. The NCRP model assumes the cancer incidence or mortality rate is scalable to human epidemiology data for gamma rays using a linear-energy transfer dependent radiation quality factor, Q(LET), and a dose and dose-rate reduction factor (DDREF). Other assumptions in the model are made with regard to the transfer of risk across populations, the use of average rates for the US population, the age, and age-after exposure dependence of risk on radiation quality and dose-rate, etc. These models will be updated as new data fro m biological mechanism and data are obtained as described by Gaps- Cancer 3-7. Systems biology models provide a framework to in tegrate mechanistic studies of cancer risk across multiple levels of understa nding (molecular, cellular, and tissues), and are the most likely approach to replace the NCRP model. Systems biology models are being developed by the Risk Assessment Project and several NSCOR's, and in conjunction with data collection will improve the descriptions of cancer risk and to lay a framework for future biological count er-measure evaluations and biomarker identification (Gap Cancer 14). Shielding Physics & Dosimetry The evaluation of radiation shielding effectiveness fo r GCR is currently hindered by data on radiation quality effects and the shape of the dose-response curve for cancer induction. However, controlling secondary neutron components through material selections and developing computer tools for shielding evaluations is a near-term focus for spacecraft design applications as carried out by the Design Tools project under Gap Cancer 13. A goal of the Design Tools project is to provide fast and reliable tools for optimization in support of engineering shielding d esigns. Radiation physics improvements will be developed in support of these analysis efforts (G ap Cancer 11). SRPE will also support tasks that integrate data from lunar or Martian robotic probes to improve analysis capabilities (Gap Cancer 12) HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 237 Biological Countermeasures The long-term phase of research will likely invo lve research on biological countermeasure (BCM) evaluation. BCM is a lower criticality in the current phase of the program for three reasons: 1) the uncertainties in cancer projections prevent the ev aluation of the need for BCM. 2) An improved understanding of the mechanisms of cancer risk is needed to be able to extrapolate results from BCM studies in experimental models to astronauts on explor ation missions, and 3) identify effective surrogate markers to perform testing of potential BCMs. Resear ch related to Gap Cancer 8 will evolve from new knowledge gained from biological mechanisms and risk assessment research. Current NRA studies with anti-oxidants and related agents ma y be expanded to target specific molecular pathways and tissues, which make the largest contribution to cancer risks. Cell and animal models and appropriate endpoints will be identified and combined with new systems biology tools to obtain quantitative projections of BCM effectiveness for astronauts in specific exploration missions. Gaps The following gaps are a culmination of research questions identified through the Bioastronautics Roadmap Development, National Academy of Science - Institute of Medicine Review, National Council for Radiation Protection Reviews, Recommendations and Reports, Radiation Discipline Working Group advisory panel recommendations, annual Radiation PI workshops, and the Sept '06 Discipline Review. More recently the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute Of Engineering has reported on approaches to Manage Lunar radiation risks (NAS, 2008), and the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reviewed the Evidence based review of the four major risks and associated Gaps. Based on the above recommendations, a total of 14 Ga ps have been re-formulated for the Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis from Space Radiation. Due to the reliance on NRA and NSCOR research, many tasks address several Gaps, making it difficult to list each task under each gap. The SPRE has chosen to provide a table of Gaps followed by a table of current tasks identifying whether it is solicited, directed, or NSCOR (which are all solicited) and the gaps addressed by that research.

Through careful evaluation of SPE frequency and size probabilities, dose-rates, likely shielding conditions, and dose distribution at specific organs, the SRPE Risk A ssessment Project has determined that the likelihood of acute risks IVA is extremely small. There are sc enarios, however, during lunar, trans-lunar, or Mars EVAs where acute radiation sickness may occur. Radi ation sicknesses, i.e., the prodromal risks, include the risks of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. These effects are manifested at about 4 to 24 hours post-exposure for exposures at sub-lethal doses with a latency time inversely correlated with dose. Furthermore, albeit the possibility of acute death through the collapse of the blood forming organs (BFO) is negligible, there is a reasonable concern of a co mpromised immune system due to high skin doses from a SPE leading to burns, which could increase the risk to the BFO. Because the m echanisms of acute risks from SPE's will not differ substantially from X-rays and gamma-rays where experimental models have already been developed, research on acute risks is largely a data collection activity with appropriate proton energies, doses, and dose-rates to represent major SPEs. In the long-term, the SRPE will consider research on fertility, sterility, and hereditary risks from space radiation, and may request the NSBRI support these ar eas because of their unique nature compared to other risk areas (Acute Gap 4). Operational Relevance and Contex t of Risks for Exploration Acute radiation risks are averted through radiation sh ielding inside most shielding habitats or lunar transfer vehicles; however , radiation exposure limits could be exceeded during deep space transit, including Venus swing-by (<0.5 AU) or extensive lunar surface EVAs, making this risk important for NASA's goals. Disruptions include reducing EVA times by several hours or requiring excessive radiation shielding. EVA programs will have to be significantly reduced if risk assessment not improved and countermeasures developed. Strategy for Mitigation As discussed in the Risk of Radiation Carcinogen esis from Space Radiation, SRPE plans to conduct a phased implementation approach to address the acute radiation risk. Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near-term, however will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are validated. The SRPE approach that follows a progression of activities designed to feed th e development of an integrated risk model with acceptable uncertainty for exploration missions, fo llowed by activities targeting risk mitigation and monitoring is used for the acute ri sk. These activities are not necessarily implemented in serial, but since the knowledge associated with acute risk is much further along than other risks, emphasis is placed on 1 to 6, the successful completion of which should fac ilitate model validation to enable mission durations required for currently planned lunar and Mars miss ions. The activities required to validate the Acute Radiation Syndromes risk projection model are as follows: 1) Establish Mechanisms of radiation-indu ced acute radiation syndrome and CM Action 2) Understand radiation quality effects on biological damage to quantify risk 3) Understand the dependence of risk on dose-rates in space 4) Extrapolation from experimental data to humans to quantify risk HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 250 5) Understand individual radiation-sensitivity to quantify risk 6) Develop countermeasures, technologies, and models for Ri sk Mitigation and Monitoring Figure 1 graphically illustrates components of the research approach.

Flow Chart of Com ponents in the SRPE Research Approach Biological Risk Research Research on acute risks related to EVA conditions must factor in the role of dose-rate over an EVA time course, the additional exposure IVA for a terminated EVA, and other spaceflight factors that could modify expected dose response models for acute risks. Animal and cell culture models appropriate for these acute risks will be used in th e research to study protons effects at various doses, dose-rates, and proton energies including simulation of solar particle event spectra (Gap Acute 1). A research emphasis on the role of the immune system and possible synerg istic effects on acute risks are needed (Gap Acute 3). This area is under review by the NCRP. Because acute risks are manifested soon after exposure and there is an existing data based on gamma-ray induced risk s, the research is expected to be completed in about a 5-year period by the NSBRI team. Risk Assessment The Risk Assessment Project has developed acute radi ation risk models using a logistic scoring approach and is modifying these models to account for prot on and secondary radiation biological effectiveness data. These models will be updated with results from th e proposed NSBRI research team when available. A graphical user interface (GUI) of the resulting m odel will be developed and tested for use in an operational setting (Gap Acute 2). Probabilistic m odels of SPE are being developed by the Risk Assessment project and in coordination w ith new results from SMD (Gap Acute 5). Shielding Physics & Dosimetry Optimization of radiation shielding (Gap Acute 6), dosimetry, and alert approaches (Gap Acute 5) is supported with operational research in these areas by both SRPE (Design Tools and Risk Assessment Projects) and the NSBRI and in collaboration with Sp ace Mission Directorate (SMD) Living with the Star HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 251 Program (Gap Acute 5). The Design Tools project will develop tools to minimize shielding mass during vehicle design, and the Risk Assessment project will develop probabilistic models appropriate for acute risk protection for mission planning purposes. The de velopment of reliable, lightweight EVA dosimetry is a goal of the research. Biological Countermeasures The important distinctions in the types of biolog ical models, possible BCMs, and exposure conditions between acute, and the risks of cancer, CNS, and degenerative risks suggests a unique approach. Therefore, the SRPE has requested the NSBRI form a focus team in this area (Gap Acute 7). This team will pursue research on the mechanisms of acute radia tion risks and possible BCM development. Studies from radiation oncology of anti-na usea drugs will be considered as well as existing drugs used in spaceflight. The role of synergisms of radiation and other space related insults will be an important thrust of this research. Gaps The following gaps are a culmination of research questions identified through the Bioastronautics Roadmap Development, National Academy of Science - Institute of Medicine Review, National Council for Radiation Protection Reviews, Recommendations and Reports, Radiation Discipline Working Group advisory panel recommendations, annual Radiation PI workshops, and the Sept '06 Discipline Review. More recently the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute Of Engineering has reported on approaches to Manage Lunar radiation risks (NAS, 2008), and the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM) has reviewed the Evidence based review of the four major risks and associated Gaps. Based on the above recommendations, a total of 8 Gaps have been formulated for the Risk Acute Radiation Syndromes Due to Solar Particle Events. As with other, the SPRE relies heavily on NRA and NSCOR research, making it difficult to list each task under each gap. The SPRE has chosen to provide a table of Gaps followed by a table of current tasks identifying whether it is solicited, directed, or NSCOR (solicited) and the gaps addressed by that resear ch.

Central Nervous System (CNS) risks from GCR are a concern due to the possibilit y of single HZE nuclei traversals causing tissue damage, as evidenced by the light-flash phenomenon first observed during the Apollo missions. As survival prognosis for patients irradiated for brai n tumor treatment has impr oved, patients have shown persistent CNS changes at long times after treatment with gamma rays suggesting a possible CNS risk for a large SPE. Furthermore, animal studies of behavior and performance with HZE radiation suggest detrimental changes may occur during long-term GCR exposures. Currently, there is no projection model for CNS risks of concern to NASA. Research at NSRL is using a variety of animal and cellular models to study the dose and radiation quality dependence of CNS risks. The extrapolation of model data to astronauts will be the major focus of CNS research in the immediate future. The values of possible thresholds for CNS risks and knowledge on how to extrapolate possible thresholds to individual astronauts is a key milestone in the long-term research plan to allow development of a CNS-specific risk projection model. Operational Relevance And Contex t Of Risks For Exploration The NASA PELs for CNS risk was developed based on existing animal data from heavy ion exposures. Although animal data and brain cancer irradiati on evidence suggests CNS structural and functional impacts from radiation exposure, additional research is required to fully understand and quantify this risk. This risk has considerable uncerta inty associated with it and no accept able model for projecting CNS risk is currently available. The PEL could be violated under possible scenarios, including following a large SPE or long-term GCR exposure, however, without a clear understanding of the CNS risk, it has been rated Important for both the lunar and Mars missi ons. Ongoing research in this area is intended to quantify this risk to determine criticality for both extended duration missions. New research results could lead to cumulative risk from CNS and Degenerative tissue Disease which when combined with Cancer risks have major negative impacts on mission design, costs, schedule, and crew selection. Strategy For Mitigation As discussed in the Risk of Radiation Carcinogen esis from Space Radiation, SRPE plans to conduct a phased implementation approach to address the CNS risk. The same breakthrough research strategy is utilized due to the large scientific challenges needed to understand and mitigate CNS risks from space radiation. An example of a breakthrough that has occurred in recent years with regard to CNS is the discovery of neurogenesis in CNS research. Breakthroughs create large perturbations in research plans and schedules, and have large benefits to achieving SPRE goals. Future breakthroughs are expected, albeit not possible to predict. Biological countermeasure research will be conducted at a low level in the near-term, however will be increased after experimental (biological) models of human risks are established and uncertainties are significantly reduced. The SRPE approach that follows a progression of activities designed to feed the development of an integrated risk model with acceptable uncertainty for exploration missions, followed by activities targeting risk mitigation and monitoring is also used for the CN S risk. These activities are not necessarily implemented in serial, but emphasis is placed on 1 to 3, the successful completion of which should facilitate model development to enable mission durations required for currently planned lunar missions. Successful completions of 4 to 7 ar e needed to enhance model development to enable Mars missions. Items 4 to 7 are being pursued at a minimal level in the current program. As activities essential for Lunar missions are completed, greater ef fort will be spent in activities essential for Mars missions.

Flow chart of components in the SRPE research approach. Biological Risk Research A critical question for the current phase of research is to establish possible threshold doses for specific CNS risks. It is likely that although acute CNS risks occur only above a dose threshold (Gap CNS-1) and that the lifetime risks for CNS diseas es, such as Alzheimer's, will have distinct dose dependence with the additional questions related to latency to disease of pr imary interest (Gap CNS-2). The values of possible thresholds for CNS risks and knowledge on how to extrapolate possible thresholds to individual astronauts will be a key milestone in the long-term research plan. An important component of this research is to factor in the variation of CNS risk with genotype or other CNS injury (Gap CNS-3). A variety of mechanisms must be understood includin g the roles of neurodegeneration, inflammation, microvasculature damage, and changes to specific ne uron-chemical pathways. These research areas will have overlaps in usage of NSRL, and potential anim al or cellular models employed, however individual NRA or NSCOR projects will pursue distinct hypothesi s driven research questions leading to distinct HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 260 endpoints and biological assays. Hypothesis directed studies to establish the underlying mechanisms for the risks (Gap CNS 1-3, 5, 6), and the possibility of synergistic effects with SPE's or other flight factors will also be considered (Gap CNS-8). The CNS risk related NSCOR study is a 5-year st udy allowing for long-term animal or sequential mechanistic studies with multiple components. Risk Assessment Research approaches are establishing the biochemistry of CNS impacts by HZE nuclei. Since projection based on scaling to human data as done for cancer risk is not possible, a systems biology approach for individual CNS risks may be needed to form a basis for animal to human extrapolation, and will rely on understanding of biochemical changes in the CNS cau sed by space radiation (Gaps CNS 5, 6). Because of the large number of GCR nuclei types and ener gies, comprehensive studies under mixed-field SPE or GCR simulation conditions for extended time periods ( hours to a few weeks) may be needed at NSRL. Extended duration studies will be useful in addressi ng SRPE gaps in synergistic risks from other spaceflight factors and radiation damage to the CNS. Biological Countermeasures Biological countermeasure and biomarker research for CNS risks is a lower priority in the near-term research strategy until the nature and magnitude of the CNS risk is more firmly established. Several studies on oxidative damage and anti-oxidants are suppor ted; however, this is not a significant emphasis of SRPE's approach. The future need for BCM research will be driven by the levels of risk determined by current research and may transition to become a major long-term focus. It is expected that the mechanistic understanding acquired from near-ter m research will set the course for effective countermeasures approaches in the future as needed (Gap CNS-4). Shielding Physics The development of new biological understanding of CNS risks will dete rmine if shielding protection for CNS is distinct from other shielding approaches to ot her radiation risks. Preliminary assessments suggest HZE nuclei with Z>10 or slow neutrons may be a hi gher relative concern for CNS than other risks, and may place more emphasis on shielding these components (Gap CNS-7).

More recently, however, several epidemiological studies, including results from the atomic-bomb survi vors and nuclear reactor workers, have identified a significant risk of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) for low LET radiation at doses comparable to those of an extended lunar mission or a Mars mission, or a short-duration lunar mission with a large SPE. An increased risk of cataracts associated with low dose space radiation from past NASA Missions has been reported and is being followed up with a clinical study of cataract progression rates in current or retired astronauts. Several NSRL studies of catarac t risks are supported to improve the understanding of how proton and HZE nuclei induce cataracts, and to identify possible countermeasure approaches. Since the risk of heart disease is a recent finding, pre liminary studies in these areas are seeking to establish possible distinctions in mechanisms for this risk between protons and HZE nuclei and gamma rays. Furthermore, the SRPE will take advantage of studi es supported by the European Union in this area, which is supporting large-scale mouse studies of CHD. These studies should present new insights into the nature of the low LET (gamma-ray) risk at lo w dose-rates is comparable to space conditions, and identify appropriate mouse strains to be used in future SR studies. Operational Relevance And Contex t Of Risks For Exploration The NASA PELs for cataract and heart risks are based on existing human epidemiology data. Although animal and clinical astronaut data show a signi ficant increase in cataracts following exposure and a reassessment of atomic bomb data suggests an in crease in CHD from radiation exposure, additional research is required to fully understa nd and quantify this risk. This risk has considerable uncertainty associated with it and no acceptable model for projecting degenerative tissue risk is currently available. The PEL could be violated under possible scenarios, including following a large SPE or long-term GCR exposure, however, without a clear understanding of the risk, it has been rated Important for both the lunar and Mars missions. Ongoing research in this area is intended to quantify this risk to determine criticality for both extended duration missions.

Flow Chart of Components in the SRPE Research Approach. Biological Risk Research Preliminary assignments of PEL's for Degenerative risks have been assigned based on human epidemiology data for gamma ray or x-ray irradiation. Cell or animal models of degenerative risks will be developed and applied to de termine the mechanisms for degenerative risks and to determine appropriate risk assessment data for models including relative biological effectiveness and dose-rate dependencies for different space radiation ions at NSRL (Gaps Degen 1-4). In the near-term, NRA research will support a small number of studies on heart a nd lens risks. A long term-focus will be to support an NSCOR in this area in 2014 and beyond. As mission duration increases, there could be degenerative risks to other tissues related to dig estive diseases and pulmonary changes that become a concern. A long-term goal will be to consider such possible changes in animal validation studies made at a possible extended duration GCR facility develope d at NSRL in the future. The NASA Study of Cataracts in Astronauts (NASCA) is collecting data on the incidence and progression rates of cataracts in over 230 current or retired astronauts. The possibility of synergistic risks with other flight factors must also be considered (Gap Degen -7) HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 268 Risk Assessment An increased risk of cataracts associated with low dose space radiation from past NASA Missions has been reported and is being followed up with a clin ical study (NASCA) of cataract progression rates in current or retired astronauts. Several NSRL st udies of cataract risks are supported to improve the understanding of how proton and HZE nuclei induce cataracts, and to identify possible countermeasure approaches. The NASCA study and NSRL research will be used by the Risk Assessment Project to project cataract risks for specific space missions. Ri sk assessment models for cataract risk will be developed (Gap Degen 5) through bi ophysical models of new or existing radiobiology data. New models for other degenerative risks will be developed after studies of biological mechanisms have matured. Biological Countermeasures Research on BCMs (Gap Degen 6) for other degenerative risks is envisioned after studies of biological mechanisms have matured. Timelines to begi n research on BCM for the Degenerative Risks are dependent on progress in Cancer and CNS research w ithin the current SRPE research prioritization plans, and perhaps based on the findings of the initial bi ological mechanisms resear ch phase of the research plan.

HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 276 RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS FROM LUNAR DUST EXPOSURE -I X N/A The toxicological effects of lunar dusts have not been studied in sufficient depth to develop an exposure standard for operations on the lunar surface. Lunar du sts have a high content in the respirable size range, they have a high surface area that is chemically reactive, and elemental iron \"nano-particles\" are imbedded in the dust grains. These unusual properties may cause the respirable dusts to be at least moderately toxic to the respiratory system, and larger grains to be abrasive to the skin & eye. NASA needs to set an airborne exposure standard based on scientific evidence so that vehicle designs can effectively control exposure. Under certain conditions on earth, mi neral dust can be highly toxic to the human respiratory system, but it is unclear whether exposure to lunar dust will be more or less harmful. Research into the toxicity of lunar dust will provide an evidence base to set exposure standards, which are needed to manage safely exposures in lunar habitats and vehicles. Context of Risk for Exploration The nominal toxicity expected from ordinary minera l dust may be increased for lunar dust by the large and reactive surfaces of the dust grains. Human exposur es to mineral dusts during industrial operations and from volcanic eruptions give us some sense of lunar dust toxicity, althou gh the earth-based analogs have serious limitations. Animal and cellular studies provide further evidence that mineral dusts can be somewhat toxic. Earth-based research of mineral dust has shown that freshly fractured surfaces are reactive and elicit an increased toxic response. Sin ce lunar dust is formed in space vacuum from highly energetic processes, we expect the grain surfaces to be reactive indefinitely until the dust is brought into a habitable environment. Lunar dust is characterized as fine, charged and reac tive dust capable of entering habitats and vehicle compartments, where it can threaten crewmember health . Testing is critical for the determination of lunar dust toxicity in order to set a permissible exposure lim it and risk criteria. Research areas should include identification of lunar dust size, shape, and chemis try, the mode of activation and passivation of lunar dust particles, toxicity to the respiratory system, ocul ar and dermal toxicity and cellular level toxicity. Health effects from chronic exposure to lunar dust may be irreversible compromised pulmonary function and possible organ disease through relocation of toxic particulates through the bloodstream. Acute health effects include ocular abrasion that might impair crew vision and dermal abrasion that might compromise function while suited. Operational Relevance Assessment & Recommendations The risk of lunar dust exposure was identified during the Apollo missions, when lunar dusts were introduced into the Lunar Lander and command module, resulting in direct exposure and occasional reports of respiratory, dermal, and ocular irritation. NASA's planning for the return to the Lunar surface has an EVA schedule that is more rigorous than what was experienced during the Apollo era. This increased duration and frequency of exposure to lunar dust requires that NASA set a permissible exposure limit for respirable lunar dust. Dermal and ocular abrasions can occur during spaceflight. These can be minimized by mitigation through operational procedures, i.e ., post-EVA clean up in airlocks, temporary breathing apparatus implementation during clean-up exposure periods, and isolation of contaminated suit from respirable environment and appropriate filteri ng design implementations within input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 277 Strategy for Mitigation To mitigate the potential health risks and formulat e a scientifically sound and defensible permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable fractions of lunar dust, we have identified several knowledge gaps, and appropriate studies to close these knowledge gaps. The Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Assessment Group has been created and utilized to provide expert opinions of NASA proposed gaps and research studies. The proposed research will permit us to gain adequate knowledge to ensure appropriate mitigation strategies. Gaps AEH 1: What are the unique properties of lunar dust that affect physiology? Lunar dust particles are unlike terrestrial dusts. L unar dusts are known to have a high surface area and other distinctive shape and chemical characteristics.

The results will be used to facilitate the management of lunar dust particles in the respirable size range Lunar activation studies will attempt to replicate solar wind, micrometeorite bombardment, and lunar processes that cause surface activation of lunar dust. Understanding the activation and passivation processes and their mode of action in the hu man system will determine potential health effects and exposure limits during mission related tasks. Deliverables : These studies will provide activated dust particles for further toxicity testing. Determination of size distribution factor for calculation of permissible exposure limit. Recommendations for operational processes and constraints to minimize exposure to lunar dusts. Recommendations to be incorporated into Spacefli ght Human Systems Standards and MOD planning. Recommendation for crew scheduling controls to mission designers. Required Delivery Milestone : PEL required by Lander SDR, FY11 Required Platforms : The activity will be conducted in va rious Validation for planetary Ops is required iground laboratory studies. n Lunar Return Timeframe on the Lunar surface. AEH 2: What is the toxicity of respired lunar dust in the respiratory system? During the Apollo missions several crews reported anecdot al respiratory issues with lunar dust. There is no scientifically defensible data to support the toxici ty of inhaled lunar dusts. These data are central in determining a permissible exposure limit and risk criteria for lunar dusts. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 278 Tasks : (AEH, LADTAG - via directed study) Pulmonary Toxicity Studies (Dos e, Species & Activation Factors) - Inhalation Toxicity, Intratracheal & Intrapharyngeal Instillation Testing (Directed Studies ) These studies will determine the distribution of inhaled and instilled dust particles throughout the lung and the overall toxicity in the lung tissue.

PEL Required by Lander SDR in FY11 Required Platforms : The activity will be conducted in va rious ground laboratory studies. Validation for planetary Ops in Lunar Return Timeframe. AEH 3: What is the mode of action of l unar dust at the respiratory cellular level? Respirable particles are suspected to be present on the lunar surface; there is no evidence that exists that would show the toxicity of lunar dust if it penetrates the lungs at the cellular level. The possible generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) will aid in the determination of lunar dust toxicity. Scientifically defensible studies will objectively de termine cellular level toxicity. Other relevant biomarkers of cellular toxicity w ill be explored if identified. Tasks : (AEH, LADTAG - via directed study) Lunar cell culture toxicity testing (Active vs. Non-Active Dusts) Human lung cell culture will be tested to determine toxic ity of lunar dust particles. The generation of ROS will be one marker of potential toxicity. Active vs. non-active dust will be tested to determine the differences in toxicity due to chemical activation. Deliverables : This information may contribute to the determ ination of both dose and activation factors for calculation of permissible exposure limit Required Delivery Milestone : Provide required data mid 2010. Required Platforms : The activity will be conducted in various ground laboratory studies. Validation for planetary Ops in Lunar Return Timeframe will be necessary. AEH 4: What is the dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dust? During the Apollo missions several crews reported an ecdotal dermal and ocular issues with lunar dust exposure. There is no data to suppor t the dermal and ocular toxicity of lunar dusts. The determination of the dermal and ocular hazards is necessary to predic t and prevent any visual decrement and vapor barrier loss during lunar operations. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 279 Tasks : (AEH, LADTAG - via directed study) Dermal Toxicity Studies Dermal abrasion studies will be performed to determine the degree of dermal toxicity from acute and chronic exposure to lunar dust particles.

AEH 5: What are the permissible exposu re limits for inhalation of lunar dust? Data collected from AEH Tasks 1- 3 will be analyzed for the development of time based exposure limits of lunar dust concentration in air. The standard will cover 6-month episodic exposures, but may include other time based exposure limits (acute and chronic) contingent upon the validity of the data.

Tasks : (NSBRI - NRA selected task) Aerosol Deposition in the Lung in Fractional Gravity The hypotheses are that total aerosol deposition in the human lung will be higher in fractional gravity, and that aerosol deposition on the lungs of rats will be more pe ripheral. The increased deposition and lengthened time before clearance may increase the likelihood of lung injury.

HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision SRPE IRP- SRPE IRP- SRPE IRP- SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 285 RISK OF ACCELERATED OSTEOPOROSIS - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - I Bone mineral loss occurs in microgravity due to unloa ding of the skeletal system, with average loss rates of approximately 1% per month. It is unclear whet her this bone mineral density will stabilize at a lower level, or continue to diminish. It is unknown if fractional gravit y, present on the moon and Mars would mitigate the loss. Mission-related bone loss cannot be corrected by post-mission rehabilitation; crewmembers could be at greater risk of osteoporosis -related fractures in later life. Greater understanding of the mechanisms of bone demineralization in microgr avity is necessary to frame this risk, as well as to understand how current and future osteoporosis treatments may be employed. Operational Relevance and Risk Context Although it is currently possible 1) to track the course of changes in bone mineral density and bone quality during long duration missions, 2) to determin e if bone losses will occur during a Mars visit, and 3) knowing such information to determine the risk of fracture upon return to Earth after a Mars mission, current capabilities are not in any requirement documen ts for Lunar or Mars missions. However, even after 6-month missions there are indications that bo ne quality/strength does not recover as quickly as bone mineral density. This may represent a long-term health effect (increased osteoporosis and fracture risk) related to this discordant recovery dynamic. This information is required to assess long-term health risks to returning crew. Strategy for Mitigation While demineralization of bone during spaceflight is known and requires mitigation; the time course of in-flight bone changes, the time course of post-fli ght recovery and individual susceptibilities have not been determined. The 2007 NASA Research Announcem ent was utilized to solic it and select proposals to gather these space normal data. In addition, work is ongoing with the Space Medicine Division to obtain long-term recovery data. The long-term goals are to deliver countermeasures during the mission, track efficacy, and prevent lifetime health risk. Due to schedule constraint s, countermeasure development has been started in parallel with space normal da ta collection and technology development. Gaps B10: What is the time course of bone loss during flights >90 days on ISS and during Lunar Outpost missions? Although the degree of loss in bone mineral de nsity during the ISS missions is not of great concern, it is not known at what rate losses occur, and it is not currently possible to predict what losses will occur during a Mars mission. Therefore, in-f light monitoring (BMD or other methods) of bone metabolism and density/strength, as new state of the ar t techniques become available, should be examined on Shuttle, ISS and during Lunar Sor tie and Lunar Outpost missions. It is recommended that additional research on bone loss remain at a low priority until th is data is acquired and assessed, and can be used to focus any future efforts. B1: Is bone strength completely recovered with recovery of BMD? It is a high priority to determine whether changes occur in bone architecture during lo ng-duration spaceflight that, even with recovery of pre-flight BMD, adversely impacts long-term risk. Is this influenced by multiple flights?

It will also explore the data already gathered to date during the US human space program in order to summarize the current state of evidence available on additional risk factors related to bone loss and recovery in microgravity. The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to provide evidence-based information that may assist in guiding the direction of further research required to understand better the risk of bone loss and fracture among crewmembers and the strategies that could be developed to prevent it from occurring.

HRP-47065 SRPE Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 288 N5: Can a single test monitor net bone calcium changes? Although the degree of loss in bone mineral density during the ISS missions is not of great concern, it is not known at what rate losses occur, and it is not currently possible to predict what losses will o ccur during a Mars mission. Therefore in-flight monitoring (other than BMD) of bone metabolism and density/strength, as new state of the art techniques become available, should be examined on Shuttle , ISS and during Lunar So rtie and Lunar Outpost missions. Task : (NxPCM - via NRA) Rapid measurements of bone loss using tracer-less calcium isotope analysis of blood and urine This task will develop a method to rapidly detect changes in bone mineral balance by measuring the natural (i.e., tracer-less) isotope composition of calcium in blood and/or urine.

Task : (NxPCM - via Directed Study) Bisphosphonates as a countermeasure to sp ace flight induced bone loss, SMO-021 The purpose of this SMO is to determine whether Bisphosphonates, in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program, will protect ISS cr ewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS flights. Two dosing regimens will be used: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of alendronate taken weekly during flight or (2) an IV dose of zoledronic acid 4 mg, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. Secondary goals will be to document the return to normal bone remodeling post-flight in crewmembers who took Bisphosphonates.

B11: What are the effects of radiation on bone? Task : (NSBRI) Space Radiation and Bone Loss: Lunar Outpost Mi ssion-Critical Scenarios and Countermeasures Astronauts on long lunar missions will face the adverse affects of microgravity, reduc ed gravity, and radiation exposure. It is known that microgravity causes bone loss since bones of the lower body do not bear weight in space as they do on Earth. The imp act of radiation on bone quality and fra cture healing in reduced gravity is unknown. Dr. Ted A Bateman is investigating the effect of different types of space radiation on bone to learn whether radiation increases the rate of loss. His team is also testing the protectiv e effects of pharmacological countermeasures, such as Bisphosphonat es, antioxidants and certain proteins. Deliverables : A product will be information regarding bone loss and radiation effects. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission.

Task : (NSBRI) Maintaining Musculoskeletal Health in the Lunar Environment It is well documented that the human body loses bone and muscle mass durin g long-duration stays in space such as on the International Space Station. With the United States planning to conduct lo ng-duration missions to the moon, scientists must learn what effects lunar gravity, wh ich is one-sixth of Earth's, will have on human muscle and bone. This study is an animal model study to determine if muscle and bone loss on the moon will be as severe as it is in microgravity. The project also seeks to determine if low-dose radiation exposure worsens bone and muscle loss in a lunar-gravity environment and if, unde r these unique conditions, exercise is still effective in reducing bone and muscle loss. Deliverables : A product will be information regarding bone loss and radiation effects. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission.

HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 290 Task : (NxPCM - via NRA) Dietary intake can predict and protect against changes in bone metabolism during space flight and recovery This task will document how the ratio of acid to base precur sors in the diet is related to directional changes in markers of bone resorption and formation during flight and recovery from flight. There is a high likelihood for success in predicting the extent of bone loss from diet ary intake patterns among astronauts during space flight given that this concept is strongly anchored in previous ground-based data from our laboratory and others. The notion of manipulating diet to minimize bone loss could also have significant social and economic impacts for NASA and for the general public - especially given the increasing trends for diets that are high in animal protein and low in fruits and vegetables. The proposed experime nts will result in a dietary countermeasure for bone loss that has no associated risks for si de effects, no requirement for payl oad mass, and no additional crew time necessary during flight. Deliverables : This task will deliver a validated nutritional co untermeasure that will protect against bone loss. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog.

The relationship between bone health and the protein/potassium ratio in the diet needs to be further investigated, along with the role of potassium in cardiovascular health during flight. Nominal determinations of phosphor us content of the space food system are required, as well as further investigation of the mechanism and implications of decreased phosphorus excre tion after long-duration spaceflight. Nominal determinations of magnesium of the space food system are required. Task: (NxPCM - via Directed Study) Nutrition Status Assessment - SMO O16E: Nutrition SMO This is a directed study that seeks to expand the Medical Requirement 016L testing in three ways: 1) include in-flight blood and urine collection, 2) expand nominal testing to include make rs of normative markers of nutritional assessment, and 3) add an R+30 session to allow evaluation of post flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation. Additional markers of bone metabolism (helical peptide, OPG, RANKL, IGF-1) will be measured to better monitor bon e health and countermeasure efficacy. New markers of oxidative damage will be measured (8-iso-prostag landin F2a, protein carbonyls, oxidized and reduced glutathione) to better assess the type of oxidative in sults during space flight. The array of nutritional assessment parameters will be expanded to include serum folate, plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate , and homocysteine to better understand changes in folate, vitamin B6 status, an d related cardiovascular ri sk factors during and after flight. Additionally, stress hormones and hormones that affect bone and muscle metabo lism will be also measured (DHEA, DHEA-S, Cortisol, testosterone, estradiol). This additional assessment would allo w for better health monitoring, and allow for more accurate recommendations to be made for crew reha bilitation. These additiona l parameters were added du e to the recommendation of an extramural panel that met to define nutritional standards and requirements in 2005. If data indi cate countermeasures are necessary for cardiovascular issues and/or bone loss, additional ground-ba sed studies will be initiat ed. These countermeasures will be validated on board the ISS Deliverables : The SFHSS nutrition standard will be updated and nutritional requirements will be delivered to AFT. Updates regarding nutritional status in-flight will be delivered to the Human System Risk Forum. All deliverables are scheduled for delivery in the FY2011 timeframe.

By directing an exercise protocol to prevent skel etal adaptation to space, we prevent a cascade of subsequent physiological changes that may introduce health risks in and of themselves. For example, bone decalcification can increase the risk for rena l stones and can also perturb the body's hormonal system that conserve calcium in the body and absorb calcium from the diet ( in Evidence Book ). Thus, an optimal exercise prescription could have crosscutting effects that preserves or maintains over all bone health. Task : (ECP - via Directed Study) Integrated Countermeasure Study - TBD This task is referenced under the Risk of Impaired Endurance - see gaps M7, M8, M9 and M10 Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength and Task: (ECP - via Directed Study) ISS Prescription Study - TBD This task is referenced under the Risk of ImpairedEndurance - see gaps M7, M8, M9 and M10 Performance Due to Reduced Muscle Mass, Strength and Task : (NSBRI) A Quantitative Test of On-Orbit Exercise Countermeasures for Bone Demineralization Using a Bed Rest Analog This novel approach involves quantifying typical daily loads to the lower extremities in selected free-living volunteer subjects who are moderate exercisers and planning individual exercise prescriptions based on DLS theory. Subjects were randomized to control or exercise groups and confined to 6-degree head-down bed rest in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the Clev eland Clinic for 12 weeks. During this time, the exercise group underwent individua lized daily exercise pr ograms in the unique Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator (ZLS) at CCF designed to replace their daily me chanical load stimulus expe rienced during free living. DXA, MRI, and QCT scans were conducted at the start and end of bed rest to assess variations in bone mineral density, changes in muscle volume, and regional changes (cortical vs. trabecular) in bone. Strength measurements were collected pre- an d post-bed rest, and urinary and serum markers of bone resorption and formation were also assessed. Dietary intake sufficient to maintain constant body weight with a balanced intake of macro- and micronutrients was planned and supervised by a registered dietician, and a physician was available 24 hr/day to attend to any medical needs. A rehabilitation program was offered to subjects in the 8 weeks following bed rest. The proposed experiment should provide a categorical answer to the question of whether intermittent load replacement can adeq uately protect the musculoskeletal sy stem against hypokinetic osteopenia and muscle atrophy and may open a new era in individualized exercise countermeasure planning. Deliverables: This study will provide data that will help close this gap. be made whether or not to pursue this exercise model. At the end of this study a decision must Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: This is a bed rest study. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 292 Task : (NSBRI) Monitoring Bone Health by Daily Load Stimulus Measurement during Lunar Missions This project will develop and validate a miniaturized accelerometer-based system that could be used during intra- and extravehicular task on the lunar surface to monitor the complete daily lo ad stimulus to the lower extremity and interpret that information in relation to bone health. After validation in the enhanced Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator (eZLS) at NASA Glenn Research Center and the lunar bed-rest analog at University of Texas Medical Branch, a deliverable of this project w ill be a system, the Accelerometric Daily Load Sensor (aDLS), including a small shoe-mounted unit that will transm it signals to a BioWATCH that could also be used to collect data on other physiological systems simultaneous ly. On-board software with visual feedback will determine how much additional exercise is requi red each day to maintain bone homeostasis. Deliverables: This study will deliver a countermeasure for use on the lunar surface. If the countermeasure will be pursued, it must be validated on the lunar surface Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: This study is being conducted in bed rest. Task : (NSBRI) An Integrated Musculoskeletal Countermeasure Battery for Long-Duration Lunar Missions The degree to which the musculoskeletal system will maintain its integrity during prolonged sojourns in the reduced gravity of the lunar surface is presently unknown. It is, however, likely that without countermeasures there will be adaptive changes in muscle strength, bone mineral density, bone geometry, and sensorimotor status. When the combined effects of these changes are considered in the context of the construction and exploration tasks that will be performed at the lunar base or at other l unar sites, the risk of injury secondary to a fall is likely to be elevated. To address this fund amental problem, we have constructed a compact platform that integrates a time efficient integrated battery of countermeasures that can be conducted in the confines of the lunar habitat to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal injury. Ultimately, we expect that this battery of countermeasures will be validated using a 10\u00b0 head-up bed rest simulation of a lunar mission, although it could also be tested in the standard 6 degree head down simulation. The specific objectives of the countermeasure battery are: to preserve muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness; to minimize decrements in postural stability, dynamic balance, and the ability to make corrective actions prior to a fall; to preserve functional performance on mission relevant tasks; and to minimize bone loss in the proximal femur. Deliverables : This study must be reviewed several times before it will deliver a countermeasure. The hardware must be developed and then evaluated in a ground-based study. It will potentially be evaluated in the lunar analog model Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: This is a ground-based study. HRP-47065 SRPE SRPE IRP- 297 RISK OF BONE FRACTURE - CRITICALI TY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - D Bone mineral loss occurs in microgravity due to unloa ding of the skeletal system, with average loss rates of approximately 1% per month. It is unclear whet her this bone mineral density will stabilize at a lower level, or continue to diminish. It is also unkn own if fractional gravity, present on the moon and Mars would mitigate the loss. This level of bone loss do es not create an unacceptable risk of fractures for ISS missions, but longer missions could create higher fracture risk. The risk of fracture during a mission cannot be accurately estimated until mechanisms and probabilities of bone overloading during the missions are understood. Mission-related bone loss ca nnot be corrected by post-mission rehabilitation; crewmembers could be at greater risk of osteoporosis -related fractures in later life. Greater understanding of the mechanisms of bone demineralization in microgr avity is necessary to frame this risk, as well as to understand how current and future osteoporosis treatments may be employed. Context of Risk for Exploration Long duration mission DXA scans of astronauts and co smonauts following long duration missions reveal an average monthly rate of BMD loss at 1-1.5% bone mass in lower limbs, hip, spine and pelvis. QCT further delineates a greater percentage loss in the cance llous bone compartment, relative to loss in cortical bone, as well as geometric changes in the proximal femur. Temporal recovery of preflight bone mass exceeds the duration of spaceflight exposure with a 50% restoration on the order of 200-250 days, based on a mathematical fit of post-flight DXA BMD measurements. Thus, the recovery model, based upon fitted data, suggest that substantial r ecovery could occur in about 3 years . The fracture risk for bone is related to the ratio of applied load to bone to the fracture load of bone. Thus the increased fracture risk induced by spaceflight is suggested collectively by the accelerated loss of bone mass as an adaptive response, by the weightlessness and reduced gravity fields experienced during missions and by the loads and torques that the skeleton is subjected to during performed tasks of the missions. The most critical work needed for this risk are measu res of in-flight changes in bone mass over the course of ISS missions so that temporal changes in bone mass can be pred icted during Mars missions. Those data will provide a basis for evaluating whether the expected loads /torques to the bones during human performance on a mission will exceed the failure load of bone (i.e., fracture load). This knowledge will drive mission operations planning. Strategy for Mitigation A high risk for fracture is a characteristic of oste oporosis, which is a consequence of the losses in bone mass and in structural deterioration. Therefore, gaps and tasks that fall under the Risk of Accelerated Osteoporosis are also mapped to this risk. The only in dependent gap for the Risk of Bone Fracture is the unknown incidence of vertebral compression fractures. The task associated with this gap is being completed by the Space Medicine Division. Gaps B2: What new technologies are available for in-flight fracture diagnosis? This gap is being worked within the ExMC Program Element. Please refer to ExMC gap 4.02 for further in formation. HHC is not conducting any work in this area. B29: What is the risk of vertebral compression fractures?

Alterations in hydration state (relative dehydration) and bone metabolism (increased calcium excretion) during e xposure to microgravity may increase the risk of kidney stone formation and it is unclear which mitig ation strategy would be the most effective. Context of Risk for Exploration Countermeasures for renal stone formation must be validated prior to Mars exploration missions because of reduced level of care and prolonged evacuation time. In-flight monitoring must be developed and instituted so that crewmembers will have a means to track their renal stone markers. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Hu man System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. Gaps B5: What is the current state of knowledge regarding renal stone formation?

Task : (NSBRI) The Multisystem Effect of Exercise Training/Nutritional Support During Prolonged Bed Rest Deconditioning: An Integrative Approach to Countermeasure Development for the Heart, Lungs, Muscles and Bones Sustained exposure to microgravity leads to adaptive changes in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems that result in substantial morbidity. For example cardiovascular deconditioning may lead to orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Atrophy of skeletal muscle will diminish work capacity and may lead to muscle injury. Bone demineralization increases the risk of kidney stone formation and may reduce bone strength increasing the risk of fracture. Bone resorption may be particularly severe after long duration space flight with uncertain recovery. Despite in depth study, the optimal counterm easure for each system has not been defined. More importantly, previous work has focused predominantly on one organ system at a time, ignoring the interaction among systems, and preventing the development of a speci fic countermeasure for an individual astronaut that might be effective for the heart, muscles and bones. The global objective of this proposal is to test an integrated countermeasure that will be effective against cardiovascu lar deconditioning, skeletal muscle atrophy, and bone demineralization, and that ultimately can be applied practically abroad the International Space Station or a mission to Mars.

Most of these have been related to cardiovascular disease, but it is not clear whether this was due to pre-existing conditions or effects of space flight. It is hoped that advanced screening fo r coronary disease has greatly mitigated this risk. Other heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibr illation, can develop over time, necessitating periodic screening of crewmembers' heart rhythms. Beyond these terrestrial heart risks, some concern exists that prolonged exposure to microgravity may lead to heart rhythm disturbances. Although this has not been observed to date, further surveillance is warranted. Context of Risk for Exploration Missions may be impacted by the occurrence of a clini cally significant dysrhythmia. It is important to define \"space normal\" for this risk so that appr opriate countermeasures can be developed if needed. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Hu man System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. Gaps CV1: What are the in-flight alterations in cardiac structure and function? This is a high priority gap for this risk. The task is already underway in collaboration with outside investigators. The studies include in-flight Holter monitoring and ultrasound assessment of cardiac structure and function. Further research into this risk is not recommended until the results from this effort are known. CV8: Can manifestations of sub-clinical or en vironmentally induced ca rdiovascular diseases during spaceflight be predicted? This gap is owned by the Space Medicine Division although it is possible that some data gathered from the Integrated Cardiovascular SMO may be of use. Task: (NxPCM - directed study) Integrated Cardiovascular Study This comprehensive study integrates the objectives of two NRA investigations and a SMO and involves both intramural and extramural investigators. Data will be obta ined twice pre-flight, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 1-2 months during flight, and 3 times post-flight. In -flight testing will require holter monitoring, 2-d echocardiography, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. After completion of this study, the clinical expression of cardiac atrophy during long duration space flight will be defined clearly, and its significance for cardiac systolic and diastolic function at rest and during gravitational transitions will be elucidated. In addition, preliminary information will be obtained regarding vent ricular conduction and repolarization that will provide either strong clinical reassurance, or pathophysiologic insight into the risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Deliverables: The products are quantification of the extent , time course, and clinical significance of any spaceflight-related cardiac atroph y and identification of its mechanisms a nd functional consequences. This will be accomplished by updating the HSRF; updating the cardiovascular risk and informi ng mission operations of requirements to support this risk.

Recent evidence from spaceflight experiments suggest alterations in micr obial characteristics, including virulence (disease- causing potential), in organisms grown during fli ght. The HRP will analyze current spaceflight operational and flight experiment da ta, develop an infectious disease ri sk assessment model, and convene risk and requirement reviews to determine if spaceflight poses any unique risk to the crew. Including in this review is a determination of the efficacy of current mitigation strategies and countermeasures given the potential changes in microorganisms and crewme mbers and recommendations to current operational or design controls. Context of Risk for Exploration Negative impacts from microorganisms during flight ar e not uncommon; however, major impacts to crew health and performance fortunately do not occur frequently. Unfortunately, the consequences of infectious disease can include loss of mission and loss of crew, and thus the extent of the risk needs clarification. If microbial virulence characteristics do change in a variety of microorganisms during flight, then current mitigation strategies would need to be revisited to ensure crew health and mission success. Strategy for Mitigation To mitigate these risks and ensure the use of appropria te microbial health requirements, a requirements review should be accomplished using systematic microbi al risk modeling that identifies knowledge gaps, such as the effect of spaceflight on microbial virule nce factors. The effect of these gaps should be evaluated, quantified if possible, and investigated if necessary to develop an appropriate knowledge base to model current infectious disease risks and set appropriate microbiological requirements. The knowledge gap concerning limited know ledge of host-microbe interacti on during spaceflight will first be addressed by a workshop designed to develop a position on the extent of the risk and need for future investigations, and, if necessary, a systematic pathwa y to gain adequate knowledge to ensure appropriate mitigation strategies.

Selection of appropriate requirements is based on de termination of the best model and assumptions for spaceflight conditions. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning (AEH, , Directed Study ) Microbial Risk Assessment Modeling Study A risk assessment based upon historical microbiological monitoring data is being performed by subject matter experts in quantitative microbial risk assessment and inf ectious disease to provide a risk model for expected potable water systems in a lunar habitat. Knowledge for this model is provided by data mining of CHeCS operational data, information from the SWAB flight expe riment, research data from other ISS experiments, exposure assessments based on ECLSS design specifications, and human immune system data provided by the Integrated Immune SMO (HHC) and previous flight research. Closure of knowledge gaps identified by this model will facilitate review and updates to water requir ements and develop a framework from which evaluation of other microbiological requirements can be performed. After completion of the model, a workshop will be convened to review the model, determine any reco mmended changes to current water requirements, and recommend forward studies if necessary. Successful application of this model to NASA microbial risks would suggest expanding this model to other components of microbiology such as food requirements during a lunar outpost.

HRP-47065 SRPE Research HRP IRP- Revision SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 313 RISK OF CREW ADVERSE HEALTH EVENT DUE TO ALTERED IMMUNE RESPONSE - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - I Human immune function is altered in- and post-flight, but it is unclear if this change leads to an increased susceptibility to disease. Reactivation of latent vi ruses has been documented in crewmembers, though this reactivation has not been directly correlated w ith the immune changes or with observed disease. Further research may elucidate whether microgravity exposure impairs the immune system, and whether this change represents a health risk to crews. Context of Risk for Exploration While there is post-flight evidence to support this risk, in-flight evidence should also be obtained. The necessary in-flight data should be collected and assessed before further determinations of future research direction are undertaken. Ground-based work should be conducted using the Antarctic station space flight analog (best available analog for immunity during >6 months. flight) so that ground control data of an appropriate sample size may be obtained. Validati on of an analog directly to flight data would be useful for future countermeasures validation. The la boratory findings are to be correlated to clinical findings and follow-up studies are performed to document any latent, long-term effects. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hen ce data mining tasks in the form of the Integrated Immune SMO are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Human System Risk Forum and it will be decided if counterme asures need to be developed. In addition, because head down tilt bed rest is not a valuable analog to spaceflight for this discipline, a good analog for immune studies is being sought. Gaps IM1: Does spaceflight alter immune function? This is a high priority for HHC. This data is currently unknown. IM2: Is an improved immune standard needed? Data must be obtained to determine if the standard is accurate and adequate. IM5: What is the time course and etiology of immune changes? An investigation of individual records of in-flight illness for clarification is needed. Task: (NxPCM - via 1498 Shuttle-based study investigating 1) neutrophil and monocyte functions (phagocytosis, degranula tion, oxidative burst capacity, and expression of surface molecules) and 2) natural-killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell cytotoxicity against target cells, and cytokine production 2) Incidence of Latent Virus Shedding 'L atent quency of latent virus reactivation, latent virus shedding, and clinical disease after exposure to the physical, physiological, and psychological stressors associated with space flight 3) Space Flight-Induced Reactiv ation of as E129 Shuttle- and ISS-based study investigates the magnitude of immunosuppression as a re sult of space flight by 1) analysis of stress hormones, 2) quan titative analysis of EBV replication us ing molecular and serological methods, and 3) determining virus-spec ific T-cell immune function. IRP- Revision FY09 314 Deliverables: Final reports of findings will be delivered in 2009. Data from these Shuttle-based immune studies will be combined with the ISS-based Integrated Immune SMO to update health standards. If these studies together indicate that a countermeasure is needed, then ground-based countermeasure studies will be solicited and performed. Countermeasures developed from th ese studies will then be validated on ISS. Required Delivery Milestone : These tasks mitigate a risk to a long -duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: ISS is required to complete these studies. Task: (NxPCM - via directed study) Validation of Procedures for Monitoring Crewmember Immune Function: 'Integrated Immune SMO,' SMO 015/SDBI 1900 The objective of this Supplemental Medical Objective (SMO) is to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints. There are no procedures currently in place to monitor immune function or its effect on crew health. Immune dysr egulation has been demonstrated to occur during spaceflight, yet little in-flight immune data has been generated to assess whether or not this may be a clinical problem. This SMO will assess the clinical risks resultin g from the adverse effects of space flight on the human immune system and will validate a flight-compatible immune monitoring strategy. The correlation between in-flight immunity, physiological stress and a meas urable clinical outcome (viral reactivation) will be determined for long- vs. short-duration space flight. Deliverables: Data from this study will be combined with th e Shuttle-based immune studies to update health standards. If results indicate that a countermeasure is needed, ground-based countermeasure studies will be solicited and performed. Then these countermeasures will be validated on ISS. In addition, all data will be shared with other Elements to help address related gaps such as (1) ExMC Gap 4.06 - Lack of capability to stabilize and treat bone fractures; (2 ) ExMC Gap 4.08 - Lack of reusable cold compress and heating pad capability made of suitable spaceflight ma terials; and (3) SHFH Gap related to new Host-Microbe Interactions Risk. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: ISS is required to ensure that the data represents space normal and for validation of potential countermeasures. A ground analog (Antarctica, NEEMO, and/or Haughton-Mars) may be used to provide additional data. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass (kg/subject) Downmass 4kg/Inc 4kg/Inc 5.5 2.27 Task : Host-Microbe Interactions Study This task is being conducted by SHFH to address AEH Gap Alterations in Host-Microorganism Interactions. 2.3 under the Risk of Adverse Health Effects Due To IM3: Are there suitable analogs for immune dysregulation? This gap be filled using the Antarctic station analog so that adequate sample sizes ma y be obtained. Findings using ground-based analogs should be related to clinical findings and follow-up studies should be performed to document any latent, long-term effects. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 315 Task: (NxPCM - via directed study) NEEMO Rapid Operational Investigation (ROI): Immune function changes during a spaceflight-analog 10-day undersea mission This study measures immune functional changes, phys iological stress, viral reactivation and viral specific immunity during the NEEMO mission. NEEMO repr esents a good analog for some aspects of short-duration spaceflight on immunity. This study will provide data to compare this ground-based spaceflight-analog to actual flight data. If immune dysregulation is observed in the NEEMO crews that is similar to that observed in flight crews during/following spaceflight, this analog will be validated for some aspects of spaceflight-associated immune dysregulation. This analog will not supersede the program goal to validate a ground analog for long- duration spaceflight and immunity. Deliverables: Initial product is completion fed into the Immune SMO data sets. of the NEEMO study and final report of findings. All results will be Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission.

These data also represent the potential for cases of Sh ingles and Ramsey Hunt Syndrome to be experienced by flight crews in long duration exploration. VZV may assume increased virulence and/or live virus numbers in microgravity. This study will demonstrate the sensitivity of the model and provid e an operational deliverable in the form of a reliable test for live quantifiable virus. Deliverables: The product is completion of the ground-based study and final report of findings. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: Ground-based laborato ry is required. Task : (NSBRI) Apoptosis and Immune Homeostasis During Hind limb Unloading Space flight causes lymphopenia, ab normally low mitogen responses, and reduced production of antibodies and cytokines. Space flight-associated factors such as micr ogravity, lack of load bearing, stress, and radiation are believed to contribute to these effects, but the exact mechanisms are unknown . Ground-based mouse models such as hind limb unloading (HU) and irradiation cause similar effects. We hypothesize th at these changes result from lymphocyte apoptosis induced by the cell surface receptor, Fas, in a manner dependent on endogenous opioids. Furthermore, we predict that radiation exposure and HU act synergistically. We have proposed to: 1) elucidate the role of Fas and endogenous opioids in the modulation of the immune system by HU and radiation; and 2) determine the effect of HU and radiation on lymphocyte dynamics and immune responses. In addition, because autoimmune disease is often associated with stress an d radiation exposure, we will determine whether HU and radiation promote autoimmunity. The overall goal is to determine the mechanisms underlying apoptosis-related immune modulation using ground-based models. Deliverables: The product is completion of the ground-based study and final report of findings. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: Ground-based laborato ry is required. IRP- Revision FY09 316 Task: (NxPCM - via directed study) Consequences of Long-term Confinement and Hypobaric Hypoxia on Immunity in the Antarctic Concordia Environment (CHOICE - Study) In the unique environment of the Concordia station, stress-dependent immune-modulation due to both confinement and hypoxia can be simultaneously investig ated with the following goals: 1) Assessment and understanding of stress-associated immune changes that results from confinement living under moderate hypobaric hypoxia comparable to those possible living situ ations in future lunar habitats where air pressure and oxygen may be lowered for technical and financial reasons and 2) Work out for the rationale for the development of adequate countermeasures to coun terbalance the potential risk of conf inement and hypoxia-induced immune and health changes. Deliverables: The product is completion of the ground-based study and final report of findings. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: This is a ground-based study in the Antarctic. IM4: Can in-flight hardware to evaluate hematology/infection/immunity be developed? This capability must be developed prior to exploration miss ions. The need for development of this equipment will be further defined when IM1 is filled. It is not clear that work should begin earlier. Simple, reliable means to evaluate immune function an d/or infection (e.g., white cell count ) is clinically relevant to long- duration space missions. Task: (ISSMP) In-flight Flow Cytometer Project Deliverables: The product is an in-flight flow cytometer capable of various immunology/hematology measurements. Required Delivery Milestone : This task mitigates a risk to a long-duration Mars mission. The tasks are conducted in the 2008-2020 timeframe because of the availability of ISS as a Mars transit analog. Required Platforms: This task is ground-based hardware development. Task : (ExMC) Lunar Lab Analysis This task is carried under the Risk of Inability to Ade quately Treat and gap 4.06 Ill or Injured Crew Member - see ExMC HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- SRPE IRP- SRPE Research Planning HRP IRP- Revision FY09 319 RISK OF INVERTEBRAL DISK DAMAGE - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - I Extended exposures to microgravity (and possibly frac tional gravity) may lead to an increased risk of spinal nerve compression and back pain. Context of Risk for Exploration Evidence from medical operations indicates that astronaut s have a higher incidence of intervertebral disc damage than the general population. Additional work should be done to determine the extent of this problem and guide design of re-ent ry and post-flight protocols as well as future re-entry spacecraft. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal must first be defined for this risk; hence data mining tasks are ongoing. Once space normal is defined, the data will be presented to the Hu man System Risk Forum and it will be decided if countermeasures need to be developed. Gaps B4: What is the incidence of intervertebral disk damage following spaceflight? The evidence provided by the discipline for this risk was the common complaint of b ack pain by the crewmembers. There is conflicting information from the Space Medi cine Division regarding the incidence of disc damage post-flight. An assessment of the current datab ase is needed for supporting evidence for this risk. Task: (NxPCM - directed study) Data mining for intervertebral disk damage Additional evidence (research data) needs to be gathered in order to establish whether the lengthening of the spine with space adaptation syndrome exacerbate s the risk for IVD damage with loading. The risk for injury may be greater during the performance of mission tasks in h ypogravity, with accelerated g forces from piloting spacecrafts, or with re turn to gravitational loading on Earth. Deliverables: Final report of findings will be brought to the HS RF in the FY2009 timeframe . If data indicate that more data is required are required, then a flight study will be conducted. If the data indicate an issue exists for disk damage, then the bone standard will be updated to include soft tissue damage. Required Delivery Milestone : Updates to the health standard s hould occur as soon as possible. Required Platforms: Access to Flight Medicine and LSDA databases is necessary for the data mining study. Task: (NxPCM - directed study) Shuttle Pilot Study - TBD Additional evidence will be gathered in order to esta blish whether the lengthening of the spine with space adaptation syndrome exacerbates the risk for IVD damage with loading. Deliverables: Final report of findings will be brought to the HSRF in the FY2012 timeframe. Required Delivery Milestone : Mission operations needs to be informed of data as soon as possible to make any modifications to Orion regarding loads on crew. If countermeasure development studies are required, a validated countermeasure will be delivered in FY2016; which is required for long-duration Exploration missions. Required Platforms: This study initially requires Shuttle crew for access to MRI. ISS crews may be required in the future for countermeasure validation. # of Subjects Initial 320 Task: (NxPCM - directed study) IVD Mechanical Countermeasure Study - TBD A back brace may be developed for use during landings to protect against intervertebral disk damage. Deliverables: A mechanical countermeasure will be delivered in the FY2012 timeframe. Required Delivery Milestone : A validated countermeasure is required for long-duration Exploration missions. Required Platforms: This study requires ISS crews for countermeasure validation. # of Subjects Initial Crew Time/Subject Post-Flight BDC Time (hrs) all long duration None 30 30 0.5 hours None crews Task : Understanding back/neck pain etiology This task is carried under the Risk of Inability to Ade quately Treat and gap 4.03. Ill or Injured Crew Member - see ExMC HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- SRPE Research Planning HRP IRP- Revision FY09 322 RISK OF ORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE DURING RE-EXPOSURE TO GRAVITY - CRITICALITY: LUNAR OUTPOST - D, MARS - I Post-flight orthostatic intolerance, the inability to maintain blood pressure while in an upright position, is an established, space-related medical problem. Count ermeasures have been succ essfully identified and implemented (fluid loading, compression garments ) or being evaluated (Midodrine & others). Completion of these efforts will be useful in determ ining what preventive measures should be used to combat orthostatic intolerance during future mission profiles. Context of Risk for Exploration Twenty percent of Shuttle crewmembers and up to 83% of returning ISS crewmembers suffer hypotension and presyncope or syncope during 10 minutes of upright tilt on landing day. This may constitute a risk when crewmembers experience Earth's gravity after exposure to microgravity. Currently available countermeasures are not effective in a ll crewmembers; in particular, women are more susceptible than men are. While it is well known that crewmembers can be incapacitated by orthostatic intolerance after six-month missions when they return to Earth's gravity, it is not known the degree to which this may be ameliorated in the gravity environment on the Martian surface. Early surface operations may require astronauts to be upright and active soon after la nding on Mars. A combination of countermeasures, both physical and pharmaceutical, should be pursued for this risk. It is not known if exposure to 1/6 g and 3/8 g will cause orthostatic intole rance or will have mitigating effects on orthostatic intolerance upon return to 1 g. Strategy for Mitigation Space normal is defined for this risk; hence current resear ch efforts for this risk are investigations for the efficacy of new countermeasures (i.e., Jobst stocki ngs and pharmacological agents). The new lunar analog currently under development will be utilized to understand the role of the lunar gravity as protection from orthostatic intoleran ce. In addition, gender effects a nd the possibility for gender specific countermeasures are also being investigated. Gaps CV3: Is orthostatic intolerance a potential hazard? This is considered a high priority for HHC, as it remains an issue for ISS and other long duration flights. It is an egress issue, not a vehicle control issue. It is not known if exposure to 1/6 g and 3/8 g will cause orthostatic intolerance or will have mitigating effects on orthostatic intolerance upon return to 1 g. Task: (NxPCM - directed study) Midodrine SMO: Test a Countermeasure against Post-flight Orthostatic Hypotension, SMO-006 To date, available countermeasures (e.g., G-suit, load ) have not sufficiently reduced post-flight orthostatic hypotension. This study is designed to evaluate a new pharmacological countermeasure for protection from post- flight orthostatic hypotension. Th is project will measure the efficacy of Midodrine in reducing the incidence and/or severity of orthostatic hypotension in returning astronauts. Efficacy will be evaluated with an expanded operational tilt test. The tilt test is used to assess the eff ects of prolonged weightlessness on orthostatic tolerance during upright posture, as measured by supine and standing heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. Deliverables: Not applicable Required Delivery Milestone : There is no required delivery milestone for this task. Required Platforms: Not applicable; this study has been discontinued. HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 323 Task: (NxPCM - directed study) Hypovolemia as a Model of Space Flight: Cardiovascular Effects and Countermeasures A hypovolemia model that reproduces the plasma volume loss seen on landing day has been developed utilizing a regimen of a single dose of IV furosemide, followed by 36 hours of a very low salt diet. In the astronauts, this dehydration regimen reproduces the landing day inciden ce of orthostatic hypotension and presyncope during tilt tests with 100% fidelity. Future work will include testin g the utility of this ground-based model by expanding the measurements to include specific hemodynamic and va scular responses, and compare/contrast them with measurements from bed rest studies. Additional activities include validating the Jobst stocking as a method to mitigate orthostatic intolerance on landing day, and exam ine alternate pressure garments if the Jobst stocking is not validated as a valid countermeasure against orthostatic intolerance. In addition, alternate medications to mitigate orthostatic intolerance (i.e., octreotide) will be examined using the hypovolemic model. Follow on studies could include validating octreotide in the 6\u00b0 head-down tilt bed rest model and flight validation of octreotide on ISS. VO2max measurements will also be ta ken using the hypovolemia model. These data will be combined with the VO2 max SMO occurring on-board the ISS. Deliverables: Data will be shared with the HSRF regarding hypovolemia. Required Delivery Milestone: None Required Platforms: This is a ground-based stud y utilizing hypovolemia as a model to spaceflight-induced changes in plasma volume. Task: (NxPCM - NRA) Gender Differences in Bed Rest: Autonomic and Neuroendocr ine Changes and Vascular Responses in Lower and Upper Extremities Although the reasons are undefined, female astronauts are more susceptible to post-flight orthostatic hypotension and presyncope than are male. Due to the lack of cardiovascular bed rest studies that have female participation, many conclusions about the effects of simulated microgravity on humans are flawed, in that they fail to describe mechanisms in the very people who have the most serious problems. This study focuses on how differences in strategies of arterial pressure control in men and women affect orthostatic tolerance both before and after bed rest. Endothelium-dependent, endothelium-independent and adrenergic receptor responses in both arteries and veins will be evaluated, before and after bed rest. In addition, plasma volumes, and hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptor inputs will be measured, in women versus men, before and after bed rest. Studies have indicated a differential response of different vascular beds in animal studies where hind limb-suspended rats show hypertrophic remodeling of the vessels in their forelimbs and atrophic remodeling in the vessels of their hind limbs. This is thought to occur because changes in transmural pressures and shear forces with hind limb suspension occur in opposite directions in the upper and lower extremities. These studies have not been repeated in female rats, and nothing like this has been performed in humans of either gender. Since humans are bipedal, bed rest would greatly reduce transmural pressures and shear forces in the legs, but not the arms. If vessel-remo deling follows the patterns in humans as in the rats, large changes could occur; this might contribute to orthostatic hypotension after bed rest. Accordingly, the study will repeat the vascular measurements mentioned above in both upper and lo wer extremities before and after bed rest and relate the findings to the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. Deliverables: The initial product is space normal data on gender diffe rences with regards to orthostatic intolerance. This information will be used to update the cardiovascular standard to include orthostatic intolerance. If the results indicate that a gender-specific countermeasure is needed, ground-based countermeasure studies will be solicited. When the development is complete the countermeasure will be vali dated on the ISS and delivered to mission operations. Data gathered from all activities will be fed into lunar surface studies. Required Delivery Milestone : FY2020 - countermeasure delivery required for long duration exploration missions. Required Platforms: Initially this study requires the bed rest ground analog to microgravity. If a gender-based countermeasure is indicated, the countermeasure will be evaluated in the bed rest microgravity analog and the countermeasure will be validated for flight using the ISS. Th is is a bed rest study to quantify gender-specific changes in orthostatic intolerance. If a gender-specific countermeasure is required, it will be developed in bed rest and validated on board the ISS. This ISS is required as the Mars transit analog. # of Subjects Initial Upmass (kg) Upmass (kg/subject) is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study None; this is a ground-based study HRP-47065 SRPE Research Planning input to HRP IRP- Revision FY09 324 Task : (EC) Evaluation of Compression Garments as Countermeasures to Orthostatic Intolerance The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of JOBST\u00ae custom compression garments to prevent orthostatic intolerance and to compare the JOBST\u00ae garment with the Anti-Gravity Suit (AGS) at 1 \"click\" (0.5 psi). Post-spaceflight plasma volume loss contributes, in part, to the development of orthostatic intolerance. Thus, we are modeling this phenomenon by using a hypovolemia regimen, developed in the Cardiovascular Laboratory, which produces plasma volume losses that are similar to those that occur following spaceflight. This study will compare the outcome of orthostatic challenges (head-up tilt test) conducted in hypovolemic subjects in three conditions: 1) no countermeasure, 2) AGS countermeasure (1-click or ~25mmHg) and 3) JOBST \u00ae custom compression garment countermeasure (g radient pressure with a higher amount of compre ssion at feet (~55mmHg) than at thigh (~8mmHg) with an aver age of 25mmHg over the length of the garment). Deliverables: The product from this task is to provide mission operations of requirements for g-suit design. Required Delivery Milestone : ASAP - requirements for g-suit design. Required Platforms: This is a ground-based study utilizing the hypovolemia model. Task: (Space Medicine) Evaluation of Jobst Gradient Compression Garments as a Countermeasure to Post-Spaceflight Orthostatic Intolerance Five male crewmembers from STS-122 participated in a 10-min, 80 head-up tilt after a 13-day mission. On landing day, February 20, 2008, each crewmember donned a pair of Jobst compression garments prior to tilt. Tilt test data obtained from STS-122 crewmembers (47 \u00b1 2 yrs, 180 \u00b1 2 cm, 86 \u00b1 5 kg) were compared with nine male crewmembers who participated in te n-minute post-spaceflight medical opera tional tilts since NASA's Return to Flight mission (STS-114) on July 26, 2005. Deliverables: This task is evaluating Jobst pressure garments on crewmembers. Required Delivery Milestone : FY2020 - countermeasure delivery required for long duration exploration missions.

It was a heritage NRA that did not provide any deliverables for exploration missions. CV4: Is 1/6-g exposure protective of 1-g orthostatic tolerance? It is unknown if the partial gravity found on the lunar surface will be protective of orthos tatic intolerance. A lunar analog should be developed to determine any protective effects.

Resource allocation and technology developm ent must be performed to ensure that the limited mass, volume, power, and crew training time be effi ciently utilized to provide the broadest possible treatment capability. This allocation must also cons ider that not all medical conditions are treatable, given the limited resources, and some cases may go untreated. Operational Relevance and Risk Context NPD 8900.3G - The immediate and long-term responsibilities of NASA with regard to the human space flight program require that the Agency provide medical and dental care, observation, and study to astronauts, payload specialists, and other space flight participants while on activ e duty with NASA. This care, observation (to include health monitoring) and study will be provided, utilizing the best current guidelines for the clinical practice of medicine and dentistry, and will be comprehensive in scope as applicable to the NASA mission. It will encomp ass all aspects related to the mission, including certification and training, and will include all space flight mission phases (pre-, in-, and post-flight). Strategy for Addressing Risk and Gaps To address this broad risk, the ExMC has broken it do wn into seven categories that correspond with the seven requirements allocated to the ExMC from the HRP Program Requirements Document (PRD). Each of the seven categories is then anal yzed individually to determine where gaps exist in satisfying the PRD requirements. Below are the seven categories into wh ich the risk has been separated and an explanation of the strategy for addressing the different categories of gaps. 1.0 Validate Standards : The NASA HQ OCHMO standard that pertain to this risk are Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for sta ndards, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determin es gaps in knowledge in the curr ent Crew Selection and Retention Criteria. Tasks are then identified to close those knowledge gaps. 2.0 Quantify the Risk: Because of the limited available operational and research data, incidence rates and outcomes for relevant medical conditions have la rge uncertainties associated with them. The Space Medicine Exploration Condition List is analyzed to determine gaps in our knowledge about medical conditions' incidence rates and outcomes in spaceflight . Tasks are then assigned to further study, model and use analog population data to be tter quantify the medical conditions. 3.0 Mitigate the Risk: Gaps in this section deal with our knowledge about effective training and telementoring programs for Exploration missions. The Space Medicine Medical Operations Lead for training, working with the ExMC Element Scientist, determines gaps in knowledge and techniques for developing future crew, flight surgeon and biomed ical ground controller training and telementoring programs. Tasks are then identified to close those knowledge gaps. 4.0 Monitor and Treat the Unmitigated Risk: Based on the Space Medicine Exploration Condition List, each condition is analyzed for each Conste llation Design Reference Mission (DRM) for the capabilities required to monitor and treat the condition. An analysis is performed to determine where gaps exist in current technologies or where efficiencies could be realized in the future. Based on when a technology comes online, either a technology watch is implemented or a technology development project is initiated to deliver the tec hnology to enable the mission. HRP-47065 330 5.0 Provide Enabling Capabilities: Provide data integration and mana gement for HRP to ensure proper handling of data (e.g., Life Sciences Data Archive, Mission Extended Medical Enterprise). Gaps exist where these capabilities are either insufficient or incomplete. 6.0 Comply with Agency Standards: Follow best practices and programmatic guidelines as levied by the HRP PRD. There are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. 7.0 Reduce Resource Requirements: Wherever possible, reduce in-flight and funding resources. There are currently no gaps associated with this requirement. Gaps ExMC 1.01: Inadequate and/or immature information on medical screening technology for the identification of clinical and sub-clinical pathology Tasks: (NASA JSC & NSBRI - Directed Study) Science and technology watch for medical screening technology Identification of technologies and the medical conditions for which additional preflight medical screening has been validated Deliverables: Updates to Medical Standards Working Group Required Delivery Milestone : N/A Required Platforms : Ground based ExMC 1.02: Inadequate information on genetic screening technology Tasks: (NASA JSC & NSBRI - Directed Study) Science and technology watch for genetic screening methodology to inform future implementation The Space Medicine Exploration Condition List will be an alyzed to determine if some conditions are suitable candidates to be mitigated preflight by genetic screening. Deliverables: Updates to Medical Standards Working Group Required Delivery Milestone : N/A Required Platforms : Ground based ExMC 1.03: Inadequate informa tion on the individual susceptibility to hypobaric environments (e.g., 7.2- psi lunar habitat) Tasks: (NASA JSC & NSBRI - Directed Study) Data Mining/Identification of characteristics associated with susceptibility to hypobaric environments For Exploration environments where crewmembers will be exposed to months of reduced oxygen partial pressure (e.g., 7.2-psi lunar habitat), this st udy will search to identify and charact erize physiological parameters that indicate susceptibility to hypobaric environments to ideally create a Spaceflight Human Health Standard. Deliverables: Individual Susceptibility to Hypobaric Environments Standard 9/01/2015 Required Delivery Milestone : Initial Crew Selection for Lunar Missions (2017) Required Platforms : Ground based ExMC 2.01: Lack of knowledge about incidence rates, probabilities and consequences relative to LOC/LOM for the medical conditions on the Exploration Medical Condition List HRP-47065 331 Description: One of the major gaps of knowledge w ith space medicine is quantification of likelihood and consequence of medical conditions that could occur in spaceflight. Total combined duration of human spaceflight is brief and limited. So the body of medical evidence in which to quantify medical conditions is small when compared to terrestrial medicine body of evidence. The focus of this gap is to generate a list of medical conditions that are of concern for human spaceflight, and provide quantifiable data and ra tionale backing why the medical condition is of concern. Tasks: (NASA JSC - Directed Study) Integrated Medical Model Due to limited resource volume constraints of the mission designs (including volume, mass, power, crew time, and crew skills), only the most important medical equipment will be stored onboard the space vehicles to diagnose and treat illnesses or injuries. In addition, crew-training time pre-flight is limited to those medical procedures most likely to occur. Because the astronauts are not likely to be trained medical clinicians, their skill level must be considered in the treatment of medical procedures. The likelihood of patient medical conditions occurring along with the required resources (including those listed above) to diagnose and treat the conditions must be analyzed to determine the level of risk to the astronauts in a quantitative manner. This allows management tradeoffs between resources and acceptable risk levels for various mission scenarios. The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) is a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) simulation to provide this quantitative risk assessment. Deliverables: Integrated Medical Model v2.0 9/30/2009 Required Delivery Milestone : N/A Required Platforms : Ground based Tasks: (NASA GRC - Directed Study) Integrated Medical Model (GRC simulations) To enhance the IMM's capability to adequately foreca st medical events of concern, but where supporting information on the rate of occurrence is lacking, development of external simulation modules is used. The external modules integrate more complete knowledge of external and internal contributors to the event to estimate the rate of event occurrence during the exploration class missions simulated in the IMM. Conditions to be modeled require a higher level of fidelity and include thos e where insufficient space flight data is available and there is no clear correlation to a terre strial analog. Additionally, medical events with multiple influencing factors, including gravitationally dependent physics, physiological changes during the mission, specific mission demands, vehicle limitations, crew reaction to criti cal events and interaction of these factors, can also be included in these models as deemed necessary to produce a simulation wi th adequate accuracy. The results of this analysis contribute significantly to the IMM's ability to forecast diagnoses and treatment outcomes of an ill or injured crewmember. Medical events to be model are selected based on the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Project identified gaps and prioritized through consensus of the IMM team (JSC, Wyle, GRC) with concurrence from the ExMC Element Manager and Element Scientist,. The cu rrent task includes four specific subject areas: 1. Bone (Hip) Fracture during EVA 2. Sleep Disturbance requiring medical intervention 3. Back pain/Lumbar Disk damage 4. Altitude Sickness requiring medical intervention Additional subject areas are added as required by the project during regular content reviews. The diverse nature of the topic areas requires interactio n with subject matter expert s (SME) at JSC, NSBRI, and the external medical community. As part of this task, at least one SME is identified and consulted within each topic area throughout the development of the model to ensure that the most pertinent data is used in the simulation and that the simulation concept is acceptable to obtain the needed information. Although no direct dependency on work in other projects exists, this modeling scheme does allow for integration of new information as it becomes available from these other projects such as Digital Astronaut.

Deliverables: Final report 3/30/2009 Required Delivery Milestone : Required Platforms : Ground based ExMC 3.02: Lack of knowledge about the stat e of the art in telementoring/telemedicine Description: Telementoring is the delivery of training and mentoring services across telecommunication networks typically in the format of audio and video. As a subset modality of telemedicine, telementoring is focu sed on providing a means to train operators with the instructor physically located in a remote location. Based on the type of training content, the presentation format may vary. Various formats includ e teleconference, video conference, or web exchange. Due to the relative novelty of this form of communication, telementoring has only recently started to gain momentum as a means to guide and train remote opera tors. As such, effective means to communicate and techniques to convey information are consta ntly under development. This gap is focused on understanding the latest on telementoring technolo gies and techniques as well as media platform on which the information is presented. Tasks: (NASA JSC:IBMP - Directed) Braslet (Duncan) Methodologies and data will be created by the internatio nal team of experts that could result in significant new knowledge and capability, enhancing important areas of oper ational space medicine such as clinical management of volume shifts induced by altered gravity, clinical diagnostic ultrasound in space flight, and telemedicine. Completion of this project w ill enable further investigatio ns of steady-state space card iovascular physiology in long-duration space flight. This i nvestigation will develop and validate appropriate methodology for studying cardiovascular responses to disturbances (for example, gravity change, volume overload, hemorrhage and others) using existing ISS resources. Future use of this met hodology will yield valuable physiological and operational data for planning and support of missions to the moon and other remote destinations. Deliverables: Validation of novel volume status measurement t echniques, expanded telemedicine processes, and recommendations for forward work 5/31/2009 Final Report 5/31/2010 Required Delivery Milestone : Required Platforms : ISS HRP-47065 333 Tasks: (Henry Ford Health System; NASA JSC-NRA) Ultrasound Diagnosis of Fracture (Dulchavsky) Crewmembers on long duration space missions are at significant risk of decreased bone strength despite countermeasures. The radiographic capabilities of fu ture spacecraft are unknown; however, ultrasound is currently operational on the ISS. Preliminary investig ations have shown that ultrasound can reliably diagnose long bone fractures. This proposal w ill evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound in the diagnosis of bony fractures and develop \"just in time\" training methods to allow astronauts to perform and interpret skeletal ultrasound to answer the specific aims: 1. Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for bony fractures and fracture healing in ground-based studies. 2. Develop CMO training programs to facilitate skeletal ultrasound to exclude fracture. 3. Develop remote guidance training programs for the ground cadre.

The procedures themselves are developed and validated on the ground. The burden is placed on the crewmember to be able to collect, analyze, and interpret data to decide which procedure decision pathway to follow. This can be an issue with medical procedures as the crewmembers often are not clinicians. They are given minimal medical training often months prior to the start of their mission. HRP-47065 334 This gap focuses on reducing the burden of medical data analysis and decision making on the crewmember. An autonomous medical procedure s ystem would assist the crewmember in analyzing and interpreting the medical data collected so th at the proper decision pathways are followed. Tasks: (NASA JSC - Directed) Advanced Integrated Clinical System - Guided Medical Procedure System Due to the limited medical skills and training of the cr ew, techniques to help the crewmembers perform medical procedures will be required. This will reduce the time required to perfor m the procedure, allow the crew to refresh their training skills during the mission, and provide the crew with audio and visual information to guide them through the procedure efficiently. This has the possibility to develop into a decision support system. This directed study will help form the requirements and solicitation for future competed efforts.

Due to the normal constraints of spaceflight, most common clinical diagnostic techniques will not be available during exploration missions. That is esp ecially true for imaging diagnostics. Although physicians commonly use X-rays, Magnetic Reso nance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and other techniques, perhaps only ultrasound may be compatib le with spaceflight. Flight surgeons have also requested improved imaging hardware operating in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to acquire digital images of skin and body orifices. Work under this gap will initially focus on identifying spaceflight medical conditions where imagi ng-based diagnosis and/or treatment is required, developing an evidence base for determining whic h technologies are required, and assessing the spaceflight readiness of the identified technologies. Once the appropriate technologies are identified and readiness determined, the integration lead will develop a plan to not only integrate the technologies to the greatest extent possible, but also the groups working on those technologies. Those groups incl ude GRC, JSC, and ARC, as well as the NSBRI. The integration lead will also identify relevant wo rk being performed with non-NASA funding and leverage NASA work with those efforts. HRP-47065 335 Tasks: (NASA JSC: NSBRI) Ultrasound Catalog for Autonomous Medical Care Develop an intuitive ultrasound image cataloging system, which incorporates ground acquired ultrasound whole body images.

Deliverables: Final report 3/31/2009 Required Delivery Milestone : N/A Required Platforms : Ground Based ExMC 4.04: Lack of smart hardware for ventilation with variable oxygenation capability that mitigates localized oxygen build up. Description: The proper and adequate operation of a ventilation device and variable oxygen delivery is a skill that takes many hours of training. The Crew Medical Officers (CMO) on CxP missions will more than likely be given very limited medical tr aining overall and even more limited training on ventilation and variable oxygen delivery. The training opportunities to teach the CMO on how to operate a ventilator will not be adequate enough to provide terrestrial standard of care during a medical contingency. The purpose of this Gap is to develop hardware th at can assist the caregiver in decision support involved with operating a ventilator and variable oxyg en delivery device. The entire smart system will also need to minimize volume, mass, and power cons umption. By developing a smart hardware system, this reduces the cognitive burden on the CMO to operate the ventilator thereby reducing the risk of inadequately trained operator. The smart hardware can manage the ventilation of the patient while the CMO can be freed to perform other medical tasks. This also allows CMO training to focus their limited resources on other aspects of their CMO trai ning for tasks that technology cannot overcome. Tasks: (NASA JSC - Directed) Lightweight Trauma Module (ISSP funded) There has been an ongoing partnership with military and industry stakeholders to develop autonomous medical capabilities. AICS projects have included the Lightw eight Trauma Module (LTM) and O2 concentrator requirements research.

Deliverables: Final report 9/30/2009 Required Delivery Milestone : Orion Medical Kits SRR (08/01/2010) Required Platforms : Ground Based Tasks: (NASA GRC - Directed) Medical Oxygen Fire Safety Medical treatment during both ISS and exploration missions may require oxygen therapy. Current hardware increases the oxygen content within th e cabin, thus increasing the fire hazard. Therefore, ExMC is partnering with DoD to develop and deploy a device that processes cabin air to increase the local oxygen content. While that makes the cabin safer, the locali zed concentration may still be a fire h azard, particularly given the lack of convection and weak conduction present in spacecraft. This work will rigorously assess the risk associated with oxygen concentrator therapy in an exploration environment. Deliverables: Final report 11/1/2009 Required Delivery Milestone : Orion Medical Kits SRR (08/01/2010) Required Platforms : None ExMC 4.05 - Lack of minimally invasive in-flight laboratory capabilities with limited consumables required for diagnosing identified Exploration Medical Conditions. Description: Exploration Medical Conditions requiring this capability are: TBD at a FY09 workshop. Analyzing bodily fluids (urine, blood, saliva) on the lunar surface will reduce launch/return mass/volume and provide the data near real-time in lie u of post-flight results. A system to perform this analysis in flight is necessary to meet these requir ements. NASA has conducted several trade studies analyzing hardware available and developed an Excel- based tool to quantify the ability of hardware to meet mission requirements. To reduce system mass and volume, NASA is investigating developing concepts and hardware for reusable systems of this type. Such miniaturized systems are dependent upon space medical standards and requirements that will be determined based on expert opinion, risk assessments and evidence bases. These standards and requirements are critical for engineering and medi cally qualifying the appropriate system for remote space applications. Since no in-situ medical diag nostic device that involves blood or urine fluid analysis is currently operational, it will be important to establish that such a device may be operated routinely. In addition to microfluidic processing sy stems, non-invasive monitori ng devices may also be considered.

NASA has conduc ted several trade studies an alyzing hardware available and developed an Excel-based tool to quantify the ability of hardware to meet mission requirements. To reduce system mass and volume, beginning with the FY 2007 SBIR call and the FY2008 budget year, NASA will begin developing concepts and hardware for reusable systems of this type.

Deliverables: Engineering prototype 9/30/2011 Required Delivery Milestone : N/A Ground based; Micro-gravity flights HRP-47065 339 ExMC 4.06: Lack of capability to stabilize and treat bone fractures Description: Bone mineral loss occurs in microgravity due to unloading of the skeletal system, with average loss rates of approximately 1% per month. It is unclear whether this bone mineral density will stabilize at a lower level, or continue to diminish. It is also unknown if fractional gravity, present on the moon and Mars would mitigate the loss. This level of bone loss does not create an unacceptable risk of fractures for ISS missions, but longer missi ons could create higher fracture risk (excerpt from the IRP). Current casting methods are problematic for the antic ipated operation environment during lunar short and long missions. Modifying existing casting methods or identifying a new technology for casting will be essential to meet this gap.

Standard terrestrial therapeutic response to treating sprains and strains is to provide cold compress or heat treatment to the affected area. Cold compress and/or heat treatment is desired that can be stowed in its inactive state in the vehicle's ambient environment, activated to provide the desired therapeutic relief, recharged using available vehicle resources, and restowed in its inactive state for future use.

It is currently funded by the JSC Innovative Partnership Program office. It was not selected or reviewed by ExMC or HRP, but does address a gap for the Lunar Outpost DRM. The lightweight, handheld microwave device to be devel oped will consist of a focusing antenna capable of killing bacteria implicated in tooth decay, cu ring proprietary composites for tooth repair and reconstruction as well as killing diseased pulpal tissue (root canal) without harmi ng the healthy tooth and surrounding gum tissue. This technology uses either C-band or Ka -band microwave energy radiated through a specifically designed antenna to sharply focus the beam.

During periodic IVA activities, the flight surgeons need the ability to monitor key physiological signals that indicate the crew's workload and other physiologic parameters. The current system for donning the sensors is time consuming and inconvenient, requiring shaving, application of electrodes, and signal checks. A more efficient system will save crew time a nd reduce the overhead of stowing additional supplies. This system will be achieved through the integration of small, easy to use biomedical sensors that will have the ability to measure, store and transmit physiologic parameters during operational and ambulatory scenarios. Such a system would also provide a wealth of data for the medical and research communities. Coordination with the HHC element for an overall medical and rese arch biomedical sensing plan will occur.

Because of the large volume of data, a data management infrastructure needs to be deployed to allow users access to the data. The system needs to be available, secure, and ensure data integrity. This way users can gain valuable insight into health and safety of the crew to maintain their health status and ensure mission success. Tasks: (NASA JSC - Direct ed/Infrastructure) Mission Medical Information System Incorporate medically relevant information into a database system for use in operations as well as for research support. The data sources to be incorporated include MRID's as well as other mission data. Currently the data resides on an FTP server, in flight surgeon files, some in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), and some in the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health (LSAH) database. Structured data sources such as the EMR and LSAH will not be duplicated, but rather joined. Effort refocused to get data into structured form first and then work on data entry at the point of collection. Effort is co-funded 50/50 with Crew Health and Safety.

Better record keeping of medication use, efficacy, and side effects will be instituted and th ose records will provide evidence for or against this risk. If medications are found to be ineffective, research will be performed to determine if drug metabolism is affected by space flight. Studies to de termine if space flight affects drug stability are currently underway. Context of Risk for Exploration Better recordkeeping of medication use, efficacy, and si de effects should be instituted. This will provide evidence for or and should be a precursor to a formal assessment of PK/PD on orbit. It is thought that the reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) mo tility and function, offered as the first piece of evidence for this gap, is not an issue after the first few days of flight. In general, SD avoids prescrib ing oral medications during this period of the mission. It is not known to what extent different volumes of distribution might be a factor in flight. Drugs selected for the PK/PD studi es should be commonly used, have few side effects, and different metabolic pathways. External consultants should be used to determine which drugs to test and to design testing protocols. SD needs to de velop a process and procedures to track systematically crew medication use, including subjective comments on effi cacy and side effects, particularly for ISS. It is particularly important to know what pharma ceuticals are taken prior to in-flight tasks. Strategy for Mitigation The overarching strategy for this risk is to obtain better record keeping of medication use, efficacy, and side effects. This includes several data mining tasks that will provide evidence for or against this risk. If there is evidence indicating ineffectiveness of medications, a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study will be performed in flight to obtain further information. Gaps PH6: Can a standard procedure for prospective an alyses of drugs to be considered for flight and periodic analyses of drugs that are used for flight be developed? A Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee should be formed. PH10: What are the performance effects of in-flight drugs on exercise, orthos tatic tolerance, motor control, cognitive function, etc? Much of this information is ava ilable in the literature and should be synthesized. New studies should be undertaken only when there is no existing data or the existing information is not relevant. This effort should be cross-disciplinary and should be the simplest monitoring techniques possible to identify performance issues. CV6: What influence does in-flight medication use have on physical and cognitive performance? This has not systematically documented. Much of this information is available in the literature and should be synthesized. New studies should be undert aken only when there is no existing data or the existing information is not relevant. This effort should be cross-disciplinary and should employ the simplest monitoring techniques possible to identify performance issues.

PH7: What are the effects of spaceflight on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics? Subjective reporting indicates that many drugs are effective in flight. There has been little documentation of the ineffectiveness of drugs. Better recordkeeping of medication use, efficacy and side effects should be instituted. This will provide evidence for or agains t this gap, and should be a precursor to a formal assessment of PK/PD on orbit. It was thought that the reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) motility and function, offered as the first piece of evidence for this gap, was not an issue after the first few days of flight.

Task: (NxPCM - via NRA) Bioavailability and Performance effects of Promethazine (PMZ) during spaceflight Promethazine is currently given to treat motion sickness during Shuttle missions . The side effects associated with PMZ include dizziness, drowsiness, sedation, and impaired psychomotor performance. Anecdotal reports from crewmembers indicate that these central nervous system side effects of PMZ ar e absent or greatly attenuated in microgravity. Recent reviews of medical debriefs indi cate that, at least in some crewmembers, there are significant central nervous system depr essant effects. In addition, the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of medications administered in microgravity may be different from on Earth, which could significantly alter drug efficacy, as well as, the severity of si de effects for a given dosage. This study will systematically evaluate PMZ bioavailability, effects on performance, si de effects, and efficacy in the treatm ent of motion sickness to determine optimal dosage and best route of administration of PMZ in flight.

In order to begin determining the lunar gravity's effects on human physiology, a ground- based analog should be developed. HHC2: How does 1/6-g and 3/8-g influence countermeasures? It is unknown how the lunar and Martian gravities will affect current spaceflight countermeasures. Utilizing a ground analog for different gravities, the gravitational effects can be measured. Tasks: (FAP - via directed study) Lunar Analog Bed Rest Development This study is for the development of a lunar analog. These lunar mission simulations may or may not include (~3 day) transit phases between Earth and Moon. While it may be useful to simulate some impacts of (7-14 day) sortie missions, the primary focus will be on longer, ou tpost missions; thus, simulation durations will generally range up to 90 days.

We propose to study the time course of the fluid shifts and plasma volume losses experienced during a simulated trip to, and extended habitation on, the Moon. Additionally, we propose to evaluate the effect of this volume change on cardiac function using newer preload-independent echocardiographic techniques. By acquiring daily measurements during the transitional phases of changing gravitational levels, we plan to validate the current computational model and further quantify the crew hea lth and performance risks associated with extended duration missions to the Moon and other partial Earth gravity environments.

In addition, the effectiveness of an exercise-countermeasure throughout bed rest, on ex pected thermal and cardiovascular alterations, will be investigated. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) prolonged LABR impairs exercise-thermoregulation, 2) prolonged LABR reduces exercise capacity and augments cardiovascular strain during exercise-heat stress, and 3) an exercise-countermeasure throughout LABR will preser ve thermoregulatory responses and exercise capacity associated with LABR.
