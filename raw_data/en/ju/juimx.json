Acupuncture has been around for centuries, but has become increasingly popular over the last few years as alternative health care and now plays a major part in the health and wellness world. Acupuncture is extremely relaxing and is very rarely painful. The needles are very tiny and stimulate the body's own systems to regulate and help restore proper function. It has been shown to help problems as varied as seasonal allergies, joint and muscle pain, sleep disorders, headaches, digestive disorders, depression and anxiety, sciatica, and addictive behaviors as well. The ancient theory behind acupuncture's effectiveness is that it helps to align the body's natural energy flow and promote better health. It makes sense for chiropractors to offer acupuncture as a complimentary service to help naturally balance all of the body's systems. There are certain protocols that are used in acupuncture to help with addictive behaviors such as eating/food addiction. This can greatly help with weight loss and problems with overeating or emotional eating. To re-center the brain through corrective acupuncture, the mind should be able to calm down those excessive thought processes that are going on unchecked. Depression and anxiety can also play into these problems. So the \"weight loss\" protocol for an acupuncture treatment includes points to help with those feelings as well. It is a very well rounded treatment, and can have great benefits if the patient is in a motivated state of mind when they start treating. Usually a clean eating diet is recommended at the same time to act as a supportive measure, and to encourage the patient through this time of changing eating behaviors to lose weight and manage addiction to food/eating. Depending on the practitioner, the scheduling of acupuncture treatments can vary, but one example would be 8-12 sessions over the course of 3 weeks during the clean eating period, then 3-6 supportive sessions after other foods are re-introduced into the diet. The \"side effects\" from food addiction acupuncture are: fewer cravings, more energy and feeling full faster. It also helps patients make better choices when eating and feeling more energized to stay active during the program. "}
