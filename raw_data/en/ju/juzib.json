The warning advisory at Lacamas Lake also remains in place. Public Health has been monitoring harmful algal blooms at Vancouver Lake since early July. Results from water samples taken from Vancouver Lake on Monday revealed cyanotoxins above the threshold levels recommended by the Washington Department of Health. Warning signs are being placed at public access points at the lake. Public Health issued a warning advisory for Lacamas Lake on July 7. Results from water samples taken from Lacamas Lake on Monday indicated toxin levels remain elevated at the lake. Cyanotoxins can be harmful to people, especially young children, and deadly for small pets that drink the water. Health officials recommend: - No swimming or water skiing. - No water contact for animals. - Avoiding areas of scum when using motorized boats, paddle boarding, kayaking or canoeing. - No drinking lake water. - Cleaning fish well and discarding organs. Public Health will continue to monitor Vancouver and Lacamas lakes and, while blooms are present, take weekly water samples to test toxin levels. Signs will be updated as conditions change. Harmful algal blooms can pose a significant health risk if the cyanobacteria or toxins are ingested, inhaled or contact skin. Inhaled bacteria or toxins could cause wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Skin contact could lead to rash, itching, blisters and eye irritation. If water with cyanotoxins is accidentally swallowed, symptoms could include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, numbness of the lips, tingling in fingers and toes, and dizziness.
