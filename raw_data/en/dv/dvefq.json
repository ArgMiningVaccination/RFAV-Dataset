[2] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka II. Map of the area 1 1 In January 2009 the Government of Sri Lanka (GS L) declared the first no fire zone (NFZ 1), a 22 square mile area, as a civilian safe zone into which the government would not fire weapons. This was communicated to citizens in the region through leaflet drops and messages to International Committee of t he Red Cross (ICRC) personnel. As the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) continued its advance and took control of towns previously under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the LTTE retreated, accompanied by tens of thousands of civilians to an eight square mile area which the GSL established as NFZ 2. By early May 2009 LTTE cadres and civilians shifted to the largely unprotected one square mile area in the south of second NFZ, between the Bay of Bengal and NanthiKadal Lagoon (NFZ 3) . [3] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka III. Executive Summary This report is submitted pursuant to the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Supplemental Appropr iations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111 -32), which directed the Secretary of State to submit a report detailing incidents during the recent conflict in Sri Lanka that may constitute violations of international humanitarian law or crimes against humanity, and, to the extent practicable, identif ying the parties responsi ble. The alleged incidents set forth herein occurred in the context of the final months of an armed conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) , which has been listed as a terrorist organization by the United States since 1997. While the conflict lasted intermittently for 25 years, this report focuses on incidents that occurred from January 2009, when fighting intensified, through the end of May 2009, when Sri Lankan government forces defeated the LTTE. It does not provide, nor is it intended to be, a comprehensive portrayal of the conflict. The United States recognizes a state's inherent right to defend itself from armed attacks, including those by non -state actors such as terrorist groups. The United States also expects states and non -state actors to comply with their international legal obligations. This report compiles alleged incidents that transpired in the final stages of the war , which may constitute violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) or crimes against humanity and related harms. The report does not reach legal conclusions as to whether the incidents described herein actually constitute violations of IHL, crimes against humanity or other violations of international law . Nor does it reach conclusions conce rning whether the alleged incidents detailed herein actually occurred . The report addresses the following categories of incidents: Children in armed conflict \u2014According to reports, on numerous occasions during the January to May 2009 reporting period the LTTE took both male and female children, some as young as 12, to join LTTE cadres. Harm to c ivilian s and civilian objects \u2014The State Department has not received casualty estimates covering the entire reporting period; s ources alleged that a significant number of deaths and injuries incurred at the time of attack were likely never recorded. Senior Sri Lankan officials made repeated public statements denying that the GSL was shelling the NFZ or targeting hospitals and was not responsible for any civilian casualties. However, sources alleged that the majority of shelling in the NFZ was from GSL forces. The GSL announced that it would observe a 48 -hour ceasefire on two occasions. The stated aim of these was to allow civil ians to move [4] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka into areas in which they would not be subject to shelling. Incident reports suggest, however, that the GSL may have begun shelling before the end of the second 48 -hour ceasefire. Reports also indicated that the LTTE forcibly prevented the es cape of IDPs and used them as human shields. Killing of captives or combatants seeking to surrender \u2014A number of sources alleged that the GSL committed unlawful killings. Multiple reports alleged that in the final few days of fighting, senior LTTE leaders contacted international representatives in an effort to broker a surrender but were killed after they allegedly reached a surrender agreement with the GSL. Disappearances \u2014According to reports, GSL forces or GSL -supported paramilitaries abducted and in some instances then killed Tamil civilians, particularly children and young men. Sources reported that th ese individuals were taken to undisclosed locations without any further information being provided to relatives. IDP checkpoints and camps were alleged to be particularly vulnerable areas, with a heavy military presence hinder ing the ability of internatio nal organizations to conduct protection monitoring and confidential IDP interviews . Humanitarian conditions \u2014Reports include instances of severe food shortages; malnutrition, particularly among the very young and old; as well as surgeries being performed wi th little or no anesthetic. The GSL pledged to provide sufficient food and medical supplies to people in IDP camps and to those trapped in the NFZ. However, most reports point to significant gaps between food, medicine, and clean water needs and the avai lable supplies in the NFZ and IDP camps. [5] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka IV. Background This report is submitted pursuant to the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Supplemental Appropr iations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111 -32), which provides: The conferees direct the Secretary of State to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations not later than 45 days after enactment of this act detailing incidents during the recent conflict in Sri Lanka that may constitute violations of internationa l humanitarian law or crimes against humanity, and, to the extent practicable, identifying the parties responsible.2 In accordance with further congressional direction, this report focuses on reports of alleged incidents and conduct which may constitute v iolations of IHL and/or crimes against humanity occurring d uring a period of especially intensive fighting, from January through May 2009. In the interest of creating a fuller picture of the circumstances of the conflict, the report also includes other re lated harms against civilians, including possible abuses of human rights. Context of the Conflict The period covered by this report marked the culmination of a protracted armed conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL), which is dominated by ethnic Sinhalese,3 and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a terrorist organization that campaign ed for a homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka for the country's minority Tamils. While relations between the two major ethnic groups have been marked by tensions since the country became independent in 1948 ,4 separatist violence emerged later. One of the earliest reported battles between t he LTTE , which was formed in 1976 under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhaka ran, and government forces occurred in 1983, when the LTTE ambush ed 13 GSL soldiers. This incident spark ed anti-Tamil riots in which an estimated several hundred to several thousand Tamils were killed . The ensuing conflict, which occurred intermittently over the next 2 5 years, resulted in the deaths of over 2 The d eadline for this report was extended by mutual agreement between the Department of State and the Committees. 3 According to a 2001 census, 82% of Sri Lankans are Sinhalese and approximately 9.4% are Tamil. 4 Following the colonial period, which was charact erized by perceived British favoritism toward Tamils , the Sinhalese majority government enacted a series of nationalistic laws, one of which made Sinhala the official language in 1956. That same year m ore than 100 Tamils were killed in widespread violence after Tamil parliamentarians protest ed the new laws. A law enacted in 1972 made Buddhism the nation's primary religion . Most Tamils are Hindu . [6] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka 70,000 Sri Lankans, both Sinhalese and Tamil, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. Over the course of the conflict the LTTE waged an insurgent campaign against the Sri Lankan state in the course of which the insurgents carried out hundreds of suicide attacks and bomb ed public buildings , transportation hubs, Buddh ist temples and other locations. In 1997 , the LTTE was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State , and is believed to be t he only terrorist group to have assassinate d two world leaders - President Ranasinghe Premadas a of Sri Lanka in 1993 and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India in 1991 . During this 25-year period, the GSL and paramili tary groups allegedly aligned with the government were at various points accused of killings and disappearances, use of child soldiers , arbitrary arrests and detention, denial of fair public trial, and infringement of freedom of movement , all of which appeared to be disproportionately directed toward the Tamil minority . With the conflict now over, more than 280,000 Sri Lankans who fled their homes in the conflict zone during or in the aftermath of the conflict are internally displaced persons (IDPs) . The vast majority are still in IDP camps and are denied the freedom to leave those camps ( Appendix B, photo 1 ). In statements, the GSL has justif ied the continual denial of IDPs' freedom of movement as necessary while the government screens for LTTE comba tants. The GSL has not allowed international organizations or journalists to have unrestricted access to the IDP camps, which has made it difficult to have an accurate picture of events and conditions. Some IDPs have reported that they have been unable t o confirm the whereabouts of injured persons who were evacuated from the battleground and taken into custody by GSL forces. Legal Framework While this report does not reach legal conclusions, an overview of relevant international law may be a useful foundation for reviewing the alleged conduct described herein . The United States recognizes a state's inherent right to defend itself from armed attacks, including those by non -state actors such as terrorist groups . In the context of a non -international armed conflict (that is, an armed conflict that is not between states) , such as the recently ended conflict in Sri Lanka, common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 provides basic treatment protections to all [7] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka individuals not taking part in hostili ties, including civilians and detained members of the armed forces. 5 Its core requirements are that individuals not taking part in hostilities must be treated humanely and without adverse distinction based on race, religion, or similar criteria. To th is end, the Article prohibits murder; cruel treatment; torture; the taking of hostages; outrages upon personal dignity; and the passing of sentences without judgment by a court providing recognized judicial guarantees. Sri Lanka is neither a party nor a s ignatory to the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, which includes more detailed rules relevant to non - international conflicts than those set forth in common article 3. The customary laws of war also require all parties to a conflict to co mply with the principles of distinction and proportionality in the conduct of hostilities. The principle of distinction holds that civilian s and civilian objects (such as hospitals and schools) are generally immune from direct attack, though civilians lose this immunity if they take direct part in hostilities. The principle of proportionality prohibits attacks that may cause incidental loss of life, injury or damage to civilians that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. The civilian population must not be used to shield military objectives or operations from attack, and parties must take all practicable precautions , taking into account military and humanitarian considerations, to minimize incidental death, injury and damage to civilians. Crimes against humanity are certain offenses committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population with knowledge of the attack . Specific acts of crimes against humanity include murder ; extermination ; torture ; rape; persecution ; enforced disappearance; and other inhumane acts, when committ ed as part of a widespread or sys tematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of that attack . The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal 5 Common article 3 provides, in part: In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisi ons: (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed ' hors de combat ' by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanel y, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above -mentioned persons: (a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; (b) taking of hostages; (c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; (d) the pas sing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. (2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. [8] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) reflect g enerally accepted definitions of crimes against humanity.6 In addition to allegations of incidents that may constitute violations of IHL and/or crimes against humanity, and in our efforts to collect as much pertinent information as possible, we received reports regarding other alleged harms against civilians , including incidents that could constitute human rights abuses . These incidents are included in the report in the interest of provid ing a sense of the broad range of harms civilians allegedly suffered from January to May 2009. The GSL has undertaken human rights obligations by ratifying various treaties. The se include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment (CAT), the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the Optional Protocol to the Conventio n on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (CRC OP). The ICCPR recognizes specific civil and political rights of individuals and related obligations of states parties, including the right to freedom of expression, the rig ht to liberty and security of person, and the right to liberty of movement. During a time of publicly proclaimed public emergency that threatens the life of the nation, the ICCPR allow s states parties to suspend some of the ir obligations under the Covenan t to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, color, sex, language , religion or social origin . In 2000 the GSL filed a notice with the United Nations (UN) that purported to derogat e from ICCPR articles relating to the duty to inform those arrested of the reasons for their arrest and to bring those charged with a criminal offense promptly before a judicial officer, the right to liberty of movement, minimum due process guarantees for criminal trials, protection against arbitrary/unlawful interference with privacy, freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, and f reedom 6 For example, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines crimes against humanity as any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the att ack: (a) Murder; (b) Extermination; (c) Enslavement; (d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population; (e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law; (f) Torture; (g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity; (h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious , gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; (i) Enforced disappea rance of persons; (j) The crime of apartheid; (k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health. [9] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka of association. The GSL has not filed formal derogations with respect to any of the other human rights treaties to which it is party. Methodology The State Department consulted a wide range of primary and secondary sources in gathering informatio n for this report . These sources includ e internal USG reporting and subject matter experts, primarily from the State Department; foreign governments; international organizations; media reports; non -governmental organizations; and eyewitnesses. Information concerning t he majority of incidents cited in this report originated in first-hand accounts communicated by persons from within the government -declared No Fire Zone s (NFZ s) and locations close to the fighting. Some o rganizations are identified by name if they have publicly released specific al legations while others, including foreign governments, UN agencies, and individual sources, are identified in more general terms to preserve confidentiality. Limitations There were a number of limitations on the State Department's ability to collect an d corroborate information. Both the GSL and LTTE denied press, foreign governments, and other organizations unrestricted access to the conflict zone, IDP screening points, IDP camps, and potential eyewitnesses to alleged incidents. It was extremely diffi cult, if not impossible, to move freely in all areas and without the presence of government or LTTE soldiers. There are allegations that GSL restrictions on access were part of a systematic attempt to hide violations of IHL and human rights abuses. Some governments and organizations that were contacted during the preparation of this report indicated that they have additional information that may pertain to relevant incidents but were unwilling to provide it at this time for a variety of reasons, including fears for the safety of their sources . Since at least March of 2008, the GSL placed strict restrictions on the ability of national and international media to travel to and report on events within the conflict zone and IDP camps. Some organizations all ege that w hen journalists did write articles or produce television reports on the conflict that were critical of GSL actions , their reporting resulted in their being detained or expelled from Sri Lanka . One such journalist is J.S. Tissainayagam , who has been detained since March 2008 on charges alleged to be politically motivated . In August 2009 Tissainayagam was sentenced to 20 years in prison on charges under the Emergency Regulations and the Prevention of Terrorism Act . Other journalists have receiv ed death threats which they attribute to the GSL. These threats are not [10] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka idle, as was shown by the murder of prominent newspaper editor Lasantha Wickramatunga in January 2009. President Rajapaksa publicly called Wickramatunga a personal friend and ordered a swift and thorough investigation. Nevertheless, many journalists, including Wickramatunga's wife, have elected to leave the country. In discussions with the State Department, organizations indicated that journalists who remain in Sri Lanka are concern ed for their safety and practic e self-censorship, which may have further limited the information available for this report. Numerous commercial imagery -based reports issued by UN agencies and non-governmental organizations identified evidence of shelling in the NFZ . U.S. government sources are unable to attribute the reported damage to either the Government of Sri Lanka or LTTE forces. Sandy soil conditions in the NFZ and the emerging monsoon season resulting in increasing cloud cover further complicated efforts to monitor the conflict with commercial and USG sources. Such limitations preclude the kind of testing and corroboration of evidence that would be necessary to evaluate whether the allegations presented are factually supported and/or would constitute violations of international law. Such legal analysis requires comprehensive and detailed information about the context of specific incidents that was unavailable here. For example, a determination about whether particular conduct would amount to a crime against humanity requires an assessment of the purpose and intent of government sponsored or sanctioned actions. In the context of civilian casualties, an analysis of whether particular military operations were conducted consistent with the laws of war would require an understanding of who committed the harms and the knowledge and intent of those actors when the operations were conducted, as well as information regarding whether apparently civilian persons were actually taking direct part in hostilities or civilian objects were being used to contribute effectively to military actions. In conclusion, there were significant limitations on the State Department's ability to collect and assess information . [11] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka V. Children in Armed Conflict For many years there have been reports that the LTTE forcibly recruited children into its cadres. 7 According to reports of the incidents noted below , on numerous occasions during the January to May 2009 reporting period the LTTE took both male and female chi ldren , some as young as 12 , to join LTTE cadres . In some instances, sources allege d that when parents or children resisted they were beaten or killed. The children were trained to use weapons and sent to the front lines for fighting, cleaning weapons, and perform ing other chores for the LTTE . In its public statements, the GSL has consi stently indicated that it viewed child soldiers as victims rather than perpetrators, in line with international best practices. In close collaboration with UNICEF , the GSL has established centers where former child soldiers are receiving vocational and other training opportunities. As a state party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC OP) on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the GSL has an obligation to take all feasible measures to prevent recruitment an d use of those under 18 by armed groups that are distinct from armed forces of a state, including the adoption of legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalize such practices.8 Upon ratifying the CRC OP, the GSL declared its minimum age for volunta ry recruitment into the governmental armed forces as being 18. The GSL also has an obligation to take all feasible measures to ensure that persons within its jurisdiction recruited or used in hostilities contrary to the CRC OP are demobilized or otherwise released from service and, when necessary, to accord to such persons all appropriate assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and their social reintegration. The following allegations with respect to children and armed conflict during the reporting period have been reported: February 16 - An organization reported that the LTTE was attempting to recruit by force all boys and girls aged 14 years or older in the LTTE - controlled territory. 7 Government have also been accused of recruiting child soldiers. However, sources and organizations have not report ed such incidents during the January to May 2009 time period. Reports suggest that the GSL has recently made significant pro gress in obtaining the release of child soldiers originally recruited by paramilitary allies in the eastern region of the island. 8 We note also that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court considers c onscripting or enlisting children under t he age of 15 years into armed forces or groups or using them to participate actively in hostilities a serious violation of the law of armed conflict . [12] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka February 23 - Several o rganization s reported to Embas sy Colombo that their sources reported ongoing LTTE forced recruitment of children . Another source stated that a young person who resisted being forcibly recruited had both his arms broken by the LTTE as punishment. March 3 - An organization received a report from a source in the NFZ that the LTTE was recruiting children as young as 12 -years -old. March 7 - An organization report ed that a source in Mullaittivu witnessed the LTTE abduction of children ages 12 to 16. The source saw the LTTE marching many c hildren away . March 16 - An organization 's source in Mullaittivu reported that those recruit ed by the LTTE included male and female children as young as 14. March 17 - A Human Rights Watch (HRW) source in the Vanni reported that an angry mob formed followi ng the death of two children caused by an LTTE recruitment unit. In a similar story, t he nationalist daily newspaper Island reported that LTTE cadres shot the parents of a child whom they made an abortive bid to abduct, and then shot the child. This incident sparked violent protests by the civilians, who forced the cadres to retreat. Embassy Colombo noted that this report is consistent with earlier information regarding retaliation against the LTTE by civilians in the NFZ . March 18 - A source who escaped the conflict zone reported that anyone aged 12 or older was eligible for forced labor and recruitment by the LTTE. March 21 -24 - HRW sources in the conflict zone reported that the LTTE rounded up over 400 youths who had sought refuge in Valaiganar Catholic Church , and immediately took the children to training camps by bus. A similar account was reported by a nother organization's local source on March 23 ; this source estimated the number of youths taken at over 250 . March 23 - An organization received a report from a local source that the LTTE was recruiting children aged 12. March 23 - Organizations with sources in the conflict zone provided to Embassy Colombo some details on communications from the NFZ, including reports that the LTTE forcibly re cruited individuals, including children, and kill ed those who resist ed orders. They note d that for the LTTE, age is not an issue anymore for recruitment/building defenses. [13] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka March - A source reported that the LTTE forcibly recruited people regardless of g ender or age, including those in the ir early teens. Parents and relatives who resist ed such recruitment were insulted, beaten or even killed. March - A source in Mullaittivu reported to HRW that the 16 -year-old daughter of a colleague was forcibly recruit ed along with three adults. March - On May 5 the Sydney Morning Herald reported an account of a 14 - year-old girl who was abducted by the LTTE in March and forced to undergo military training. She performed drills using dummy weapons in preparation for battle and, as with many female recruits, her hair was cut short. The girl's mother was able to smuggle her out of the LTTE camp and they were able to escape to the camp in Vavuniya. The Herald quoted Major -General Jagath Dias of the Army's 57th Division saying that his men had been fighting girls as young as 11: It's very difficult [to shoot at children] but when someone has a weapon and is firing it at you, it doesn't matter what age, you have to shoot. Brigadier Shavendra Silva of the 58th division9 told the Herald that most of the LTTE cadres captured since April 23 were between 11 and 18 -years -old. There were many young girls aged 13 and 14. All of them had short hair. ... They don't have the numbers of fighters they need so they conscript civil ians forcefully. April 16 - The BBC reporte d that IDPs evacuated from the safe zone confirmed reports of child recruitment by the LTTE. April 25 - The Guardian reported that the LTTE gave guns to children as young as 12 and forced them to fight on the fro nt lines alongside LTTE cadres . Those forcibly recruited included the 16 -year-old daughter of a n organization staffer in the NFZ . An organization's spokesman said there had been reports of clashes on the beaches between LTTE members and families who had tried to prevent their children being taken. Some of those who resisted reportedly were beaten or shot. April - An organization reported the abduction of a 12 -year-old boy from Kovilkulam in mid -April. An LTTE press gang came to his home in the NFZ. Two of the boy's elder brothers fled upon seeing the LTTE cadres . But the press gang caught the 12-year-old and took him away . The boy's father stayed behind and somehow got his son and escaped to Vavuniya a few days later. 9 For a more detailed display of the locations of Sri Lankan military divisions, see the Battle Progres s Map on the Ministry of Defense website, http://www.defence.lk/orbat/Default.asp . [14] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka April - A foreign government reported the account of a 17 -year-old girl who was forcibly recruited in Mattalan. The LTTE police came with some cadres to take her. Her mother argued with the police and tried to stop them, telling them that the girl was only 17. When the mother resisted, the cadres beat her with sticks while the girl was taken away. The girl managed to escape with a friend four nights later. April - The May 3 edition of the New Indian Express ran the account of a woman who had recently escaped from the NF Z. She witnessed the LTTE's capture of some 600 teenagers who were hiding in a Valayanmadam church in April. The article quoted her as saying, People had gathered there to hide from the army shelling, and also from the Tigers who were trying to recruit youngsters. But one day the Tigers arrived in 12 vehicles, firing their guns in the air, and forcibly took away around 600 girls and boys who had been hiding in the church. They were screaming and crying, but we were helpless. [15] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka VI. Harms to Civilians and Civilian Objects The State Department has not received casualty estimates covering the entire reporting period from January to May 2009 . However, o ne organization, which did not differentiate between civilians and LTTE cadres, recorded 6,710 people killed and 15,102 people injured between January 20 to April 20 .10 These numbers were presented with a caveat, supported by other sources, that the numbers actually killed and injured are probably higher . This is because the majority of casualty statistics were based upon the deaths of people transferred to medical facilities or reported by eyewitnesses to attacks. Sources alleged that a significant number of deaths and injuries incurred at the time of an atta ck were likely never recorded. During the reporting period, senior Sri Lankan officials made repeated public statements denying that the GSL was shelling the NFZ or targeting hospitals and was not responsible for any civilian casualties. However, sources alleged that the majority of shelling in the NFZ was from GSL forces. The GSL announced that it would observe a 48 -hour ceasefire on two occasions. The stated aim of these was to allow civilians to move into areas in which they would not be subject to shelling. Incident reports suggest, however, that th e GSL may have begun shelling before the end of the second 48 -hour ceasefire. Reports also indicated that the LTTE forcibly prevented the escape of IDPs and used them as human shields. In all armed conflicts, IHL requires that combat operations be con ducted in accordance with the principles of distinction and proportionality. The law of war principle of distinction requires parties to the conflict to distinguish between military and civilian objects and prohibit s the intentional targeting of the civilian population as such , including individual civilians. The law recognizes, however, that civilians taking direct part in hostilit ies lose their immunity from attack . In addition, while certain objects, such as schools, are presumed to be civilian o bjects, they are not immune from direct attack if they are being used in a way that makes an effective contribution to military action and if their destruction might accordingly offer a definite military advantage. The principle of proportionality requi res that parties to a conflict refrain from attacks on military objectives that would clearly result in collateral civilian casualties disproportionate to the expected military advantage. Accordingly, some level of collateral damage to civilians - however regrettable - may be incurred lawfully if consistent with proportionality considerations. All parties to a conflict 10 Estimates for April 20 through May were not available to the State Department as of the release of this report . [16] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka must take all practicable precautions, taking into account both military and humanitarian considerations, in the conduct of military opera tions to minimize incidental death, injury, and damage to civilians and civilian objects. The following allegations of civilian casualties and harm to civilian objects have been reported: January January 2 - A foreign government reported that civilian s were killed due to heavy shelling at the Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital. January 2 - A foreign government reported that aerial bombing of a petrol station and bus depot 250 meters from Mullaittivu General Hospital killed four people and injured eight . Janua ry 8 - A source in the conflict zone reported to HRW that five people were killed and at least 15 injured by shelling in Thevipuram and Vaddakachchi. January 8 - HRW reported that at 1:20 p.m. shells hit Tharmapuram Junction 75 meters from the Tharmapuram Hospital , killing seven people. January 12 - A source in the NFZ reported that artillery shells fell into the premises of Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital at around 10 :00 a.m., injuring two patients. January 13 - HRW reported that at 10 :00 a.m. Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital was hit by shells killing one person and wounding six, and that patients fled the wards to seek shelter from the shelling. According to satellite imagery taken on January 28, the Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital did not appear to show visible damage and appeared to be functioning . (See Appendix B, image 1.) January 15 - An HRW source in the conflict zone reported shelling in Udayarkattu, Visuamadu, and Puthukkudiyiruppu . Six people were injured close to the assistant government agent's office in Put hukkudiyiruppu. January 16 - A source in the conflict zone reported to HRW that the SLA was advancing from both sides ; heavy shelling was causing many casualties.

May 18 - Embassy Colombo, as well as press and foreign governments , received reports that LTTE political leaders Nadesan and Puleedevan, along with other LTTE leaders, were killed while surrendering to GSL forces.

[47] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka VIII. Disappearances Organizations and sources alleged that GSL forces or GSL -supported paramilitaries abducted and in some instances then killed Tamil civilians, particularly children and young men. Sources reported that the se individuals were taken to undisclosed locations without any further information being provided to relatives. IDP checkpoints and camps were alleged to be particularly vulnerable areas, with a heavy military presence hinder ing the ability of internation al organizations to conduct protection monitoring and confidential IDP interviews.11 While applicable provisions of IHL do not address disappearances in detail, the United States supports the principles that families have a right to know the fate of their relatives and that each party to a conflict should search areas under its control for persons reported missing when circumstances permit, and at the latest from the end of active hostilities. The Rome Statute of the ICC recognizes that enforced disappear ances of persons may constitute a crime against humanity when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack . Article 9(1) of the ICCPR provides that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person ; no one shall be subjected t o arbitrary arrest or detention ; and n o one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure s as are established by law. Article 10 of the ICCPR states that [a]ll persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. Further, Article 16 of the ICCPR provid es that [e]veryone shall have the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. The following allegations of disappearances have been reported: February 3 - One woman in an IDP camp reported to an organization that when she was crossing the Omanthai check point with her husband and child, her husband was detained there by GSL forces. As of a week later, she had no information about him. February 8 - A source told HRW that she was approached by about 50 families whose relatives had been detained at Omanthai checkpoint by GSL forces in previous days. Neither the families nor the source had any information as to the whereabouts of the detainees. 11 As is common in the aftermath of armed conflict, there ha ve been reports that organizations had located some of the people previously believed to have disappeared during the conflict . [48] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka February 11 - A source in the Vavuniya IDP camps told HRW that during the week of February 2 the military separated 70 to 80 young people from their families at Omanthai checkpoint and detained them. Two days later, many of the young people were brought to the IDP camps, yet the fate of others remained unknown. The source said that at least two mothers approached her saying their children had gone missing. February 12 - Embassy Colombo sources reported that some IDPs said that their sons were taken away by the Sri Lankan military at IDP screening centers. February 23 - An organization 's local source s reported that at night young girls would be taken out from the IDP camps in Vavuniya and never return ed. Due to death threats , most of these events were never reported to the camp authorities . April 24 - An organization reported that the SLA was separating people into small groups of 10 -12 for screening before the civilians reach ed the official IDP screening center. Only three to five members of each of the smaller groups later returned to the larger group. The local staff did not know what happened to the remaining people in the screened groups . April 27 - Embassy Colombo received a report that buses were taking all boys and men between 14 and 35 from two schools in Vavuniya. Th e men and boys were told that they were being taken under the Prevention of Terrorism Act to a police station for screening. However, the young men reportedly had not turned up at any police station, and their location was unknown to the reporting organization . May 10 - An eyewitness who escaped the NFZ reported to HRW that a boy was held back by the Sri Lankan military while his family passed through Omanthai checkpoint. May - A foreign government reported two separate accounts of disappearances in May. The first is the account of a 15 -year-old girl who was injured in May and taken by the SLA for treatment. The second is the account of a man carrying his three children out of the conflict area . The SLA took the children to an unknown hospital . As of June 2 the whereabouts of the children involved in both accounts remained unknown. May 21 - According to sources in Manik Farms, many newly -arrived IDPs reported being separated from their children at the Omanthai screening point in Vavuniya District. [49] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka May - Numerous organizations, including t he Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldier s, reported that children were being abducted from IDP camps and from Vavuniya by government -supported paramilitary groups who enjoy tacit support from the GSL. [50] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka IX. Humanitarian Conditions The GSL pledged to provide sufficient food and medical supplies to pe ople in IDP camps and to those people still trapped in the NFZ. On February 17, the Senior Presidential Advisor announced a commitment to provide 80 -100 metric tons (MT) of food per day to civilians, and that medicine would be included in the next shipment of supplies . In early March the GSL Presidential Secretariat issued a statement saying that there had been no case of any citizen in the north of Sri Lanka dying from starvation and that the GSL would take all measures to prevent such a tragic oc currence.12 Later that month the Minister of Health Care and Nutrition stated that the GSL continued to send enough medical and essential food supplies and won't stop sending medical and food supplies despite the possibility that the LTTE was confiscatin g supplies for its own cadres.13 However, while some incidents reported in this section cite deliveries of up to 500 MT of foodstuffs to the NFZ, the majority point to significant gap s between food, medicine, and clean water needs and the available suppl ies in the NFZ and IDP camps. These reports include instances of severe food shortages , malnutrition, particularly among the very young and old, as well as surgeries being performed with little or no anesthetic. (See Appendix A, photo 9.)

International humanitarian law recognizes that relief organizations may offer their services in relation to victims of armed conflict, and the United States 12 On March 20, t he government -owned Tamil Daily quoted the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights , Mahinda S amarasingh e, who claimed that the GSL provided sufficient food and medicine for the trapped population. He further claimed that reports concering shortages of medicines were LTTE propaganda. 13 In an interview with the AFP on February 24, the Sri Lankan Defen se Secretary accused the LTTE of taking part of the food and medicine sent for civilians. [51] Report to Congress on Incidents During the Recent Conflict in Sri Lanka supports the principle that, subject to the requirem ents of imperative military necessity, impartial relief actions necessary for the survival of the civilian population should be permitted and encouraged. The GSL, as a party to the International Convention on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) , also has an obligation to take steps to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights in the ICESCR, and has recognized that these rights will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Potentially r elevant rights in the ICESCR include the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. As a state party, the GSL has recognized the right of everyone to be free from hunger, and is required to take measures, including specific programs, which are needed to, inter alia, ensure an equitable distribution of world foo d supplies in relation to need. As a state party, the GSL has also recognized that everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and that one step to be taken to achieve full realization of this right is the creation of conditions that would assure medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness. The following allegations in which civilians may have been deprived of food and medical supplies have been report ed: January 30 - An organization confirmed to Embassy Colombo that a 14- truck convoy organized by the Government Agent of Mullaittivu reached Puthukkudiyiruppu with approximately 179 MTs of food.
