Regarding vaccine mandates, Senator Marshall said in part, \"This is another example of big government socialism. The swamp is about to get deeper, and they are going to use OSHA to enforce their unconstitutional vaccine mandates. We are doing everything we can to stop it. This is a slap in the face of hardworking Americans - people that were heroes just a few months ago and now this government wants to separate them from the job by forcing them to make a choice between the jab or the job. This is an unconstitutional mandate. Just a little commonsense knows that it's morally wrong to separate soldiers from the military and our heroes from the hospitals all the while we are on the downswing of another wave... When is this government going to take into account natural immunity?\" Background: Senator Marshall has been leading the fight in the U.S. Senate to halt President Biden's vaccine mandate and to get the Administration to recognize the importance natural immunity. Last week, he led a letter with several Republican Senators pledging to oppose ALL efforts to implement and enforce Joe Biden's vaccine mandate particularly on upcoming spending measures considered by the U.S. Senate.

In October, following numerous roundtable discussions in Kansas City, Topeka, and Wichita with union workers who are literally faced with the decision of job or jab, Senator Marshall requested leaders of the Senate [HELP](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021-10-25-HELP-Committee-Vaccine-Mandate-Labor-Unions.pdf), [Agriculture](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Ag-Hearing-Request-RE-Unions-Vaccines-10.27.21.pdf), [Small Business](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/10.27.21-Letter-to-Cardin-and-Paul-on-Vaccine-Mandates.pdf), and [Energy](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/10.26.21-ENR-Committee-Vaccine-Mandate-Hearing.pdf) Committees to hold hearings with Kansas union workers to discuss the vaccine mandates. These workers are at risk of losing their jobs over the mandate and in turn further exacerbating the labor shortage and supply chain crisis, and further stifling economic recovery.

In September, Senator Marshall spoke on the Senate floor about [an amendment](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Marshall-Amendment-to-Stop-Vaccine-Mandate.pdf) he offered to the government spending package to prohibit funding for implementing or enforcing the Biden Administration's COVID vaccine mandate on private companies. All [50 Senate Republicans](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/574721-senate-defeats-gop-amendment-to-block-biden-vaccine-mandate) supported Senator Marshall's amendment.

Senator Marshall introduced the [COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-bill-prohibits-dishonorable-discharge-for-unvaccinated-servicemembers/)to prohibit the Department of Defense from giving servicemembers a dishonorable discharge for choosing not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Senators Marshall, Kevin Cramer (ND), Rick Scott (FL), and Roger Wicker (MI), along with First Liberty Institute general counsel Mike Berry - an attorney representing dozens of Navy Seals fighting the vaccine mandate - held a press conference to discuss [their efforts](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/HEY21B23-2.pdf) to halt President Joe Biden from dishonorably discharging servicemembers for choosing to not get the COVID vaccine.

In opposition to Biden's vaccine mandate on businesses, Senator Marshall joined his colleagues in demanding a [Congressional Review](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/in-opposition-to-biden-vaccine-mandate-sen-marshall-demands-congressional-review/) of President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate on private employees before it goes into effect and oppose this unlawful, unnecessary federal command. Senator Marshall joined his colleagues to introduce the [Prevent Unconstitutional Vaccine Mandates for Interstate Commerce Act](https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/29/senate-republicans-legislation-block-federal-agencies-proof-vaccination/). As the Biden Administration is working to enforce vaccine mandates for businesses merely seeking to engage in interstate commerce, the legislation would protect the privacy of Americans' personal health information and prohibit the Department of Transportation and other federal agencies from requiring proof of vaccination or the use of a vaccine passport for such activities. Senator Marshall helped introduce the [Keeping Our COVID-19 Heroes Employed Act](https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/services/files/064573B4-225E-4383-9D34-ED625BACD341) to save essential workers from being fired due to President Biden's sweeping vaccine mandate. Senator Marshall questioned U.S. Department of Labor Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training nominee Jose Javier Rodriguez recently on how he plans to handle the upcoming spike in unemployment rates caused by President Biden's vaccine mandate.

Senator Marshall [penned an op-ed](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/564616-advancing-t-cell-testing-can-help-parents-can-make-informed) for The Hill, highlighting the importance of T-cell testing and natural immunity research in helping parents make informed decisions on COVID-19 vaccinations. Senator Marshall [led a letter](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/press-releases/sen-marshall-leads-doc-caucus-letter-urging-cdc-to-acknowledge-covid-19-natural-immunity/) with 14 other health care providers in Congress to the CDC urging the agency to acknowledge natural immunity from COVID-19. The letter also urges the CDC to work with other federal agencies to ensure all future policies and federally-funded research take into account "}
