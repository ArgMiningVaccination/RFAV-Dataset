The Committees also draw the Commission's attention to the new or emerging problems whic h may pose an actual or potential threat. They are: the Scientific Co mmittee on Consumer Safety (S CCS), the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) and the Scientific Co mmittee on Emerging and Newly Identified Heal th Risks (SCENIHR). In addition, the Commission reli es upon the work of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Medici nes Agency (EMA), the Euro pean Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). SCENIHR This Committee deals with questions related to emerging or newly identified health and environmental risks and on broad, complex or multidisciplinary issues requiring a comprehensive assessment of risks to consum er safety or public health and related issues not covered by other Community risk assessment bodies. Ex amples of potential areas of activity include potentia l risks associated with interact ion of risk factors, synergic effects, cumulative effects, antimicrobia l resistance, new technologies such as nanotechnologies, medical devices including those incorporating substances of animal and/or human origin, tissue engineering, blood products, fertility reduction, cancer of endocrine organs, physical hazards such as no ise and electromagnetic fields (from mobile phones, transmitters and electronically controlled home environments), and methodologies for assessing new risks. It may also be invite d to address risks related to public health determinants an d non-transmissible diseases.

In addition, biophysical interaction mechanisms and th e potential role of co-exposures to environmental stressors are discussed. Exposure Human exposure to electromagnetic fields (E MF) comes from many different sources and occurs in various situations in everyday life. Man-made static fields are mainly found in occupational settings, such as close to MRI scanners, although DC high-voltage overhead transmission lines are being constructed, whic h are expected to expose larger parts of the population to static elec tric and magnetic fields. EMF in the extremely low frequency (ELF) ra nge are ubiquitous. The main sources of these fields pertaining to the general public are in-house installations, household appliances and powerlines. In recent years, attention has also be en directed towards people living next to electric power transformers installed inside residential buildings. It appears that long-term exposure to ELF magn etic field of these people can extent to several tenths of T. Today, for power regulation most modern elec trical equipment uses electronics instead of transformers. Examples includ e the switched power supplies to laptops, drilling tools, chargers of mobile phones and similar device s. As a consequence, the frequency content of the daily magnetic field exposure has ch anged mainly by adding odd harmonics. In particular, the third harmonic (150 Hz) has be come another dominating frequency in our environment. In the household, more appliances have appe ared in the intermediate frequencies (IF) range. An important source of exposure in this frequency range is induction hobs, which have become popular in recent years. Thes e can expose their users (both members of the general public and professi onals) to IF magnetic fields higher than the reference levels of exposure guidelines. In the radio frequency (RF range), by far the most applications which emit EMF are in the frequency range above 100 kHz up to some GHz. Multiple sources exist that contribute to an individual's exposure. Howeve r, transmitters in close vicinity to or on the body have become the main sources of exposure for the general population and professionals. Distance to the source is the main determin ant of exposure, together with emitted power and duty factor. In particular for brain tissues, the mobile ph one used at the ear re mains the main source of exposure. However, since th e first generation of mobile telephony, the technology aimed at reducing the emitte d power of mobile handsets. Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) phones are an other source of everyday exposure. Smart-phones, which operate within networks of different technologies, as well as other portable wireless devices, like tablets and lapt op computers, increased the complexity of the user's exposure and changed the exposed body region. Due to the different sources used next to the body, it is important to take into account multiple exposures for risk assessment, which may also re quire organ-specific dosimetry. This issue is also important for occupational exposure, since th ere may be situations, such as working in an MRI suite, where professionals are expo sed simultaneously to EMF of multiple frequencies ranges, different temporal variations and field strengths. The environmental exposure from sources is dominated by broadcasting antennas, antennas from private and governmental telecommunication services and mobile communications base stations. Historical data from spot measurement campaigns and Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 5 continuous radiation monitoring systems indi cate that the introduction of new mobile telecommunication technologies after the deployment of the GSM and UMTS systems did not substantially change the average levels of EMF in the environmen t. At the same time, other technologies, like digital broadcasting, have in some regions contributed to the reduction of EMF exposure from far field sources. The number of sources has increased indoors. The installation of a ccess points and short range base stations, such as 3G femtocells, WiFi hotspots and DECT devices, has given rise to exposure at very cl ose distances (within 1 m), wher eas farther away the emitted EMF does not exceed the common background levels. Consequently, the emitted EMF from these devices, even when combined, still results in a marginal exposure compared to reference levels of European and international guidelines. In general, it appears that, with respect to telecommunication applicatio ns, the technological trend is to use low- power emitters, closer to or on the hum an body, and at higher frequencies. Millimetre wave and THz applications are expected to be available soon in various industrial environments, such as for imaging systems used for non-destructive quality control, as well as for short-range broadband telecommunications. Currently, they do not significantly affect the averag e exposure of the general pub lic. These applications will operate with low power and, due to the small penetration depth of the radiation, expose only superficial tissues. Interaction mechanisms Several interaction mechanisms are well established. These enable extrapolation of scientific results to the enti re frequency range and wide-b and health risk assessment. They have been used to form ulate guidelines limiting expo sures to EMF in the entire frequency range from static fields to 300G Hz. A number of studies proposed other candidate mechanisms. However, none that op erates in humans at levels of exposure found in the everyday enviro nment has been firmly iden tified and experimentally validated nor do they enable concluding on potential health risks at other exposure conditions both with regard to amplitude and/or frequency. Health effects from THz fields The number of studies investigating potential biological, non-thermal effects of THz fields is small, but has been increasing over recent years due to the availability of adequate sources and detectors. In vivo studies indicate mainly bene ficial effects on disorders of intravascular components of microcirculation in rats under immobiliz ation stress, but do not address acute and chronic toxicity or carcinogenesis. In vitro studies on mammalian ce lls differ greatly with respect to irradiation conditions and endpoints under investigation. There are studies suggesting health effects of exposure, but these have not been replicated. Some theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, but there is no experi mental evidence for them. Considering the expected increase in use of THz technologies, more research focusing on the effe cts on skin (long-term, low-le vel exposure) and cornea (high- intensity, short-term exposure) is recommended. Health effects from Radiofrequency (RF) EMF Overall, the epidemiological studies on mobile phone RF EMF exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumours. Furthermore, they do not in dicate an increased risk for other cancers of the head and neck region. Some studies raised questions regarding an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neur oma in heavy users of mobile phones. The results of cohort and incidence time trend st udies do not support an increased risk for glioma while the possibility of an association with acou stic neuroma remains open. Epidemiological studies do not indicate increased risk for other malignant diseases, including childhood cancer. The earlier described evidence that mobile phone RF EMF exposure may affect brain activities as reflected by EEG studies during wake and sleep is further substantiated by Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 6 the more recent studies. With regard to these findings, studies which aim at investigating the role of pulse modulation and which use more experimental signals, indicate that although effects on the sleep EEG are neither restricted to NREM sl eep (one study also indicates effects in REM sleep) nor to the spindle frequency range. It seems that depending on the EMF signal, th e theta and delta frequency range in NREM sleep can also be affected. Furthermore, half of the experi mental studies looking at the macrostructure of sleep (especially those with a longer duration of exposure) also found effects, which, however, are not consistent with regard to the affected sleep parameters. Therefore, given the variety of appl ied fields, duration of exposure, number of considered leads, and statistical methods it is presently not po ssible to derive more firm conclusions. For event-related potentials and slow brain oscillations, results are inconsistent. Furthermore, there is a lack of data for sp ecific age groups. One study indicates that children and adolescents seem to be less a ffected. The previous evidence that RF exposure may affect brain acti vity as reported by EEG studies during both wake and sleep appears also in recent studies. However, the relevance of the small physiological changes remains unclear and mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Overall, there is a lack of ev idence that mobile phone RF EMF affects cognitive functions in humans. Studies looking at possible effects of RF fields on cognitive function have often included multiple outcome measures. While effects have been found in individual studies, these have typically been observed only in a small number of endpoints, with little consistency between studies. Symptoms that are attributed by some people to various RF EMF exposure can sometimes cause serious impair ments to a person's quality of life. However, research conducted since the previous SCENIHR Opinion adds weight to the conclusion that RF EMF exposure is not causally linked to th ese symptoms. This applies to the general public, children and adolescents, and to people with idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF). Recent me ta-analyses of observational and provocation data support this conclusion. For symptoms triggered by short-term exposu re to RF fields (measured in minutes to hours), the consistent results from multiple double-blind experiments give a strong overall weight of evidence that such effects are not caused by RF exposure. For symptoms associated with longer-term ex posures (measured in days to months), the evidence from observational studies is broa dly consistent and weighs against a causal effect. However, it has gaps, most notably in terms of the objective monitoring of exposure. Human studies on neurological diseases an d symptoms show no clear effect, but the evidence is limited. The previous SCENIHR Opinion concluded th at there were no adverse effects on reproduction and development from RF fiel ds at non-thermal exposure levels. The inclusion of more recent human and animal data does not change this assessment. Human studies on child development and behavioural problems have conflicting results and methodological limitations. Therefore, the eviden ce of an effect is weak. Effects of exposure on foetuses from mother's mo bile phone use during pregnancy are not plausible owing to extremel y low foetal exposure. Studies on male fertility are of poor quality and provide little evidence. Health effects from Intermediate Frequency (IF) EMF There are few new studies on health effects from IF expo sures in general, and no epidemiological studies have been conducted in particular. Some in vivo studies report on the absence of effects on reproduction and de velopment of IF fields up to 0.2 mT in a frequency range of 20-60 kHz. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 7 As in the previous SCENIHR Opinion, there are still too few studies available, and furthermore no epidemiological studies have been conducted. In view of the expected increase of occupational exposure to IF, st udies on biomarkers an d health outcomes in workers are recommended. This could be su pplemented with expe rimental studies. Health effects from Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) EF and MF Overall, existing studies do not provide conv incing evidence for a causal relationship between ELF MF exposure an d self-reported symptoms. The new epidemiological studies are consistent with earlier findings of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 \u00b5T. As stated in the previous Opinions, no mechanisms have been identified and no support is existing from experimental studies that could explain these findings, which, together with shortcomings of the epidemiological studies prevent a causal interpretation. Studies investigating possible effects of ELF ex posure on the power spectra of the waking EEG are too heterogeneous with regard to applied fields, durati on of exposure, and number of considered leads, and statistica l methods to draw a sound conclusion. The same is true for behavioural outcomes and cortical excitability. Epidemiological studies do not provide convincing evidence of an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including de mentia, related to power frequency MF exposure. Furthermore, they show no evidence for adverse pregnancy outcomes in relation to ELF MF. The studies concerning childhood health outcomes in relation to maternal residential ELF MF exposure during pregnancy involve some methodological issues that need to be addr essed. They suggest implausi ble effects and need to be replicated independently before they can be used for risk assessment. Recent results do not show an effect of the ELF fields on the reproductive function in humans. Health effects from static magnetic fields (SMF) In most of the available in vitro studies, SMF above 30 T induced effects in the cellular endpoints investigated, although in some cases the effects were transient. Gene expression was affected in a ll studies, with predominantly up-regulated outcomes. These new studies are consistent with th e results of previous studies. A number of studies are reporting that effect s of SMF exposures o ccur in animals, at levels ranging from mT to T. However, since many of the findings are limited to single studies, they do not provide any fi rm foundation for risk assessment. Observational studies have shown that moveme nt in strong SMF may cause effects such as vertigo and nausea. These can be explai ned by established interaction mechanisms and are more likely to occur in fields abov e 2 T. The relevance of these effects for the health of personnel remains unclear. Health effects from combined EMF exposure The few available studies on combined exposure to different EMFs do not provide sufficient evidence for risk assessment. The studies reporting on effects on DNA integrity after an MRI investigation are clearly of interest to follow up. However, it is not clear which component of the complex EMF exposure during scanning may cause the effect: SMF, switched gradient MF or the pulsed RF EMF. Further studies on DNA integrit y and MRI exposure are needed, and the feasibility of cohort studies of MRI patients and occupationally ex posed personnel should be discussed. Health effects from co-exposure to environmental stressors Experimental results reported since the previo us opinion indicate that co-exposures to environmental stressors (such as physical or c h e m i c a l a g e n t s ) w i t h E L F o r R F l a c k consistency. Under the same conditions, effe cts might be increased, decreased or not Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 8 influenced at all and are not linked to specific experimental protocols. Due to the small number of available investigations and the large variety of protocols used (different chemical or physical treatments and different EMF exposure conditions), it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions. Therefore, the relevanc e of co-exposures to environmental stressors (such as physical or chemical agents) with ELF or RF to human health under real-life exposure conditions remains unclear.

In addition, biophysical interaction mechanisms and th e potential role of co-exposures to environmental stressors are discussed. Information has primarily been obtained from reports published in international peer- reviewed scientific journals in the English language. Additional sources of information have also been considered, including web-based information retrieval and documents from governmental bodies and authorities. SCHENIR 'Memorandum on the use of the scientific literature for human health risk assessment purposes - weighing of evidence and expression of uncertainty' 2012, was followed. Not all identified studies are necessarily included in the Opinion. On the contrary, a main task is to evaluate and assess the articles and the scientific weight that is to be given to each of them. Only studies that are considered relevant for the task are commented upon in the Opinion. Nevertheless, all identified studies are listed in the annex. A specific concern in the assessment of many studies is the descripti on of the exposure. This applies to experimental as well as to epidemiological studies. Over time, many studies have reported biological effects as a result of EMF exposu re. However, in many cases the description of the exposure is in sufficient for reproducing the experiment. Papers with poor description of essential da ta, such as the exposu re, are therefore of little or no value in risk evaluation and do not provide adequate knowledge about modes of actions. In the last few ye ars there have been a number of in vivo and in vitro studies dealing with exposure directly from a comme rcial mobile phone or other wireless device. In almost all cases these experiments are with out relevance, since they do not quantify the factual exposure. An epidemiological study should ideally ca pture all major sources of exposure as a function of time during the relevant time pe riod (considering latency) prior to occurrence of the outcome. The minimum requirem ent for exposure assessment for an epidemiological study to be informative is to include reasonably accurate individual exposure characterization over a relevant pe riod of time capturing all major sources of exposure for the pertinent part of the body . Valid exposure assessment makes it possible to distinguish between sub-grou ps with contrasting exposure levels. As EMF exposure is ubiquitous, it is difficult to find an unexposed reference group, and in stead, a quantitative contrast is chosen by comparing low versus high exposure levels. In general, personal exposimetry is regarded as the gold standard for assessment of current short-term exposure, because spot measurements may not adequately reflect long-term exposure. For studies on health risk s from EMF, depending on the investigated endpoint, the relevant time period for wh ich exposure data would be needed is a sufficiently long period, such as several years preceding the diagnosis of cancer. As a rule, retrospective exposure assessment is more challenging and prone to errors than estimation of concurrent exposures. Estimate s from study subjects are rarely a reliable source of information, due to potential erro rs in recall, particularly for case-control studies. More objective sources of inform ation should be used wherever possible. In research on health effects of EMF, the la ck of clearly focused working hypotheses for chosen biological endpo ints is accentuated by the lack of an established biological or biophysical mechanism of action at environmental exposure levels. This does not allow researchers to conclude on the most releva nt exposure parameter, and usually several alternative measures of exposu re are evaluated (for instan ce field strength, exposure Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 13 frequency, cumulative exposu re, time since first exposure etc.). In addition, some studies use multiple end-points which are equally prone to false positive results, without adequate statistical corrections. Good research practice requires that all hypotheses evaluated are clearly stated and that all results pertaining to them are reported. Selective reporting, with emphasis on significant findings that were not specified in advance, can mislead the assessment by ig noring the issue of multiple testing. Exposure Human exposure to EMF comes from many different sources and occurs in various situations in everyday life. Man-made static fields are mainly found in occupational settings, such as close to MRI scanners, alth ough DC high-voltage overhead transmission lines are being constructed, wh ich are expected to expose larger parts of the population to static electric and magnetic fields. EMF in the ELF range are ubiquitous. The main sources of these fields pertaining to the general public are in-house installations, household appliances and powerlines. In recent years, attention has also been directed towards people living next to electric power transformers installed inside residential buildings. It appears that long-term exposure to ELF magnetic field of these people can extent to several tenths of T. Today, for power regulation most modern elec trical equipment uses electronics instead of transformers. Examples includ e the switched power supplies to laptops, drilling tools, chargers of mobile phones and similar device s. As a consequence, the frequency content of the daily magnetic field exposure has changed mainly by adding odd harmonics (150 Hz, 250 Hz, 750 Hz, etc.). In particular, the third harmonic (150 Hz) has become another dominating frequency in our environment. In the household, more appliances have appe ared in the intermediate frequencies (IF) range. It was found that at close range, so me of them, including playthings, can exceed the reference levels set by exposure guidelines. An important source of exposure in this frequency range is induction hobs, which have become popular in recent years. These can expose their users (both members of the general public and professionals) to IF magnetic fields higher than th e reference levels of exposure guidelines, mainly due to the fact that their safety standard requires conf ormity at a distance of 0.3 m only, and does not account for all the different mode s and (worst case) use conditions. By far the most applications which emit EMF are in the frequency range above 100 kHz up to some GHz. Multiple sources exist that c o n t r i b u t e t o a n i n dividual's exposure. However, transmitters in close vicinity to or on the body have become the main sources of exposure for the general population and pr ofessionals. Distance to the source is the main determinant of exposure, together with emitted power and duty factor. In particular for brain tissues, the mobile ph one used at the ear re mains the main source of exposure. However, since th e first generation of mobile telephony, the technology aimed at reducing the emitted power of mobile handsets. In particular, for GSM systems, already the introduction of dynamic power co ntrol reduced the average output power to about 50% of its rated value during calls, wh ereas the use of discont inuous transmission (DTX) during voice calls gave a further 30% reduction in average emitted power. Adaptive power control became faster and more effective in the third-generation (3G) of mobile telephony systems leading to a fu rther reduction (by about two orders of magnitude) in the specific absorption Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR) compared to GSM phones. In addition, hands-free kits re duce the energy absorbed by the head drastically. DECT phones are another source of everyday exposure. Smart-phones, which operate within networks of different technologies, as well as other portable wireless devices, li ke tablets and laptop computer s, have added complexity to the user's exposure and changed the exposed body region. Due to the different sources used next to the body, it is important to take into account multiple exposure for risk assessment, which may also re quire organ-specific dosimetry. This issue is also important for occupational exposure, since th ere may be situations, such as working in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 14 an MRI suite, where professionals are expo sed simultaneously to EMF of multiple frequencies ranges, different temporal variations and field strengths. The exposure from environmental sources is dominated by broadcasting antennas, antennas from private and governmental telecommunication services and mobile communications base stations. It has been sh own that such system s have significantly increased the EMF levels in the urban envi ronment compared to the levels measured during the 1980's, when only analogue radio and television broadcas ting were present. However, historical data from spot meas urement campaigns and continuous radiation monitoring systems indicate that the intr oduction of new mobile telecommunication technologies after the deployment of the GSM and UMTS systems did not substantially change the average levels of EMF in th e environment. At the same time, other technologies, like digital broadc asting, have in some regions contributed to the reduction of EMF exposure from far field sources. The number of sources has increased indoors. The installation of a ccess points and short range base stations, such as 3G femtocells, WiFi hotspots and DECT devices, has given rise to exposure at very cl ose distances (within 1 m), wher eas farther away the emitted EMF does not exceed the common background levels.

These applications will operate with low power and, due to the small penetration depth of the radiation, expose only superficial tissues. Interaction mechanisms Several interactions mechanisms are well established. They allow extrapolation of scientific results to the enti re frequency range and wide-b and health risk assessment. They have been used to form ulate guidelines limiting expo sures to EMF in the entire frequency range from static fields to 300G Hz. A number of studies reported other candidate mechanisms. However, none that op erates in humans at levels of exposure found in the everyday enviro nment has been firmly iden tified and experimentally validated nor do they allow concluding on potential health risks at other exposure conditions both with regard to amplitude and/or frequency. Health effects from THz fields The number of studies investigating potential biological, non-thermal effects of THz fields is small, but has been increasing over recent years, due to the availability of adequate sources and detectors. In vivo studies indicate mainly bene ficial effects on disorders of intravascular components of microcirculation in rats under immobiliz ation stress, but do not address acute and chronic toxicity or carcinogenesis. In vitro studies on mammalian ce lls differ greatly with respect to irradiation conditions and endpoints under investigation. Studies suggesting effects of exposure have not been replic ated in independent laboratories. Some theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, but no conclusive experimental support is available. Considering the expected increa se in use of THz technologies , more research focusing on the effects on skin (long-term, low-level exposure) and cornea (high-intensity, short- term exposure) is recommended. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 15 Health effects from RF fields Overall, the epidemiological studies on mobile phone RF EMF exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumours. Furthermore, they do not in dicate an increased risk for other cancers of the head and neck region. Some studies raised questions regarding an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neur oma in heavy users of mobile phones. The results of cohort and incidence time trend st udies do not support an increased risk for glioma while the possibility of an association with acou stic neuroma remains open. Epidemiological studies do not indicate in creased risk for other malignant diseases including childhood cancer. A considerable number of well-performed in vivo studies using a wide variety of animal models have been mostly negative in outcome. A large number of in vitro studies pertaining to genotoxic as well as non-genotoxic end- points have been published since the last Opin ion. In most of the studies, no effects of exposure at non-thermal levels were repo rted, although in some cases DNA strand breaks and mitotic spindle di sturbances were observed. The earlier described evidence that RF exposu re may affect brain activities as reflected by EEG studies during wake and sleep is further substantiated by the more recent studies. With regard to these findings, studies which aim at investigating the role of pulse modulation and which use more experimental signals, indicate that although effects on the sleep EEG are neither restricted to NREM sleep (one study indica tes effects also in REM sleep) nor to the spindle frequency rang e. It seems that depending on the EMF signal the theta and delta frequency rang e in NREM sleep can also be affected. Furthermore, half of the experimental stud ies looking at the macrostructure of sleep (especially those with a longer duration of ex posure) also found effe cts, which, however, are not consistent with regard to the affe cted sleep parameters. Therefore, given the variety of applied fields, duration of exposure , number of considered leads, and statistical methods it is presently not possible to derive more fi rm conclusions. For event-related potentials and slow brain oscillations results are inconsistent. Furthermore, there is a lack of data for sp ecific age groups. One study indicates that children and adolescents seem to be less affect ed. Therefore, the previous evidence that RF exposure may affect brain activity as reported by EEG studies during both wake and sleep appears also in recent studies. However, the relevance of the small physiological changes remains unclear and mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Overall, there is a lack of evidence that RF EMF affects cognitive functions in humans. Studies looking at possible effect s of RF fields on cognitive function have often included multiple outcome measures. While effects have been found by individual studies, these have typically been observed only in a smal l number of endpoints, with little consistency between studies. Symptoms that are attributed by some peop le to RF EMF exposure can sometimes cause serious impairments to a person's quality of life. However, research conducted since the previous SCENIHR Opinion adds weight to the conclusion that RF EMF exposure is not causally linked to these symptoms. This applies to the general public, children and adolescents, and to people with idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF ). Recent meta-analyses of observational and provocation data support this conclusion. For symptoms triggered by short-term exposu re to RF fields (measured in minutes to hours), the consistent results from multiple double-blind experiments give a strong overall weight of evidence that such effects are not caused by RF exposure. For symptoms associated with longer-term ex posures (measured in days to months), the evidence from observational studies is broa dly consistent and weighs against a causal effect. However, it has gaps, most notably in terms of the objective monitoring of exposure. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 16 Human studies on neurological diseases an d symptoms show no clear effect, but the evidence is limited. The previous SCENIHR Opinion concluded th at there were no adverse effects on reproduction and development from RF fiel ds at non-thermal exposure levels. The inclusion of more recent human and animal data does not change this assessment. Human studies on child development and behavioural problems had conflicting results and methodological limitations. Therefore, the eviden ce of an effect is weak. Effects of exposure on foetuses from mother's mo bile phone use during pregnancy are not plausible owing to extremel y low foetal exposure. Studies on male fertility are of poor quality and provide little evidence. Health effects from IF fields There are few new studies on health effects from IF expo sures in general, and no epidemiological studies have been conducted in particular. Some in vivo studies report on the absence of effects on reproduction and de velopment of IF fields up to 0.2 mT in a frequency range of 20-60 kHz. In view of the expected increase of occupational exposure to IF EMF, studies on biomarkers and health outcomes in workers, which are based on reasonably sized groups with well-characterized exposure, would be informative. This could be supplemen ted with experime ntal studies. Health effects from ELF fields Overall, existing studies do not provide conv incing evidence for a causal relationship between ELF MF exposure an d self-reported symptoms. The new epidemiological studies are consistent with earlier findings of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 \u00b5T. As stated in the previous Opinions, no mechanisms have been identified and no support is existing from experimental studies that could explain these findings, which, together with shortcomings of the epidemiological studies prevent a causal interpretation. As concluded in the previous SCENIHR Opinio n, data suggest that ELF MF may induce both genotoxic and othe r biological effects in vitro at magnetic flux densities of about 100 T and higher. The mechanisms are not established and the relevance for a connection between ELF MF exposure and childhood leukaemia is unclear. Studies investigating possible effects of ELF ex posure on the power spectra of the waking EEG are too heterogeneous with regard to applied fields, dura tion of exposure, number of considered leads and statistical methods to draw a sound conclusion. The same is true for behavioural outcomes an d cortical excitability. Epidemiological studies do not provide convincing evidence of an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including de mentia, related to ELF MF exposure. Furthermore, they show no evidence for adve rse pregnancy outcomes in relation to ELF MF. The studies concerning childhood health outcomes in relation to maternal residential ELF MF exposure during pregnancy involve some methodological issues that need to be addressed. They suggest impl ausible effects and need to be replicated independently before they can be used for risk assessment. Recent results do not show that ELF fields have any effect on the reproductive function in humans. Health effects from static magnetic fields (SMF) In most of the available in vitro studies, SMF above 30 T induced effects in the cellular endpoints investigated, although in some cases the effects were transient. Gene expression was affected in a ll studies, with predominantly up-regulated outcomes. These new studies are consistent with th e results of previous studies. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 17 A number of studies report that effects of SMF exposures occur in animals, at levels ranging from mT to T. However, since many of the findings are limited to single studies, they do not provide any firm foundation for risk assessment. Observational studies have shown that moveme nt in strong SMF may cause effects, such as vertigo and nausea. These can be explai ned by established interaction mechanisms and are more likely to occur in fields abov e 2 T. The relevance of these effects for the health of personnel remains unclear. Health effects from combined exposure to different EMFs The few available studies on combined exposure to different EMFs do not provide sufficient evidence for risk assessment. It is clearly of interest to follow up on studies concerning the effects on DNA integrity after an MRI investigation. However, it is not clear which component of the complex EMF exposure during scanning may cause the effect: SMF, switched gradient MF or the pulsed RF EMF. Further studies on DNA integrit y and MRI exposure are needed and the feasibility of cohort studies of MRI patients and occupationally ex posed personnel should be discussed. Health effects from co-exposure to environmental stressors Experimental results reported since the previous opinion indicate that co-exposures of environmental stressors (such as physical or c h e m i c a l a g e n t s ) w i t h E L F o r R F l a c k consistency. Under the same conditions, effe cts might be increased, decreased or not influenced at all and are not linked to specific experimental protocols. Due to the small number of available investigations and the large variety of protocols used (different chemical or physical treatments and different EMF exposure conditions), it is not possible to draw definitive conc lusions. Therefore, th e relevance of co-exposures of environmental stressors (such as physical or chemical agents) with ELF or RF to human health under real-life exposure conditions remains unclear. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 18 1. BACKGROUND Council Recommendation of 12 July 19991 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fiel ds (0 Hz to 300 GHz) fixes ba sic restrictions and reference levels for the exposure of th e general public to electrom agnetic fields (EMFs). These restrictions and reference levels are ba sed on the guidelines published by the International Commission on Non Ionizi ng Radiation Protection in 1998 (ICNIRP)2. In response to the Council Recommendation , all Member States have implemented measures to limit the exposure of the pub lic to EMF, either by implementing the provisions proposed by the Council Recommendation, or by implementing more stringent provisions3. For workers, the Council and the Parliame nt have adopted Directive 2004/40/EC of 29 April 20044 on the minimum health and safety re quirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical ag ents (EMFs). However, in October 2007, the European Commission announced the postpone ment of the implem entation of this Directive in order to allow enough time to prepare a modified text to better take into account research findings on the possible im pact of the exposure limits on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The new Direct ive on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the expo sure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) and repealing Di rective 2004/40/EC was issued on 26 June 2013 (Directive 2013/35/EU)5.The Council Recommendation al so invites the Commission to \"keep the matters covered by this recommend ation under review, wi th a view to its revision and updating, taking into account po ssible effects, which are currently the object of research, including relevant aspects of precaution \". The ICNIRP guidelines were endorsed by the Scientif ic Steering Committee (SSC)6 in its Opinion on health effects of EMFs of 25-26 June 1998. The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE) prepared an update of the Scientific Steering Committee's Opinion and concluded in its Opinion on \"Possible effe cts of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF), Radio Frequency Fields (RF) and Mi crowave Radiation on human health\", of 30 October 2001, that the information that ha d become available since the SSC Opinion of June 1999 did not justify revision of the exposure limits reco mmended by the Council7. The Opinions delivered by the SCENIHR in March 20078, January 20099 and July 200910 confirmed the earlier conclusion of the CSTE E and again highlighted the n eed for additional data and research on this issue and recommended that specific research areas be addressed. The Commission relies on the SCENIHR to periodically review new information that may influence the assessment of risk s to human health in this area and to provide regular updates on the scientific evid ence base to the Commission. 1 (OJ.

The RF and lower microwave frequencies are of particular interest for broadcasting, mobile telephony. The 2.45 GHz frequency is mainly used in domestic and industrial microwave ovens. 8 http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_007.pdf 9 http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_022.pdf 10 http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_o_024.pdf Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 19 Since September 2008, the cut-off date for the previous review by the SCENIHR, a sufficient number of new scientific publications have appeared to warrant a new analysis of the scientific evidence on possible effects on hum a n h e a l t h o f e x p o s u r e t o E M F . I n addition, the development of new technologies using EMF in the THz range, especially imaging techniques such as security scanners for passenger screening, calls for new assessments. On 16-17 November 2011, the International Co nference on EMF and Health, organized by the European Commission under the auspic es of the SCENIHR, pr ovided an overview of the most recent scientific developments in this area as the initial preparation for a future Scientific Opinion. Consequently, the SCENIHR is being asked to examine this new scienti fic evidence and to address in particular the questions listed in the Terms of Reference. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 20 2. TERMS OF REFERENCE The Committee is requested: 1. To update its Opinions of 20099, 10 in the light of newly available information. 2. To give particular attention to issues affected by important gaps in knowledge in the previous Opinions, especially: the potential adverse effects of EMF on the nervous system, including neuro- behavioural disorders, and on th e risk of neo-pl astic diseases; the understanding of biop hysical mechanisms that could explain observed biological effects and epidem iological associations; and the potential role of co-exposures with other environmental agents in biological effects attributed to EMF. 3. To review the scientific ev idence available to understand the potential adverse health effects of EMF in the THz range. 4. To develop a set of priori tized research recommendations updating previous efforts in this area (in particular by the SCENIHR and the WHO). These recommendations should include methodological guidan ce on the experimental desi gn and minimum requirements to ensure data quality and usability for risk assessment. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 21 3. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 3.1. Introduction and scope The purpose of this Opinion is to update the SCENIHR Opinion of 19 January 2009 in the light of newly available information and to give special consideration to areas where important knowledge gaps were identified in the previous Opinion. In addition, biophysical interaction mechanisms and th e potential role of co-exposures to environmental stressors are discussed. In or der to update the Opinion, this section establishes the scientific rati onale that is needed to pr ovide the requested Opinion. Relevant scientific knowledge from the physical, engineering, medical and biological sciences is critically evalua ted and summarised. When appr opriate, gaps in knowledge are highlighted and suggestion s for future important areas of research are included. As in the previous Opinions, the section is divided into separate sub-sections based on frequency bands: (radio fr equency (RF) (100 kHz < f 300 GHz), intermediate frequency (IF) (300 Hz < f 100 kHz), extremely low frequency (ELF) (0 < f 300 Hz), and static (0 Hz) (only static magnetic fields are considered in this Opinion). These frequency ranges are discussed in order of decr easing frequency: RF, IF, ELF, and static fields, respectively. For each frequency range, the review be gins with a summary of the findings in the previous Opinion. This is followed, for each frequency range, by a discussion that is organised according to ou tcome. For each outcome, relevant human, in vivo and in vitro data are covered. This Opinion also discusses a part of the radio frequency spectrum that is the lower Terahertz (THz) range. Terahertz applications operate between the optical spectrum on the short wavelength side and the radio freque ncy fields on the long er wavelength side. Applications are mainly imaging and spectroscopy. There are also frequency bands that are not covered in this Opinion since relevant data regarding possible effects on hu man health are not available, or not directly mentioned in the mandate. Parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not discussed include the infrared and ultraviolet frequency bands. Throughout this Opinion, the terms \"positive\", \"negative\", and \"uninformative\" are used to describe studies. A \"positive\" study refers to a study where an effect of EMF is shown, with valid methods described in enough detail to constitute evidence supporting the study hypothesis. If a well-conducted and appropriately reported study shows no clear effect despite proper methods and statistical power, its results provide evidence against the study hypothesis (but support the null hypothesis), and the study is considered \"negative\". Studies with insufficient information on the methodology or inadequate statistical power or flawed study design (or methods) are regarded as \"uninformative\". Furthermore, SI-units are consistently used throughout the Opinion. 3.2. Methodology Information has been obtained primarily from original research papers published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals in the English language. This includes meta-analyses but not reviews. Additional sources of information have also been considered, including web-based information retrieval, and documents from Governmental bodies and authorities. For most of the sections in the Scientific Ra tionale, scientific reports published after the publication of the previous SCENIHR Opinion (SCENIHR 2009) have been considered. In practice, the present Opinion thus covers st udies that were published between 2009 and June 2014. Certain sections in the Scientific Rationale were not covered in our previous SCENIHR Opinions. In such cases, publicat ions published before 2009 have also been included in the assessment. Not all identified studies are necessarily included in the Opinion. On the contrary, a main task is to evaluate and assess the articles and the scientific weight that is to be given to Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 22 each of them. Detailed criteria for selecting these studies have been published in the SCENIHR Memorandum \"Use of th e scientific literatu re for risk assessment purposes - a weight of evidence approach\" (SCENIHR 2012). A dditional criteria spec ifically for studies of EMF health effects were also listed in a previous SCENIHR Opinion (SCENIHR 2009). Although anecdotal evidence can be valuable for highlighting an area of concern and thus initiating scientific studies, this kind of evidence has not been considered in the assessments performed in this Opinion. In some areas where the literature is part icularly scarce, it has been considered important to explain why the results of certai n studies do not add useful information to the database. Identified reports that have no t been considered in the Opinion are listed under the subheading \"Literatur e identified but not cited\" in the References section. Exposure considerations A specific concern in the assessment of many studies is the descripti on of the exposure. This is true for experimental as well as for epidemiological studies. Over time, many studies have reported biologic al effects after EMF exposure. However, the description of the exposure is in many cases not sufficient even for scientists with relevant knowledge and the proper equipment to reproduce the ex periment. Papers with poor descriptions of the exposure are therefore of little or no va lue in risk evaluation and do not provide knowledge about modes of actions. Valberg (1995) and Kaune (1995) have listed up to 18 parameters that need to be considered in ELF MF in vivo and in vitro experiments, which fall into five major categories: a) exposure intensity and timing, b) frequency- domain characteristics, c) spatial (geometr ic) descriptors, d) combined EMF exposure, and e) characteristics of the exposure system . The same considerations are also valid for experimental work in other frequency areas. Omission of many EMF exposure parameters causes considerable difficulty for others to replicate the experiment and interpret the reported EMF bioeffects. An example where important exposure details are commonly missing is an in vitro experiment with cells in a Petri dish. If a magnetic field is applied vertically it will induce an electric field that is strongest at the peri phery of the dish, and a pproaching zero in the centre of the dish. On the other hand, if th e field is applied horizontally the induced E field will in most cases be much smaller and also uneven in a different way. It is important to know these details in order to tell if any effect is due to the magnetic field itself or to an induced E field. Another factor of importance in in vitro experiments is the background magnetic field in cell culture incubators. It has been shown by Hansson Mild et al. (2009) and Portelli et al. (2013) that values up to some tens of \u00b5T are common and the dist ribution within the incubator is very inhomogeneous. Needless to say, if the performed experiments are investigating MF-effects at similar flux densities, the relevance of the experiment is doubtful. Recently, Zeni and Scarfi (2012) discussed the requirements for in vitro studies with RF exposure. Just as in the ELF situation, there are many parameters to take into consideration, and experiments without proper dosimetry are not useful in risk evaluation or other interpretations. In the last few years there have been a number of in vivo and in vitro studies dealing with exposure directly from a mobile phone. In almost all cases these experiments are without relevance since they do not mention anything about the factual exposure. They are also impossible to reprod uce in another laboratory. Th us, there are studies where a mobile phone is placed next to or under a Petri dish, or under a cage of animals, and connected to another phone. Such a set-up do es not allow for proper dosimetry as many unknown factors can influence the exposure th at is produced. These include the distance to the phone's base station, the output power, the SAR distribution of the phone, whether the DTX function was activated, an d the frequency used by the phone. These experiments are therefore best carried out with a special exposure set-up. More detailed Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 23 advice for proper procedures regarding in vitro studies of EMF effects are given in Zeni and Scarfi (2012) and Paffi et al. (2010). Considerations for epidemiology An epidemiological study should ideally ca pture all major sources of exposure as a function of time during the relevant time pe riod (considering latency) prior to occurrence of the outcome. For exposures from environmen tal and occupational so urces, as well as from personal use of devices, comprehensive construction of exposure history requires evaluation of exposure as a fu nction of time. For RF, person al use of mob ile phones and DECT is the predominant source of exposure for the vast majority of the population, followed by occupational exposure for cert ain subgroups and by presence of wireless devices, base stations and sim ilar sources in residential and other daily settings. For ELF, consideration of residential exposure from nearby power lines, wiring within the home and some occupational exposures are essential. In general, personal measurements are regard ed as the gold standard for assessment of current short-term exposure , though spot measurements may not reflect long-term exposure. For studies on heal th risks from EMF, the rele vant time period for which exposure data would be needed is a peri od of perhaps several years preceding the diagnosis. Typically, exposure assessment only encompasses either a short-term measurement of a maximum of 48 hours wi th personal monitoring, or a spot measurement providing only a snapshot of instantaneous exposure levels at a single location (while the former can more widely cover the places where exposure occurs, such as work or school, and hence provide a more re alistic picture of typical exposures). As a rule, retrospective exposure assessment is more challenging and prone to errors than estimation of concurrent exposures. Long-ter m exposure from some key sources such as power lines, TV/radio transmitters or ba se stations can also be retrospectively reconstructed if adequate information on the system is available (voltages for power lines, power levels, directions and shielding for transmitters and base stations). Study subjects are rarely an optimal source of information due to potential errors in recall, particularly for case-control studies. More objective sources of information include records such as monitoring reports, e.g. op erator records for call time in mobile phone studies (provided that both in-coming and ou t-going calls are registered). Various proxy measures as indirect indicato rs of exposure are commonly em ployed, such as job title for occupational exposure. Their validity depends on variability of exposure for subjects with similar occupations - the wider the exposure distribution, the higher the miscl assification. Exposure assessment should provide adequate temporal and spatial resolution. The focus should be on the relevant part of the body (target tissue). Mobile phone use is important for local exposure in the head and neck area , but far-field exposures are (likely to be) more important for other parts of the body. For instance, maternal mobile phone use is likely to be inappropriate as an indicator of RF-EMF exposure to the foetus in studies on developmental outcomes or the testis in sperm quality studies. Estimation of SAR from mobile phones in various parts of the brain (a t an individual level) based on self-reported usage history is already approaching/extending the limits of the resolution achievable from such data. The minimum requirements for exposure asse ssment for an epidemiological study to be informative include reasonably accurate indi vidual exposure char acterization over a relevant period of time capturing all major so urces of exposure for the pertinent part of the body. Valid exposure assessment allows a re searcher to distinguish sub-groups of the population with contrasting exposure levels. As EMF exposure is ubiquitous, it is difficult to find an unexposed reference group and inst ead, a quantitative contrast is used with comparison of low versus high exposure levels. Whatever exposure metric is used, it is important to demonstrate its adequacy for the specific study hypothesis, for instance with th e help of validation studies, comparison of different metrics aimed at predicting the same exposure, or sensitivity analysis using different error scenarios. Fi rstly, sometimes the seemin gly most appropriate or Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 24 comprehensive metric is not the best one; for example, personal dosimetry in case- control studies on cancer in children captur es all exposures over a typical day, but is unlikely to be appropriate for estimating past exposure conditions, as children's daily activities change dramatically with age and daily activities of the case children are definitely influenced by having had the disease. Secondly, depending on exposure prevalence, it might be that small misclassification errors have a big impact and large misclassification errors have a small impact in the risk estimation, as the bias related to misclassification depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the metric in predicting the true exposure. For example, childhood cancer studies using calculated fields as exposure metric suffer from extra loss of statistical power; however, there is little bias in the risk estimation, because the method has very high specificity (unlikely that truly non-exposed children are classified as exposed) but has low sensitivity (likely that truly exposed children are classified as non-exposed) that hardly matters due to the low exposure prevalence. These examples cl early show the reason why, for exposure assessment in epidemiological studies, experts in epidemiology and dosimetry should team up to jointly develop the most appropriate method. Dose Even if the exposure assessment is carried out in a valid fashion, the problem of combining the exposure intensity with the duration of exposure into a dose measure still remains. However, the proble m of dose assessment in epid emiological studies has mostly not been taken into account because no interaction mechanism(s) is (are) known regarding potential non-thermal effects of weak fields. Depending on the type of disease studied, the exposure assessment in the ep idemiological studies need to be very different. For effects depending on just shor t term exposure - effects of more acute character - the SAR values might be the useful measures to obtain. This can be exemplified by subjective symptoms and mobi le phone use. However, regarding diseases with long latencies like cancer and Alzheimer' s disease, it becomes much more difficult, since then it is the exposure a number of years ago that is of interest, which may not be easy or at all possible to estimate today wi th any reasonable accuracy. In particular, questions about how the exposure is accumula ted over many years need to be answered before the ultimate exposure assessment ca n be made. When calculating accumulated exposure over time, an importan t question is if there is a threshold under which no effect occurs, i.e. how low values should be take n into account. Intermi ttent exposures also provide difficult problems, such as the spacin g of the repeated expo sures and its relation to a possible biological reset time, i.e. when the system is fully recuperated. There are studies suggesting that repeated exposure in the minute to hour scale can be much more efficient than continuous expo sure in experimental setting s, but much remains to be investigated before this can be taken into account in epidemiological studies. Issues in data analysis and reporting: Multiple comparisons and statistical significance Statistical significance is used as a means of summarising the findin gs in various fields where statistical analysis is used in drawing inference from the data. Fundamentally, it indicates the agreement between the null hypo thesis and the observations (empirical data). Statistical significance (p-value) is defined as the probability of observing an effect (of observed size or larger) in the absence of any true effect (called type 1 or alpha ( ) error in statistics). The p-value indicates the frequency of comparable results (similar or larger effect than observed) that would oc cur by chance alone, i.e. under the null hypothesis. Statistical significance is calc ulated based on tests that pertain to the distribution of the outcome variable (e.g. a t-test for comparing two normally distributed variables, a chi-square test for frequencies etc.). A p-value is always calculated by contrasting the null hypothesis (claiming no e ffect) in relation to a specific finding, reflecting both sample size (number of observations), and magnitude of effect. The study hypothesis (alternative hypothesis) is a st atement that assumes the existence of the proposed effect (claiming the pr esence of an effect of undefi ned size). A critical value of 0.05 for the p-value is commonly used as a threshold, with values <0.05 taken to indicate the presence of an effect (which means accepting a 5% probability of error in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 25 case the null hypothesis is true, i.e. or type I error). This selection is based on convention alone and can be regarded as completely arbitrary. W h e n a n i m p o r t a n t decision is to be made and erroneously accepting a chance finding would have important bearing, lower values such as 0.01 or 0.001 ca n be used. An appropriate interpretation of the p-value is the smaller th e value, the more support th e data lend for the study hypothesis. Yet the p-value alone is not a su fficient description of the study results, because it depends on both the amount of information and the size of the effect. Therefore, a study that is too small would fail to reach statistical significance even when the effect size is large enough to be meanin gful. This would be term ed a 'false negative' result due to insufficient statistical power. Statistical power is defined as the probability of detecting a true effect. It is usua lly defined in terms of type II error, , which is the probability of not reaching statistical signif icance with a given e ffect size. Statistical power is then 1- . Statistical significance testing is an issue in studies aimed at evaluating hypotheses. This is not the goal in all research, but estimation, i.e. quantification of the magnitude of effect (s uch as assessment of dose-response curve), is pursued in some studies (though typically in a situation, where the pr esence of an effect has already been established, for instance risk of cancer from ionising radiation). Statistical power depends on the magnitude of the effect, probability of end-point occurrence, and sample size (or the combin ed effect of the three, which can be expressed as the number of excess events in the exposed group). An example of probability of detecting an effect of a given size as a function of sample size is illustrated in the Figure 1 below. The smaller the study, the larger the effect needs to be to reach statistical significance - even a substantial difference may fail to be detected. Conversely, in a very large study, even an effect of trivial size can be statistically significant. Hence, the effect size and number of events need to be indicated to allow a meaningful interpretation of the p-valu e, and some journals discourage use of significance tests placing more emphasis on confidence interv als as indicators of random error. Figure 1. Required sample size to detect an effect of a given size In research on health effe cts of EMF, the lack of cl early focused hypotheses is accentuated by the lack of an established bi ological or biophysica l mechanism of action. This does not allow the researchers to specif y mechanistically the mo st relevant exposure indices, but commonly several alternative measures of ex posure are evaluated (for instance field strength, exposure frequenc y, cumulative exposure, time since first exposure etc.). In addition, some studies use multiple end-points, which are equally prone to false positive results. Neurophysiol ogical studies also ge nerate diverse outcome data with various aspects of brain function (with unclear pathophysiological relevance). For example, high through-put methods used i n a n a l y s i s o f g e n e e x p r e s s i o n ( e . g . genome-wide association studies) and other an alyses are a good example of approaches that generate a wealth of data that are commonly analysed in an exploratory fashion (data mining or association mapping). In such contexts, a proportion of tests - Means: Dif erence between two dependent means (matched pairs) Tail(s) = Two, Power (1- err prob) = 0,8, err prob = 0,05 Effect size dz Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 26 expected to show statistically significant results ev en in the absence of any true effect. For instance, when using a cu t-off of 0.05 for the p-value, one out of 20 significance tests can be anticipated to be below that leve l and the probability of finding at least one p<0.05 for 10 comparisons is 40% (provided th at they are based on uncorrelated data). When a large number of signific ance tests are performed, avoi ding false positive results (apparently significant findings arising due to chance) is an issue. For example, several neurophysiological studies have reported e ffects of EMF on various aspects of EEG. Especially with regard to power spectra, several tests are commonly performed (e.g. testing 0.25 Hz bin frequency bands for a rang e from 0.25 to 20 Hz implies 80 tests, with four test results expected to be statistically significant just by chance, given type I error frequency of 0.05). Similar difficulties are also commonly encountered in epidemiological studies of occupational exposures, for exam ple where a wide range of job titles are evaluated. Such comprehensive evaluation s are called hypothesis generating or hypothesis screening studies, as opposed to hy pothesis testing, and can be regarded as exploratory studies. Several methods have been developed for adjusting the significance level used for multiple comparisons (Kooperbe rg et al. 2005, Rice et al. 2008). The simplest and most commonly used is the Bonferroni correction, which is based on defining the alpha error over the entire material by setting the criterion of statistical significance as the standard (0.05), divided by the number of tests. Hence, for an anal ysis with 10 tests (without a priori defined main results), a significance level of 0.005 could be applied. Other approaches are also available, some with mo re refined definitions for a positive finding (for instance the Benjamini-Hoc hberg method incorporating al so the false discovery rate, Wacholder et al. 2004). Others use a resamplin g procedure, such as boot strapping or Monte-Carlo simulation, or firs t test the overall result fo r evidence of heterogeneity across the hypotheses. More empirical approach es include dividing the material into a test set and a separate validation set, where only those findings supported by the initial analysis are evaluated. The inherent problem in adjusting significance levels is that a true effect is of course unaffected by the numb er of tests and missing an effect due to correction (false negative or type II error) is a possibility that has prompted several researchers to abandon such correction methods. Study design can help minimise false positive findings. A key issue is selection of study size based on careful power ca lculation, with realistic es timates of effect size and background risk. Small studies that only have adequate statistical power for detection of extreme effects are most pron e to serendipitous findings. Good research practice requires that all hy potheses evaluated are stated and that all results pertaining to them are reported. Sele ctive reporting, with emphasis placed on significant findings that were not specified in advance, can mislead the reader by ignoring the issue of multiple testing. In the worst cases, only the significant results are reported, and non-significant ones ignored - this would misguide the interpretation of statistical significance by obscuring the need for considering multiple testing. This inappropriate practice is called the 'Texas sharp shooter effect' (\"if you wa nt to hit the bull's eye, the best method is to shoot first and call what ever you hit the intended target\"). To avoid such conscious or unconscious selection of re sults, detailed study pr otocols and analysis plans with pre-specified exposure indica tors and primary outcomes are needed. Registration of randomised trials is nowadays required by several journals for this same reason. Publication of study protocols for non-randomised studies has also been suggested as a remedy to this problem (Swaen 2011, Lancet 2010). Publication bias is a related distortion of the results reported in the literature (Dwan et al. 2008). It refers to a phenomenon whereby re search in which the study hypothesis is supported by the findings is more likely to be formally reported in the peer-reviewed literature (Hopewell et al. 2009). The selectiv e publication of results that appear to provide most support for the study hypothesis is enhanced by editorial policies focusing on the most striking findings which are likely to attain the most attention (and citations). Frequently, initial reports of effects turn out to be smaller in subsequent assessment Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 27 (known as 'winner's curse'), which reflects the role of serendipity in reporting and publication (Zollner & Pritchard 2007, Ioa nnidis 2008). Publication bias tends to be strongest for small studies: large, costly studies are more likely to be published regardless of their findings. Publication bias should always be evaluated in meta-analyses to assess the possibility that small studies in particular are skewed toward positive results. Weight of evidence A weight of evidence approach is used to assess the scientific su pport for a specific outcome. This is based on data from hu man, animal and mechanistic studies (the primary evidence) along with exposure. For ea ch line of evidence, the overall quality of the studies is taken into account, as well as the relevance of the studies for the issue in question. The weighting also considers if causality is shown or not in the relevant studies. In the present Opinion (i.e. the Opinion te xt proper, the Executive Summary, and the Abstract) the following categories are used to assign the relevant weight of evidence for the specific outcomes. Strong overall weight of evidence - Coherent evidence from human and one or more other lines of evidence (except for symptoms where only human evidence is available); no important data gaps Moderate overall weight of evidence - Good evidence from a primary line of evidence (human experimental or epidemiological, animal and mechanistic studies together with exposure), but evidence from several other lines is missing (important data gaps) Weak overall weight of evidence - Weak evidence from primary lines of evidence, severe data gaps Discordant overall weight of evidence - Conflicting information from different lines of evidence Weighing of evidence not possible - No suitable evidence available 3.3. Exposure to EMF Basic restrictions and reference levels The 1999/519/EC European Coun cil Recommendation (EC, 1999) defines, in its Annex I, the basic restrictions and reference levels for limiting exposure of the general public. This had been added by the directive 2013/35/EU on occupational exposure to EMF. In accordance to EC (1999) and ICNIRP (1998) restrictions on expo sure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electr omagnetic fields that are ba sed directly on established health effects and biol ogical considerations are termed 'basic restrictions'. Depending upon the frequency of the field, the physical quantities used to specify these restrictions are magnetic flux density, current density, specific energy absorption rate, and power density. Magnetic flux density and power dens ity can be readily measured. In the latest guidelines issued by ICNIRP (2010) for limiting exposure in the frequency range of 1 Hz - 100 kHz, the internal electric field strength (the electric field inside the tissues) has been introduced to replace the electric current density as a quantity to restrict the excitation of nerve and other electrically sensitive cells. Since many of the physical quantities used for setting the basic limits cannot be readily measured, reference levels are provided for practical exposure-assessment purposes to determine whether the basic restrictions are l ikely to be exceeded. Some reference levels are derived from relevant ba sic restrictions using measur ements and/or computational techniques and some reference levels address perception and adverse indirect effects of exposure to EMF. The derive d quantities are electric fi eld strength, magnetic field Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 28 strength, magnetic flux density, power dens ity, and contact current. Quantities that address perception and other in direct effects are (contact) cu rrent and, for pulsed fields, specific energy absorption. In any particular exposure situation, measured or calculated values of any of these quantities can be comp ared with the appropriate reference level. It should be noted that the derived reference levels (or action values) may also include additional reduction fa ctors or be highly conservative in nature. The field induced inside the bo dy further depends on physical properties of the exposure configuration, such as frequency, polarization , direction of incidence, as well as on the anatomy of the exposed person, including height, posture, body mass index (BMI). Finally, the dielectric properties of tissues that change with water content and age are also important. The distributi on of the field induced insi de the human body at high frequencies is highly non-uniform, therefore compliance with both local and whole-body energy absorption needs to be demonstrated. Respect of the reference level will ensure resp ect of the relevant basi c restriction. If the measured value exceeds the reference level, it does not necessarily follow that the basic restriction will be exceeded. Under such ci rcumstances, however, there is a need to establish whether there is resp ect of the basic restriction. Some quantities such as magnetic flux density and power density serv e both as basic restrictions and reference levels. Despite certain question marks regarding the potential health effects of EMF on humans in general, and on workers in particular, th ere is a rapid and steady development of new techniques, technologies and wo rk practices exposing the wo rkers and the population to a-priori advantageous electrical, electron ic, wireless or wired appliances such as telephony, WiFi, electrical distribution, RFID, welding systems, galvanization, microwave applications, non-ionizing medical imaging (MRI), surgery (surgical diathermy), etc. Much of our daily exposure to EMF, both in the workplace and for the general public, is complex and no longer consists of a single frequency, but is rather a multi-frequency exposure with different char acteristics. An example is the use of wireless telephony where the phone may operate in several different modes depending on location; for instance switching be tween 3G and GSM modes. Weld ing is another example where multiple frequencies are present during the process. Workers are increasingly wearing medical implantable systems (p acemakers, insulin pumps, et c.) that are susceptible to influences from electromagnetic emitting a ppliances. Some interactions / interferences between bodily systems and the mentione d appliances are known, described and scientifically documented. In certain cases some of them are avoidable; other interactions with living materials remain unknown or unexplained. The novel EU directive on occupational expo sure (Directive 2013/35/EU) was initiated in 2004, but concerns about possible negative impact on the use of MRI caused some delays. The exposure limit values for low frequency fields that ar e now being discussed are based as before on stimulatory effects on central and peripheral nervous systems. The values are given as limits of the internal electrical field strength, and this is then transformed into action levels given as external electric field strength and magnetic field induction. If an action value is exceeded, it does not necess arily follow that the exposure limit value is also exceeded. Under such circumstances, howe ver, there is a need to establish whether there the exposure limit value is respected. For the radiofrequency range th e limits are given in Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR) and follow the ICNIRP guidelines from 1998. These values are then transformed into the measurable quantities of el ectric and magnetic field strengths. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 29 3.3.1. Wireless communication technologies (incl. dosimetry) Broadcasting Transmitters operating in the medium freq uency range (300 kHz - 3 MHz) typically use monopoles as antennas, whereas in the high frequency range (HF, 3 MHz - 30 MHz) they use curtain antennas. In this lower band used for broadcasting, the transmitter power is rather large resulting in electric field strength values that are high with respect to the fields generated by other app lications, even at a distance of a few hundred meters. In their measurement campaign, Mantiply et al . (1997) measured electric field strengths that varied from 2.5 to 20 V/m (magnetic fi eld strengths from 7.7 to 76 mA/m) at 100 m away from the antenna tower of AM radio st ations operating in medium frequency with powers between 1 and 50 kW. At the same dist ance in front of a conventional curtain antenna operating at 9.57 MHz (HF) and with 100 kW of inpu t power, the electric and magnetic field strengths vari ed from 4.2 to 9.2 V/m and from 18 to 72 mA/m along the traverse respectively. As a consequence, a co ntrol zone is usually defined around such installations in which access for the general public is prohibited. In the case of FM radio and TV broadcasti ng antennas, which oper ate in the frequency range of 80 - 800 MHz, the people exposed mo st are the professionals who work in the area around the antennas. The antennas in this frequency range typically have output powers of 10 - 50 kW and they take the form of dipole arrays (either horizontal or vertical) on the sides of the installation tower. Hansson M ild (1981) measured the fields at places where it is not possible to avoi d RF exposure of the hands and feet while climbing the ladder of the antenna tower in an FM and TV broadcasting facility. The highest values registered were 600 V/m for the electric field strength and 3.0 A/m for the magnetic field strength; the lowest were 275 V/m an d 0.9 A/m, respectively. In most European countries an alogue broadcasting systems ar e being replaced by digital ones, namely digital video and audio broadc asting (DVB and DAB) . Although the power transmitted from digital broadcasters is lowe r than their analogue counterparts, a study carried out by Schubert et al. (2007) statistically analysed the electric field strength at the same locations before and after switchov er from analogue to digital broadcasting. The analysis revealed an incr ease in mean exposure in the TV broadcasting frequency band, mostly in the central parts of Nure mberg and Munich. The maximum power density for TV broadcasting increased from 0.9 mW/m2 to 6.5 mW/m2 after the transition. According to the authors the main reason for this mean exposure change was the increase in the radiated power at the transmitter stations with the introduction of DVB-T. A closer examination of the resu lts revealed that the change of the radiated power at the transmitter covering the re spective regions was nearly the same as the measured exposure change and could therefore be taken as a coarse indicator for the mean change of exposure. On the contrary, the transition from analogue (FM) broadcasting to DAB led to a mean exposure reduction of 10 ti mes in the corresponding frequency band. In a recent study, Joseph et al. (2010a) co mpared the public exposure to sources in various frequency bands of the spectrum, usin g the data collected by personal exposure meters across five European countries (Bel gium, Hungary, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland). The highest mean exposure from broadcasting was registered in office environments in Belgium for the FM frequency band and was 0.096 mW/m2 (0.2 V/m). Mobile phones Table 1 lists the various mobile phone systems that have been used by the participants of the INTERPHONE study (Cardis et al., 2001) . The next generations of mobile phones were expected to operate at frequency bands higher than 2 GHz. However, the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting will free a significant part of the spectrum (digital dividend), which may be reallo cated to newer systems. The fourth generation (4G) of mobile phone systems in Europe is Long Term Evolution (LTE). Its main feature is fast data transmission with rate s reaching up to 100 Mbps (megabits per second) downlink (from the base station to the mobile unit) and 50 Mbps uplink (from the mobile unit to the base station). Although current frequenc y and transmission powers of LTE mobile Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 30 phones are comparable to those for 2G and 3G handsets, in the future use may be made of higher frequency bands (beyond 2 GHz) fo r this technology. Furthermore, coding and modulation schemes are different in the LTE system to allow for higher data rates. The data flows into several narrow frequency band s called subcarriers, which can be switched on and off. Another important aspect of LTE is the use of MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antennas, i.e. the pres ence of more than one antenna on the device, so that the signal can reach the latter following different routes and thus improving the quality of service. Following the tradition in the field of mobile telephony, where about every 10 years a next generation of systems is introduc ed, it is expected that 5G systems will be developed by 2020 to accommodate the demand for faster communica tions with higher data transfer rates. In this direction, EU has funded a flagship project within FP7, the METIS project, with the objective of laying the foundation for 5G systems and building consensus prior to standardization. In order to fulfil the requiremen ts of the test cases examined within METIS, the communicating de vices must be equippe d with radio access technologies at higher frequency ranges with large bandwidths. In the METIS project the highest priority for frequencies above 6 GH z was placed on frequencies between 40 and 90 GHz (Osseiran et al., 2014). C o n c e r n i n g t h e v a l u e s i n T a b l e 1 , i t i s u s e f u l t o n o t e t h a t t h e s i g n a l f r o m m o s t 2 G terminals is pulsed. If a phone uses a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) technology, it transmits at regular intervals. The fraction of time that the phone transmits is given by the duty factor, i.e., a duty factor of 0.12 denotes that the phone transmits 12% of the time. The average power is calculated as the product of the maximum power with the duty factor. In the case of 3G phones (con tinuous transmission) the power can be up to 125 mW. This is, however, the maximum value, since in reality the output power of a mobile phone is considerably lower and is de termined by the signal quality (strength). The use of Adaptive Power Control (APC) with which mobile phones reduce their output powers to allow for good signal quality give s longer life to their batteries. The network continually monitors signal quality and may re duce the emitted power of a mobile phone, by up to a factor of 1,000 for GSM and about 100,000,000 for UMTS (SCENIHR, 2009). Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 31 Table 1. Historical development of mobile telephony systems (adapted from HPA (2012) and Cardis et al. (2011)). In a multinational study (V rijheid et al., 2009), software -modified GSM phones were distributed to more than 500 volunteers in 12 countries for 1 month each. The average output power of over 60,000 phone calls wa s approximately 50% of the maximum. The maximum power was used 39% of the time (on average) and was higher for rural areas. T h e f a c t t h a t o u t p u t p o w e r f r o m m o b i l e p h ones is higher in ru ral environments was confirmed by Persson et al. (2012), who st udied the uplink power of devices in a 3G network. In an urban environment they meas ured an average output power of 0.4 mW (median 0.02 mW) for voice calls and 2.0 mW (median 0.2 mW) for video upload. These results are in agreement with an older study by Gati et al. (2009) who had noticed, however, that there is also a differentiation between ind oor and outdoor environments, with the average output powers for voice ca lls in 3G systems being less than 5 mW for the former and less than 1 mW for the latter.

Typical updates occur with 2 - 5 h in between. During these time in tervals the phone is to be considered as a passive radio receiver with no microwave emission (Han sson Mild et al., 2012). However, modern smart phones, which can operate in several modes other than voice and SMS transmission (e.g., by staying connected to th e internet for data transmission), seem to require location updates more often, thus cont ributing to the exposu re of their users and the persons around them (Urbinello and R\u00f6\u00f6sli, 2012). In order to assess the exposure of users to mo bile phones the quantity of Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR) is used and not the electric field directly next to its antenna, because it is not possible to measure so close to the antenna without perturbing the electric field to be measured and the operat ion of the phone itself. SAR is measured in W/kg and is the rate of specific absorption (SA), measured in J/kg, i.e. the rate at which energy is deposited in tissue. It is a ssessed with measurements in human body phantoms filled with appropriat e liquids, which bear dielectric properties similar to those of human tissues. Another way of estimating the SAR is to use computational techniques and numerical phantoms derived from real hu mans with high resolution medical imaging techniques (Christ et al., 2010; Zradzi ski, 2013). During the INTERPHONE study 1, 233 maximum SAR values aver aged over a 10 g cube of tissue were registered (Car dis et al., 2011). They ranged from 0.01 W/kg, which is actually the sensitivity limit for measurement equipment, to 1.7 W/kg. The vast majority of values, however, were below 1 W/kg. Although not statistically significant, a trend of decreasing SAR over a period of years wa s clear from this study. This trend was confirmed by K\u00fchn et al. (2013). In epidemiological studies, cumulative specific absorption is also referred to as total cumulative specific energy and is commonly us ed as an exposure proxy, equivalent to dose. It is clear from the INTERPHONE st udy (Cardis et al., 2011) that cumulative specific absorption for the early analogue syst ems were manifold higher than for the next generations of handsets. During operation, GSM mobile phones are th e sources of magnetic fields at the ELF range. Perentos et al. (2007) have measured a magnetic flux density value of less than 100 T at 217 Hz, which is the main spectral component associated with the GSM pulses, and confirmed the presence of spectral co mponents at 2.1 and 8.3 Hz. The maximum current density induced in the head of the mobile phone user was not larger than 28% of the ICNIRP (1998) limit, according to Jokela et al. (2004) who measured the battery current pulses for seven GSM phones and calcul ated the exposure quot ient in a simplified spherical head model. Ilvonen et al. (2005) calculated lower values of the induced current density in a realistic human head phantom in the range of some A/m 2, i.e., about three orders of magnitude below the ICNIRP (1998) limit of 2 mA/m2 at 217 Hz. There are some differences in energy absorp tion from mobile ph ones between children and adults. Children's heads are smaller and, therefore, mobile phon es expose a larger part of their brains. Moreover , their tissues, like bone marrow, have a higher electrical conductivity due to larger water content; th erefore, local energy absorption can become higher in these tissues. Ne vertheless, the peak spatial (SAR) assessed with the standardized specific anthropometric manne quin (SAM) head phantom has been shown to yield a conservative exposure estimate for both adults and children using mobile phones (Christ et al., 2010). Moreover, the va lue of the maximum lo cal peak SAR in the SAM was always higher than in the adult and children models (Hadjem et al., 2010). Mobile phone base stations Modern communication systems are based on the division of space in 'cells' to allow for full coverage of subscribers. The coverage in ea ch cell is provided by a base station, also called a 'relay' station in some countries, which is a transceiver serving the subscribers that are within that cell. The size of the cells can vary from several kilometres in the countryside (macrocells) to some metres inside a home (femtocells), with the respective Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 33 output power from the antennas ranging from tens of watts to as low as 5 mW. It has been shown that for macrocells distance from the base station is a bad proxy for exposure (Sch\u00fcz and Mann, 2000), whereas late st studies show that for femtocells the electric field radiated by th em rapidly falls o ff with distance to reach background radiation levels at about 1m (Boursianis et al., 2012). Moreover, the use of femtocells in homes leads to a reduction of the exposure to the mobile phone user (Zarikoff and Malone, 2013; Aerts et al., 2013). In a recent study Rowley and Joyner (2012) analysed the data from surveys of radio base stations in 23 countries across five co ntinents from the year 2000 onward (figure 2). They reported the immission level as a function of time (figure 3), as well as in terms of the technology (figure 4). These figures are reproduced with permission of the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology. Figure 2. Minimum (), maximum () and narrowband average ( average ( ) of all su rvey data for each country with the number of measurement points for the country in brackets . For comparison, the global weighted average marked with dot--dashed line through ( ) and the ICNIRP reference levels for the public at 900 and 1800 MHz are also plotted. (Rowley and Joyner, 2012) Figure 2 shows that despite the increasing nu mber of base stations and the deployment of additional mobile technolo gies, the electromagnetic radiation levels have essentially remained the same in each country. Nevert heless, the results al so show that the environmental level of radiation from mobile communication base stations is at least one order of magnitude higher than the median exposure level of 0.05 mW/m2 reported more than 30 years ago by Tell and Mantiply (1980) for measurements of VHF and UHF broadcast services from 486 locations distribu ted throughout 15 large cities in the USA. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 34 In a recent study by Tell and Kavet (2014) measurements were taken at a total of 94 sites across four cities in the USA. Although a direct comparis on of the two studies is not possible due to design limitations, it is clear from the reported results that for the FM radio broadcast band there was a three-fold increase in the median value of the power density.

For comparison, ICNIRP reference levels for the public at 900 and 1800 MHz ar e also plotted. Mobile Other refers to mobile technologies either not identified in the source survey or not included (e.g., PDC) in one of the other mobile technologies categories. All Mobile is the result of averaging over all mobile technologies. Only narrowband measurements (from 16 countries) could be used. The weighted averages for all available measurement years for each country were then averaged over the number of countries with measurements for each mobile technology. The figure in brackets on the horizontal axis label is the number of countries for which measurements were available for each technology. (Rowley and Joyner, 2012). With respect to emerging mobile comm unication technologi es, the measurement campaign in Stockholm, Swed en, has shown that the averag e contribution of LTE (Long Term Evolution) to the total radiofrequency exposure was less than 5% (Joseph et al., 2010b). The results from the comparis on of personal exposure data across five European countries (Joseph et al., 2010) have shown th at exposure in all countries was of the same order of magnitude and that in the ou tdoor urban environment, mobile phone base stations and mobile phone handsets domina ted the exposure. The exposure from the downlink frequency bands of mobile communication systems ranged in the outdoor urban environment of the five count ries between 0.08 and 0.35 mW/m2. These values are considerably lower than the value of 1 mW/m2 derived from measurement campaigns around base stations (figures 2 and 4), but this difference can be explained by the way the measurement points were selected in the latter case, i.e., mainly in the vicinity of base stations and in some cases wi thin their line of sight (LOS). Microwave links On the masts of mobile phon e base stations very often drum-like antennas are mounted; usually more than one. Thes e antennas serve to wirelessly link two points with a microwave communications link in the GHz frequency range and it is very unlikely that a member of the general public gets in the main lobe of the antennas, especially since they are mounted at a significant he ight. In their majority, these antennas are parabolic dish reflectors similar to the antennas used for receiving satellite broadcasting signals. However, the size of parabolic antennas an d the emitted power of microwave links may differ according to the application. For satellite uplink broadcasting, several hundreds of W are used with dishes that ca n reach 5 meters in diameter. In this case the antenna is directed at a satellite avoidi ng all obstacles in-between, th erefore exposure to the main lobe is unlikely to happen. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 36 Apart from fixed installations VSAT (Very Small Aperture Term inal) transportable stations also exist. They use antennas less than 3 meters in diameter (most of them are about 0.75 m to 1.2 m tall) and a power of some Wa tt. The transmission rates of VSAT stations usually range from very low up to 4 Mbps. Th ese VSAT usually access the satellites in the geosynchronous orbit and relay data (e.g., TV signal) from terminals on earth to other terminals and hubs. Cordless phones There are both analogue and digital cordless phones marketed, although the latter have dominated in recent years, due to their technological advantages and quality of communication. The average tr ansmitted power of cordless phones is about 10 mW. Analogue cordless phones cont inuously emit during operation, whereas digital cordless phones can involve timesharin g and pulse modulation. Theref ore, the peak power of the latter can be higher than 10 mW. Digital En hanced Cordless Telecommunication (DECT) phones, for example, have a peak power of 250 mW. However, they operate with 400 s bursts every 10 ms, resulting in a 4% duty fact or (the percentage of the time that they emit), which if multiplied with the burst peak power gives an average value of 10 mW. DECT phones operate at 1880 - 1900 MHz an d offer voice communication. Although there is no adaptive power control for the cord less phones, it is clea r from the above that their average power is smaller than that from mobile phones operat ing at their highest power level. As far as DECT base stations (the fixed part of the device) are concerned, it must be noted that when in standby mode they transmit an 80 s burst every 10 ms, i.e. they have a duty factor of 0.8%, and, thus, an average power level of 2 mW. With the ECO DECT technology, transmission power is turned off when the handset is docked and charging and is adjusted according to the handset's distance to the base station. Two studies (K\u00fchn et al., 2007; Schmid et al., 2007) that measured DECT devices, reported that at a distance of 1 m the maxi mum power density from the base station was less than 40 mW/m 2, which is less than 1% of the ICNIRP reference levels (ICNIRP, 1998). The reported worst-case 10 g averaged spatial peak SAR was less than 0.06 W/kg (K\u00fchn et al., 2007), a value which is also seve ral times below the ICNIRP basic restriction for local exposure of 2 W/kg. In a similar way to mobile phones, the oper ation of cordless phones with 10 ms frames leads to the presence of an EL F MF magnetic field of 100 Hz. Terrestrial trunked radio Terrestrial trunked radio (TET RA) is a digital technology mainly used for the mobile communications of emergency services. It us es the frequency range of 380 - 470 MHz. The system works in a time-division multiple-access way, similarly to GSM but only with four time-slots per frequency channel and 17 frames per second. In normal two-way voice communication only one of these four time-slots is used, resulting in a 25% duty factor (percentage of time when there is tr ansmission) for the hand -portable equipment. Since the maximum power of port able devices is 1 and 3 W, the above duty factor leads to average powers of 0.25 and 0.75 W respecti vely. If the device is used for both voice and data transmission, i.e. more than one of the four available slots are occupied, the average power can increase accordingly. Co mmercially available TETRA handsets come with either helical or monopole antennas. Several numerical dosimetry studies (Dimbylow et al., 2003; Schmid et al., 2007; Wainwright, 2007) have investigated the operation of TETRA devices against the ICNIRP exposure gu idelines (ICNIRP, 1998). They have shown that the 10 g averaged SAR va lues were always below the o ccupational basi c restriction but could exceed the general public basic restri ction by up to 50%, such as in the case of a 3 W device with a helical an tenna (Dimbylow et al., 2003). In a similar manner to the GSM system there is a location update signal sent from a TETRA mobile device to the base station. The rate of the location update can be set in a wide range and largely depend s on the network operator. Th e maximum rate defined by the standard is every 10 seconds. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 37 Bluetooth devices Bluetooth devices operate at the license free ISM band of 2.45 GHz. They are used to connect devices within a shor t range wirelessly. They come at three different power classes of 1, 2.5 and 100 mW, with a range of about 1, 10 and 100 m. Hands-free kits that are connected to mobile phones operate usually at 1 mW (class 3) or 2.5 mW (class 2), such as in the case of car-kits. In a simula tion of a realistic case with a class 2 device Mart\u00ednez-B\u00fardalo et al. (2009) calculated 10 g averaged SAR values that were about 1/1000th of the ICNIRP basic restriction of 2 W/kg (ICNIRP, 1998), which is consistent with the measurements of K\u00fchn et al. (2009) who reported peak spatial 10 g SAR values lower than the sensitivity of the measuring equipment (5 mW/kg). In an earlier study, K\u00fchn et al. (2007) had measured the maximu m 10 g averaged SAR of a class 1 (100 mW) Bluetooth device to be less than 0.5 W/ kg and the electric field strength at 1 m distance at 1 V/m. Baby monitors Baby monitors are one- or two-way communication devices that that are used to transmit the sound or the picture of an infant, or to transmit the voice of an adult for calming an infant. Baby monitor operat e at 40, 446, 864, 1900 and 2450 MHz and can have peak transmit powers up to 500 mW. Schmid et al. (2007) reported maximum electric field strength of 1.1 V/m at a di stance of 1 m, whereas K\u00fchn et al. (2007) reported a higher value at the same distan ce of 3.2 V/m. In the latter study the 10 g averaged SAR was measured to be lower th an 0.1 W/kg, therefore several times below the 2 W/kg basic restriction of ICNIRP for the general population (ICNIRP, 1998). Wireless local area networks Wireless local area networks (WLAN) are form ed by devices which co nnect directly with each other or via an entry point to a wired network, known as the access point (or \"hot spot\"). In order to establish the connection wi th these devices, which can be a laptop, a peripheral computer (e.g., prin ter, digital camera, and vide o projector), a game console and so on, an antenna and a transmitter ha ve to be included. The most common WLANs operate at the license free frequency bands of 2.4 and 5 GHz. The technical standards for WLANs are produced by the Institute of Elec trical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and have evolved to provide for data rates up to 72 Mbps in a single channel. In Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Inst itute (ETSI) standard EN 300 328 limits the maximum power for any system operatin g in the 2.4 GHz band to 100 mW. Several studies have assessed exposure to de vices operating in a WLAN. In a dosimetric measurement of access points touching a flat phantom filled with tissue simulating liquid, K\u00fchn et al. (2007) reported th at the maximum 10 g averaged SAR was less than 1 W/kg. They also reported a maximum powe r density of approximately 3 mW/m 2 at a distance of 1 m and 40 mW/m2 at a distance of 0.2 m from an access point. At the same distances Foster (2007) and Schmid et al. (2007) reported 1 mW/m2 and approximately 180 mW/m2 respectively. It should be stressed that all the values given above are far below the reference level of 10 W/m2 specified in the ICNIRP gu idelines (ICNIRP, 1998). The numerical dosimetric studies of Mart\u00ednez-B\u00far dalo et al. (2009) and Findlay and Dimbylow (2010) have also confirmed that the maximu m local SAR values are within the ICNIRP basic restrictions for the general public. At 2.4 GHz, using a power of 100 mW and a duty factor of one (100%), the highest local SAR value in the head was calculated as 5.7 mW/kg (Findlay and Dimbylow, 2010). However, in reality, the duty factor is much less. In fact, for 146 individual laptops and the acce ss points from 7 networks investigated in UK schools, the maximum duty factors were 0.91% and 11.7% respectively (Khalid et al., 2011). Applying these duty factors to th e numerical dosimetric results from the previous studies would result in a peak 10 g averaged SAR value of some W/kg in the torso of a 10-year-old child. Another WLAN technology known as Worldwid e Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax) has emerged in recent years to provide connectivity at a larger range, similar to that of cellular networks (up to 50 km for fi xed stations). Joseph et al. (2012) have Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 38 reported values up to 0.3 V/m (0.24 mW/m2) for the electric field strength from WiMax applications in various indoor and outdoor environments. Recently, the Wireless Gigabi t Alliance (WiGig) was form ed, which envisions seamless connectivity between digital devices at multi- gigabit-speed data ra tes that will drive industry convergence to a single radio us ing the license free 60 GHz band. The typical application for the new WLAN technology will be multimedia streaming for high definition video and audio, as well as latency free gaming. Smart meters Smart meters are devices that allow the re mote monitoring of energy consumption (usually electricity and gas) by allowing data, such as location, consumption units and time of usage to be wirelessly transmitted to the utility company at regular intervals. Recently, a report (EPRI, 2010) and severa l papers (Tell et al., 2012; Zhou and Schneider, 2012; Foster and Tell, 2013) have been published regarding the exposure associated with smart meter us e. The devices investigated we re both an end point meter, as well as cell relays. The former includes two transmitters, of which one connects the end meter to the local area network (LAN) at a license free or licensed frequency band, while the other operates at the 2.4 GHz ISM ba nd to interact with other devices in the home constituting the home area network. The second type of smart meter includes a third type of transmitter operating usually at a cellular communications frequency (e.g., 900 or 1900 MHz) to form a wireless wide area network (WWAN), which collects the data from all the end meters and forwards them to the utility company (relay function). The percentage of time that a smart meter is ac tive transmitting data (duty factor) depends on the technology used. In the paper by Te ll et al. (2012) the maximum duty factor for end point smart meters was only 4.74% and for cell relays approximately 0.088% (due to the high data rate provided by the specific wireless technology used). Although the nominal maximum transmitted equivalent isotropy radiated power (EIRP) of the examined meters was 2.3W, the measured value for the same cell relay meter was a lot smaller (0.3 W). Given the above, Tell et al . (2012) concluded that under virtually any realistic condition of deployment with the meters operating as designed, the RF power densities of their emissions will remain, in mo st cases, two orders of magnitude or more below FCC's maximum permissible exposure (MPE) levels for the general public (6 W/m 2 at 900 MHz) both in front of and behind the meters. Wireless smart meters are not the only type used in practice. Power line communications (PLC), which allows the transmission of br oadband signals through power line cables, is also employed for the implementation of remotely reading the utility meters. Zhou and Schneider (2012) conducted a dosimetric stud y of a smart meter with the help of the Virtual Family computational phantoms models (Christ et al., 2010). They concluded that if the estimated SAR values were reduced to take into account the 0.088% duty factor the exposure guidelines woul d be met, even when the hum an placed his or her head against the meter. They also concluded that vertical displacements of the meter relative to the body never produced greater peak spatial SAR values than when the smart meter antenna was aligned with the nose. In their effort to assess exposure form a sp ecific type of a smart meter, Foster and Tell (2013) reported that it was not always possibl e to clearly distinguish emissions from the meters, since smart meters operate at simi lar power levels and in similar frequency ranges as many other digital communication s devices in common use. They reported a duty factor of 0.05-0.1% over the course of a day and concluded that smart meters \"would make only minor contributions to the total background RF radiation level inside a home, which is in any event tiny in comparison to accepted safety limits\". 3.3.2. Industrial applications Occupational exposure has been discussed in several publications and perhaps the most comprehensive text can be found in the fact sheets produced in the EU project EMF-NET: Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 39 Effects of the Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields: From Science to Public Health and Safer Workplace (see also Table 2). These fact sheets are available at: http://www.ciop.pl/CIOPPortalWAR/appman ager/ciop/pl?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=P6200 59861340178661073&html_tresc_root_id=32277&ht ml_tresc_id=300003145&html_kluc z=32274&html_klucz_spis accessed January 30, 2015. In this chapter we therefor e only briefly discuss the vari ous sources and the exposure that can occur in industrial application. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 40 Table 2. Sources and types of occupational exposu re to EMF. From EMF-NET Main Task MT2 WORKEN - Deliverable D4911 (Hansson Mild et al. 2009) Static and ELF fields Strong static magnetic fields are uncommo n in industrial applications, with some exceptions. In aluminium production the current used can reach hundreds of kA with static fields of the order of some mT close to the conductors, and the general level in the factory is up to 1 mT. The current is rather smooth and the ELF component from the ripple is of the order of some \u00b5T only. In electrolytic processes, the static magnetic field levels at the operator's locations can be approximately 8-15 mT, but here the EL F component from the ripple from the AC 11 http://www.portaleagentifisici.it/DOCUMENTI/NIR_DOCUMENTAZIONE/Final_technical_report_D49_FactSheet.pdf?lg=IT Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 41 rectification is perhaps the interesting part. The ELF MF can reach some hundreds of \u00b5T at basic frequencies of 50-300 Hz. Magnetic resonance imaging systems use magn ets typically from 0.05 T to about 3 T. Also static magnetic fields, RF fields (10-100 MHz) and rapidl y changing gradient magnetic fields occur in pu lse sequences within MRI equi pment. The maximum level is about 1 T in front of the magn et, and nurses/technicians st aying with patients can be exposed to up to 0.2 T, approaching the protec tion guideline. Howeve r, it must be borne i n m i n d t h a t I C N I R P e m p l o y s reduction factors from effe ct thresholds, when setting exposure limits, so exposure to well-char acterised EMF some way above the exposure limits is possible before effects take place. Strong static magnetic fields are used in MR I and NMR application and this is dealt with in section 3.8. RF The use of RF fields in our workplaces ha s increased rapidly during the last decade, mainly due to the increased use of wireless communication techniqu es, security devices and in medical applications. However, although workers' exposure in these cases is in general low and not in conflict with the EU directive, there are exceptions. In the office as well as in the industry and transportation environment, wireless communications are frequently used. The indoor base stations as well as different blue tooth equipment and WLAN used for ma n to machine or machine to machine communication have a low output power and therefore the possible exposure of workers is not in conflict with the regulations. Low exposure can also be expected when the sources are enclosed. Examples in the industry are plasma metallization and polyme rization, plasma deposi tion and etching and microwave heating, for instance vulcanization of rubber. These processes are normally performed in closed chambers, but ther e might be leakages especially after reconstructions or changes in process and th erefore a simple recurrent check might be a part of the assessment. The number of devices used for security pu rposes, as anti-theft and personal access control have increased rapidly in shops, libra ries, airports and restricted areas. These devices operate at different frequencies depending on which technique is used. Several work below 100 kHz, but the RFID equipmen t (Radiofrequency Iden tification Device) works at 120-154 kHz and there are also devi ces working up to 4.9 GHz. The first calculations with a numerical model of a pr egnant woman exposed to an RFID reader operating in the 900 MHz band have shown th at the peak spatial SAR remains below the basic restrictions (ICNIRP, 1998) for 1 W radi ated power and 100% duty cycle (Fiocchi et al., 2013). Electronic Article Surveillan ce (EAS) systems works usually in the MHz range both in continuous swept frequency and at fixed puls ed frequency at the detector. Normally, the personnel only pass through these areas and are therefore only ex posed during a short period and not in conflict with the regulation s. However, there migh t be devices situated near a permanent working place, for instance a cashier. In such cases actions must be taken to insure that the regulations are fulfilled. In some workplaces it will be necessary to take measurement for showing compliance wi th the EU directive. Examples of such workplaces are given below. Dielectric heaters RF sealers and glue dryers are two examples of dielectric heaters frequently used in the industry to seal plastic objects and to glue wood details. The output powers range from 1 to 200 kW. Most sealers are operated manually and require the presen ce of the operator close to the RF electrodes. In some applicatio ns, pieces of plastic ma terials to be heated must be held by hand, and the operator's ha nds will be highly ex posed to RF fields. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 42 Electric field strengths range in areas of operators typically from 1 to 300 Vm-1, and magnetic fields range from 0.1 to 20 Am-1 respectively. In workplaces where these devices are used it is necessary to perform detailed measurements of both the electric and the magn etic fields as well as contact and induced currents. These measurements of ten need to be done on a regular basis, perhaps yearly, since the radiation pattern from th e machinery changes with use. Induction heating Operators of induction furnac es and heaters are highly exposed; at 1 meter from a 1-10 kHz heating equipment, fl ux densities typically range from 0.03 to 0.5 mT, and may reach 5 mT at 10 cm. Similarly, devices working at a frequency of 50 Hz, may produce 5 mT fields at 20 cm, and over 0.1 mT at a di stance of several meters, and the guidelines (27 \u00b5T for 3 kHz -to 10 MHz and 1 mT for 50 Hz;, ICNIRP, 2010)) ) are exceeded manifold during work procedures close to furnaces. Industrial microwave oven s and microwave drying These ovens are often closed and no access is given to areas where high intensity microwave ovens can be encountered. However, there may be leakage in some cabinets and connections, and a regular maintenance program is recommended. Microwaves are also used for drying of wate r damage in buildings. These applications are usually high powered devices wi th an applicator that has so me potential leakage. Due to the high intensity microw ave energy used it is also possi ble to get exposure on the other side of the wall or floor where the applicator is located. Great care when using these devices is needed, and in some countries ther e is a demand for licensing for the use of these machines. Radar In general it would be exceptionally to fi nd cases of staff being exposed to direct emissions of radar signals from the antennas . Often measurement is not needed and the exposure assessment can be done by num erical calculations. However, during manufacturing, service and repair it may happen that staff accidentally can be exposed. Some of the radars used by the military can have a very high outp ut power and therefore are restricted in use at close range. As an example we can mention a destroyer that was equipped with so called SPY radar. This is mounted on four places around the ship and consists of phase controlled small antennas . The radar beam can be formed into a so called pencil beam and it is randomly searching the area. The power is of the order of 6 MW and with an antenna gain of 10,000 the power density at 100 m distance can reach several hundreds of kW/m2 with a peak electric field ex ceeding 10 kV/m. This can cause permanent damage to electronics. It has been confirmed that in a quiet environment humans can hear radar pulses (Chou et al., 1982; Elder and Chou 2003) . Experimental studies have shown that the hearing is caused by thermoelastic pressure wave s generated in the head due to the inhomogeneous absorption of the radar pulses . Other effects on man from a short term exposure, besides feelin g heat, are not known. Broadcasting and other communications Radio and TV broadcasting installations are us ually safe workplaces. However, there is a potential for involuntary, accidental intense exposure of staff. In most of the cases, technical staff working at radi o/TV broadcasting equipment, are technically well informed and trained. However, when working near an t e n n a s w i t h r e p a i r o r a d j u s t m e n t d u r i n g broadcasting, occupational exposure is likely to be in conflict with the EU directive. These situations should be avoided. Rooftop work ers near base stations antennas might be exposed to RF fields about 900- 2000 MHz. Ex amples of such workers are sheet metal workers, chimney-sweeper and painter. In these cases the emission properties are well defined and simple instructions are more relevant than measurements. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 43 ELF In arc welding, electric currents up to 1 kA can be used. The cable carrying the welding current can touch the welder or even be wrapped around a shoulder of the welder. Magnetic flux densities are approximately 1-2 mT at the surface of the welding cable and power supply, exposing the we lders to strong ELF fields. Handheld electric tools We are not aware of any new publications deal ing with the exposure from handheld tools, but there is a need to clarif y these questions with a more systematic measurement of different tools. It is not straight forward to measure EMF from handheld tools. It is clear that they are surrounded by a magnetic field when used; the machines can use up to a kilowatt of power which leads to currents in the wiring of the order of a few amperes. B fields in the range of a few hundreds of \u00b5T are not uncommon measured at close distance, and as such they do not exceed international guid elines. The problem in exposure assessment arises when we start looking at the average time of the ex posure. Hansson Mild et al. (2009) brought up the example of a handheld electric drill. The machine usually draws 10 times more current during the first few periods and the corre sponding magnetic field is also strongest then. Standard No. EN 62233: 2008 states that the measurement should be taken at a certain distance from the mach ine, and for the first 200 ms from the start- up the machine should be negl ected. But since the limits for exposure to ELF fields are set to protect against nerve excitation, which can happen even within a half-period of the power frequency alternating curre nt (AC), i.e. during exposu re of <10 ms (Reilly, 1998), this then becomes very questionable. The question of average time needs also to be discussed in connection with exposure assessment of for instance a spot welding ma chine. Usually the limits are set in root- mean-square (rms) values for field strengths, but should averaging be over one second or a shorter time period? Various standard s give different answ ers, but since most commercially available instruments use one second as averaging time, this is the most commonly used period. In contrast, Dire ctive 2013/35/EU 2013/35/EU does not specify any averaging time for frequencies <100 kHz. IEEE Standard No. C.95.6:2002 gives the rms averaging time as the longer of 0.2 s or 5 cycles (up to 10 s) ((IEEE, 2002).2010). However, even the use of th is standard might be problematic. An assessment of exposure produced by a spot welding machine is an example. The total welding time, i.e. the time when the curr ent is on, is typically shorter than one second, even only a few periods of 50 Hz (i.e. the order of tens or hu ndreds of 1 ms) (see further Hansson Mild et al., 2009). The whole weld is over be fore the averaging time is up. 3.3.3. Medical applications Diathermy Diathermy is a technique used in physiother apy for the treatment of acute or chronic orthopaedic and inflammatory conditions. Its therapeutic effect de rives from the heat produced in the tissues, due to the absorp tion of electromagnetic energy at high frequencies, and from the influence of tran smembrane ionic activity at low frequencies (Macc\u00e0 et al., 2008). Short-wa ve diathermy devices operat e at 13.56 or 27.12 MHz in a continuous or pulsed mode. Microwave di athermy is applied mainly at 2.45 GHz, although there are devices work ing at 434 MHz, as well. The st udies for the evaluation of exposure due to diathermy have mainly fo cused on the occupational exposure of physiotherapists. A measurement campaign in 20 physiotherapy departments across the UK operating 36 diathermy units has shown that at distances of 0.15 - 0.2 m th e electric field strength for continuous wave operation was generally over 500 V/m and sometimes as high as 5000 V/m for capacitive equipment; the magnetic fi eld strength at the same distances was 0.5 - 2.0 A/m (Martin et al., 1990), leading the authors to propose that the operator should keep a distance of at least 1 m from the unit, cables and electrod es when talking to a Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 44 p a t i e n t d u r i n g c o n t i n u o u s w a v e t r e a t m e n t s . H o w e v e r , i n a m o r e r e c e n t s u r v e y o f 1 0 short-wave diathermy units op erating at 27.12 MHZ, it was found that stray fields fell below the reference levels fo r occupational exposure give n in the ICNIRP guidelines (ICNIRP, 1998) at 2 m for continuous wa ve capacitive and at 1 m for inductive equipment; another 0.5 was re quired before the fields fell below guidelines for other personnel (Shields et al., 2004). For mi crowave diathermy, measurements of approximately 11 devices have shown that if operators stand at 1 m away from the 2.45 GHz and 434 MHz applicators and not in the vicinity of large metallic objects, which could reflect radiation, they should not be expose d to fields above the reference levels for occupational exposure (Macc\u00e0 et al., 2008). A numerical study has shown that overexposu re of tissues, such as the eye lenses, central nervous system and the gonads, can occur in a patient receiving short-wave diathermy at 27.12 MHz, if certain output power levels are exceeded for specific applicators, during the treatment of the head , the shoulder or the hip (Leitgeb et al., 2010). Electrosurgery Radiofrequency energy is used in several surgical procedur es. In most cases the setup used entails a small active electrode as the a pplicator of high curre nt density and a flat electrode (known also as the 'ground' or 'dis persive' electrode) fr om which the current returns to the generator (monopolar configurat ion). The active electr ode acts as a cutting or coagulation instrument by applying sinusoi dal or pulsed waveforms in the current in the frequency range of 0.3-5 MHz. Currently, a widely used minimally invasive electrosurgical procedure is radiofrequency ablation, which is routinely applied in oncology, cardiology and otorhinolaryngology. In one study 6 electrosurgica l devices were measured (De Marco and Maggi, 2006). It was found that near the equipment the meas ured fields were rather high, but at a distance of 0.5 m from the device the electr ic field strength fell to 32 - 57 V/m and the magnetic field strength to 0.2 - 0.8 A/m. A ccording to the authors, in the worst case (maximum reading obtained) a surgeon's hands are exposed to an RF wave with magnetic field strength of 0. 75 A/m and electric field streng th of 400 V/m. However, it should be noted that stray radiation is prod uced not only by the electrosurgical unit but also by the cables (L iljestrand et al., 2003). Active medical devices in and on the human body Active medical devices operating inside or on the human body can be classified into two categories, namely diagno stic and therapeutic. The first category includes the devices used for physiological monitoring, which find the most applications in medicine . Such devices are inserted in to the patient's body for the in vivo monitoring of critical physiological information, such as heart function (electrocardiograph ECG), hemodynamics (v (blood glucose level) al., 2004; Paradi so et al., 2008; Klueha et al., 2005). This category also includes the miniaturized me dical image capturing devices, such as the capsule endoscope, which are tr ansiently inserted into the body (Liao et al., 2010; Cohen and Klevens, 2011). The second category of devices includes those which are used for the treatment of a disease, a dysfunction or an impairment, such as various neuromuscular microstimulators (Ghovanloo and Najafi, 2007; Kane et al., 2011), drug infusion pumps (Meng and Hoang, 2012) an d other microelectro mechanical systems (MEMS) based devices, as well as cochlear implants (Eshraghi et al., 2012) and visual prostheses (Ong and Cruz, 2011). Many active medical devices in side or on the human body (such as cardiac pacemakers or breathing stimulators) commu nicate with other implants or external control units), in order to exchange commands, transfer data or, even, receive power. This process is c a l l e d t e l e m e t r y . S o f a r , a w i d e r a n g e o f radio frequency bands have been used by Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 45 medical device manufacturers for this purpos e. However, the two frequency bands, which are most often used for medical systems ar e the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) bands (401-406 MHz) and the Industri al, Scientific, Medical (ISM) bands (e.g., devices with the protocols of Bluetooth in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and ZigBee in the 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz ISM bands for Europe). In telemetry, both inductive coupling and radiofrequency radiation are employ ed for implementing telemetry. Unfortunately, despite the increased use of acti ve medical devices inside or on the body, the Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR), the current density, or the fields inside the tissues are not always reported , although they should form a design consideration (Q Fang, 2010). However, there are also reports of implanted devices eith er for biotelemetry (Scanlon et al., 1999; Shiba et al., 2008; Si ngh et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2009) or for wireless power transmission (O'Handley et al., 2008; Shib a et al., 2002; Zan et al., 2010), which mention the SAR and current induce d in the patient tissues. They also give an indication of the maximum power or duty factor values that need to be obeyed to comply with ICNIRP guidelines (ICNIRP, 1998). Cosmetic medicine Radiofrequency energy is used in several applications of cosmetic (aesthetic) medicine, which include skin tightening and rejuvenation , cellulite reduction, acne scars treatment and hair removal (Sadick et al., 2004; Bel enky et al., 2012; Lolis and Goldberg, 2012). The frequency of operation of the various de vices used in this area is up to 10 MHz (Belenky et al., 2012). When RF energy is used alone (not in conjunct ion with light), the main mechanism of action is the heating of dermis. Partial collagen denaturation is caused because of the heat, which results in collagen contraction and thickening. The natural inflammatory wound healing response triggers neocollagene sis and further skin contraction (Lolis and Goldberg, 2012). Unfortunately, there is not much informatio n about the exposure of the operator of devices used in clinical dermatology. As fa r as the patients are concerned, the energy fluences can reach up to 144 J/cm 2 over 1 cm2 of area (Lolis and Goldberg, 2012). Transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique, based on the induction of an electric field inside the brain by the application of an extern al magnetic field. This field can depolarize neurons or modulate cortical excitability, by ch oosing the appropriate parameters of stimulation, even beyond the duration of the treatment session. This has behavioural consequences and therapeutic potential (Rossi et al., 2009). One experimental study has assessed the ex posure of the operator during a TMS treatment session: With a figure-8 coil, a pu lse repetition frequency of 5 pulses/s and stimulus intensity of 60-80% of the stim ulator's maximum output, the worker's reference levels for the magnetic field were transgressed at a distance of about 0.7 m from the surface of the co il (Karlstr\u00f6m et al., 2006). In a second numerical study, it was co nfirmed that the staff working with TMS treatments can become exposed to magnet ic field levels exceeding the ICNIRP restrictions (ICNIRP, 1998). It was concluded that the figure-8 coil results in a smaller stray magnetic field and lower induced curre nt density in the TMS operator compared with the round coil. The authors suggest that the operating staff should stand at least 1.1 m away from TMS coil and propose the use of robot controlled TMS systems instead of handheld devices (Lu and Ueno, 2010). Electromagnetic Fields used in MRI The electromagnetic fields used in MRI scanners have been thoroughly investigated by for instance Capstick et al. (2008), and have been discussed in length in a review by McRobbie (2012); therefore only a brief summary is given here. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 46 Static field MRI scanners in clinical use have supercon ducting magnets generally with cylindrical bores and provide static fields with magnetic flux density of 1.5 -3 T. A smaller number of ultra-high field MR systems are in use in research institutions worldwide and these use static fields up to 9.4 T. Due to the active shielding of the static field, especially for scanners with higher field strengths, the fi eld drops quickly with a distance from the scanner, producing a large gradient of the stat ic field so that the field may only become significant within 0.5 m from the bore opening. There is a requirement that the 0.5 mT contour around the magnet is marked, or acce ss to it restricted, to prevent interference with implanted cardiac pacemakers and cardiove rter defibrillators and to avoid accidental release of iron containing objects into the magnetic field. This contour is usually contained within the MRI scanner room. Static fi elds may interact dire ctly with tissues via magnetic susceptibility causing differential forces on tissues, or by interaction with nuclear spins. Furthermore, motion of tissue (a conducting medium) in a gradient of the static field or rotation in a field will induce electric currents in the body. So-called open systems provide much greater access to the patient, facilitating, for example, interventional procedures. Such systems use static fields typically around 0.2 - 1 T. The static magnetic field is always on, inde pendent of whether an MRI procedure is being performed or not. That means that everyone moving around the scanner will effectively be exposed to a space- varying magnetic field (cause by motion in th e static field and its gradient). Switched gradient field The switched gradient fields used for imag e encoding come from three different coils used to create linear gradients of the magn etic field in three di rections within the scanner. Switched gradient fields (time varyin g magnetic fields), are deliberately created which must be distinguished from the inevitable time-independent gradients of the static field that exist where the magnetic field fa lls away around the sca nner. These switched gradient fields are switched on and off to sele ct the region of diagnostic interest and to spatially encode the MR signals. The faster the imaging sequence, the greater the rate of change of the gradient fields required. The am plitude of this is of the order of mT with fast rise and fall times of tens to hundreds of \u00b5s. Typically, the grad ient field strengths in the region can be 25-50 mT/m and maximum sl ew rates (the peak amplitude divided by the rise time) can be 100 - 200 T/m/s within the imaging field of view. Gradient fields in modern systems can be as high as 100 mT/m with slew rates of 800 T/m/s. The gradient waveform is complex and not periodic but can be characterized by primary frequencies in the kHz range. The limiting factor for the patient's exposure is peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) due to electric potentials induced across the nerve fibres. A limit has been set at about 50 T/s to avoid nerve ex citation in the patient. The occupational exposure to the switched gradie nt field will be significant es pecially close to the bore. In Wil\u00e9n et al. (2010) the rms valu e of the field was measured to be up to 0.1 mT at 0.3 m distance from the centre of the bore. From their data dB/dt values of 70 T/s could be calculated at the same position. The magnitude of the magnetic field gradient and its time derivate depends on which pulse sequence is used. Radiofrequency field The RF field is usually created with a body coil integrated into the scanner that produces a circularly polarised B 1 field. For cylindrical bore systems at 1.5 or 3 T, this is usually a birdcage coil in order to provide a region around the iso-centre of the scanner where the B1-field is spatially uniform. For open MR scanners with the static field vertical, the RF B 1 field is often produced by a pair of planar coils placed above and below the patient. Only the magnetic field component is required for the MRI. The E field is generally small except in the vicinity of the coil windings . The occupational exposure to the RF B 1 field will in general be low since the field falls off rapidly outside the transmit coil. An Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 47 exception will be staff carrying out interventional procedures, particularly in open scanners, where hands and arms, and possibly th e head may be exposed to levels similar to those for the patients. The RF field has a frequency of around 42 MHz/T, which means that for a 3 T scanner the frequency is around 126 MHz. There are limi t values for SAR for patients (ref) and in normal operation mode the whole body SAR should be below 2 W/kg, whilst for the 1st controlled level the SAR should be below 4 W /kg. Different RF pulse sequences are used depending on what contrast is required. This leads to different SAR values for each pulse sequence, and typically during a clinical sca n many different sequences are used to get the appropriate information. However, the intensity of each pulse can be substantial. Measurements show that the peak values fo r the RF B1 field can reach 10 A/m and more, and with a duty cycle on about 1%, the SAR valu es in the pulses are rather high. This is an area where very little information is availa ble since almost all research on RF has been dealing with the average va lues and thermal effects. The RF field and the switched gradient fi elds are only turned on during the MRI procedure. Only professionals that stay in the room during the procedure will be exposed to these fields. The problem of conducting an exposure asse ssment for epidemiological studies has been discussed in a recent publication by a COST BM0704 group, see further Hansson Mild et al. (2012). Exposure near MRI machines Several new papers have been looking into th e occupational exposure of persons working with MRI. De Vocht et al. (2009a) measured pe rsonal exposure to both static and time- varying magnetic fields, and th ey found that while the time-weighted exposure levels are below the ICNIRP guidelines, the peak exposure limits we re exceeded during certain procedures. Karpowicz et al. (2011) and Karpowicz and Gr yz (2012) studied the exposure to static magnetic field (SMF) during operations of MRI scanners. Measurements near a 1.5 T MRI magnets showed that the SMF exposure from various scanners depends on both SMF of magnets and scanners design, as well as on wo rk organization. A routine examination of one patient the radiographer was exposed to SMF exceeding 0.5 mT for approximately 1.5-7 min, and up to 1.3 min to SMF exc eeding 70 mT. The mean values (B mean) of exposure to SMF are 5.6-85 mT, with a mean of 30 mT. One of the main problems with the risk asse ssment of work near an MRI scanner is the induction of an electric field in the body when moving near the bore. Chiampi and Zilberti (2011) have addressed this problem and developed a computational procedure to evaluate the internal E fi eld. For further details see Wang et al. (2012). 3.3.4. Security applications Electronic article surveillance systems Electronic article surveillance systems (EAS) are widely used in shops and libraries to prevent theft. However, reports on the magn etic fields around the EAS gates are very few in the literature. There are three components in an EAS, i.e. a detection unit (e.g., in the form of walk-through gates), a tag to be detected, and a tag deactivator. The main categories of EAS are also three, namely , electromagnetic systems (10 Hz - 20 kHz), acousto-magnetic systems (20 - 135 kHz), an d radiofrequency systems (1 - 20 MHz) (Joseph et al., 2012). Trulsson et al. (2007) measured the magnetic fields around 11 EAS in Swedish shops and found values of up to 536 A/m (673 T) and 118 A/m (148 T) next to an electromagnetic and an acoust o-magnetic system, respective ly. Both values were above the reference levels from the ICNIRP (1998) guidelines for the ge neral public at the frequency of operation of the EAS. Joseph et al. (2012) measured the magnetic field at Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 48 several points near six EAS - two from each category - and also concluded that the maximum values were up to 13, 8 and 1.8 ti mes higher than the reference values from the ICNIRP guidelines (1998; 2004) for the electromagne tic, acousto-magnetic and radiofrequency systems respectively. In particular, they measured rms (root-mean- square) values of up to 148 A/m (186 T), 42.4 A/m (53.3 T), and 0.14 A/m for the three EAS categories. In a simulation study of Ma rt\u00ednez-B\u00fardalo et al. (2010) it was shown that SAR and induced current density were kept below the basic restrictions (ICNRIP, 1998) even when the radiofrequency EAS operat ing at 10 MHz had a maximum magnetic field close to the maximum value measured by Trulsson et al. (2007), which exceeded the reference levels (ICNIRP, 1998). Conducted electrical weapons Conducted electrical weapons (CEW), also ca lled neuromuscular inca pacitation devices, ('tasers') use electrical currents to disrupt th e voluntary control of muscles by stimulating involuntary muscle contractions . Such devices can be used in a pain compliance mode, whereby they are held against the target, so as to cause pain but not incapacitate it. The amplitude and time course of pulses delive red by the CEW may vary considerably; the net charge delivered may be in the order of some tens of C (Reilly et al., 2009). In a recent review of the lit erature on the acute pathophysiological influences of CEW, Kunz et al. (2012) concluded th at the majority of current me dical research could not find any acute clinical relevant effects during or after professional use of such devices on human subjects. However, they also note that in most of the current literature on CEW, tests were done on subjects with no significant medica l history and the CEW devices were applied as indicated by the manufact urer. Furthermore, no testing has been performed on persons intoxica ted by illegal substances. Th erefore, possible CEW-related injuries or pathophysiological changes cannot be excluded in the fi eld, where the targets often receive multiple shocks in extreme situations. A numerical study of Leitgeb et al. (2010) has shown that the maximum cardiac rms current density amounted to 7.7 kA/m 2. This is higher than the values published so far and by far outweighs the reduce d stimulatory efficiency of th e short pulses compared to the sinusoidal fibrillation threshold. Theref ore, the authors concluded that ventricular fibrillation risk from CEW cannot generally be excluded. 3.3.5. Power generation and transmission Photovoltaic arrays Public concerns about the potential health e ffects from magnetic fields emanating from installations of photovoltaic arrays for po wer generation had alre ady appeared in the early 90's. The measurements performed in la rge scale installations of DC photovoltaic modules in the USA (Jennings et al., 1993) have resulted in magnetic field values of up to 18.3 T at the closest distance to transforme rs and inverters for 60 Hz. This value became larger (27.4 T) for a broader frequency range (40 - 800 Hz). The measurement of magnetic fields in the abov e frequency range at a distance of less than 2.5 cm from the inverter case of an AC ph otovoltaic module gave a value of over 0.2 mT (Jennings et al., 1997). Unfortunately, the literature on the magnetic fields from the components of roof-mounted photovoltaic modules is scarce and no conclusions can be drawn regarding their contribution to pers onal exposure to ELF MF. Wind turbines Limited research has been performed on the EMF generated by wind turbines, although their proliferation has been fast in the re cent years. In a pilot study conducted in Bulgaria, Israel et al. (2011) measured both el ectric and magnetic fiel ds in a wind energy farm comprising 55 wind turbines of the Vestas V90 3 MW type. Measurements were made on the border of the populated areas/ settlements at 1.80 m above the ground and it was found that electromagneti c fields are not emitted during operation of wind turbines Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 49 or they are so small that they are insignificant compared to the values to be found in other measurements in residential areas and homes. This conclusion was confirmed by McCallum et al. (2014) who had performed meas urements in a wind energy farm around 15 Vestas 1.8 MW wind turbines. The author s of the study mention that the magnetic field levels detected at the base of the tu rbines under both the 'high wind' (turbine generating power) and 'low wind' (turbine dr awing power from the grid for maintenance) conditions were low (mean = 0.9 mG) and ra pidly diminished with distance, becoming indistinguishable from backgrou nd within 2 m of the base. Transformers and power substations Public concern on the exposure to ELF elec tric and magnetic fields (EMF) has mainly focused on power transmission lines. However, the exposure to EMF from transformers installed inside residential buildings has attr acted the interest of many researchers in recent years. Keikko et al. (2006) investigated magnetic fi elds, especially the harmonic components, in electric distribution (20 to 0.4 kV) substations installed indoors. They extrapolated their measurements to calculat e residential exposure immediately above the transformer room and reported a large contri bution of the harmon ics in the exposure. In a survey of residential ex posure at 50 Hz from 10 to 0.4 kV transformers in Hungary (Szab\u00f3 et al., 2007) the mean magnetic fiel d value in the apartm ents just above the transformer rooms was 0.66 T, when spot measurements we re taken in a grid of 0.5 m step. In a similar study in Finland (Ilone n et al., 2008) spot measurements were performed in 30 residential buil dings with transformer stations installed in them. In the apartments exactly above the inst allation a mean value of 0.62 T was measured, whereas the mean value was 0.21 T in flats on the same floor but not exactly above the transformer. The measurements conducted in 41 apartments within 10 buildings in Israel (Hareuveny et al., 2011) resulted in an average magnetic fiel d at the height of 0.5 m of 0.40 T for the apartments above the transformer station and 0.06-0.12 T in all other locations of apartments. In Switzerland (R\u00f6\u00f6s li et al., 2011), the mean magnetic field in 8 apartments directly above or neighbouring wall-to-wall with the transformer station room was 0.59 T. In another 10 apartments which touched the transformer room at a corner or edge the average magnetic field was 0.14 T. In Bulgaria (Zaryabova et al., 2013), the average magnetic field measured at a height of 0.5 m, in 23 apartments that have rooms directly above and next to tran sformers (\"exposed apartments\") was 0.37 T. In other apartments (in the same building) the aver age value was 0.24 T on the same floor like the exposed apartments, and 0.03 T on higher floors. Joseph et al. (2009) performed magnetic and electric field measurements at positions accessible to the general public around tw o 150-36/11 kV substations. They measured momentary magnetic field values within the range of 0.05 to 13 T and electric field values within the range 0.1 to 270 V/m. 3.3.6. Transportation Exposure to electromagnetic field can be encountered when usin g different modes of transportation. Many studies have addressed the ELF magnetic field in trains. Nordenson et al. (2001) looked at railroad engine dr ivers and found that they are exposed to relatively high ELF magnetic fields (MF), ranging from a few to over a hundred \u00b5T instantaneous values, and wi th mean values over the working day from 2-15 \u00b5T depending on the type of engine. R\u00f6\u00f6sli et al. (2007) found that for Swiss railway drivers mean exposure could be as high as 21 \u00b5T. Much lower values were found in an Italian study by Contessa et al. (2010). The average exposure to ELF MF was in the order of 1-2 T, with higher levels (few \u00b5T) only for one engine; occasionally in hot spot s, close to wiring or specific equipment, the field values could reach several tens of \u00b5T. Halgamuge et al. (2010) investigated the exposu re values at the floor level and seat level in Australian trams and trains in urban and su burban areas, and in a hybrid car. The MF Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 50 strength was measured at different points inside and near the moving vehicles. The results are far lower than the ICNIRP recommended levels. A large comprehensive summary report on lo w frequency EMFs enco untered in different modes of transport has recently been presen ted by the Swedish Radiation Safety Agency, authored by Anger (2010). The agency has - as a part of the environmental monitoring - measured EMF in buses, cars, long-distance and commuter trains, trams, underground trains, marine vessels and ai rcrafts. The measurements we re performed at randomly chosen places where passenger s are present. All of the le vels measured are well below the limits for general public exposure. The highest levels were measured in trains, where the mean MF strength ranged from 2 to 27 \u00b5T , depending on the type of train and coach. On single occasions, measurements in commute r trains showed a magn etic field strength of up to 80 \u00b5T. Following the work by Vedhol m and Hamnerius (1997) who show ed for the first time that steel-belted tires in cars could produce an EL F MF inside the car, Milham et al. (1999) looked into this in more detail. They found that the magnetic fields emanate from radial tires due to the presence of reinforcing belt s which are made of magnetized steel wire. When the tires spin, they generate ELF MF, usually below 20 Hz. The fundamental frequency of these fields is determined by the tire rotation rate and has a sinusoidal waveform with a high harmonic content. The field strength can exceed 2.0 \u00b5T at seat level in the passenger compartment of vehicles. Tell et al. (2012) measured the magnetic field in electric an d gasoline-powered cars. For seven electric cars, the geom etric mean (GM) of all meas urements was 0.095 \u00b5T with a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 2.66, compared to 0.051 \u00b5T for four gasoline- powered cars (GSD=2.11). 3.3.7. Household appliances Microwave ovens Microwave ovens are among the most widesp r e a d d e v i c e s a t h o m e . T h e y w o r k w i t h ultra-high frequency (UHF) radiation in th e frequency range of microwaves (0.3 - 300 GHz), hence the device name. Almost all of microwave ovens work at 2.45 GHz. The radiation is absorbed by food and heats it. However, the food itself does not radiate when it is inside the oven or after it is removed from it. By design and construction, although the radiation is confined inside the metal casi ng of the microwave oven with the help of a metal-wired glass door, there is still some radiation leakage from it. This is higher close to the casing, but falls off rapidly with distan ce, except in the case when the door seals are defective or dirty. In an early syst ematic study (Matthes, 1992) 130 microwave ovens from 20 different manufacturers were measured to determine their leakage radiation at 5 cm distance. Depending on their maximum operating power (300-1200 W) the measured values rang ed between 0.2 and 1 W/m2. In a more recent study (Alhekail, 2001), which included 106 devices, both in hous eholds and restaurant s, the device power reached up to 4.4 kW. However, it was not the powerful devices that gave the highest leakage radiation of 60 W/m2, but a 10-year-old device. In general it was found that older devices leaked more radiation. Ne vertheless, the median value for leakage radiation was only 1.6 W/m2 and, in agreement with theory, the power intensity of the radiation fell in both studies fast with distance following the inverse square law. An interesting aspect of microwav e ovens is that, apart from the microwave radiation they work with, they are a source of static (a permanent magnet is used to power the magnetron) and low frequency magnetic fiel ds. The latter were measured at several distances from 34 microwave ovens and amounted to some tens of microtesla (27 17 T) at 5 cm, but dropped to some microtesla (1.7 0.6 T) at 50 cm (Preece et al., 1997). Induction hobs Another household appliance used for preparing food is the induction cooker, known also as an induction hob. Induction cookers have been used by professionals in restaurants and other industrial environmen ts for a long time due to their advantages, which include Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 51 shorter cooking times, energy saving an d lower risk of burns and fire. Their environmentally friendly profile has increased their popularity as domestic appliances. They operate with magnetic f i e l d s b e t w e e n 2 0 k H z a n d 1 0 0 k H z , m a i n l y i n t h e intermediate frequency (IF) range which indu ce currents in special cooking vessels for heating them and the contained food. If the cooking zone is not completely covered by the cooking vessel, the possibility of stray magnetic field reaching the position of a person standing near the appliance exists. Mo reover, if the vessel is touched by a person during the cooking process, a small current (leakage current) may flow through the body of that person. In some cases output is re gulated by on-off modulation at a typical frequency of 0.5 Hz (one pulse every two seconds). The technical standard for induction cookers (EN 62233) by IEC (2005) specifies that the reference value of 6.25 \u00b5T recommended by IC NIRP (1998) should be met at a distance of 30 cm from the cooking field when one cook ing zone is operated with a cooking vessel large enough and centred on the cooking zone. However, it is not always possible to keep this distance from the appliance, particularly when pregnant women, children and people of small stature are standing next to the cooker. Therefore, meas urements have also been performed at closer distances and have shown (Christ et al., 2012) that directly in front of the device cabinet th e magnetic field can even exc eed the occupational limit of 30.7 T at the frequency of 20 kHz. Induction hobs are at the top of the list in generated magnetic fields, despite the fa ct that the highest magnetic fields are usually emitted by motor-driven appliances, tools and kitchenware (Leitgeb et al., 2008). Electric heating systems Electric floor heating systems comprise an arrangement of heating cables or films incorporated in the thickness of the floor below a covering. He at is produced by the flow of electric current through the incorporated heating elements. This current may generate low-frequency magnetic fields around the he ating elements, the fi eld strength varying according to the type of heating cable used . State-of-the-art electric floor heating systems produce only negligible magnetic fi elds. These systems empl oy two-core heating cables in which the magnetic fi elds of the adjacent supply and return conductors cancel each other out. On the contrary, single-c ore heating cables carry a single heating conductor and the supply and return conductors in this type of system may lie far apart. As the magnetic fields of th e two conductors cannot fully offset each other, a residual magnetic field persists. Storage heating systems use th e thermal mass of the floor to store heat energy. The heating cables are laid in the bottom section of an approximately 10 cm thick cement layer. The thermal store is normally heated up during the night using off-peak electricity. The stored energy is then pa ssively released to the space as radiant heat during the daytime. Low-frequency magnetic fields occur during the he at-up phase, i.e. normally during the night. Direct systems, which employ a thin screed as a short-term thermal store, respond more immediately to temperature fluctuations. Ener gy is passively released as radiant heat with only a short time lag, the short-term thermal store being replenished throughout the daytime as required. Low-frequency magnetic fi elds occur during the heat-up cycles, i.e. in most cases throughout the day. Electric floor heating systems are the reason fo r higher magnetic fiel d values at the level of the floor in Swedish residences, accordin g to a recent study (Hamnerius et al., 2011). Mobile electrical radiators start operating wh en their temperature falls below the pre-set temperature of a thermostat by storing heat in the water or oil they contain. During their operation a low frequency (50/60 Hz) magnet ic field is produced in their immediate vicinity with a value of less than 1 T. The magnetic field rapidl y falls with di stance from the appliance. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 52 Toys and playthings Radio-controlled toys include cars, boat s, planes, helicopters and scale railway locomotives. Radio-controlled devices often ha ve a transmitter that is the controller and have control sticks, triggers, switches and dial s at the user's fingertips. The receiver is mounted in the toy itself and receives and processes the signal fr om the transmitter, translating it into signals th at are sent to the servos. Hi gh-end toys use pulse-code modulation (PCM) to provide a computerised digital bit-stream signal to the receiving device, instead of analogue-t ype pulse modulation. There is a large range of operating frequencies and output powers for the radio- controlled toys available in the market. In terms of exposure assessment, each device needs to be cons idered on the basis of its own output power and frequency of operation. Certain playthings, such as pl asma balls, emit the highest el ectric fields found in our living environment in the intermediate freque ncy (IF) range. These products, are devices that use high voltage to create ionized light discharges. Meas urements have shown (Alanko et al., 2011) that the recommended re ference levels for the general public are exceeded at distances <1.2 m, and that th e contact currents in the hand may be two times higher than recommended by the general public guidelines. 3.3.8. THz technologies In the literature, there are various definition s of the THz frequency range, depending on the application under consideration. For telecommunication engineers this frequency range spans from 0.3 to 3 THz (1 THz = 10 12 Hz) and is also known as the Tremendously High Frequency (THF) range (Tanenbaum 2002); frequencies above this range are considered in the optical radiation spectrum. In the field of biomed ical engineering the THz frequency range may include up to 30 THz (Shumyatsky and Alfano, 2011). For the purposes of this Opinion, we shall define the THz radiation as covering 0.3 to 20 THz, i.e. having a wavelength between 1 mm and 15 m, spanning the spectr al interval between the millimetre wave and the infrared regions. From a spectroscopic point of view, biologically important collective modes of protein, RNA and DNA vibrate at THz frequencies, whereas polar liquids like water strongly absorb THz frequencies due to rotation and collectiv e modes. These features make THz imaging very attractive for medical applications. As a matter of fact, many organic substances have characteristic absorption spectra in th e THz frequency range, while the high water absorption coefficient, although limiting penetration depth in biological tissues, allows for extreme contrast between less or high hydr ated tissues to be employed for medical imaging. Another valuable property of such fields is their ability to pass through a wide range of materials, like plastics and cardboard, making it possible to inspect packaged goods and opening the way to non-destructive and non-in vasive inspection of packages like mail envelopes and laggings for manufacturing, qu ality control, and process monitoring (Jansen et al., 2010). Radiation at this frequency range has been a subject of study fo r astrophysicists for many years, because approximately one-half of the total luminosity and 98% of the photons emitted since the Big Bang fall into the submillimeter and fa r-infrared (Mueller, 2003). It has also been used by scientist s in the laser fusion community for the diagnostics of plasmas. Howe ver, for many years, THz sources were not generally available, and this gap has only recently beg un to be filled by a variety of high quality sources and detectors of THz field. This ha s provided great advances in research and continues to enable further applications to be investigated. The power of THz sources ranges from a few nW to a few W (Shumyatsky and Alfano, 2011). The opportunities for THz science in chemistr y and biology are wide ranging from label- free sensors to cell signalling, cell and ti ssue imaging (Ramundo Orlando and Gallerano, 2009). Furthermore, THz technolo gies are recently being incr easingly integrated into a host of practical medical, military and security applications. For instance, THz imaging Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 53 and sensing techniques are presently being tested at major airports for security screening purposes (Luukanen et al., 2013), at major medical centres for cancer and burn diagnosis (Taylor et al., 2008; Woodwa rd et al., 2003), and at border patrol checkpoints for identification of drugs, explosives and we apons (Federici et al., 2005; Dobroiu et al., 2006; L uukanen et al., 2013). Moreover, THz radiation is being considered in telecommunications due to several advantages of THz communication links (Federici and Moeller, 2010): - THz communications have the potentia l for increased bandwidth capacity compared to microwave systems. They are i nherently more directional than microwave or millimetre (MMW) links due to less free-space diffraction of the waves. - Compared to infrared (IR), there is lower attenuation of THz radiation under certain atmospheric conditions (e.g., fog). Time-varying fluctuations in the real refractive index of the atmospheric path lead to scintill ation effects in wirele ss communications. For THz radiation, these scintillation effects are smaller than for IR radiation, allowing THz to provide longer links compared to wireless IR . Therefore, THz commu nication links are a viable solution for the last mile and first mile problem (The last and first mile problem refers to establishing broadband, multiuser local wireless connections to high speed networks, such as fibre-optical). As an exampl e, THz wireless links co uld be used as part of the last mile transmission of multiple channel high definition television (HDTV) signals. Overall, although THz a pplications are in their early stage of development, it is expected that general public exposure will take place in the near future, mainly due to security and telecommunications applications . Occupational exposure wi ll also increase as THz imaging systems will be developed and de ployed in manufacturing chains for non- destructive quality control. This has raised concerns about health risks and biological effects associated with this type of radiation. Furthermor e, the current recommendation of safety limits has been determined usin g extrapolated estimates from neighbouring spectral regions of millimetre wave on the lo wer frequency side, and optical radiation on the upper frequency side (ICNIRP, 1996, 1998). There are no sp ecific guidelines generated for this frequency range. In a ddition, only a few st udies have collected experimental data to support these standards. 3.3.9. Discussion on exposure to EMF Human exposure to EMF occurs from many di fferent sources and in various everyday or exceptional situations. Man-made static fields are mainly found in occupational settings, such as close to MRI scanners, although DC high-voltage transmi ssion lines are being constructed which will expose larger part s of the population to static EMF. EMF in the ELF range are ubiquitous. The main sources of these fields pertaining to the general public are household appliances and po wer lines. The electrical appliances that generate higher magnetic fields around them are those that use a motor for their operation. However, in recent years attentio n has been directed to wards people living next to power transformers in stalled inside residential build ings. It appears that long- term exposure to ELF magnetic field of thes e people (assessed with spot measurements) can exceed several tenths of T. Today practically all electrical equipmen t uses modern electronics instead of transformers, although the latter are still be ing used because of galvanic insulation. Examples include all the switched power supplie s to laptops and simila r devices, chargers to mobile phones etc. In new welding machines there is also a shift to modern electronics with the introduction of IGBT transistors. Welding machines are using more and more a power factor correction that allows to rectify the shape of the current closer to a sinusoid. This, in turn, leads to a ripple current in the tens of kHz range instead of the earlier 50 Hz and harmonic frequencies. The use of switched power supplies has also le d to a change of the frequency content of our daily magnetic field exposure. Since these devices utilize only a small portion of the Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 54 50 Hz current, this leads to large harmonics with 150 Hz an d higher. With the present electrical wiring with three phases and a neutral, the 150 Hz harmonic is now the dominating frequency in the stray currents in buildings. In the household, more appliances have appe ared in the IF range. It was found that some of them, including playth ings, can exceed the limits set by exposure guidelines at close range. An important source of exposure in this frequency range is induction hobs, which have become popular in recent ye ars. These can expose their users (both members of the general public an d professionals) to IF magnet ic fields higher than those suggested in exposure guidelines, mainly du e to the fact that their safety standard requires conformity at a distan ce of 0.3m only, and does not account for all the different modes and (worst case) use conditions. By far most applications that emit EMF ar e in the frequency range above 100 kHz and up to some GHz. Multiple sources exist that cont ribute to an individual 's exposure and under various circumstances. Ho wever, transmitters in the close vicinity to or on the body have become the main sources of exposure for the general population and professionals. Distance to the main beam of the source is the main determinant of exposure, given that the emitted power and duty factor remain the same. Especially for brain tissues, the mobile phone used at the ear remains the main source of exposure. However, since the first generation of mobile telephony, ther e is a trend in the technology of mobile terminals for lower time-avera ged emitted power. In partic ular, for GSM systems, the introduction of power control reduced the output power to about 50% of its maximum during calls, whereas the use of discontinuous transmission (DTX) during voice calls gave a further 30% reduction in average emitted po wer. Adaptive power control became faster and more effective in the third-generation (3G) of mobile telephony systems leading to a further reduction (by about two orders of magnitude) in the SAR compared to GSM phones. In addition, hands-free kits can lower the energy absorbed by the head drastically. DECT phones which are another so urce of everyday exposure lead to an SAR which is several times lower than that of GSM phones, although their peak spatial SAR may be smaller by one order of magnitude. Smart-phones, which operate within networks of different technologies, as well as other portable wireless devices, li ke tablets and laptop computer s, have added complexity to the user's exposure; therefore, combined exposure should be considered for exposure assessment. The exposure from environmental sources is dominated by broadcasting antennas, antennas from private and official governme ntal telecommunication services and mobile communications base stations. It has been sh own that such system s have significantly increased the EMF levels in the urban envi ronment compared to the levels measured during the 1980's, when only analogue radio and television broadcasting was present. However, historical data from spot meas urement campaigns and continuous radiation monitoring systems indicate that the introduc tion of new technologies after 2G systems, even the emerging 4G systems, did not signif icantly increase the me asured fields in the environment. Indoors, the inst allation of access points an d short-range base stations, such as 3G femtocells, WiFi hotspots and DE CT devices, ha s given rise to exposure at distances within 1 m from them, whereas fart her away the emitted EMF does not exceed the common background levels. The emitted po wer from these devices, even combined, still gives a very low exposure compared with reference levels of European and international guidelines. Occupational exposure to RF sources at work may lead to a cumulative whole-body exposure of professionals much greater than from their mobile phone use, although the exposure in their head tissues is still expected to be high er from their mobile phone. In the higher frequencies of the RF range an d beyond, i.e. millimetre and submillimetre waves, there are only a few applications curr ently, but these applications will become more widespread, especially for broadband telecommunications. Ho wever, such systems Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 55 will operate with low power and, due to the small penetration depth of radiation, only superficial tissues are of concern. Terahertz applications are also in their ea rly stage of development. General public exposure will be mainly due to security and telecommunications applications, whereas occupational exposure will originate from the introduction of THz imaging systems in manufacturing chains for non-destructive quality control. 3.3.10. Conclusions on exposure to EMF Human exposure to EMF comes from many different sources and occurs in various situations in everyday life. Man-made static fields are mainly found in occupational settings, such as close to MRI scanners, alth ough DC high-voltage overhead transmission lines are being constructed, wh ich are expected to expose larger parts of the population to static electric and magnetic fields. EMF in the ELF range are ubiquitous. The main sources of these fields pertaining to the general public are in-house installations, household appliances and powerlines. In recent years, attention has also been directed towards people living next to electric power transformers installed inside residential buildings. It appears that long-term exposure to ELF magnetic field of these people can extent to several tenths of T. Today, for power regulation most modern elec trical equipment uses electronics instead of transformers. Examples includ e the switched power supplies to laptops, drilling tools, chargers of mobile phones and similar device s. As a consequence, the frequency content of the daily magnetic field exposure has changed mainly by adding odd harmonics (150 Hz, 250 Hz, 750 Hz, etc.). In particular, the third harmonic (150 Hz) has become another dominating frequency in our environment. In the household, more appliances have appeared in the IF range. It was found that at close range, some of them, including playthin gs, can exceed the reference levels set by exposure guidelines. An important source of exposure in this frequency range is induction hobs, which have become popular in recent years. These can expose their users (both members of the general public and professionals) to IF magn etic fields higher than the reference levels of exposure guidelines, mainly due to the fact that their safety standard requires conformity at a distance of 0.3 m on ly, and does not account for all the different modes and (worst case) use conditions. By far the most applications which emit EMF are in the frequency range above 100 kHz up to some GHz. Multiple sources exist that c o n t r i b u t e t o a n i n dividual's exposure. However, transmitters in close vicinity to or on the body have become the main sources of exposure for the general population and pr ofessionals. Distance to the source is the main determinant of exposure, together with emitted power and duty factor. In particular for brain tissues, the mobile ph one used at the ear re mains the main source of exposure. However, since th e first generation of mobile telephony, the technology aimed at reducing the emitted power of mobile handsets. In particular, for GSM systems, already the introduction of dynamic power co ntrol reduced the average output power to about 50% of its rated value during calls, wh ereas the use of discont inuous transmission (DTX) during voice calls gave a further 30% reduction in average emitted power. Adaptive power control became faster and more effective in the third-generation (3G) of mobile telephony systems leading to a fu rther reduction (by about two orders of magnitude) in the specific absorption Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR) compared to GSM phones. In addition, hands-free kits re duce the energy absorbed by the head drastically. DECT phones are another source of everyday exposure. Smart-phones, which operate within networks of different technologies, as well as other portable wireless devices, li ke tablets and laptop computer s, have added complexity to the user's exposure and changed the exposed body region. Due to the different sources used next to the body, it is important to take into account multiple exposure for risk assessment, which may also re quire organ-specific dosimetry. This issue is also Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 56 important for occupational exposure, since th ere may be situations, such as working in an MRI suite, where professionals are expo sed simultaneously to EMF of multiple frequencies ranges, different temporal variations and field strengths. The exposure from environmental sources is dominated by broadcasting antennas, antennas from private and governmental telecommunication services and mobile communications base stations. It has been sh own that such system s have significantly increased the EMF levels in the urban envi ronment compared to the levels measured during the 1980's, when only analogue radio and television broadcas ting were present. However, historical data from spot meas urement campaigns and continuous radiation monitoring systems indicate that the intr oduction of new mobile telecommunication technologies after the deployment of the GSM and UMTS systems did not substantially change the average levels of EMF in th e environment. At the same time, other technologies, like digital broadc asting, have in some regions contributed to the reduction of EMF exposure from far field sources. The number of sources has increased indoors. The installation of a ccess points and short range base stations, such as 3G femtocells, WiFi hotspots and DECT devices, has given rise to exposure at very cl ose distances (within 1 m), wher eas farther away the emitted EMF does not exceed the common background levels. Consequently, the emitted EMF from these devices, even when combined, still results in a marginal exposure compared to reference levels of European and international guidelines. In general, it appears that, with respect to telecommunication applicatio ns, the technological trend is to use low- power emitters, closer to or on the hum an body, and at higher frequencies. Millimetre wave and THz applications are expected to be available soon in various industrial environments, such as for imaging systems used for non-destructive quality control, as well as for short-range broadband telecommunications. Currently, they do not significantly affect the averag e exposure of the general pub lic. These applications will operate with low power and, due to the small penetration depth of the radiation, expose only superficial tissues. 3.4. Interaction mechanisms Today, well established knowledge allows explaining all scientifically proven biological effects of non-ionizing electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fiel ds and justifies the clear-cut separation between low frequency an d radio frequency range. At static fields and in the LF range induced intr acorporeal electric fields ma y cause biologic effects such as cellular stimulation. However, due to basic biologic reasons stimulation ends above about 100 kHz. Consequently, in the RF rang e EMF energy absorption and subsequent tissue heating becomes the majo r mechanism. This does not imply that in the LF range energy absorption and heating is not occurring anymore. It just means that their effects simply become negligible compared to the stimulatory effects of the induced electric fields. The several established biophysical mechanisms through which EMF can interact with living matter help to provide the rationale for limiting human exposures to EMF such as in guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP, 1998; 2010; 2014) and the standard s of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE, 2005; 2007). EMF may also have an indirect impact on health such as by causing interference with the functioning of active electronic implants (e.g. pacemakers or cardioverter defibrilla tors) or other body-wor n medical devices and prostheses. Controversial reports on suggested health ri sks are explained by various hypothetical mechanisms that have not been verified und er permitted exposure conditions and in particular of daily life exposure. As an example, the established mechanisms at low frequencies cannot explain the increased risk for childhood leukaemia that has been reported in epidemiologic studies with much higher than average ma gnetic field exposure at homes. Similarly at high frequencies, the established mechanisms cannot explain why Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 57 there might be an increased risk for glio ma and acoustic neuroma as reported in epidemiological studies in heavy users of mobile phones after 10 years or more of use. Much laboratory research has attempted to determine the chain of molecular and biological events that could lead to the development of neoplastic (or other) disease f o l l o w i n g e x p o s u r e t o E M F . H o wever, changes in the specific or global expression of genes, proteins or metabolites, or temporal changes in particular hormones are not considered a mechanism per se but are considered to reflec t a biological response or potential biomarker of exposure. These resp onses (and similar studies related to other diseases) are described in the relevant sections of this Opinion devoted to describing experimental work. 3.4.1. Static fields Static electric fields due to the electric conductivity of body tissue cannot induce intracorporeal electric fields. Ho wever, static electric fields ca use redistribution of electric charges within initially uncharged objects, and in particular charging of the body surface. This leads to electromechanic forces acting upon and between charged hair and may lead to perception or even annoyance. In ad dition, electrostatic charging may cause discharging at the body surface or to ground ed objects. These (micro-) electroshocks can be repetitive and may also lead to perception or even annoyance. Static magnetic fields interact with living tissues via electrodynamic and magnetomechanical interactions (WHO, 2006). Electrodynamic interaction occurs at moving ch arged particles (electrons, ions or dipoles) within the blood flow, within moving tissue such as the beating heart muscle or within moving persons by generating a force (Loren tz force) that separates positively and negatively charged particles and hence indu ces a movement-depende nt electric field. Magnetomechanical interaction may cause forces which align atoms and particles or with inherent magnetic moments (magnetic dipole s) or at material with diamagnetic, paramagnetic or ferromagnet ic properties. In inhomogeneous MF, forces may cause acceleration of ferromagnetic pa rts and, in strong MF a projectile effect. In daily life, geomagnetic fields are too we ak to generate relevant effects. However, the much stronger magnetic fields in and around a MR I scanner at present operating with 0.3 - 9.4 T are strong enough to produce relevant e ffects which may need protective measures such as access control by detector gates to avoid ferromagnetic de vices brought in the vicinity of MRI scanners, to prevent from ad verse interference with implanted cardiac p a c e m a k e r s a n d - a t M F a t o r a b o v e 4 T - to prevent from dangerous stimulation of nerves and muscles (and from excess tissue he ating by the associated RF EMF) (ICNIRP, 2009). 3.4.2. ELF fields Time-varying fields (with frequencies up to 10 MHz) result in the induction of alternating electric fields in biological objects. If of su fficient magnitude, these fields can modulate or initiate ongoing activity in the nervous sy stem. Above dedicated thresholds they may also cause stimulation of nerves and, above higher thresholds contraction of muscles. ELF electric fields similar to static electric fields ca use redistribution of electric charges within initially uncharged objects, and consequently charging of the body surface, however, this time oscillating. This leads to periodic electromechanic forces acting upon charged hair and may lead to perception or even annoyance. In addition, alternating electric charging may cause periodic discharges at the bo dy surface or to grounded objects. These repetitive (mic ro-) electroshocks may also le ad to perception or even annoyance. In contrast to static fields periodic rechargi ng induces intracorporeal electric currents and electric fields strengths which, if strong enough may stimulate nerve and muscle cells. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 58 ELF magnetic fields induce intracorporeal electric fi eld strengths that according to the induction law increase with frequency and cr oss sectional area. Cons equently, inside the body, the strength of induced electric fields increases from zero at the centre to the maximum at the body surface. 3.4.3. RF Fields In the RF range, which means beyond frequencies that are high enough that cellular stimulation is no longer possible, the EM F energy absorption and subsequent tissue heating becomes the major mechan ism. In this frequency range in the far field electric and magnetic field strengths are tightl y coupled like the links of a chain. RF EMF energy absorption is based on oscilla ting mechanical forces on electric charged particles or electric dipoles generated by the electric comp onent, and, generated by the magnetic field component on pa rticles with an inherent magnetic moment. Depending on the particle's mass and mobility, these forces may cause translatory, oscillatory and/or rotatory movement and hence conversion of fi eld energy to particle's kinetic energy. In the following step, inside the material particle's kinetic energy is distributed by collision with other particles, hence causing irregular particle movement that on a macroscopic scale is named heat (Brown's molecular movement) and quantified by the physical term temperature. It must be stressed that on a molecular level by its principle nature the interaction of RF EMF is non-thermal. Therefore, the terms thermal and heating apply to the entire ensemble of particles and have no meaning for individual particles. Consequently, the discussion about thermal and non- thermal effects is misleading . Irrespective of the field amplitude the basic physical interaction mechanism is non-thermal. However the (macroscopic) biochemical and physiological responses depend on temperature. Most chemical properties, chemical reaction ki netics and cellular processes are temperature- dependent. Therefore, any claimed borderli ne between thermal and non-thermal effects necessarily needs to be defined with regard to specific effects such as triggering the onset of thermoregulatory reactions. Therefor e, to generally claim that effects observed below exposure limits would necessarily be non-thermal is misleading and ignores this basic relationship. If strong enough, time-vary ing fields (with frequencies above 100 kHz) result in measurable heating of exposed tissues (WHO , 1993, ICNIRP, 1998). If the exposure is sufficiently prolonged or intense, the capa bilities of the vari ous elements of the thermoregulatory system to dissipate th e absorbed power may be compromised, resulting in increases in (whole-body or local) temperature. Rises of core body temperatures of up to a few degrees stay wi thin the body's intrinsic thermoregulatory bandwidth as demonstrated by the circadian or women's monthly temperature rhythms. Some temperature increase is usually well to lerated, although it might become health relevant at higher values. In addition, short transient heating such as from microwave radar pulses with high peak power (of a few kW/m 2 or more) can result in thermome chanic effects such as auditory perception described as a hissing, popping or clicking sound: the microwave hearing phenomenon (WHO, 1993; Lin and Wang, 2007). These effects are attributed to the pulses causing a transient localised heating, resulting in an associated tissue expansion, particularly of the liquid within the labyrinth of the inner ear. This generates an acoustic wave that stimulates th e auditory receptors. As indirect effects electric shocks or cont act burns can result from touching large, conducting ungrounded objects in strong RF EMF. Public exposures guidelines for EMF are se t to avoid adverse effects on the nervous system and stimulation of nerve and muscle ce lls and to avoid excess heating of either the whole body or parts of it by limiting exposures to stay sufficiently below the thresholds for these effects with a reduction factor that accounts for uncertainty and interpersonal variability. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 59 3.4.4. Other mechanisms In addition to the established interaction mechanisms, a number of other mechanisms have been postulated. Many of these candidates are not biophysically plausible, although a few do enjoy limited experimental su pport. However, none has been firmly demonstrated in humans and their relevance to health remains unclear. To a large extent, the investigation of potential new relevant mechanisms that operate at low levels of exposure has been hampered by the absence of a robust, reliable and repeatable effect that occurs in any biolog ical model as a consequence of exposure. The search for a new relevant mechanism, if existent, would be greatly improved if such an effect could be established. At present, re ports of low-level effects by exogenous fields remain highly controversial and subject to much scientific debate and scrutiny. In a careful review of potent ial mechanisms, Sheppard et al. (2008) concluded that the dominant mechanism at RF frequencies was dielectric heating, and that most other possible mechanisms, many based upon direct coupling to specific modes in molecules, cells or tissues, are implausible as means for independent energy deposition. Most potential candidates were excluded because, to be biologically effective, they would be accompanied by such temperature rises th at would overwhelm any other biological response. Resonant molecular or submolecul ar vibrational modes were also excluded because movements are too heavily damped, whilst other suggested mechanisms involve energy that would be far weak er than thermal background. It was also concluded that conditions where an RF field interacts directly with charges or dipoles to cause molecular transformation or damage would require fiel d strengths that are greatly in excess of those that would cause dielectric heating. Radical pair mechanism Free radicals are highly reactive and short-lived molecules or ions with unpaired electrons, and they are formed when radical pairs dissociate. Certain metabolic reactions involve an intermediate state comprising a radical pair, usually in a singlet state with the spin of one unpaired electron anti-parallel to the spin of the other (WHO, 2006). These spin-correlated radical pairs recombine to form reaction products. It is well known that an applied magnetic field (with a frequency of less than about 100 MHz) can affect the rate and the extent to which the radical pair converts to the triplet state (parallel spins) in which recombination is no longer possible, and thereby change th e reaction yield. Although there is theoretical and experiment al evidence for such effects in chemical systems (Challis, 2005; Georgiou, 2010), th e dependence on reaction rates is complicated and sizeable effects are usually only seen in special circumstances (Timmel et al., 1998). While extendin g the lifetime of the radical pair could have serious consequences by affecting the integrity of DNA or other subcellular components and processes (Finkel, 2003), the extent to wh ich these effects could produce oxidative stress-induced tissue damage is not known. This mechanism has been su ggested (Ritz et al. 2000) as a means by which some species of birds and other animals may use th e Earth's magnetic field as a source of navigational information during migration, and there is experimental support for this view (Ritz et al. 2004). More recently, Ritz et al. (2009) investigated the behavioural effects of exposure of robins to time-varying magnetic fields of 470-480 nT at frequencies ranging from 0.01 MHz to 7 MHz, and identified a radical pair with a long lifetime involved in the birds' magnetic compass. It was found that fields of around 0.6 MHz and above caused the robins to be disoriented. Ritz and co-wor kers concluded that a strong resonance at a Larmor frequency of 1.315 MHz (w ith a geomagnetic field of 46 T) would be expected for a radical pair in which a radical has a magnetically-isolated spin. This resonance may arise from the interaction of the unpaired elec tron with the external magnetic field to produce a unique energy-level splitting (Zeeman interaction). Georgiou (2010) reported some studies with RF fields that provide evidence for the induction of oxidative stress via the free-radical pair mechanism in biological systems. These effects included increased production of reactive oxygen species, an increase in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 60 DNA single-strand breaks, increased lipid peroxi dation, and alterations in the activities of enzymes associated with antiox idative defence. Many of thes e changes were reversed by pre-treatment with antioxidants. Sheppard et al. (2008) emphasized that de spite the number of biochemical reactions involving free radicals, there are many restrictive conditions that would make the effect of RF magnetic fields very unlikely in most systems. These include the frequency constraints based on hyperfine coupling strength , and radical pair interactions restricted by the necessity for creation of spin-corre lated radical pairs th at remain in close proximity. It is also essential that radical lifetimes are long enough to be affected by a time-varying magnetic field, an d relaxation processes are slow enough to allow adequate radical lifetime. In addition, the static magn etic field must have an appropriate field strength. Magnetite particles Most biological materials are either diamagnetic of paramagn etic in nature and interact only very weakly with a magnetic field. In contrast, magnetite (Fe 3O4), a naturally occurring oxide of iron, is ferrimagnetic and interacts with magnetic fields more strongly than any other biological material. Magnetosom es containing biogenic magnetite crystals have been found in certain bacteria and in th e cells of many animals, including brain cells in humans (Kirschvink et al., 1992a). Magnetite may play a role in navigation in some fish, birds and turtles although its function in humans remain unclear, and there is very little evidence that humans possess an endo genous magnetic compass. Magnetite has also been found in mouse tumours, suggestin g a possible role in ce llular functions and implicated in iron transport and storage. The pathway(s) through which magnetic inform ation could be transduced into relevant biological signals remains largely elusive. However, it has been suggested that magnetosomes may rotate or oscillate in lo w frequency magnetic fields of sufficient intensity (Kirschvink et al., 1992b, Kir schvink, 1996). If these are coupled to mechanically-sensitive ion channels, this to rque may activate the channels and cause them to open or close. Th e resulting change in ion flux could influence a variety of cellular processes. In addition to power fr equency fields, effects could be produced by low frequency fields associated with mobile phone signals. The ferrimagnetic transduction hypothesis provides a tentative biophysical mechanism to begin to understand how magn etic fields might cause sign ificant biological effects. However, it has been calculated that exposure to time-varying fields of around 50 \u00b5T or more are required to overcome constraints imposed by thermal noise (Adair, 1994). Fields of this magnitude may be encountered in the environment but will be limited to parts of the body in close pro ximity to wiring or electric appliances. Thus it cannot provide an obvious explanation for the increased risk of ch ildhood leukaemia with above average time-weighted fi elds in the home. Non-equilibrium and nonlinear effects Because living, biological systems do not ex ist at thermal equili brium, theories on interactions between EMFs and biological tissues must consider the non-equilibrium and nonlinearity of these sy stems (Georgiou, 2010). Non- linear processes such as rectification could transduce low frequency- modulated RF signals into the frequency range where physiological systems operate (Sheppard et al., 2008). It has been proposed that biochemical effects may be induced by weak fields in biological systems that are in non-equili brium states in which the time to transition from an intermediate metastable state to a final act ive or inactive state may be less than the thermalization time of the induce d field (Binhi and Rubin, 2007). After considering whether protein conformati on might be affected by RF fields if amplitudes of specific vibrational modes are altered, Prohofsky (2004) concluded that the biological effects of RF fi elds on DNA, proteins and si milar macromolecules can only be due to temperature changes because the absorbed energy associated with inter- Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 61 molecular vibrations is too rapidly converted to heat and coupling to the surrounding water (damping) occurs before the energy can be transferred to intra-molecular resonant modes. A non-thermal effect might still exist, however, if there was a very strong energy coupling between the inter- and intra-molecular modes, and if the damping effect of water can be ignored. These conditions may occur for proteins such as myoglobin or haemoglobin, in which the haem group can oscillate in the protein pocket at lower frequencies. Another suggestion has been that cells ma y have the potential to cause non-linear demodulation of a modulated or pulsing frequency to create low frequency fields that then have an effect on tissues. However, it has been concluded that the power of the demodulated signal would be in finitesimally small, at most 77 dB below the carrier, and more probably 90-100 dB below (AGNIR, 2012) . Thus the demodulated power at 16 Hz from an incident field of 100 V/m at 900 MHz has been estimated to only about 1 pW. This suggests that any demodulated signal of biological significance would need to be accompanied by a carrier frequency of thermally-destructive power. Balzano and co-workers designed a doubly re sonant cavity to search for nonlinear RF energy conversion in biologic al material (Balzano et al ., 2008). The loaded cavity was resonant at about 890 MHz and at the second harmonic of about 1780 MHz. The sensitivity of the system was considered suffi cient to reveal any nonlinearity that could have any potential biological significance, and allowed detection of second harmonic signals above a noise floor as low as -169d Bm (Davis and Balzan o, 2010). Biological material was exposed to a low-level continuous wave field at input powers of 0.1 or 1 mW at the resonant frequency while monito red for evidence of the generation of the second harmonic (Kowalczuk et al., 2010). A wide range of both cancer and non-cancer cell lines were used, as were cells and tissues previously repo rted to exhibit responses to weak RF fields. These cells in cluded high-density cell susp ensions of human lymphocytes and mouse bone marrow cells, and adherent layers of IMR-32 human neuroblastoma, hamster ovary cells. Also examined were thin slices of mouse ti ssues, including brain, kidney, muscle, liver, and diaphragm. The cavity was placed within an incubator to ensure optimum conditions for the samples. Over 500 samples were test ed but no evidence of non-linear energy conversion by any of the samples was found Overall, since second-harmonic generation is considered to be a necessary and suffici ent condition for demodulation, these results do not support the possibility that living ce lls possess the non-linear properties necessary to demodulate RF energy. Ca2+ ion homeostasis The possibility that changes in Ca2+ flux may occur in cells in response to exposure has long been considered (see reviews by Adey , 1981; WHO, 1993. 2007). Some, but not all studies have reported effects using low frequency electric fields or pulse modulated RF fields, often with effe cts restricted to specific amplit ude or frequency windows (see Pall, (2013) for a review of studies suggestin g effects through voltage-gated calcium channels). One recent study tested this hypothesis usin g a highly sensitive a ssay and state-of-the- art techniques. Using an open transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell housed within a custom-made incubator, O'Connor et al. (2010) exposed cover slides with monolayers of human EA.hy926 endothelial cell s, cultured PC-12 neuroblast oma cells or rodent primary hippocampal neurons to CW or GSM 900 MHz si gnals at 0.012 - 2 W/kg for 30 min. An automated high-throughput imaging techno logy was used to monitor Ca2+ ion concentrations in the cells using floresce nce indicators (Fura-2, or Fura-PE3 for hippocampal neurons); real-time images were made every 30s before, during and after exposure. No significant effects on resting or spontaneous Ca2+concentrations were seen for any cell line with either CW or pulsed signals. A second phase of the experiment studied the effects of exposure on endothelia l cells following treatment with histamine (to stimulate the release of Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores) or with thapsigargin (to stimulate passive Ca2+ store depletion and Ca 2+ entry). It was found that exposure had Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 62 no influence on the responses of the endothelial cells to either treatment. Overall, the authors concluded that this highly-sensitive assay did not detect any consequences of RF exposure. Pearl chain formation The pearl-chain formation may occur when molecules and cells can move under the influence of an electric field and rearrange to form chains al ong the direction of the field (Sher et al., 1970; Schwan, 1982; Takashima and Schwan, 1985). Under the influence of an electr ic field, electrical charges tend to accumulate on opposite cell surfaces to form induced dipoles, whose orientation changes with oscillations of the field. A dipole-dipole attraction occurs in th e process. The attracti ve forces between the dipoles are enhanced when the objects ar e in close proximity to each other. The dipoles then align in the direction of the applied electric field and form chains of many cells or molecules. The ch ains are mostly single-stranded, although it is possible to form multi-stranded chains. Pearl-chains ha ve been observed within suspensions of erythrocytes or bacteria that allowed sufficient mobility. At frequencies up to about 100 MHz, the threshol d of the electric field strength needed to produce the pearl-chain effect depends on frequency, cell or particle size, the amplitude and pulsation of the applied field. At high er frequencies, the induced dipoles have insufficient time to follow the oscillating field to change their directions. Both (single or multiple) pulses and CW fields are known to produce the pearl-chain effect. Pulsed fields appear no more effective than CW fields in producing the pearl-chain effect. While these effects have been ob served using cell suspensions in vitro , they seem unlikely to occur in vivo . Blood might be regarded as a possible biological candidate to show this effect, but its complex, dynamic mo tion means that the er ythrocytes and other cells are unlikely to become aligned wi th the field for appreciable periods. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species Many free radicals are the result of natu rally occurring processes such as oxygen metabolism and inflammatory pr ocesses, although environmenta l stimuli such as ionizing radiation and toxins can also increase the le vels of free radicals (see Dr\u00f6ge 2002 for a comprehensive review). Reactive Oxygen Sp ecies (ROS) along with Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) are terms collectively describin g radicals and other non-radical reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen derivatives. ROS/RN S are formed in all living organisms as by- products of normal metaboli sm and as a consequence of exposure to environmental compounds. In biological systems, there are a multitude of reaction s that act to reduce the induced increased levels of ROS/RNS, collectively called antioxidants. The antioxidants are substances that are able to regulate oxidat ive reactions in the way that they compete with other oxidizable substr ates; they prevent, delay or inhibit the oxidation of the substances. During normal conditions there is a balance between oxidants and antioxidants (a radical homeostasis is established). Whereas the reactions of ROS/RNS are fast, th e responses of the cell/organism are much slower. Short periods of elevated ROS/RNS levels, less than a few minutes, can manage to initiate protein expression and other regulations, yet they cannot be completed within these short times. Thus, the func tional responses, acting on de toxification as well as on the pro-oxidant side, require longer time, ov e r a p e r i o d o f h o u r s o r d a y s ( J e z e k a n d Hlavata 2005). A number of experimental studies have investigated whether EMF can influence the radical homeostasis of the cell, and thus act as an initiator of events that can lead to changes in the cell\u00b4s status that in turn may be involved in development of disease processes (reviewed e.g. by Simk\u00f3 and Matts son, 2004; Consales et al. 2012). Recently, a grouping approach was performed by Ma ttsson and Simk\u00f3 (2014) that tested the hypothesis that ELF MF exposure in vitro changes the oxidative ba lance in the cell. The conclusion from the work is that ELF MF (modulated or unmodulated) consistently can Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 63 influence the oxidative status, at or above 1 mT, in a broad range of cell types and independent of exposure duration. 3.4.5. Conclusion Several interactions mechanisms are well established. They allow extrapolation of scientific results to the enti re frequency range and wide-b and health risk assessment. They have been used to help formulate guidel ines limiting exposures to EMF in the entire frequency range from static fields to 300G Hz. A number of studies reported other candidate mechanisms, however none that oper ates in humans at levels of exposure found in the everyday enviro nment has been firmly iden tified and experimentally validated nor do they allow concluding on potential health risks at other exposure conditions both with regard to amplitude and/or frequency. 3.5. Health effects from THz fields The previous SCENIHR Opinion did not include health effects from TH z technologies, so a brief introduction of this part of the el ectromagnetic (EM spectrum) is in order. THz-induced biological effects are strictly related to THz ex posure parameters (frequency, power, exposure duration, etc.) and the comp osition and properties of the biological target (index of refraction, absorption and scattering properties, etc.). These elements can impact the propagation, energy spatia l distribution and th ermal effects of THz irradiation. For instance, the largest and primary targets are the skin and cornea (since the penetration depth is in the order of 100 m), and many biological macromolecules like DNA, tryptophan, protein and carbohydrates contribute to tissue absorption although water is the main tissue chromophore at THz frequency. Due to water absorption, high power THz field is assumed to cause thermal effects in biological materials, although non-thermal effects have also been proposed (Alexandrov et al., 2011). The number of studies investigating the biological effects of weak THz field is small, but has increased during the last 10 years due to the availability of reliable sources and detectors. In the following, a review of the main publications dealing with health effects of THz field is provided. Expe riments have been described by including THz frequency, exposure duration, power density when applicable, biological systems, investigated endpoint and main results. The main studies addressing the interaction mechanisms of THz field on biological systems have also been included. The in vivo and in vitro studies that are referred are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 in the following text. 3.5.1. In vivo studies To date the only human study was carried ou t by Ostrovskiy et al. (2005) and published in the Proceedings of IRMMW-T Hz. They demonstrated that THz fields could represent a useful tool to induce burn repair and re duce microbial dissemination. They treated a group of 14 and a group of 21 patients suffering from superficial and deep burns respectively, while 2 groups of 15 patients ea ch were employed as controls. Seven to ten 15 min treatments were provided per day in CW m o de a t the fr e q ue ncy o f 0 . 1 5 TH z, 0.3 W/m2. This resulted in acceleration of the epithelialization process and reduced the microbial dissemination in deep burns by 100 to 1000 fold (Ostrovskiy et al., 2005). Although empirical dosimetric data were not provided by the authors, post-publication measurements performed by Wilmink and Grun dt (2011b), demonstrated that the THz- induced temperature rise was roughly 0.1\u00b0C, thus corroborating the authors' suggestion that the observed effects are du e to the strong absorption of nitric oxide (NO) molecules at THz frequencies and not to thermal mechanisms. The majority of the in vivo experiments on the Albino rat model were carried out, by the Kirichuck group. In the first paper (Kir ichuck et al., 2008), by using a microwave generator, they exposed male and female rats (n=180; 60 males and 120 females) for 15 or 30 min to 0.15 THz, 0.7 mW, 2 W/m\u00b2 after inducing disorders of intravascular components of microcirculation by immobilization stress (a si ngle 3 h fixation of animals Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 64 in the supine posture). Platelet aggregation was studied in platelet-rich plasma samples by using a platelet aggregation analyser. Re sults indicated that both male and females exhibited complete recovery of platelet aggregation, althou gh female rats were more sensitive (15 min treatment was effective in female with respect to 30 min in male rats). In a second paper (Kirichuck et al., 2009), th e authors did not confirm their previous observations on platelet aggregation, and as a matter of fact in this study they found the aggregation parameters to be elevated in Albino rats after immobilization and after exposure to 0.15 THz, 30 W/m\u00b2 for 15, 30 and 60 min. The discrepancy between the papers was not commented on by the author s. In the same paper they found that immobilization stress weakened the animals' orientation abilities (maze designed to test for depression) and the irradiation even increased this weakening. In a third paper (Kirichuck and Tsymbal, 2009), these authors employed 75 male albino rats divided into 4 groups (c ontrol; rats immobili zed and not irradiated; rats immobilized and subjected to a single irradiation session for 15 min; rats immobilized and subjected to a single irradiation session for 30 min) to test the effects of terahertz irradiation at the nitric oxide frequencies 150.176-150.664 GHz (0.7 mW radiation power and 2 W/m2 power density) on the intensity of lipoperoxidation (LPO) and antioxidant properties of the blood subjected to immobilization stress by a supine fixation technique for 3 h to activate lipoperoxidation. They found that 30 min terahertz irradiation completely normalized LPO processes and functional activity of antioxidants in stressed rats. In a fifth group of rats subjected to immobilizat ion stress and irradiated for 30 min at the frequency of 53.54 GHz no reduction of stress parameters was observed, thus confirming the putative role of nitrogen monoxide as a mediator. Subsequently (Kirichuck and Tsymbal, 2010), they demonstrated the effi cacy of 30 min terahertz radiation at 129.0 GHz (1 W/m2) (frequency of the molecular spectr um of radiation and absorption of atmospheric oxygen) on normalizing the hy percoagulation and the suppression of fibrinolysis of blood induced in mongrel white rats by experimental stress as in the previous paper. In a fifth paper, they investigated the effects of electromagnetic radiation at the frequency of NO emissi on and absorption spectrum 150.176-150.664 GHz (0.7mW radiation power and 2 W/m2 power density) on peripheral perfusion in albino rats under conditions of acute immobilization stress (rigid fixation in the supine position for 3 h). Laser Doppl er Flowmetry (LDF) was perfor med using a laser blood flow analyser, whose transducer was fixed on th e dorsal surface of the right paw using a- traumatic patch and LDF software. 30 min THz exposure resulted in correcting disturbance in periph eral circulation (Kirichuk et al., 2011). The possibility to treat hemodynamic disorders accompanying some of pathologic diseases has also been demonstrated (Kir ichuk et al., 2012). Albino rats, in which immobilization stress once ag ain caused hemodynamic disord ers, were exposed by using Orbita, an extremely high freq uency therapy apparatus for he modynamic, fibrinolytic and peripheral perfusion disorder s treatment, to continuous terahertz radiation with frequencies equal to absorption and emissi on frequencies of nitrogen oxide (150.176- 150.664 GHz) and atmospheric oxygen (129.0 \u00b1 0.75 GHz), and 1 W/m2 power density for 3 cm2 skin area. Exposures of 5, 10 and 15 min in both conditions allow for reverting the post-stress hemodynamic ch anges in great vessels. In the latest study from the same group (K irichuk and Tsymball, 2012), they found that the positive effects of the THz field, at atmospheric oxygen frequency of 129 GHz on blood nitrite concentration of exposed ma le white rats under acute and chronic immobilization stress, were negated upon preliminary tr eatment with L-NAME, a non- selective inhibitor of NO-synthase, thus demonstrating the involvement of constitutive NO-synthase in the mechanisms of positive effects. The effects of THz waves on the behaviour of mice were investigated by Bondar and co- workers (2008). Male adult C57BI/6J mice we re kept in a metal cage divided into 2 compartments with a transparent barrier with holes. By means of a hole in the metal cage, at the level of mouse body and at a dist ance of 3 cm from the barrier, the radiation beam entered the cage and was reflected inside the cage by another hole with a mirror in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 65 the opposite wall, to expose mi ce at 3.6 THz, (about 50 W/m2) for different time periods from 5 to 30 min. There were no changes in behaviour of animals with respect to the barrier or to the mouse into the adjacent compartment, while significant reduction in sniffing the hole allowing entry of radiation and time spent in its proximity were recorded as compared to the controls. Delayed effects of 30 min THz irradiatio n were also detected one day after exposure by the anxiety of experimental mice with respect to control by means of the orientation test in a maze, thus the authors concluded that mice exposed to radiation show anxiety. The effect of THz waves on the inflammatory response in skin ha s been investigated recently by Hwang et al. (2014). They empl oyed a genetically engineered Tie2-eGFP mouse model to analyse cellular level inflammatory response after pulsed THz wave irradiation. In particular, ear skin of a li ve anaesthised mouse wa s irradiated for 30 min with pulsed THz wave (2.7 THz, 4 \u00b5s pulse width, 61.4 \u00b5J per pulse, 3 Hz repetition) generated from a compact free electron la ser. Average power density was 260 mW/cm2, and the number and distribution of neutro phils, which are the first immune cells to rapidly migrate to an inflamma tion site, in the ear skin we re monitored before and after THz irradiation by using a custom-built intravital laser-scanning confocal microscopy system. A massive recruitmen t of newly infiltrated neutrophils was observed in the irradiated skin 6 hours after exposure. Hi stological analysis also confirmed an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the dermis of the irradiated skin in absence of observable changes in the skin structure. Overall the result s suggest that THz irradiation is capable of initiating an acute inflammatory response without stru ctural disruption of the irradiated skin. In conclusion, taken together, the in vivo studies mainly showed be neficial effe cts of THz field on disorders of intravascular compon ents of microcirculation in rats under immobilization stress, an indication of nega tive effects was reco rded on behaviour of experimental animals which showed increased anxiety compar ed to control animals. In all cases, further experiments are needed to support these findings. Studies so far also suffer from a lack of adequate dosimetry. Moreover, in vivo investigations on acute and chronic toxicity and carcinogenes is are mandatory in evaluating health risk related to THz frequencies. Table 3.

In vitro studies Human cell types Some investigations deal with cells from human skin since THz field cannot penetrate deep into the human body but can likely affect the skin. The research group of Clothier (Clothier et al., 2003; Bourne et al., 2008), focusing on human primary keratinocytes (NHKs) and neural cell cultures, ND7/23 cell line, investigated the effects of THz fiel d in the range 0.1-2.7 THz (240-620 W/m2) for time periods varying from 10 min to 24 h. Th e differentiation was monitored via the incorporation of fluorescein cadaverine into the cornified envelops. This differentiation assay was combined with the assessment of cell viability by resazurin assay. Primary cultures of NKS express adhesion molecules that comprise part of the natural barrier function of the skin, and the e ffects of exogenous agents on this barrier function can be measured. Absence of effects on cell differentiation and barrier forming and viability following THz exposure was found. Furthermore human corneal epithelial cells were also investigated which would also be likely exposed to the THz field in vivo . Their ability to differentiate in a normal way is important as the eye is potentially less protected than the skin. Again, after two cycles of 24 h ex posure, with a 48 h interval between the exposures, no adverse effects were found on cell viability and barrier function. Authors also evaluated effects of 24 h exposure on glutathione (GSH) and heat shock protein 70 levels in NHKs before and after differenti ation and no stress response was detected. Human dermal fibroblasts were employed by Wilmink and co-workers (2011a) to investigate cellular and molecular response to THz field exposure. In vitro exposures of 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 min were performed in a temperature-controlled chamber using a molecular gas THz laser (2.52 THz, 848 W/m2). Both computational and conducted us ing finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modelling approaches, infrared cameras, and thermocouples. Cellular viability was assessed using conventional MTT assays. In a ddition, to determine if protein and/or DNA damage occurred, qPCR was empl oyed to quantify the transcriptional activation of genes involved in protein and DNA sensing and re pair pathways. Comparable analyses were also conducted for hyperthermic (40\u00b0C for 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 min) and genotoxic (3 min UV lamp exposure, 254 nm and 38 W) posi tive controls. They found that cellular temperatures increased by 3\u00b0C during all THz exposures, and equivalent levels of cell survival ( 90%) and heat shock protein expression (3.5-fold increases) in the THz and hyperthermic exposure groups for each exposu re duration. In addition, the expression of DNA sensing and repair genes was unchanged in both groups; however, appreciable increases were observed in the genotoxic controls. In this paper, computational modelling techniques to simulate the thermal history of cells expose d to THz field were employed, and authors concluded that 2.52 TH z bioeffects may be accurately predicted with conventional thermal damage models (Wilmink et al., 2011a). In two more recent papers from Hintz sche and co-workers, human primary dermal fibroblasts (HDF cells) and a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) were exposed to THz field in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 67 different conditions to evaluate primary DNA damage (comet assay) and chromosomal damage (micronucleus assay). In the first paper (Hintzsche et al., 2012), cell cultures were exposed from below with a collimated Gaussian beam at 0.106 THz in a modified incubator at defined environmental conditions for 2 h, 8 h, and 24 h with different power density ranging from 0.4 W/m2 to 20 W/m2, representing levels below, at, and above current safety limits. Neither DNA strand br eaks nor alkali-labile sites, in the comet assay, or chromosomal damage in the form of micronucleus induction were detected. In the second paper (Hintzsche et al., 2013), human skin cells (HDF and HaCaT) were exposed in vitro to terahertz radiation for 2 and 8 h at the specific frequencies of 0.380 and 2.520 THz, with power dens ity ranging from 0.3-9 W/m2. Chromosomal damage was not detected in the different cell types after ex posure to radiation of both frequencies. In addition, cell proliferation wa s quantified and found to be unaffected by the exposure, and there was no increase in DNA damage measured in the comet assay for both frequencies. In two recent papers from the same resear ch group, an artifici al human skin tissue model (EpiDermFT, MatTek), resembling no rmal tissue structure, was employed to address the effects of THz wa ve on human skin tissue. The model consists of normal, human derived epidermal keratinocytes and derm al fibroblasts that form a multi-layered, highly differentiated model of human dermis and epidermis. It is mitotically and metabolically active and preserves the arrang ement and communication of cells in skin tissue in vivo . Titova et al.(2013a) exposed tissue sa mples at room temperature (21\u00b0C) for 10 min at the focus of a 1 kHz pulsed THz beam with high and low THz energy of 1 \u00b5J and 0.1 \u00b5J, respectively. The time averag ed-THz power density was 570 W/m2 at the highest THz pulse energy, and the temperatur e increase was estimated to be less than 0.7 \u00b0C. The presence of phosphorylated H2AX ( H2AX) was significant induction of H2AX phosphorylation was detected, whic h that is one of the earliest and most characterized cellular responses to DSBs , thus indicating DNA damage. At the same time, THz exposure resulted in the increase of the expression level of various proteins that take part in cell cycle control and DSB repair processes. Titova et al., (2013b) exposed the same artificial human skin tissue to picoseco nds-duration broadband (0.2- 2.5 repetition rate, 1/e2 spot -size diameter of 1.5 mm and pulse energy of 1.0 \u00b5J or 0.1 \u00b5J. Tissue samples in single we ll plates were placed at the focus of the pulsed THz beam for 10 min 30 min after irradiation, excised 2 mm-diameter exposed portions of the tissues were an alysed using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Espression BeadChip. Exposure to THz pulses profoundly affected gene expression in directly exposed human skin. The levels of 442 genes and the levels of 397 genes resulted affected after 10 min exposure to TH z pulses with energy of 1.0 \u00b5J and 0.1 \u00b5J, respectively, when compared to unexposed controls. 219 differential expressed genes were common for both THz pulse exposure regimes; among them 164 were down regulated, and 55 were up regulated and in clude genes involved in the etiology of dermatological diseases and ca ncer, but also genes with key functions in apoptotic signal pathways. Since the induced changes in tran scription levels are opposite to disease- related changes, authors hypothesized potential therapeutic applications of intense THz pulses. Human epithelial cells and embr yonic stem cells were studie d by Williams et al. (2013). They exposed human corneal epithelial (HCE- T), human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE- 19) and human embryonic stem (h ES07) cells, at frequencies up to 0.5 THz in different conditions to evaluate cell morphology and proliferation (phase contrast microscopy and BrdU staini ng), and differentiation (immunostaining). Confluent ARPE-19 cell cultures we re irradiated for 3 h (1.8 W/m 2 average power density) and their morphology and growth ob served immediately af ter exposure and for various time up to several days. Subconfluent cultures of both the ARPE-19 and HCE-T epithelial cells were exposed (1.4 to 3.7 W/m2 average power density) for periods of the order of 3 h, to test the effects of exposure time, the influence of multiple exposures and the influence of irradiation on longer term cell behaviour, such as the subsequent cell proliferation after sub-cu lturing. hES07 cells were exposed (0.2 to 2.9 W/m2) for variable Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 68 duration (2-6 h) to evaluate the effects on attachment, proliferation and differentiation. It was found that epithelial cell cultures did not show any effect s in terms of cell morphology or proliferation, irrespective of the specific cell type, exposure time and multiple exposures. Similar results were ob served in embryonic st em cells that also demonstrated that they maintain their undifferentiated phenotype after THz irradiation. Human blood cells have also been investig ated, mainly in the fr amework of the EU funded THz-BRIDGE project (http://w ww.frascati.enea.it/THz-BRIDGE/). Zeni et al. (2007), using a Free Electron La ser and a specific THz delivery system to irradiate whole blood samples, exposed human blood samples from 17 healthy donors for 20 min to Terahertz radiation, and different electromagnetic conditions were considered. In particular, the frequencies of 120 and 130 GHz were chosen: the first one was tested at 0.5 W/m2, while the second one was tested at 0.3-2.3 W/m2. In this paper, Specific energy Absorption Rate (SAR) values were also calculated that resulted in 0.4 mW/g and 0.24, 1.4, and 2 mW/g for 120 and 130 GHz respectively. Chromosomal damage was evaluated in PHA stimulated whole blood cultur es established after i rradiation, by means of the cytokinesis block micronucleus techni que, which also gives information on cell cycle kinetics. Moreover, huma n whole blood samples exposed to 130 GHz at SAR levels of 1.4 and 2 mW/g were also tested for pr imary DNA damage by a pplying the alkaline comet assay immediately afte r exposure. The results obta ined indicated that THz exposure, in the explored electromagneti c conditions, was not able to induce chromosomal damage or alteration of cell cy cle kinetics in PHA st imulated human blood lymphocytes, and primary DNA damage in human leukocytes from healthy subjects. Korenstein-Ilan et al. (2008), applied cont inuous-wave (CW) 0.1 THz field (0.31 W/m 2) to PHA stimulated human lymphocytes isolated from whole blood samples from healthy volunteers and cultured according to standa rd protocol. After 1, 2 and 24 h exposure, they examined the changes in chromosome number of chromosomes 1, 10, 11 and 17 and changes in the replication timing of th eir centromeres using in terphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosome s 11 and 17 were shown to be the most vulnerable (about 30% increase in aneuploidy after 2 and 24 h of exposure), while chromosomes 1 and 10 were not affected. Changes were also observed in the asynchronous mode of replication of cent romeres 11, 17 and 1 (by 40%) after 2 h of exposure and of all four centromeres af ter 24 h of exposure (by 50%). Authors speculated that the induced genomic instability was likely caused by radiation-induced low-frequency collective vibrational modes of proteins and DNA (Kor enstein-Ilan et al., 2008). Rodent cell types Berns and Bewley (1987) invest igated the effects of pulsed 1.5 THz field on a rat kangaroo kidney cell line (PTK2). They used Fr ee Electron Laser to expose cells at room temperature to 10, 20 or 100 pulses of 100 W/cm2 for 1-10 min; 1 W/m2 average power density. They examined cell morphology by means of standard light microscopy and did not observe any changes either immediately after irradiat ion and 3 h post exposure. Small changes were observed only 20 h post exposure. DNA synthesis, measured by means of 3H thymidine isotopes and autoradiographic analysis was foun d to be inhibited after long exposure. The same group also found DNA synthesis inhibition in either synchronized S phase or unsynchronized Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells under 5-10 min exposure to 1. 5 THz field, 1 W/m2 average (Berns et al., 1990, 1994). Bock et al. (2010) exposed mouse mesenchymal stem cell s (MSC) to a broadband THz field (~ 10 THz), average power density of 10 W/m2 for 2, 4, 6 and 9 h. By looking at morphological changes, a significant accumulation of lipid-like droplets in the cytoplasm was evident after 9 h THz irradiation. By looking at global gene expression (Affymetrix mouse genome microarray), many of the MS C genes did not respond at all (89%), certain genes were activated (6%), while still other genes were repressed (5%) significantly after 9 h irradiat ion. In the group of activated genes, confirmed by mRNA level quantification by using RT-PCR, the over-expression of transcription factor Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 69 peroxisome proliferator-activat ed receptor gamma (PPARG) that is known to be required for adipocyte differentiation, suggested that a THz field, in the specific exposure conditions, enhanced the differentiation proc ess towards an adipoc yte-like phenotype in MSC. Authors proposed that a THz field could represent a potential tool for activation of cellular differentiation. More recently, the same research group in a follow up of the previous study (Alexandrov et al., 2011), investigated the effects of both pulsed and CW THz field on hyperthermic genes (i.e. genes that usually respond to temperature increases in the cell) in MSCs. Low-power radiation from both a pulsed br o a d - b a n d ( c e n t r e d a t 1 0 T H z ) s o u r c e ( 1 0 W/m2) and from a CW laser (2.52 THz) source (~30 W/m2) was applied for 2 and 9 h. Modelling, empirical characte rization, and monitoring te chniques were applied to minimize the impact of radiat ion-induced increases in temper ature. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate changes in the transcriptional ac tivity of selected hyperthermic genes. Temperature increases were minimal, and the differential expression of the investigated heat shock proteins (HSP105, HS P90, and CPR) resulted unaff ected, while the expression of certain other genes (Adiponectin, GLUT4, and PPARG) showed clear effects of the THz irradiation after prolonge d, broad-band exposure. Hintzsche et al. (2011), inve stigated and quantified th e production of spindle disturbances in A(L) cells, a human-hamster hybrid cell line, by a 0.106 THz field (CW). Monolayer cultures in petri dishes were expo sed for 0.5 h to a 0.106 THz field with power densities ranging from 0.43 W/m2 to 43 W/m2 or were kept under sham conditions (negative control) for the same period. As a positive control, 100 \u00b5g/ml of the insecticide trichlorfon, which is an aneuploidy-inducing ag ent, was used for an exposure period of 6 h. During exposure, the sample containers we re kept at defined environmental conditions in a modified incubator as required by th e cells. Based on a to tal of 6,365 analysed mitotic cells, the results of two replicate experiments sugge st that 0.106 THz field is a spindle-acting agent as predominately in dicated by the appearance of spindle disturbances at the anaphase and telophase (especially lagging and non-disjunction of single chromosomes) of cell divisions. The authors claimed that their findings do not necessarily imply disease or injury but may be important for evaluating possible underlying mechanisms. In conclusion, taken together, the in vitro studies differ greatly for exposure characteristics and duration, cell type, biological endpoint and do not allow for any conclusion. Concerning genotoxicity, due to the close correlation between DNA damage and cancer occurrence, and the importance of genomic instability in assessing the potential health effects of radiation, the conflicting results presented here deserve future attention.

Studies on mechanisms The most relevant studies on possible mechanis ms of effects of THz fields on biological systems are quoted in this section. They mainly originate from the Frohlich studies (1968, 1975) that postulated th at the homeostasis of living systems is assured by the flow of free energy through a coherent exited state maintain ed by metabolic processes, and predicted that biological objects are able to support, unde r defined conditions, coherent excitations in the range 109-1012 Hz. As a matter of fact, based on this assumption, THz field exposure might be expected to affe ct biological processes and Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 71 living systems. Theoretical models have b een developed to support the onset of non- thermal effects of THz fields. They are mainly based on the fact that the energy scale of a THz field is within the range of hydrogen bonds, van der W aals interactions, and charge- transfer reactions and thus, through nonlin ear resonance mechanisms, such fields may have a significant effect on biomolecules and ce lls (Chitanvis, 2006). Some theoretical works have addressed this possibility. Re cently, a fascinating approach has been proposed by Alexandrov et al. (2010). It pred icts that high electric fields can generate localized modes of vibration in DNA molecule and that THz excitation could induce and drive conformational changes. They show ed that THz field could cause dynamic separations of the DNA double strands, and claimed that the nonlinear resonance mechanism is active even for small amplitudes of the THz field, but it is probabilistic and therefore requires extended exposure. Th e conformations generated through this mechanism can subsequently affect molecular processes involved in gene expression and DNA replication. The observation on the influence of THz fields on the natural dynamics of DNA was confirmed in the study by Swan son (2011); furthermore, he showed that parameter variation can eliminate breather modes entirely or make them unrealistically strong, that thermal noise completely domina tes the external influences of the system, and that it is extremely unlikely that double stranded DNA denaturation can be induced by experimentally acce ssible THz fields. Overall, the relevance of thes e mechanisms is questionable, since the postulated effects have not been experimentally verifi ed at permissible exposure levels. 3.5.3. Discussion on health effects from THz fields A proper risk assessment on health effects from THz exposures is difficult to perform since little pertinent evidence is available due to the small number of investigations carried out so far. Most of the studies have been performed in the la st decade, mainly in the frequency range of 0.1-1 THz. Only very few investigations are available on higher frequencies. In vivo studies mainly indicate beneficial effects on disorders of intravascular components of microcirculation in rats und er immobilization stress, but do not address acute and chronic toxicity or carcinogenesis. In vitro studies on mammalian cells differ greatly with respect to irradiation conditions and endpoints under investigation. Studies suggesting effects of exposure have not been replicated in independent laboratories. Some theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, but they are difficult to accept since no conclusive experimental evidence is available. More systematic research is needed for any firm conclusions to be drawn on the health effects from exposure to a THz field. In pa rticular, broader frequency ranges are to be investigated. Human and animal studies should address specific endpoints related to possible toxic effects on the skin and the cornea. Positive studie s need to be replicated in independent laboratories. Considering the expected increa se in use of THz technologies , more research focusing on the effects on skin (long-term, low-level exposure) and cornea (high-intensity, short- term exposure) is recommended. In addition , monitoring of occupationally exposed groups for skin and eye changes and disorders wo uld be useful. 3.5.4. Conclusion on health effects from THz fields The number of studies investigating potential biological, non-thermal effects of THz fields is small, but has been increasing over recent years, due to the availability of adequate sources and detectors. However, scientific studies on potentia l health effects from long- term exposure are still lacking. In vivo studies indicate mainly bene ficial effects on disorders of intravascular components of microcirculation in rats under immobiliz ation stress, but do not address acute and chronic toxicity or carcinogenesis. In vitro studies on mammalian ce lls differ greatly with respect to irradiation conditions and endpoints under investigation. Studies suggesting effects of exposure have not been replic ated in independent laboratories. Some Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 72 theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, but no conclusive experimental support is available. Considering the expected increa se in use of THz technologies , more research focusing on the effects on skin (long-term, low-level exposure) and cornea (high-intensity, short- term exposure) is recommended. 3.6. Health effects from RF fields 3.6.1. Neoplastic diseases 3.6.1.1. Epidemiological studies Brain tumours and other tumours of the head and neck area What was already known on this subject? In the previous SCENIHR Opinion adopted in 2009, it was conclude d that the evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that the use of mobile phones for less than ten years was not associated with an increased risk of develo ping a brain tumour. A major limitation however was that only few longer term users were included in those studies, circumventing firm conclusions related to long-term mobile ph one use. In addition, it was noted that any conclusions of risk after indu ction periods of more than 20 years were not possible due to the short lif etime of the technology. What has been achieved since then? Exposure considerations for mobile telephony Exposure assessment in epidemiological st udies of mobile phone (MP) users is complicated due to the complex and varying use patterns and power control as well as the rapid changes of technologies and device s. As a first proxy the exposure has been assessed comparing users versus non-users. The next step has been to use the cumulative call time. . However, a long-term user has often used more than one phone model, and sometimes also more than one mobile phone system (analogue and digital systems). It is particularly complicated to combine the use of different phones with different power outputs, syst ems, frequencies and intracor poreal distributions of the Specific energy Absorption Rate (S AR) into one exposure measure. Different mobile phones have different output power and the change is quite large when first generation phones are co mpared with today's models. The old analogue phones had an output power of 1 W and it was seldom down-regulated due to the long distance between base stations. The 2nd generation GSM phones oper ate with a peak power of 2 or 1 W for the 900 and 1800 MHz band, resp ectively. This is then down-regulated depending on to the quality of the connection to the base station. Lauer et al. (2013) give the average output power as 133 mW for GSM 900 and 62 mW for GSM 1800. Persson et al. (2012) report that the averag e terminal output power for 3G voice calls was below 1 mW for any environment includ ing rural, urban, and dedicated indoor networks. The median value was of the or der of 10 \u00b5W. For DECT phones the rated output power is 10 mW. Hansson Mild et al. (2005) used the average ou tput as a weight factor for the call time on the various phone types, NMT, GSM and DECT. Howeve r, since the NMT operate at a much higher output power, the weighting made their use dominant. In another attempt Cardis et al. (2011a) tried to estimate the ra dio frequency (RF) dose as the amount of mobile phone RF energy absorb ed at the location of a brai n tumour. They quantified all the main parameters thought to influence the amount of the total cumulative specific RF energy from mobile telephone use (in joules per kilogram), or dose, absorbed at a particular location in the brain. This algorithm was then applied to Interphone Study subjects in five countries (Cardis et al. 2011b). Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 73 With regard to the dynamic changes in technology, exposed body regions and use patterns, exposure assessment in epidem iological studies of users of mobile telecommunication devices such as smart phones, tablets et c. faces severe problems. In view of the lack of verification of any proposed non-thermal interaction mechanism, established knowledge does not suggest effe cts accumulating with time. Beyond that, there is no sound scientific basis for defining additional dose-dependent exposure parameters. Brain tumours A working group at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) within the Monograph program on the evaluation of carc inogenic risks to humans classified the epidemiological evidence for glioma due to mo bile phone use as limited, but extended the conclusion to the entire RF range and classi fied it as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC 2013, Baan et al., 2011). Whether the use of mobile phones is associat ed with an increased risk of brain tumours has been the research question of numer ous small and a handful of large-scale epidemiological studies. Attention has focused on the possibility of tumours of the head and neck region because these tissues are primarily exposed to the RF fields emitted by hand-sets. Several studies were completed just between the last SCENIHR Opinion (SCENIHR, 2009) and today, allowing now a more thorough assessment especially regarding longer-term use over more than a decade. The associ ation between mobile phone use and brain tumour risk was investigated with three di fferent study designs, including ecological studies, i.e. age- and sex-spe cific time trend analyses of brain tumour incidence rates; case-control studies; and cohort studies. Due to the inherent strengths and weaknesses related to each of the approaches, their resu lts complement each other and contribute to the overall picture. Case-control studies are common in cancer epidemiology because cancer subtypes are rare diseases, and this approach involves co mparing exposure patterns in persons with the disease of interest to a random sample of non-diseased from the same source population. In case-control studies, exposure is often assessed by personal interviews that, since collecting detailed personal information is possible, allows for a rather detailed modelling of exposure. Limitati ons of case-control studies include i) the challenge of establishing a truly representative control gr oup, given that many countries lack a good framework for random sampling and, since active participation is required, that selection bias may result if participation is related to the exposure of interest; ii) the challenge of recruiting the cases especially for a disease with poor prognosi s and, with regard to brain tumours, that symptoms of the disease may include memory difficulties; and iii) exposure estimation mainly ba sed on recall of study subjec ts, which may give rise to recall bias generally overesti mating a possible effect. Self-r eported exposure also suffers from substantial misclassification as detailed information on everyday activities in the distant past is sought, such as the amount of mobile phone use more than 5-10 years earlier. Cohort studies follow the direction of aetiol ogy by assessing exposure prior to occurrence of disease, but when investigating a rare di sease very large numbers of participants are needed. With such large numbers, exposure assessment is often crude. In addition, a system for tracing study subjects to collec t information on disease occurrence needs to be in place. Unsurprisingly, given these de mands, no prospective study with detailed exposure information has been completed, although one study ha s been underway in Europe since 2007 (Sch\u00fcz et al., 2010). The on ly cohorts that provided results are a Danish cohort study of mobile phone subscr ibers and the UK Million Women Study, both described below. Cohort studies are not fr ee of bias; once again, selection bias (comarability of study groups) may be of some concern, although not to the same extent as in case-control studies if within-cohor t comparisons are made; exposure assessment is often a weakness as it is often cr ude and sometimes based on self-reported Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 74 information with uncertain a ccuracy. However, an advantage compared to case-control studies is that exposure information is coll ected before occurrence of the disease, and therefore the reporting of expo sure information is unrelated to disease status avoiding recall bias. Ecological studies are prone to ecological falla cy; due to lack of data at the individual level, findings may reflect cases that occur in the unexposed segmen ts of the population. With regard to mobile phone use, ecological studies based on high-qua lity cancer registry information (nearly complete coverage of th e cancer cases) have some value if one assumes an effect with alread y modest mobile phone use, as then exposure prevalence has increased sharply to cover the vast majori ty of the population and would affect the incidence time trends; however, if an effe ct were restricted to , for example a small proportion of very heavy users in the popula tion, such an effect may be missed in the trends unless heavy users can be identified. An example of such a method was a study exploring links between brain cancers and va rious environmental fa ctors in 165 countries for generating hypotheses (de Vocht et al. 20 13). They reported higher incidence rates of brain cancers in countries with the most freq uent mobile phone subs criptions. The study is not informative for causal inference, as popular use of mobile phones can also reflect standard of living, which is also associated with, for example, availa bility of diagnostic medical services. Ecological studies on the other hand can be used for consistency checks that extrapolate the risk estimates from case-c ontrol or cohort studies to surveillance data and compare the expected with the observed changes in time trends. This approach is strong as it is based on objective and comprehensive data, when the predictions would result in a major increase in the disease burden of the population in particular in case of mobile phones with their ve ry high prevalence. In the following paragraphs, case-control, co hort and ecological st udies will first be described separately. The last part will summarize the findings of all three designs and an interpretation of the overall evidence is given. Case-control studies Interphone was a multinational case-control study conducted in 16 centres in 13 countries; several country-spe cific results were already available for the previous SCENIHR Opinion (SCENIHR, 2009). The final re port of Interphone included 2708 cases of glioma with 2792 matched controls, an d 2409 meningioma cases with 2662 matched controls (Interphone Study Group, 2010). A redu ced risk related to ever having been a regular mobile phone user (using a mobile phone at least once a week over a period of 6 months or more) was seen for glioma (odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.94) and meningioma (OR 0.79; CI 0.68-0.91). No elevated OR was observed beyond 10 years after first phone use (glio ma: OR 0.98; CI 0.76-1.26; meningioma: OR 0.83; 95% 0.61-1.14). ORs were below 1.0 fo r all deciles of lifetime number of phone calls compared with non-regular users and for nine deciles of cumulative call-time, with several ORs in the intermediate categories be ing statistically signif icantly decreased. In the top decile of recalled cumulative call time, beyond 1640 hours of use, the OR was 1.40 (CI 1.03-1.89) for glioma, and 1.15 (CI 0.81-1.62) for meningioma. An analysis with the lightest users (less than 5 hours of use) as a reference gave respective ORs of 1.82 from glioma and 1.10 for meningioma. ORs for glioma tended to be higher in the temporal lobe than in other lobes of the brain, but the CIs aro und the lobe-specific estimates were wide. ORs for glioma were hi gher in subjects wh o reported phone use mostly on the same side of the head (ipsil ateral) as their tumour than for use on the opposite side (contralateral ). For meningioma, ORs for te mporal lobe tumours were slightly lower than for other locations, while a similar pattern as for glioma of higher ipsilateral ORs compared to contralatera l ORs was seen. Years since first use by cumulative call time showed the highest ORs for heavy use in the shortest-term users of 1-4 years for in both gl ioma and meningioma. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 75 Several factors may have had an impact on th e results: i) evidence of an overestimation of mobile phone users among co ntrols contributed to the overall decrease in risk in overall use; ii) prodromal symptoms of the tumour, particularly glioma, may have added to this effect if due to those symptoms pa tients refrain from be coming mobile phone users or use it less as they would otherwise; iii) evidence of general difficulties in remembering past mobile ph one use accurately, introducing non-differential random error, that would lead to an underestimation of an association, if it exists; iv) evidence of systematic reporting errors with underestimati on of use by light users and overestimation of use by heavy users, that could inflate an association; v) some evidence of stronger over-reporting of past use in cases than in controls, and of more commonly reported implausible values in cases that could lead to a spurious positive a ssociation. Due to the n a t u r e o f v a r i o u s b i a s e s w i t h s o m e l e a d i n g to under- and some to overestimation of associations, firm conclusi ons are difficult to draw. Two novel approaches were used in subsets of the Interphone data to further explore the relationship between RF and location of the brain tumour (Larjavaara et al., 2011; Cardis et al., 2011b). Larjavaara et al. (2011) used two approaches: In a case-case analysis, tumour locations were compar ed with varying exposure levels; in a case-specular analysis, a hypothetical reference location was assigned for each glioma, and the distances from the actual and hypothetical lo cations to the mobile phone were compared. The study included 888 gliomas from 7 Europe an countries. Overall, the results did not suggest that gliomas in mobile phone users are preferentially located in the parts of the brain with the highest RF exposure. Based on small numbers, however, the OR from the case-specular analysis in mobile phone user s of 10+ years was 2.0 (CI: 0.68-5.85) and was 1.0 (CI: 0.59-1.69) in the category of highest cumulative ca ll time (>339 hours). Cardis et al. (2011b) used a RF modelling algorithm developed based on mobile phone characteristics such as frequenc y, type of phone, etc. and location of the brain tumour based on images (Cardis et al. 2011a), and applied it to 553 glioma and 676 meningioma cases with 1762 and 1911 controls, not over-la pping with the study population from Larjavaara et al. RF dose was estimated as to tal cumulative specific energy (TCSE; J/kg) absorbed at the tumour's estimated centre. Th e ORs for glioma increased with increasing TCSE 7 or more years before di agnosis, with an OR of 1.91 (C I: 1.05-3.47) in the highest quintile, other ORs varied around 1.0. Patterns for meningioma were similar, but ORs were usually lower, many below 1.0, except for TCSE 7 or more years before diagnosis where the OR was 2.01 (CI: 1.03-3.93). A co mplementary analysis in which 44 glioma and 135 meningioma cases in the most expose d area of the brain were compared with gliomas and meningiomas located elsewhere in the brain showed increased ORs mainly for glioma in the most exposed part of the br ain in those with 10+ years of mobile phone use (OR 2.80, CI 1.13 to 6.94 for glioma; OR 1.34, CI 0.55-3.25 for meningioma) but not in those in the highest category of cumulati ve mobile phone use, 1147+ hours (OR 0.99, CI: 0.30-3.27 for glioma; OR 1.41, CI 0.66 -3.02 for meningioma). Comparing the two sets of results with the origin al Interphone results shows co nsistency; while the approach by Larjavaara et al. (2010) is rather conser vative and attempts to remove sources of recall bias, it strengthens the overall finding of no associat ion, whereas the approach by Cardis et al. (2011a) offers a refinement of the exposure metr ic emphasizing the association in heavy users; however, it is still based on recall and cannot therefore exclude that the observed asso ciation might be due to bias. Another case-control study in several part s was done in Sweden. A pooled analysis covered two case-control studies on patien ts with malignant brain tumours diagnosed during 1997-2003 and matched controls alive at the time of study inclusion, as well as one case-control study on pati ents and controls deceased du ring the same time period (Hardell et al., 2011). The analysis incl uded 1,251 cases and 2,438 controls. ORs increased with latency being 1.1 (CI 0.9-1.4) for 1-5 years, 1.2 (CI 0.9-1.5) for >5-10 years and 2.5 (CI 1.8-3.3) for 10+ years of mobile phone use. For cordless phone use the respective figures are 1.1 (CI 0.9-1.4) , 1.4 (1.1-1.8) and 1.6 (CI 1.03-2.5). Risks were highest when use started before the age of 20 years, especially for astrocytoma. Risks increased by 1-2% per 100 hours of cordless phone or mobile phone use. No Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 76 validation studies to assess the possible impact of bias and errors were carried out for this study, but most of those identified in Interphone would likely apply to this study, too. While response rates for the Hardell stud ies were reported to be higher than for Interphone, the mixture of self-administered questionnaire and telephone interviews not described in detail allowed less standardized guidance through complicated questions. In a commentary, Hardell et al. (2011) made an attempt to allow better comparison between the results of the In terphone study and the Swedish case-control studies, by restriction to the same age group of 30-59 years and applying the Interphone definition of a non-regular mobile phone user (regular user was defined as at least one call per week over a period of six months or more and disregarding cordless phone use) and the cut-offs of different user categories to th eir data. The ORs in the two studies became more similar for the heavy users (as defi ned by Interphone, 1640+ hours of lifetime cumulative use), being 1.75 (1.02-3.00) for th e Swedish studies compared to 1.40 (1.03- 1.89) for Interphone, but for most other comp arisons remained different (e.g. for time since first use of >10 years: 1.79 (1.19- 2.70) vs 0.98 (0.76-1.26; quantify the re lationship, Interphone and the Hardell studies were analysed in a meta-analytical approach (Hardell et al., 2013a), an OR of 1.71 (CI: 1.04-2.81) was found for temporal glioma am ong ipsilateral mobile phone users of 10+ years of use; however, the above-mentioned caveats of combining those studies remain. Hardell and Carlberg (2013) anal ysed the survival of patients after glioma diagnosis in relation to the use of wire less phones. All cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 with a malignant brain tumour (n = 1,251) in the authors case-control studies were included. For glioma, the use of wireless phones (mobil e and cordless phones) gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% CI =0.9-1.2) , with >10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma grade IV (g lioblastoma), HR was 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95- 1.4), with >10 year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (>426 h) of cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. A decreased survival of glioma cases with lo ng-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones (mobile and DECT) was found. Three further case-control studies were published recently. Hardell et al. (2013b) extended their case-control study series with glioma cases aged 18-75 years and diagnosed between 2007-2009, with overall 593 participating cases and 1368 controls, using the methodology of their previous studie s. ORs for use of different types of wireless phones were increased, being 1.8 (CI: 1. 04-3.3) for analogue phones, 1.6 (CI: 0.996- 2.7) for digital (2G) phones, and 1.7 (CI: 1. 1-2.9) for cordless phones; all associations were stronger when latency periods between 15-25 years we re taken into account. For analogue phones and >25 years of latency, the OR was 3.3 (CI: 1.6-6.9), and for all digital (2G, 3G, cordless) phones combined and >20 years latency it was 1.5 (CI: 0.5- 4.6). They also extended thei r set of meningioma cases, al so by those aged 18-75 years and diagnosed between 2007-2009 (Carlberg et al., 2013), involving 709 cases and the same 1368 combined controls of the glioma and meningioma study as used for the glioma analyses. ORs for use of different type s of wireless phones were not increased, being 0.9 (CI: 0.6-1.5) for an alogue phones, 1.0 (CI: 0.7-1. 4) for digital (2G) phones, and 1.1 (CI: 0.8-1.5) for cordless phones. ORs varied around 1.0 for different phone types also when taking long latencies into a ccount. With >25 years latency, the OR for all wireless phones combined (analogue and all digital) was 1.2 (0.6-2.4), based on 16 exposed cases and 33 exposed controls. In the highest category of use ( 2376 hours), for all phone types combined, the OR was 1.4 (CI: 0.9-2.0). Coureau et al. (2013) published results from a French multi-centre case-control study of cases of glioma and meningioma diagnosed between 2004-2006, with a total of 253 gliomas, 194 meningiomas and 892 controls, following a qu estionnaire-based approach for exposure assessment. No association was seen when co mparing ever regular users with non-users (OR 1.24, CI: 0.86-1.77 for glioma; OR 0.90, CI: 0.61-1.34 for meningioma). When specifically looking at the highest category of lifetime cumulative use ( 896 hours), however, ORs increased, and were 2.89 (CI: 1.41-5.93) for glioma and 2.57 (CI: 1.02- 6.44) for meningioma. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 77 The results on glioma from th e most recent Swedish study ar e in line with the previous results from the same group, namely showing increased risk s with ever use of mobile phones for all wireless phone type s, that even increase furthe r with longer latencies. The French study finds an increased risk only in \"heavy\" users and is therefore often interpreted as being compatible with Interp hone (Interphone, 2010). However, it needs to be noted that the strengths of associations are very different and so is the definition of a \"heavy\" user, with a much lower cut-off in the French study. Fo r glioma, the French study (Coureau et al., 2013) shows an OR of 2.89 for 896 hours, while the comparable categories in Interphone show ORs of 0.71 (CI: 1.40 (CI: 1.03-1.89) for 1640 hours. The only available study on mobile phone use and brain tumours in children and adolescents is the Cefalo study conducted in four European countries, involving face-to- face interviews with 352 families of brain tumour patients in 7-19 year olds and 646 matched controls (Aydin et al., 2011a). Regu lar use (again at least one call per week over a period of 6 months or more) showed a statistically non-significantly increased OR of 1.36 (CI 0.92-2.02), but there was no trend by either time since first use, cumulative number of calls, or cumulative call time. Use of cordless ph ones showed no increased OR (1.09; CI 0.81-1.45), not even in the group of highest cumulative use. For a subsample of participants it was possible to obtain tr affic records from mobile phone operators: while the OR significantly increased in the time since first use category of longest latency of >2.8 years (2.15; CI 1.07 to 4.29), there was no trend by cumulative call time with ORs being 1.24, 1.95 and 1.38 (none statistically signific antly elevated). No clear patterns were seen when comparing ipsilatera l and contralateral use. Validation studies in the context of Cefalo confirm observations from Interphone, namely the difficulty of participants to accurately recall past mobile phone use (Aydin et al., 2011b). Cohort studies Follow-up of all private Danish subscriber s of mobile phones starting in 1982-1995 for brain tumour risk until 2006 was included in the previous Opinion (SCENIHR, 2009). In the meantime, an update of this cohort was published (Frei et al., 2011). In this update, 358,403 subscription holders accrued about 3.8 million person-years. Relative risks (RR) for all central nervous system tumours wa s 1.02 (CI 0.94-1.10) in men and 1.02 (CI 0.86-1.22) in women, based on 714 cases in men and 132 in women. By type of brain tumours, no associations were seen for glioma (1.08 in men and 0.98 in women) or for meningioma (0.78 in men and 1.02 in women). In the longest term subscribers, of 13+ years, RR of glioma for men was 0.98 (CI 0. 70-1.36), based on 37 cases. Analysis by lobe showed no clear pattern, the RR for te mporal lobe glioma in men being 1.13 (CI 0.86-1.48); due to small numbers no subana lyses were possible fo r women. Exposure misclassification is of concern in this cohort study, as information was only available on subscriptions in the name of an individual (no subscriptions that were in the name of a company) and no data were obtained on the amount of use; cordless phone use was not included. An advantage, however, is that subscriber status was ascertained before occurrence of disease. . No analysis by am ount of use was possible. Therefore, heavy users could not be analysed separately. This could lead to an underestimation of the association if risk was restri cted to heavy use, depending however on the proportion of heavy users within the overall user category. Recently, the results of the Million Women Study conducted in the UK pertaining to mobile phone use were released (Benson et al. 2013), with prospective data on years of mobile phone use and never, less than da ily, or daily use for approximately 800,000 middle-aged women. The mobile phone use was assessed by questionnaire and did not include the use of cordless phones. No indicati ons of increased risks of glioma were found in relation to duration or frequency of mo bile phone use (rate ratios for the highest exposed groups of 10+ years of mobile phone use or daily use, respectively, based on 40 cases, group 0.8-0.9 with upper confidence limits around 1.1). Rate ratios were close to one also for meningioma for all exposure indi ces. In summary, the relative risks for 10+ years of mobile phone use were 0.78 (CI 0.55 -1.10) for glioma and 1.10 (CI 0.66-1.84) Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 78 for meningioma. The follow-up was relatively short, on average seven years, and numbers of cases for specific tumour types rath er small, especially for long/term users. Time trend analyses Analyses of recent time trends of brain tu mours and its subtypes were published based on incidence data from the UK (de Vocht et al., 2010), from the Nordic countries (Deltour et al., 2012), and from the US (Little et al., 2012). They consistently show little indication of an increase in the age groups of most active mobile phone users and steady weak increases only in the el derly. Such analyses of inci dence trends provide evidence which is too weak to rule out an associatio n between mobile phone use and brain tumour risk but may be suitable to chec k the plausibility of reports on higher risk. In two of these studies (Deltour et al., 2012, and Little et al., 2012), simulati ons were used to evaluate the risk estimates of the case-control studie s by calculating expected time trends under various risk scenarios and comp aring them with the observed time trends. The simulation study in the Nordic countries virtually rules out a doubling in risk even after 15+ years since first mobile phone use as well as a 50% risk increase after 10+ years and 20% after 5+ years; increases of 50% after 15+ years or 20% after 10+ years would be highly unlikely as well as 10% after 5+ years (Deltour et al., 2012). When assuming risk only among heavy users, the po ssibilities of detecting such effects decrease. However, a doubling of risk with 10+ years latency or 50% with 5+ years latency are very unlikely, given the observed trends. The overall decrea sed risk in Interphone, an OR of 0.8 for overall use would also be highly unlikely, even assuming 10+ years latency (Deltour et al., 2012). The US results confirm the observat ions made on the basis of the Nordic countries (Little et al., 2012). No increase was seen in the UK study (De Vocht et al., 2011), with the exception of a small one in temporal tumours; how much this is attributable to a decline in tumours with missing information on location is unclear. With respect to teenagers and adolescents, Aydin et al. (2012) provide incidence rates from Sweden in their Cefalo report to compare wi th the ORs observed in the study; rates were stable or even slightly declining, providing little support for a 36% risk increase with overall mobile phone use as s een in the case-control analys is and some evidence against the two-fold risk increase after 2.8+ years latency as observed in the operator-records based case-control analysis. The relationship between risks observed in analytical studie s and the associated absolute excess in the incidence is show n in Figure 5 for one specific scenario. The figure shows the observed glioma incidence rate in the Nord ic countries, as reported by Deltour et al. (2012), reflecting how many ca ses occurred in the Nordic co untries. In addition, three predicted incidence rates are shown which are ba sed on an increased risk of 1.2, 1.5 or 2 respectively, after regular mobile phone us e of 10 years or more. The predicted steep increase shows that increased risks of th ese magnitudes are in conflict with the population data. That renders all studies re porting increased risks of such magnitude implausible. Consequently, the most plausible reason for the reported increased risks are methodological artefacts. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 79 Figure 5. Observed glioma incidence rate in the Nordic countries and expected rates assuming mobile phone (regular mobile phone use of 10 years or more) related relative risk increases of 1.2, 1.5 and 2, respectively [Based on data from Deltour et al. 2012] Brain tumour results in context The fact that incidence rates of glioma and me ningioma do not rise in the age groups of highest mobile phone prevalence provides evid ence that common use of mobile phones is unlikely to be associated with an increased ri sk of those brain tumours. This is confirmed by the Danish cohort study that rules out ri sks that would affect large segments of the population. Evidence against an association al so arises from the large-scale UK million women study with prospective exposure inform ation. Case-control studies already show associations for moderate mobile phone use, with decreased risk es timates in Interphone and increased risk estimates in the Hardell studies, both incompatible with the observed incidence rate time trends and demonstratin g the vulnerability of case-control studies with self-reported mobile phon e use to bias. With such a material impact already in the overall results, the findings restricted to heavy mobile ph one users become difficult to interpret. Increase of risk in heavy users, such as 1.5-fold incidence after 10 years of use, are incompatible with observed incide nce trends. The two major studies differ in some methodological aspects in cluding different comparison gr oups (different definition of the unexposed reference). However, while th is may explain some of the heterogeneity, the fundamental difference in risk observed remains in the moderate users that also influences the association seen in heavy users. The incidence time trends do not contradict a modest increase in heavy us ers because numbers of excess cases would remain too small to be detectable in the time period analysed. Acoustic neurinoma Acoustic neurinoma, also termed vestibular schwannoma, is a tumour that arises on the eighth cranial nerve leading from the inner ear to the brainstem and accounts for about 5% of all intracranial tumour s. The Interphone study also included 1105 patients with newly diagnosed acoustic neuroma and 2145 controls (Interphone Study Group, 2011). OR with ever having been a regular mobile phone user was 0.85 (CI 0.69-1.04). The OR 7.08.09.010.011.012.013.014.015.016.0 1979 1984 1989 1994 1999 2004Predicted if RR=2 Predicted if RR=1.5 Predicted if RR=1.2 Observed Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 80 for 10+ years after first regular mobile phone use was 0.76 (CI 0.52-1.11). There was no trend of increasing ORs with increasing cumulative call time or cumulative number of calls, with the lowest OR (0.48; CI 0.30-0.78) observed in the 9th de cile of cumulative call time. In the 10th decile (1640+ hours of cumulative call time), the OR was 1.32 (CI 0.88-1.97). With censoring at 5 years before the reference date the OR for 10+ years after first regular mobile phone use was 0.83 (CI 0.58-1.19) and for 1640+ hours of cumulative call time it was 2.79 (CI 1.51-5.16), but again with no tr end in the lower nine deciles and with the lowest OR in the 9th de cile. In general, ORs were not greater in subjects with ipsilateral use. Acoustic neuroma was also analysed in the Danish subscriber cohort, and follow up through 2006 identified 404 cases in men an d 402 cases in women among approximately 2.8 million Danes (Sch\u00fcz et al., 2011). Among subscribers of 11+ years since the first subscription, 15 cases occurred in men yielding an RR of 0. 87 (CI 0.52-1.46) and no case v e r s u s 1 . 6 e x p e c t e d i n w o m e n . A d d i t i o n a l c l i n i c a l d a t a s h o w e d t h a t a c o u s t i c n e u r o m a sizes in long-term mobile phone subscribers were not larger than among nonsubscribers and tended not to be more often on the righ t side of the brain, the side of the head preferred during mobile phone use by th e majority of the Danish population. The two studies align well in providing additional evidence against a positive association between common mobile phone use and risk of acoustic neuroma. In the case-control study an increased risk in the group of heav iest users was observed; patterns, however, were difficult to interpret as in the seco nd highest group of heavy use the risk was statistically significantly decr eased. As the group of heavy users comprised only 77 of the 1105 cases (about 7%), the absolute numb er of excess cases would be small in populations and therefore difficult to detect in the cohort study or in incidence time trend analyses, as done by Larjavaara et al. (2011) where no increase was observed in time trends compatible with a mobile phone-re lated hypothesis. In the UK Million Women study (Benson et al., 2013), an excess of ac oustic neuroma was seen among those using mobile phones the longest. Increased risks were noted fo r more than 10 years of use (relative risk of 2.46 (CI 1.07-5.64)), th ough the finding was based on less than 10 cases. In the same paper, an analysis of incidence rates of acoustic neuroma in England showed no increasing trend in the period 1998-2008. An update was recently published in a letter (Benson et al., 2013b); no increase in risk in acoustic neuroma was observed anymore (the relative risk for long-term user s of 10+ years decreased from 2.46 to 1.17 (CI: 0.60-2.27)), suggesting that the previous ly reported increase in risk was a chance finding. Two further case-control studies were recent ly reported from Sweden. In a study of 451 cases and 710 controls, the OR for ever usin g a mobile phone was reported to be 1.18 (CI: 0.88-1.59) (Pettersson et al., 2014). The OR for the highest quar tile of cumulative mobile phone use ( 680 hours) was initially 1.46 (CI: 0.98-2.17) and 1.14 (CI: 0.63- 2.07) when only histological confirmed cases were incl uded. Hardell et al. (2013c) added a further case-control dataset of cases diagnosed between 2007-2009 to their previous case-control dataset of acoustic ne uroma cases, and the pooled analyses based on overall 316 cases and 3530 controls. This sh owed increased risks for different wireless phone types, but strongest for analogue phon es. For use of analogue phones, ORs were 2.9 (CI: 2.0-4.3) and 7.7 (CI: 2.8-21) in those with >20 ye ars latency. The respective ORs for all digital wireless phones combined (2G, 3G, cordless) were 1.5 (CI: 1.1-2.0) and 8.1 (CI: 2.0-32) with >20 years latency. For total wireless use, in the >20 years latency group, the OR was 4.4 (CI: 2.2-9.0). Other tumours of the head and neck region Salivary gland tumours represent about 3% of the head tumours, and among them, parotid gland tumours occu r in about 70-80%. No additi onal analytical studies on mobile phone use and the risk of parotid or specifically salivary gland tumours were published since the last Opinion (SCENIHR, 2009). In addition, researchers investigated time trends in incidence rates or numbers of cases. In Israel, the total number of parotid gland cancers in Israel increased 4-fold from 1970 to 2006 (from 16 to 64 cases per Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 81 year). The steepest increase occurred afte r 2001; however, no incidence rates were presented (Czerninsky et al., 2011). In the UK , numbers of new case s of parotid gland tumours more than doubled from 112 new ca ses in 1986 to 247 in 2007 in men, and 116 to 199 cases in women (de Vocht, 2011), co rresponding to an increase in age- standardized incidence rates from 0.5 to 0.8 (1986-2008) per 100,000 in men and 0.4 to 0.6 in women. More recently, data of around 8500 patients in the Nordic countries were analysed (Shu et al., 2012). The age-standardized incide nce rate of salivary gland tumours between 1970 and 2009 was stable, with annual percent changes of -0.1% (CI: -0.4 to 0.2) for men and -0.2% (CI: -0.5%- 0.1%) for women, providing no evidence of any increase. S\u00f6derqvist et al. (2012a) studied the risk of salivary gland tumours and use of wireless phones. Sixty-nine patients with salivary gland tumours and 262 randomly recruited controls were included. The us e of wireless phones was not associated with an overall increased risk of salivary gland tumours, odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4-1.5. A UK population-based case-control study of th e risk of pituitary tumours in relation to mobile phone use enrolled 291 cases and 630 controls (Schoemaker and Swerdlow, 2009). Following the Interphone design and in terview, tumour risk was not associated with overall mobile phone use, and did not increase 10+ ye ars after first use (OR 1.0; CI: 0.5-1.9), or for users in the highest quar tile of cumulative number call time (OR 1.1; CI 0.7-1.7). A hospital based case-control study of mobile phone use and parotid gland malignancies carried out in China (Duan et al. 2011) was based on 136 epithelial cancers and 64 mucoepidermoid carcinomas with 2051 ho spital controls. However, the results are not internally consistent showing both in creases and decreases across the exposure range. Melanoma (skin, eye) and other skin cancer A German hospital-based case-control study of uveal melanoma of the eye found no increased risk related to mobile phone use (S tang et al. 2009). The material consisted of 459 cases (participation 94%) and 827 population -based controls (with additional sets of hospital and sibling controls). Regular use, long duration of use or cumulative call time did not show any increased risks (point estimates below unity, with most upper confidence bounds below 1.5). These findings co ntradict those of an earlier report (Stang et al. 2001) by the same group (related on ly to mobile phone use at work), but the current study is based on a larger material and more extensive exposure assessment. In a Swedish case-control study the use of mobile phones and cordless phones was assessed for 347 cases with mali gnant melanoma in the head and neck region and for 1,184 controls (Hardell et al., 2011). Overall no increased risk was found. In the most exposed area, namely temporal, cheek and ea r, cumulative call time of >365 hours of cordless phone use showed an OR of 2.1 (CI: 1.1-3.8) and mo bile phone use of 2.1 (CI: 0.7-6.1) in the group of 1-5 years after first use, but no association was seen for longer latencies. Using the Danish subscriber cohort study desc ribed above, no increased risks were seen for malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma of the head (Poulsen et al., 2012). Among men with 13 years of subscription , the RRs were close to unity for basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the head. For melanoma, although a slightly elevated RR was found (RR=1.20, CI: 0.65-2.22), a similar RR was observed for melanoma of torso or legs (RR=1.16, CI: 0.94 -1.47), yielding a ratio of the two RRs of 1.04 (CI: 0.54-2.00). The risk pattern was si milar among women, although it was based on smaller numbers. Discussion of brain tumours and other tumours of the head and neck area Overall, there is little evidence that moderate mobile phone use is associated with risk of any cancer in the head and neck region. This is supported by large-scale epidemiological studies of three different desi gns. Only one case-control st udy shows risk increases at Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 82 moderate usage levels, but the results are incompatible with observed time trends in incidence rates in reality checks and can th erefore not be used for hazard assessment. Evidence is more controversial for heavy users of mobile phones; \"heavy use\" is a qualitative characterisati on and difficult to quantify as the users with the highest life-long use are compared to those with lesser use (c ombining years of use and amount of daily use), with various definitions and cut-points . For instance, in Interphone, \"heavy users\" were approximately 10% of life-long heaviest regular users (or about 5% of all study subjects). It corresponds to, for example, half an hour of daily use over 10 years or more (in the communication of th e outcome of the IARC Monograph (IARC 2013)), but this figure must not be interpreted as any sugge stion of a threshold of an effect. For the heaviest users, the largest case-control study in particular observed about 40% increased risks for glioma and for acoustic neuroma. It cannot be concluded from the available studies whether this reflects a ca usal association. Limi tations of the case- control studies, including selection bias and recall bias, raise concern that the observed association in small subgroups could be attributable to methodological shortcomings. Time trend analysis in incidence rates and th e two cohort studies show no evidence of any risk. They are useful to ch eck the plausibility of elevated risk estimates but would not detect small risk increases after long er latencies in heavy users only. A major limitation of most stud ies is that mobile phone use is used as a crude proxy for RF exposure, with the latter also depending on many technological features, but very strongly - as described in the chapter on exposure - on the generation of mobile technology. RF exposure from NMT handsets were manifold higher than GSM technology or today's exposure and RF exposure duri ng the roll out of GSM technology, when networks were not fully optimized, was also substantially higher th an current exposure levels. Therefore, the increased risk estima tes seen in heavy users in case-control studies, mainly driven by former technologies may not be replicable anymore due to changed technology. For meningioma, the evidence for increased risks of long-term heavy users is weaker than for glioma, but some case-control studie s do show increased risks as well. For uveal melanoma, there is no evidence for any associ ation, including heavy users. For salivary gland tumours and melanoma of the cheek or ear the evidence is so mewhat controversial as for glioma but based on much fewer studies. Too few of the published cancer studies have sufficient statistical power and observation time to identify a potential small risk af ter use periods of 15 years or more. Most reported elevated risks did not pass the pl ausibility check by time-trend analyses. Although, overall, the evidence of any positive association is weak, given the widespread use of mobile phones, more research with im proved quality of exposure assessment is needed. There is currently only one recent study, overcoming the limitations mentioned above by oversampling light and heavy users from the population and basing exposure assessment on traffic records from netw ork operators (Sch\u00fcz et al., 2011). Cancer other than head and neck region What was already known on this subject? The previous SCENIHR Report concluded that evidence weighed against an association between RF-EMF exposure from broadcast transmitters and the risk of childhood leukaemia. What has been achieved since then? Childhood cancers in relation to RF exposure A nation-wide case-control stud y of RF EMF exposure from base stations and childhood cancers was conducted in the UK (Elliott et al. 2010). It covered all childhood malignancies diagnosed at ages 0-4 years during 1999-2001, with four controls per case identified from national birt h register, with matching on sex and date of birth. The electromagnetic field fr om base stations was estimated ba sed on coordinates of residence Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 83 at birth (obtained for 93% of the cases an d 90% of the controls) and comprehensive data on all base stations by the four nati onwide network operators. For central nervous system cancers (251 cases), no increased ri sks were found for the highest exposure tertile in terms of distance from the nearest base station, its power output or calculated power density (adjusted odds ratios 0.76-0.95 , with upper confiden ce limits 1.12-1.38). No indication of increased risks was foun d for leukaemia and lymphoma either (odds ratios 1.03-1.08, with upper confidence limits 1.34-1.42, 527 cases). Analyses of continuous exposure metrics did not reveal an y indication of exposure-response effects. Hauri et al. investigated the association be tween exposure to RF EMF from broadcast transmitters - with field strengths in V/m estimated from prediction models - and the risk of childhood cancer in children under the age of 16 year s at diagnosis in Switzerland (Hauri et al., 2014). They used two approach es: one using time-to-event analysis of children included in the Swiss National Cohort in the 2000 census followed up for cancer in the time period 2000-2008, and one approach using incidence dens ity cohort analysis by using all cases registered in the Sw iss Childhood Cancer Registry 1985-2008 and person-years under risk from censuses (1 990, 2000) and interpolation between or extrapolation before or after the respective censuses. Hazard ratios (HR) from the time- to-event analysis based on overall 830 canc ers (40 in the high exposure group >0.2 V/m) did not show an association (HR=1.02 , CI: 0.96-1.08) per 0.1 V/m increase in >0.2 V/m exposure ca tegory (HR=1.03, CI: 0.74-1.43), but some variation by cancer type, wi th a small decrease in HR for leukaemia (0.82, CI: 0.67- 1.01) and a small increase in HR for CNS tu mours (1.05, CI: 1.00-1.10). In comparison, the incidence density analysis, based on la rger numbers (3591 cases overall and 144 in the high exposure category), showed RRs of 0.90 (CI: 0.76-1.06) for all cancers combined, for >0.2 V/m compared to <0.05 V/m, for the entire time period. When splitting the time period into 1985-1995 and 1996-2008, wi th the former one possibly having less \"contamination\" from RF EMF from the mob ile telephony networks, for were 1.13 (CI: 0.45-1.23), resp ectively. Hence, no clear patterns were identified, with mainly seeing no associations, but in fe w subgroup analyses both elevated risks (CNS tumours) and reduced risks (leukaemia), po ssibly due to chance. A large case-control study of childhood cancer and environmental RF from base stations in Taiwan reported odds ratios slightly and non-significantly above unity for brain tumours, but not leukaemias (Li et al. 2012 ). The main shortcom ing of the study was crude exposure assessment, as informatio n was available on annual power of base stations but residential data related only to the township of residence at the time of diagnosis and no information on address, residential history or other sources of RF was available. No validation study of the exposure indices used was conducted. Adult cancers in relati on to RF exposure In the nationwide Danish cohort study of mo bile phone subscribers described above (Frei et al., 2011), a deficit of all cancers was observed among subscribers combined in men but not women, corresponding to RRs of 0. 96 (CI: 0.95-0.98) and of 1.02 (CI: 0.97- 1.06) respectively. The reduced risk for men was mainly seen in tobacco-related cancers, suggesting lower tobacco consumption in the group of early mobile phone subscribers compared to the general population. The above-mentioned prospect ive UK Million Women Study (Benson et al., 2013) also shows a slight deficit in ca ncers in mobile phone users, with a RR of 0.97 (CI: 0.95- 0.99), again mainly due to fewer tobacco-related cancers. Leukaemia was suggested to be of interest because it may have a shorter induction period than solid cancers. In a UK case-contr ol study, the relation of acute lymphocytic and non-lymphocytic leukaemia risk to mobile phone use was investigated, including 806 cases and 585 non-blood relatives as contro ls (Cooke et al., 2009). No association was found between regular mobile phone use (Int erphone definition) an d risk of leukaemia Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 84 (OR=1.06, CI: 0.76-1.46). Analyses of risk in relation to years since first use or cumulative call time showed no significantly raised risks, and there was no evidence of any trends. A non-significantly raised risk was found in people who first used a phone 15 or more years ago (OR=1.87, CI: 0.96-3.63 ). Another study from Thailand with 180 cases and 756 age- and sex-matched hospital controls covered only short durations of mobile phone use (median 24-26 months), rendering an observed association with digital mobile phone use difficult to interpret (Kaufman et al., 2009). Conclusions on epidemiology of neoplastic diseases Overall, the epidemiological stud ies on RF EMF exposure do no t indicate an increased risk of brain tumours, and do not in dicate an increased risk for other cancers of the head and neck region, or other ma lignant diseases including childhood cancer. Two large prospective cohort studies do not show increased risks of brain tumours or other malignancies and large-scale time se ries analyses of incidence trends are consistent with their results. Some case-control studies have reported odds ratios around 1.5 to 3 for the highest exposed groups of cu mulative use time, but recall bias cannot be excluded as a possible explanation. Case-cas e analyses of the highest exposed parts of the brain have not shown incr eased risk when exposure in dices independent of self- reported use have been employed. The on ly study of mobile phone use and brain tumours in children did not show an incr eased risk, but more studies are needed especially for those starting to use mobile ph ones as children and their cancer risk later in life. The totality of evidence of epidemiological studies weighs against cancer risks from base stations and broadcast antennas . In particular, large case-control studies modelling RF exposure and investigating the risks of childhood cancers have not shown any association. A working group at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) within the Monograph programme on the evaluation of ca rcinogenic risks to humans classified the epidemiological evidence for glioma and acoustic neuroma as limited and therefore evaluated RF fields as a possible human ca rcinogen (IARC, 2013). Based on studies published since that assessment (update of the Danish cohort study, the UK cohort study, further case-control st udies, the case-control study on mobile phones and brain tumours in children and adolescents, the cons istency checks of brain tumour incidence rates using data from the Nordic countries and the US), the evidence for glioma has become weaker. 3.6.1.2. In vivo studies What was known on this subject? A number of studies have investigated the possible carcinogenicity of RF fields using animal models. These have used both no rmal strains and those with a genetic predisposition to one or more types of ca ncer. Other studies have tested possible co- carcinogenicity with known chemical or phys ical carcinogens. While a few of these studies have reported positive results (mos t notably, Repacholi et al. (1997) found an increased lymphoma incidence in the transgenic E\u00b5-Pim1 mouse model) the majority of studies have produced no evidence that expo sure to mobile phone signals is associated with an increased incidence, latency or severi ty of neoplasms, nor does exposure have a significant effect on survival time or increa se the occurrence of other adverse responses. The previous Opinion concluded that the ne wer studies were cons istent with earlier results, and the few differences that had been observed for some endpoints were possibly false positives. Overall, it was concluded that RF fiel ds such as those emitted by mobile phones were not carcinogenic in laboratory rodents. What has been achieved since then? Bartsch et al. (2010) examined the effects of near-continuous, long-term exposure to low intensity GSM signals on health and survival in female SD rats. Groups of 12 freely Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 85 moving animals were exposed in their home cages to 900 MHz GSM signals at average whole-body SARs of 0.08 W/kg (when young) to 0.038 W/kg (when old). Weight was monitored at regular intervals and an exte nsive post-mortem examination was carried out on most animals. No significant changes in weight gain or on the incidence of mammary or pituitary tumours were seen in two groups of 12 animals exposed for up to 24 months. No significant effects on weight gain were seen in two groups of 30 animals given exposure until death (at about 36 months of age), but their lifespan was significantly shortened. The incidence of mammary tumours was al so reduced, possibly due to a relative increase in pituitary tumour s in these animals. It was suggested that previous rodent studies had not used a sufficiently long exposure period to enable the effects of the RF field to be seen. Signific ant differences in survival were also noted between groups (including the sham-expos ed animals) that were attributed to differences in the time of year the animals were born: those animals born in the spring had a significantly longer survival compared with those born in the autumn. Jin et al. (2011) exposed young rats to combined 849 MHz CDMA and 1950 MHz WCDMA signals at a combined SAR of 4 W/kg, for 45 min/day, 5 day/week for a year. Animals were exposed alternately in the morning or afternoon. No significant effects on weight or on spontaneous tumour rates were found, an d post-mortem analysis did not show any significant pathological differences that co uld be related to expo sure. In addition, analysis of blood and urine di d not reveal any significant fi eld-related effects except a significant increase in mean corpuscular haemoglobin level, and alkaline phosphatase in males; and a significant decrease in total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase in females. Lee et al. (2011) exposed young AKJ/R mice (which spontaneously develop lymphoma) to combined CDMA and WCDMA signals for 45 min/day, 5 day/week for 42 weeks using a reverberation chamber; the SAR at each frequency was calculated to be 2 W/kg. Compared to sham-exposed controls, exposu re had no significant effect on weight, survival time or incidence of lymphoma. The latter was assessed by histopathological analysis of the thymus. Blood counts remain ed unaffected by exposure and there were no consistent effects on metastatic infiltration in the spleen or other organs (changes in infiltration were seen in the brain but th ese was attributed to factors other than exposure). Some studies have investigated the effects of long-term exposure to RF fields on the promotion of CNS tumours in rats initiated by prenatal (maternal) administration of n- ethylnitrosourea (ENU) and have generally found negative results (SCENHIHR, 2007). However, Tillmann et al. (2010) found that life-time exposu re to 1.966 GHz UMTS signals (for 20 h/day, beginning on gestational day 6 and continuing for up to 24 months) increased incidence and multiplicity of lung carcinomas in female mice compared with animals treated with ENU alone. Peak SARs were calculated to be 5 W/kg and a pre- study showed that this exposure did no t induce measurable increases in body temperature. Significant effects were also seen on liver tumours, but these were discounted due to possible confounding caused by bacterial infection. UMTS exposure on its own had no tumourigenic effect. Due to limitations in the design of the study, the authors considered this a pilot, so more extensive studies using this model would be informative. Finally, the results of a National Toxicology Program (NTP) project entitled \"Studies to Evaluate the Toxic and Carcinogenic Potential of Cell Phone Radio Frequency Radiation in Laboratory Animals\" are expected to be pub lished in late 2014 (http: //ntp.niehs.nih.gov). This large and important pro ject was initiated in 2003 at the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute. It uses well-characterised reverberation chambers to expose animals to intermittent fields (10 mi n-on, 10 min-off) for 18 .50 hours per day, 5 days per week, without the need for restraint. Following studies exploring thermal effects, and a pre-chronic st udy investigating effects on in utero and post-weaning exposures, a chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study will be undertaken. It is planned to expose rats and mice for two years to GS M or CDMA signals at 900 and 1900 MHz at three SARs, the highest of which is expected to induce an increase in body temperature Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 86 of 1oC. Long-term absorption of RF energy at that level will have a considerable impact on thermoregulation, and induce compensatory changes in metabolism, as well as reducing food consumption and spontaneous activity. Nevertheless, the results of the project are eagerly awaited and will info rm future research in this area. Repacholi et al. (2012) conducted a systematic review of animal labo ratory studies that investigated the risks of exposure to RF fiel ds associated with mobile phones on brain cancers or other tumours of the head. Twelve animal studies were identified that have been published since 2000. No statistically significant relationsh ip was found between exposure to RF fields and geno toxic damage to the brain or the incidence of brain cancers or other neoplasms of the head. However, a significant increase in spontaneous pituitary tumours was found in female rats and mice at SARs below 2 W/kg (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2- 2.2). This excess was not found in male rats and mice exposed below 2 W/kg, and exposure at higher SARs did not result in a si gnificant change from unity in either males or females. The authors attributed the exce ss to under-representation of tumours in the sham-exposed groups in two out of the three studies considered, resulting in a spurious increase in overall tumour incidence. Discussion on in vivo studies Consistent with many earlier studies, rece nt animal studies have not produced any compelling evidence that RF fi elds are carcinogenic or have other adverse effects. The recent data are not completely negative, ho wever: one study found that long-term low level exposure of rats to GSM signals may shorten their life-span; and a pilot study using UMTS signals indicated an increased risk of lung tumours in female mice treated with a chemical carcinogen during gestation and after weaning. Neither study is definitive and the results require independent confirmation. The results of a large NTP study are expected in the next year or so, which should help to clarify the remaining uncertainties. Based upon an analysis of animal studies published since the early 1980s, IARC (2013) considered that the evidence in experimental animals for carc inogenicity of RF fields was limited (for making a definitive evaluation): although some positive studies were noted, there were unresolved questions regarding the adequacy of the design, conduct or interpretation of these studies. Conclusions on in vivo studies Overall, because a considerable number of well-performed studies using a wide variety of animal models have been mostly negative in outcome, the animal studies are considered to provide strong evidence fo r the absence of an effect. 3.6.1.3. In vitro studies What was already known? In the previous Opinion several in vitro studies were reviewed. Due to the inconsistent findings and a lack of a dose-response relati onship, it was concluded that there was no evidence to explain carcin ogenesis of RF fields. What has been achieved since then? A large number of studies have been carried ou t on different cell ty pes. They deal with genotoxic as well as non-genotoxic cancer -relevant endpoints, as reported Genotoxic effects The induction of genotoxicity after RF exposu re has been evaluated by applying several cytogenetic tests that measure chromoso mal damage (chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei), spindle damage or changes in DNA conformation and DNA repair (comet assay, formation of foci). The result s obtained are summarized in table 5. Concerning the induction of chromosomal dama ge, several authors failed to find effects in a frequency range from 900 MHz to 18 GHz. No significant incr ease in chromosome aberrations was detected by Hansteen an d co-workers in human peripheral blood Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 87 lymphocytes exposed for 53 h to 2.3 GHz, continuous wave (CW) or pulsed waves (PW, 200 Hz pulse frequency, 50% duty cycle), 10 W/m2 power density (no SAR value is given), respect to unexposed controls, althou gh a slight increase was detected in PW respect to CW exposed samples (Hansteen et al., 2009a). The authors also confirmed their results at higher fr equencies (18 GHz CW, 1 W/m2 and 16.5 GHz PW, 10 W/m2) (Hansteen et al., 2009b). Similar findings were also reported for shorter exposure duration (24 h) at lower freq uency (1950 MHz) at SAR values of 0.5 and 2 W/kg (Manti et al., 2008). In another investigation, abse nce of chromosomal rearrangements, either numerical or structural, was found after 24 h exposure of human amniotic cells to 900 MHz, GSM (0.25 W/kg SAR), evaluated soon af ter and 24 h after RF exposure, by using complete R-banded karyotyping (Bourtho umieu et al., 2010). These results were confirmed by further investigations where the authors found no significant changes in the rate of aneuploidy of chromosome 11 an d 17 (Bourthoumieu et al., 2011) and in the expression and activation of the p53 protein at average SARs up to 4 W/kg (Bourthoumieu et al., 2013). Absence of chromosomal damage was also re ported by applying the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) assay under several experimental conditions. Vijayalaxmi and co- workers failed to detect chromosomal damage (MN formation) in PHA stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes from four donors after exposure for 2 h to 2450 MHz radiofrequency field, SAR of 10.9 W/kg, at bo th CW and wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) modulated field. Melatonin treatment did not change the MN frequency in RF-exposed/sham-exposed cells (Vijayalax mi et al., 2013). Absence of effects was also confirmed by Waldmann and co-workers. Pe ripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 20 healthy donors were intermittently (5 mi n on/10 min off cycles) exposed for 28 h at the frequency of 1800 MHz, GSM modulation , at SAR values of 0.2, 2 and 10 W/kg. Neither primary DNA damage (comet assay), nor chromosomal damage (MN, CA and SCE) was detected in exposed samples comp ared to sham exposed ones when slides were analysed in blind mode in three independent labora tories (Waldmann et al., 2013). No increase in MN frequency was detected in human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to 900 MHz, GSM (1.25 W/kg mean SAR) given for 20 h in several stages of the cell cycle (Sannino et al ., 2009a; 2011). Similar results were obtained by the same research group when 20 h exposures were carri ed out in the S phase of the cell cycle at 1950 MHz (UMTS) and SAR values of 0.15, 0. 3, 0.6 and 1.25 W/kg (Zeni et al., 2012). Moreover, they also reposted absence of effects on DNA integrity (MN assay) and DNA migration (alkaline comet assay) in human fibroblasts from healthy and Turner's syndrome donors after 24 h exposure to 900 MHz, GSM, 1 W/kg SAR (Sannino et al., 2009b). Liu and co-workers failed to detect DN A strand breakage by alkaline comet assay in mouse spermatocyte-derived GC-2 cells exposed to 1800 MHz (GSM-talk mode) for 24 h (5 min on/10 min off cycles) at SAR values of 1, 2 and 4 W/kg. Interestingly, when the FPG modified comet assay was applied, an in crease in the extent of DNA migration was found at 4 W/kg SAR, indicating oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species at the level of DNA molecule. Oxidative damage was also confirmed by an increase of DNA adducts at 4 W/kg SAR and of ROS production at 2 and 4 W/kg SAR (Liu et al., 2013). In four investigations, the effect of RF expo sure was evaluated in te rms of mitotic spindle disturbances. Shrader and co-workers found a statistically si gnificant increase in the number of mitotic figures with spindle alteration s in Human-Hamster hybrid cell s (FC2 cells) exposed from 0.5 to 2 h to 835 MHz (calculated SAR of 0. 6 W/kg) with a field strength of 90 V/m (Shrader et al., 2008). In a further study they confirmed this result by exposing FC-2 cells to 900 MHz for 30 min (c alculated SARs of 0.01 and 0.017 W/kg) and found that the E-field component of the transversal electromag netic field (E-field strengths of 45 and 90 V/m), but not the magnetic comp onent, is responsible for th e observed effect (Schrader et al., 2011). Defects of spindle assembly were detected in Chinese Hamster V79 fibroblasts exposed for 15 min to 2.45 GHz, CW, at power densities of 50 and 100 W/m2 (Ballardin et al., Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 88 2011). Moreover, the authors also observed an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. However, they stated that, since most of the literature reports a lack of RF-induced genotoxicity, it is reasonable to speculate that the observed spindle alterations belong to a non-permanent effect. Zimmerman et al. (2012) show ed that very low levels of 27.12 MHz (0.05-1 W/kg) RF given for 21 h (3 h/day for a week) inhibit cancer cell proliferation at specific modulation frequencies by destroying the mi totic spindle. Moreover, alteration of gene expression was also detected. Since the e ffect was observed in hepatocarcinoma and breast cancer cells, but not in cells from healthy tissues, the authors conc luded that their results may have broad implications fo r the treatment of cancer. A large number of experiments have been ca rried out by employing the comet assay to assess the effect of RF on DNA migration. Ku mar et al. (2011) exposed rat long bones to 900 MHz, CW, at 2 W/kg SAR for 30 min. Af ter exposure, the bone marrow cells were extracted and analysed. No differences in DN A migration pattern were detected between RF- and sham-exposed cells. Moreover, no differences were found in terms of proliferation and erythrocyte maturation. Zhijian and co-workers evaluated the effect of intermittent (5 min on/10 min off) RF exposure at 1800 MHz, GSM (2 W/kg), on human white blood cells and human lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (24 h and 2h expo sure duration, respecti vely). In both cases DNA migration was unaffected (Zhijian et al., 2009; 2010). DNA integrity also resulted unaffected in hum an neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y) after 1 and 3 h exposure to 872 MHz, CW and GS M, 5 W/kg, compared to their respective sham-exposed controls (Luu kkonen et al., 2009; 2010). A transient increase in DNA migration was measured in the human trophoblast HTR-8/SV neo cell line exposed to 1800 MHz at 2 W/kg fo r 16 or 24 h (5 min on /10 min off cycles). The effect was detected either in GSM basic and GSM talk si gnal modulation, but it was recovered after 2 h. No effect was found for shorter exposure duration (4 h) and when the field was applied with out modulation (CW) (Fra nzellitti et al., 2010). Other authors reported an increase in DN A migration induced by RF exposure. Thus, Campisi et al. (2010) exposed primary rat astr ocytes for 5, 10 or 20 min to 900 MHz, CW or amplitude modulated at 50 Hz at the same power density of 0.26 W/m2 (no SAR reported). A significant increase in DNA fragmentation, together with ROS formation, was found after modulated exposure for 20 min. No effects were detected when shorter exposure duration or CW were used (Cam pisi et al., 2010). Gajski and Garaj-Vrhovac (2009) also found induction of DNA damage, as assessed by the alkaline comet assay and the Fpg-modified comet assay, in rat blood lymphocytes exposed for 30 min to 915 MHz, GSM, at power density of 2.4 W/m2 (calculated SAR of 0.6 W/kg). An increased DNA fragmentation, together with increase d ROS formation and decreased viability and mobility was found in human spermatozoa exposed for 16 h to 1800 MHz at SAR ranging from 0 to 30 W/kg. The effect resulted depe nding on the SAR value (De Iuliis et al., 2009). In three investigations, detection of -H2AX phosphorylated hist one (foci formation) was employed as a measure of RF-induced DN A damage. This technique is capable of detecting DNA damage at levels 100-fold below the detection limit of the alkaline comet assay and foci formation is an early marker of DNA damage. Xu and co-workers exposed si x different cell types to 1800 MHz, GSM (3 W/kg SAR), for 1 or 24 h (5 min on/10 min off cycles). No chan ges in the average number of foci per cell was detected after 1 h exposure in each of the six cell types examined, while 24 h exposure resulted in a signific ant increase of foci formation in two cell types. However, the elevated number of foci was not associat ed with DNA fragmentation (comet assay), cell cycle arrest, cell prolif eration or viability changes, although a slight but not statistically significant increase in ROS fo rmation was detected. The authors concluded that RF is able to induce foci formation in a cell-type dependent manner, but the induced Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 89 DNA damage may be reversible or compensa ted by DNA repair pathways (Xu et al., 2013). Two more studies, carried out by the rese arch group of Dr. Belyaev, evaluated the inhibition of endogenous foci formation by RF exposure. In a first investigation it was demonstrated that 1 h exposure to 915 MHz, GSM SAR) of human peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal and hypersensitive donors resulted in a significant inhibition of 53BP1/ -H2AX DNA-repair foci formation, while no consistent response wa s observed at 905 MHz (Belyaev et al., 2009). In a further study the author s extended the results obtain ed on human lymphocytes to human primary fibroblasts and mesenchymal st em cells. Since steam cells exhibited the strongest effect, they suggest that the latte r are the most relevant cellular model for validating safe mobile communication signals (Markova et al., 2010). The effect of RF exposure on the DNA molecule was investigated in a study by Hekmat et al. (2013). They exposed DNA extracted from calf thymus to 940 MHz, 40 mW/kg SAR, for 45 min and different spectr oscopic measurements were ca rried out immediately after RF exposure and 2 h post exposure. The re sults indicated that RF exposure induced irreversible conformational changes in DNA structure, as assessed by UV-vis spectroscopy and circular dichroism analysis. A meta-analysis pooled 88 in vivo and in vitro studies published during 1990-2011 assessing genetic damage in human cells expo sed to RF. The authors concluded that the magnitude of difference between RF- exposed and sham-exposed controls was small with some exceptions. Of the six end-points ana lysed, no effect was found for micronuclei, sister chromatid exchange or SCE foci, while studies usin g COMET assay showed higher frequencies of changes overall in the expo sed than control group, but no exposure gradient in terms of SAR. Results concerning the induction of CA, MN and SCE indicated that, overall, the genotoxicity indices in RF-exposed samples were within the spontaneous values reported in a large databa se. For the result obtained with the comet assay, although the meta-ana lysis indicated significant in creases in several exposure conditions, the authors stated that some of the increases could be due to the modification of the comet analysis and inte rpretation of the results (Vijayalaxmi and Prihoda, 2012). Furthermore, the authors found strong evidence of publication bias in the studies. A skewed (asymmetric) distribution of results in a funnel plot, i.e. substantially larger effect size in small than large studies, suggests th at small studies have also been conducted with small or no effect, but th ey were not published. Small studies with positive results are more likely to be published than those with null or negative results. As reported in the previous Opinion, Schwarz et al. (2008) found that 24 h exposure of human fibroblasts, but not of lymphocytes, to 1950 MHz, UMTS, at SAR values of 0.05 and 0.1 W/kg, induced a statistically significant increase in DNA damage both in terms of MN frequency and DNA migration (Comet assa y). There are several areas of concern about the reported results, including non-credible low standard deviation of reported data, suspiciously low inter-individual differences, indications of data fabrication, inappropriate statistical analysis, and un dermined blinding (L erchl 2009, 2010) This makes the study by Schwarz et al inappropriate for risk assessment. Moreover, in 2013 Speit and co-workers attempted to replic ate the induction of micronuclei and DNA migration (alkaline comet assay) in HL-60 ce lls exposed for 24 h (5 min on/10 min off cycles) to 1800 MHz, CW, at a SAR of 1.3 W/ kg. By using the same exposure system and the same experimental protocol s as the authors of the original study, they failed to confirm the results. They did not find any ex planation for these conf licting results (Speit et al, 2013). Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 90 Table 5.

In several studies the induction of apoptosis has been investigated after exposure to RF ranging from 900 to 2450 MHz, as reported in Table 6. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 92 Exposures to 900 MHz, GSM, 1 W/kg SAR for 24 to 144 h did not induce apoptosis in rat primary cortical neurons as well as in muri ne SN56 cholinergic neurons. The exposure also failed to induce effects on viability and proliferation (Del Vecchio et al., 2009a). Similar results were found in human sperma tozoa exposed for 1 h to 900 MHz, GSM, at SAR of 2 and 5.7 W/kg. At various times afte r exposure no differences with respect to un-exposed controls were detected in terms of caspase-3 activity, externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA strand breaks and generation of ROS (F alzone et al., 2010). One hour exposure of human lymphoblasto ma (Jurkat) cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes, either proliferat ing or quiescent, to 900 MHz, GSM, at a mean SAR of 1.35 W/kg also provided no evidence for induct ion of apoptosis, al though a slight but statistically significant increase in caspase 3 activity was detected in proliferating but not in quiescent cells. Since several studies de tected an involvement of caspases in processes other than apoptosi s, the authors also evaluate d viability and cell cycle in proliferating lymphocytes exposed to RF. Howeve r, no effects were detected in cell cycle kinetics at 6, 24 and 48 h after 1 h exposure (Palumbo et al., 2008). Moquet et al. (2008) confirmed the lack of apoptosis in prolifer ating as well as in differentiated murine neuroblastoma N2a cell line exposed for 24 h to 935 MHz at 2 W/kg SAR. These findings were obtained by test ing three signal types (CW, GSM basic and GSM talk) and by employing severa l tests to measure apoptosis. Simon et al. (2013), exposed re construct epidermis from human skin biopsy to 900 MHz, GSM basic for 6 h at an SAR level of 2 W /kg. After RF exposure, growth medium was replaced with fresh medium, and reconstruc ted epidermis was incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2, 6, 18 or 24 h. Results indi cated no significant variation of p53 and caspase 3 in exposed samples compared to sham exposed ones. In this study global protein oxidation, proliferation and differentiation were also evaluated in the same experimental conditions. No effects were de tected, except for a slight alteration of differentiation markers level. In contrast, Joubert and co-workers, usin g a 900 MHz CW signal exposed rat primary cortical neurons for 24 h with an SAR of 2 W/kg and detected a signi cant difference in the apoptosis frequency with respect to sh am-exposed cells, as assessed by DAPI staining and TUNEL. During these RF exposu res, a temperature rise of 2\u00b0C was noted and therefore control experiments with cells exposed to 37 and 39\u00b0C were also performed. Overall, the result s suggested that the induction of apoptosis is independent of changes in temperature. As the apoptosi s rate in the RF-exposed cells was signi cantly different from these controls, they concluded that they may have seen an effect of RF elds (Joubert et al., 2008). In a further st udy, the same research group exposed rat cerebral cortical cells for 24 h to 900 MHz, GSM, but to a lower SAR (0.25 W/kg). No induction of apoptosis was dete cted, but an increase in HSC70 and a decrease in HSP90 expression was observed. Since comparable effects were also observed in cells incubated at 37.5\u00b0C, the authors concluded that the induced changes are most likely linked to temperature increase (Terro et al., 2012). Ballardin et al. (2011) detected an increase in apoptosis when V79 cells were exposed for 15 min to 2450 MHz, CW, at power density of 50 and 100 W/m 2. The frequency of apoptotic cells increased with the increase of the applied power density of the incident field. The authors excluded thermal effects since treatmen ts with thermostatic baths induced apoptosis only when the temperature exceeded 40\u00b0C. Kahya et al. (2014) exposed a breast cancer ce ll line derived from metastatic site (MDA- MB-231) to 900 MHz modulated at 217 Hz for 1 h at an average calculated SAR of 0.36\u00b10.02 W/kg. They found induction of apop tosis, including incr caspases 3 and 9 activities, and increased mitochondrial membra ne depolarization in compared to control cells. Moreover, oxidative stress was also induced (increased ROS formation). These levels decreased towards controls when treatm ent of 1h with sodium selenite (200 nM), a well-known antioxidant agent, was carried out be fore RF exposure. In this study no sham Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 93 exposures were carried out and the results ob tained in exposed samples were compared to their respective controls. In another study the ability of RF to induce apoptosis and to act as a tumour-promoting agent in rat astrocytes and C6 glioma cell s was investigated. For this purpose, cell cultures were exposed for 12, 24 or 48 h to 1950 MHz at 5.36 W/kg by employing the Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA), a 3-G standard currently employed in UMTS mobile telecommunication networks in China. A significant increase in apoptotic cells (annexin-V assay and caspase 3 activation), and up-regulation of bax mRNA levels and inhibition of cell growth was detected after 48 h exposure of as trocytes. No effects were found for shorter exposure times. C6 glioma cells resulted unaffected for all the experimental conditions tested. Moreover, when expose d cells were injected into mi ce no tumour induction was produced (Liu et al., 2012). Table 6.

Most of the studies devoted to assess the ca pability of RF exposure to modify the oxidation state of the cells have been carried out by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, although in some cases ot her targets related to oxidative stress have Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 94 been evaluated, such as antioxidant enzy me activity, glutathione (GSH) depletion, mitochondrial RNA. The details of the review ed studies are presented in table 7. Luukkonen et al. investigated ROS format ion in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells exposed for 1 h to 872 MHz, CW and GSM si gnal, 5 W/kg SAR. The results did not show evidence of differences when comparing RF and sham-exposed cultures (Luukkonen et al., 2009). Under similar exposure conditio ns (900 MHz, GSM, 2 or 5.7 W/kg SAR) Falzone and co-workers confirmed that 1 h RF exposure was not able to induce ROS formation in human spermatozoa, a cell model particularly susceptible to oxidative stress (Falzone et al., 2010). 2 h exposure of human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) to 837 MHz (CDMA) or to 1950 MHz (WCDMA) at SAR of 4 W/kg also did not induce oxidative stress in terms of ROS formation, GSH de pletion and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity (Hong et al., 2012). In another study Brescia et al. al so provided no evidence for ROS increase in human lymphoblastoid T ce lls (Jurkat) exposed to 1950 MHz, UMTS, at SAR of 0.5 and 2 W/kg for short (5-60 min) or long (24 h) exposure duration (Brescia et al., 2009). Similar results were obtained by Poulletier de Gannes et al. (2011), who investigated the effect of the Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE) signal on three brain human cell lines (SH-SY5Y, U87 and CHME5) and primary cortical neuron cultures. Exposures to 1800 MHz were carried ou t and four conditions were tested: 2 and 10 W/kg for 1 and 24 h. For all the experimental conditions tested, RF exposure was not able to increase ROS production. In several investigations an increase in ROS formation was reported under different exposure conditions. Liu et al. (2013) exposed mouse spermatocy te-derived GC-2 cells exposed to 1800 MHz (GSM-talk mode) for 24 h (5 min on/10 min off cycles) at SAR values of 2 and 4 W/kg and measured ROS levels and oxidative DNA ba se damage by measuring the levels of 8- oxoG. RF exposure increased the generation of ROS in a SAR-dependent manner, and 4 W/kg exposure also increased the levels of the DNA base damage. Pre-treatments with the antioxidant tocopherol blocked RF expo sure-increased ROS production and 8-oxoG levels at a SAR value of 4 W/kg. Another research group (Liu et al., 2014) by employing the same cell model and the same experimental conditions demonstrated a dose dependent increase in ROS levels at 2 and 4 W/kg SAR and an increased autophagy. Sefidbakht et al. (2014) exposed human embr yonic kidney cells (HEK293T) for 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min to 940 MHz RF field at an average SAR of 0.09 W/kg. They detected an increase in ROS formation after 30 min expo sure, followed by a sharp rise in catalase and superoxide dismutase activi ties and elevation of glutathione content during the 45 min exposure with a concomitant decrease in lipid peroxidation. The authors concluded that RF exposure is capable of activate the stress response by an immediate increase in ROS levels. Ni et al. (2013) investigated the induction of oxid ative stress in human lens epithelial B3 (HLE-B3) cells intermittently exposed (5 min on/10 min off cycles) to a 1800 MHz RF EMF, GSM signal (average SAR=2, 3 and 4 W/Kg). The ROS levels were measured (DCFH-DA assay) in cells exposed for 0.5, 1, and 1.5 h. Lipid peroxi dation was detected by a Malondialdehyde test (MDA, a member of a family of final products of lipid peroxidation) in cells exposed for 6, 12, an d 24 h. The mRNA expression of SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and GPx1genes and the expression of SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and GPx1 proteins were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays in the cells exposed for 1 h. For all the experimental conditions tested, in the RF exposed cultures ROS and MDA levels significantly increased and mRNA and protei n expression significantly decreased in comparison to sham-exposed ones; cell viability also decreased (three independent experiments for each exposure condition/endpoint examined). X u e t a l . r e p o r t e d t h a t i n t e r m i t t e n t e x p o s u r e s ( 5 m i n o n / 1 0 m i n o f f ) o f r a t p r i m a r y neurons for 24 h at 1800 MHz, GSM, 2 W/kg SAR, induced an increase in ROS production and in the levels of 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHdG), a common biomarker of DNA oxidative Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 95 damage in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and a concomitant reduction in the copy number of mtDNA and the levels of mtRNA transcripts . However, such effects were demonstrated to reverse by pre-treatment with melatonin, an efficient antioxidant in the brain (Xu et al., 2010). In a more recent investigation, the same research group evaluated ROS formation on six different cell types after 1 and 24 h intermittent exposure (5 min on/10 min off) at 1800 MHz, GSM, 3 W/kg SAR. No di fferences were detected when comparing exposed and sham-exposed cultur es. The study also provided no indication of alteration in cell proliferation and cell cycl e progression (Xu et al., 2013). An increase in ROS formation, together with enhanced DNA fragmentation, was reported by Campisi et al. on primary rat astrocyt es exposed for 20 min to 900 MHz amplitude modulated at 50 Hz, 0.26 W/m2 power density (no SAR value is given). No effects were detected when shorter exposure duration (5 or 10 min) or CW exposures were performed (Campisi et al., 2010). In this study the abse nce of dosimetric details makes the results difficult to comment. De Iuliis et al., after 16 h exposure at 1800 MHz, SAR from 0.4 up to 27.5 W/kg also found an increase in ROS generation by the whole cell and mitochondria in a SAR-dependent manner, together with oxid ative DNA damage (8-OHdG) and DNA fragmentation. Such effects translated to re duction in sperms motility and vitality. The authors claimed that their re sults clearly demonstrated th at RF exposure can damage sperm function via mechanisms involving the leakage of electrons from the mitochondria and the induction of oxidative stress, but the employed SAR values are very high and not relevant to cell phone users.

They are summarized in table 8. No effects on cell cycle progression were detected in several cell types exposed intermittently (5 min of/ 10 mi n off) to 1800 MHz, GSM, 3 W/kg SAR for 1 or 24 h (Xu et al., 2013). Similar results were obtained by Lee et al. on human breast MCF7 cancer cells exposed for 1 h to 837 MHz (CDMA, 4 W/kg SAR). The authors found no effects on cell cycle distribution and on ce ll cycle regulatory protein ex pression (Lee et al., 2011a). Beneduci and co-workers also reported no e ffects on cell prolifer ation and cell cycle kinetics after 1 h or 4 days exposure of human skin melanoma cells at 42.2 and 53.57 GHz, CW (1.4 and 3.7 W/m2, respectively) (Beneduci et al., 2009). In a study carried out to inve stigate the response of two human cancer cell lines to a 24 h exposure to 2200 MHz pulse-modulated (5 \u00b5s pulse duration, 100 Hz repetition rate) at an average SAR of 0.023 W/kg, a consistent reduction in cell numbe r together with an increased proportion of cells in G0/G1 an d G2/M phase was found. The effect was detected in neuroblastoma but not in hepato carcinoma cells. The authors stated that the cytostatic response observed is ce ll-type specific (Trillo et al., 2011). Different results on the basis of the exposure conditions we re reported by Ozgur and co- workers who employed human hepatocellular ca rcinoma cells to eval uate the effects of GSM EDGE signals at 900 and 1800 MHz. Exposu res were carried out for 1, 2, 3 and 4 h in intermittent mode (15 min on/15 min of f) at an average SAR of 2 W/kg. When compared with their respective sham exposed cells, an increa se in cell proliferation was observed after 1h exposure to 1800 MHz while a significant decrease was observed in both the 900 and 1800 MHz exposed cells afte r 4 h exposure. No effects in the other conditions were detected. Moreover, significant increase in LDH and glucose levels released into the medium were observed af ter 4 h exposure to either the 900 and 1800 MHz RFR, associated with the presence of morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (Ozgur et al., 2014). The enzyme Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) acts in cell cycle regulation and its activity after RF exposure has been in vestigated in the past by se veral research groups with conflicting results. Two investigations conducted by Billaudel and co-workers reported negative effects of RF expo sure on different cell types and under different exposure conditions. In particular, ODC activity resulted unaffected in L929 cells exposed to a) 825 MHz and 872 MHz, Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (DAMPS) standard for 8 h at 0.5-2.5 W/kg, b) 900 MHz, GSM, for 2 h at 0. 5-2.5 W/kg and c) 1800 MHz, GSM for 2 or 24 h at 2.5 W/kg (Billaudel et al., 2009a ). The results were confirmed on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed for 8 or 24 h to 835 MHz (DAMPS) or 1800 MHz (GSM) at 1 or 2.5 W/kg SAR (Billaudel et al., 2009b). In two papers the capability of RF exposure to induce cellular neop lastic transformation was investigated. Yang et al. exposed NIH 3T3 cells to 916 MHz, CW, at 10, 50 or 90 W/m 2 power density for 2 h/day up to 8 weeks (no SAR value given). They detected a changed morphology of exposed cells. Moreover , when exposed cells we re inoculated into mice, the development of lumps was induced. The authors concluded that RF exposure can promote neoplastic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (Yang et al., 2012). The results reported are very interesting, but the study lacks rigorous dosimetry. Diffe rent results were reported by Hirose et al. They expo sed embryonic mouse fibroblasts to 2142 MHz, W-CDMA, at SAR of 0.08 or 0.8 W/kg for 6 weeks. The number of transformed foci resulted in similar exposed an d sham-exposed cultures, suggesting that RF is not capable of inducing cell transformation (Hirose et al., 2008). In a fu rther study the same research group also reported lack of activation of rat microglial cells after 2 h exposure at 1950 MHz (IMT-2000), W-CDMA, 0.2, 0.8 or 2 W/kg SAR. Furthermore, no differences in the production of tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 between exposed and sham-exposed cultures was detected (Hirose et al., 2010). Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 98 Rao et al. evaluated the effect of RF expo sure on cell differentiation. Mouse embryonic carcinoma cells were exposed for 1 h at a frequency ranging from 700 to 1100 MHz. Intracellular Ca++ spikes , which trigger proliferation and differentiation, resulted increased in retinoic-acid diffe rentiated cells as a function of frequency (at 0.05 W/kg) and SAR (at 800 MHz) (Rao et al., 2008). Del Vecchio et al. showed th at long duration exposure to 900 MHz, GSM, at 1 W/kg decreased neurite number gene expre ssion in rat primary cortical neurons (5 days exposure) and in murine SN56 cholinergic neurons (3 days exposure). However, both cell types recovere d after 6 days (Del Vecchio et al., 2009a).

Recovery after 6 days DAMPS: Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System; IL-1 Multiple Access. A large number of studies have been carried ou t to evaluate the effect of RF on gene and protein expression. They ar e reported in table 9. In six investigations the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been evaluated, since they are regarded as cellular stress mark ers and have been repo rted to be affected by several environmental stressors, including RF. Exposure of human endothelial cells (EA.hy926) for 1 h to 1800 MHz, GSM, 2W/kg SAR provided no evidence for increase of HSP27 expression (Nylund et al., 2009). In a further study the auth ors confirmed their results on human umbilical vein (HUVEC) and brain endothelial (HBMRC) cells exposed in the same experimental conditions (Nylund et al., 2010). In both investigations the authors found altered expression of several not identified proteins but these findings were not confirmed by western blo tting or resulted as artifacts. By applying intermittent exposures (5 min on /10 min off cycles) Fran zellitti et al. also reported lack of effects on HSP expression in human trophoblast cells exposed for 4, 16 or 24 h to 1800 MHz, GSM, 2 W/kg SAR, alth ough changes in on e (HSP70C) over 4 transcript isoforms was detect ed (Franzellitti et al., 2008). Lack of effects on HSP expression and phosph orylation was also reported by Kim et al. (2012) on human breast epithelial (MCF10A ) cells exposed to 837 MHz, CDMA, 4W/kg SAR, for 4h or 2h on three consecutive days. On the contrary, an in creased expression of HSP70 and a decreased expression of HSP90 was found in rat cere bral cortical cells exposed 24h to 900 MHz, GSM, 0.25 W/kg SAR (Terro et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it must be noted that the authors reported a 0.5\u00b0C difference be tween sham and RF exposed samples, which could be resp onsible for the observed differences. Gerner et al. intermittently exposed (5 min on/10 min off) Jurkat cells, human fibroblasts and mononuclear cells to 1800 MHz, 2 W/kg SAR , for 8 h. They detected no effects on protein expression, bu t a higher level of 35-S incorporated proteins, including HSPs (Gerner et al., 2010). In one study the effect of millimetre wave s was assessed on human astrocytoma-derived cells (U-251) exposed to 59-61 GHz (2.64-3.30 W/kg). After 24 h exposure no variation in the expression of HSP70 and on endoplasmic reticulum stress-responsive chaperon proteins was measured (Nicolaz et al., 2009). Sun et al. (2012) reported an increased epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor clustering and phosphorylation in human am niotic cells exposed to 1800 MHz, GSM, from 0.5 to 4 W/kg for 15 minutes. In another paper an increased transcript expr ession of IGF-1, incr eased phosphorylation on of BCL-2 and cyclin D1, together with a decreased expression of BX was detected by Yoon et al. (2011) in human derm al cells exposed to 1763 MHz, CDMA, at 2 or 10 W/kg SAR for 3 h. Cervellati and co-workers also reported an increased expression of genes for connexions, together with changes in cell ular localization when human trophoblasts were exposed for 1 h to 1817 MHz, GSM (2 W/kg SAR). However, no variation in terms of expression of these membrane proteins was de tected (Cervellati et al., 2009). Genomic and proteomic techniqu es have been applied by so me researchers to evaluate the effects of RF exposure. None of th ese studies have reported any significant difference between exposed and unexposed samples. Roux et al. failed to find differences in ge ne expression of normal human keratinocytes exposed to 900 MHz, CW, for 10 min (2.6 W /kg) or 30 min (0.73 W/kg) compared to Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 100 sham-exposed cultures. As a matter of fact, some genes had a diffe rent expression but this result was not confirmed by RT-PCR (Roux et al., 2010). Sakurai et al.

(2010) exposed three different cell lines (Human glioblastoma A172, neuroglioma H4 and or W-CDMA, 0.08-0.8 W/kg SAR, for up to 96 h. Differential expression in a small number of genes was observed in each cell line. Howe ver, the results again were not validated by RT-PCR. Le Quement et al. (2012) also reported no effects of 60. 4 GHz millimetre waves (42.4 W/kg average SAR) given for 1, 6 or 24 h to primary human keratinocytes. Only few transcripts resulted to be affected by RF af ter PCR validation and th e effect was transient (disappeared after 6 h). In one investigation, the effe ct of RF exposure on protei n expression of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was evaluated after RF exposure given 1h/day for 3 days at 849 MHz, at 837 MHz, CDMA, 2 or 10 W/kg SAR. No significant differences were recorded in exposed vs. sham exposed samples (Kim et al., 2010). Table 9.

Conclusions on in vitro studies DNA damage has not been detected in a large number of in vitro studies, although DNA integrity was affected in some investigations. In some of these cases, the effect seemed to be dependent on the cell type investigat ed and by the electromagnetic parameters applied (frequency, modu lation). Most of the studies repo rting a lack of effects refer to chromosome aberration and micronuclei, whic h are indicators of fixed DNA damage, i.e., unrepairable damage, while most of the investigations reporting effects refer to DNA migration, spindle disturbances and foci form ation, which are indicators of non-fixed DNA damage, i.e., transient and repairable da mage. Concerning the other endpoints not related to genotoxicity, most of the studie s did not find any ef fects. A few studies reported positive findings, whic h sometimes were reversible. 3.6.1.4. Conclusions on neoplastic diseases from RF exposure Overall, the epidemiological studies on RF EMF exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumours. Furthermore, they do not indi cate an increased risk for other cancers of the head and neck region. Some studies raised questions regarding an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma in heavy users of mobile phones. The results of cohort and incidence time trend studies do not support an increased risk for glioma while the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open. Epidemiological studies do not indicate increased risk for other malig nant diseases including childhood cancer. A considerable number of well-performed in vivo studies using a wide variety of animal models have been mostly negative in outcom e. These studies are considered to provide strong evidence for the absence of an effect. A large number of in vitro studies pertaining to genotoxic as well as non-genotoxic end- points have been published since the last Opin ion. In most of the studies, no effects of exposure at permissible levels were recorded, although in some cases DNA strand breaks and spindle disturbances were observed. 3.6.2. Nervous system effects and neurobehavioural disorders 3.6.2.1. Epidemiological studies What was already known on this subject? The previous SCENIHR report concluded that there was no evidence that acute exposures to RF fields at the levels relevant for mobile telephony had effects on hearing or vision. Furthermore, there was is no evidence th at this kind of exposure had direct Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 102 neurotoxicological effects. Most studies show ed lack of effects on supporting structures like the blood-brain-barrier. Th e positive finding was lackin g dose-response relationships and needed independent replication in studies with improved methodology. What has been achieved since then? Neurodevelopment and behavioural outcomes To further elucidate earlier findings showing an association between mobile phone use and behavioural problems, an extension of the first analysis within the Danish Birth Cohort was conducted based on more than 28,000 children born in 1998-2002 (Divan 2012). Similar to the earlier report, a 25-item Strengths and Difficu lties Questionnaire was used to assess behavioural problems (disruptive behaviour including temper tantrums and disobedience, wi th attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as the most common diagnosis) at age 7 years. Mobile phone use of the moth er during pregnancy and child's own mobile phone use were assess ed by interview when the child was aged seven. The findings were largely consistent with the earlier report, with slightly but significantly elevated risk of behavioural problems associat ed with both maternal and own mobile phone use. The ad justed odds ratio for mother 's mobile phone use during pregnancy was 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4), for ch ild's own use 1.3 (1.1-1.5) and for both exposures combined 1.5 (1.3-1.7). Mobile phone exposure was associated with lower socioeconomic status, maternal smoking and mother's younger age as well as higher prenatal stress scores. Adjustment for th ese potential confounders weakened the association but did not remove it. The over all prevalence of behavioural problems was 3%, which is similar to reports from earlie r studies (and suggests that the assessment method gives credible results). The relation of maternal mobile phone use and child development was analysed in the Danish National Birt h Cohort, with 41,000 singletons born in 1996-2002 (Divan et al. 2011). Information on mothers' mobile ph one use during pregnancy was assessed retrospectively and child development was eval uated using telephone interviews at ages 6 and 18 months. No clear associations between mobile phon e use and cognitive development (language skills) or motor development were observed (odds ratios 0.8-1.1 for mothers with 4 or more relative to 0- 1 calls per day and mobile phone on all day versus not at all). The assessment of de velopment was based on maternal reports instead of direct observation. In addition, mobile phone use was asked retrospectively. A Dutch study on behavioural problems in re lation to mobile phone exposure found no increases related to maternal mobile phon e use during pregnancy (Guxens et al. 2013). The analysis was based on a birth coho rt study of 2618 children and behavioural problems assessed using the Strengths and Diffi culties Questionnaire at age 5 with both mothers and teachers as informants. The majo r weakness of the study was the fact that information on phone use during pregnanc y was obtained retrospectively when the children were aged 7 years. In a Spanish study of 530 children, neurodev elopment was assessed at age 14 months by psychologists using well-established instruments, and information on mothers' frequency of mobile phone use was collec ted with an interview during pregnancy (Vrijheid et al. 2010). No significant associ ation was found between the number of daily calls and mental or psychomotor scores, althou gh the average scores were slightly higher for mental and lower for psychomotor develo pment even after adjustment for mother's education, IQ and smoking. A strength was the careful assessment of outcome, weakness scanty informatio n on mobile phone use. Interview data collected from parents of 2422 schoolchildren (age dist ribution not given) in 2008 and 2010 were used to analyse the re lationship between mobile phone use, blood lead and ADHD (Byun et al., 2013). The data were analysed as two cross-sectional studies as well longitudinal analysis. Adjustment for age, gender, number of siblings, child's and parental psychiatric diagnoses and maternal smoking was used. ADHD was assessed using ADHD rating scale and prevalen ce of ADHD was 8-10%. Overall, children with mobile phones did not have increased prevalence of ADHD sy mptoms (OR 0.74-0.93 Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 103 in three analyses), age at start of mobile phone use or cumulative call-time were not associated with ADHD symptoms either. Only use of mobile phone for playing games >3 minutes per day was associated with ADHD symptoms, and internet browsing with mobile phone in 2008 data but not in th e other two analyses. Results for possible association between blood lead and ADHD sy mptoms were not given. Analyses of the interaction (joint effect) of blood lead level (dichotomized into below versus above 2.35 g/dl) and mobile phone usage were also presented. Of the eight exposure indices reported, only age at first obtaining an ow n mobile phone was associated with ADHD symptoms, though no systematic pattern by age was observed though highest prevalences were reported for older ages. The results show littl e evidence for an association between mobile phone use and AD HD symptoms. The behavioural patterns in ADHD may however affect also mobile phon e use and therefore in terpretation of a relationship would need to be cautious. In a cross-sectional survey conducted in Germany, a higher pr evalence of conduct problems was found among children and adole scents with the highest RF exposure from mobile phones (Thomas 2010). The study popula tion was recruited as a sample of the population aged 8-17 years in four Bavarian towns in 2006-2008, with 52% participation. Maschek exposimeter worn during one day (recording once per second, no measurements during night time) was used for exposure assessment. The exposure levels were low, with the highest measuremen ts <1% of the ICNIRP reference level. The 25-item Strengths and Weakne sses Questionnaire was used to evaluate behavioural problems. It was filled in by the subjects themselves, with exception for children aged 8- 12 where parents made the assessment. The prev alence of four catego ries of behavioural problems ranged from 3-7%. When the subjec ts were divided into deciles based on the electromagnetic field strength , those in the highest exposure category had a higher prevalence of conduct disord ers (OR=3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.4 for those teenagers and 2.9, 1.4-5.9 for those aged 8-12 years). The analys is used adjustment for age, sex, own or parental education, town. Neurological disease An analysis of the risk of multiple sclerosis in relation to mobile phone use was analysed in the Danish cohort study of 420,000 privat e mobile phone subscrib ers (Poulsen et al. 2012). The cohort was established from network operator records in 1982-1995 and followed up through 2004. During a 10-year fo llow-up, a total of 406 multiple sclerosis cases occurred among the subscribers with incidence comparable to the rest of the population (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.18). No clea r relation to duration of subscription was found, although the point estimate for 13 or more years was slightly above unity (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.65-2.43). Incidence of neurological disease has also been reported in the Danish cohort study (Sch\u00fcz et al. 2009). The cases we re defined as first hospital contacts (hospitalization or outpatient visit). The standardized hospitalisation rates (SHR) relative to the entire population were slightly increased for migrai ne and vertigo (SHR 1.1-1.2), but decreased for dementias and Parkinson's disease (SHR 0.7-0.8). Among men, lower rates of hospitalization were also seen for epilepsy. For migraine, vertigo and Parkinson's disease, no difference was observed any more after a llowing for a 10-year latency. No difference in hospitalisations was found in amyotrophi c lateral sclerosis or multiple sclerosis. Discussion and conclusion on epidemiological studies The large Danish National Birth Cohort study has reported results that suggest higher prevalence of some behavioura l and health disorders in child ren, but these have not been confirmed in other studies. The publishe d studies have methodological weaknesses including information on mobile phone use du ring pregnancy obtained only years after the birth of the child and concerns about re sidual confounding. A fundamental issue is whether the exposure indicators such as freq uency of mother's mobile phone use are at all relevant for foetal RF ex posure in utero. Attention de ficit disorders have a clear hereditary component and hence it is possible that the findin gs could be due to reverse Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 104 causality, i.e. mother's mobile phone use reflecting her hyperactive features rather than phone use causing child's behavioural problems. In conclusion, there is weak evidence for an association between beha vioural disorders and RF exposure of the foetus, because of conflicting results and me thodological limitations. Recent epidemiological studies have not show n increased risks of neurological disease related to RF exposure. 3.6.2.2. Neurophysiological studies What was already known on this subject? SCENIHR concluded in the previous Opinion that, with the exception of a few findings on otherwise negative studies, there is no eviden ce that acute or long-term RF exposure at SAR levels relevant for mobile telephony can influence cognitive functions in humans or animals. There is some evidence that RF exposure influences brain activity as seen by EEG studies in humans. Human st udies also indicate the possi bility of effects on sleep and sleep EEG parameters. However, cert ain findings are contradictory and are furthermore not substantiated by cellular st udies into mechanisms. There is a need for further studies into mechanisms that can explain possible effects on sleep and EEG. There is no evidence that ac ute exposures to RF-EMF fields at SAR levels relevant fo r mobile telephony have effects on hearing or vision. The positive fi nding is lacking dose- response relationships and needs independent replication in studies with improved methodology. The findings of activated glial cells at relatively high SAR-values could indicate gliosis and thus subsequent ne urodegeneration after exposure, although exposures at lower levels did no t reveal any such effects. What has been achieved since then? A number of studies on human volunteers as we ll as on various animal species (section 3.6.2.3) have been publishe d since the previous Opinion. The experimental human studies focus on the macrostructure (sleep variables derived from polysomnography) and microstructure (EEG power) of sleep, other electrophysiological measurements (resting- stake waking EEG and event related potentials ), brain activity as sessed by functional magnetic behaviour and cognition, sensory related functions, and other physiological outcomes, e.g. heart rate variability, skin conductance, blood flow and oxygenation parameters. Ex posures have mostly been to GSM-related signals and UMTS-signals, one study each cons idered LTE and TETRA exposure. Human studies - sleep: Studies on possible effects of electromagnetic fields on the central nervous system (CNS) can be distinguished into those which focus on a resting and thos e which focus on an active brain. In the former case a further distinction can be made between a state in which exogenous factors can largely be neglec ted (sleep) and one in which the brain is awake but relaxed (usually waking EEG with eyes closed). Studies investigating a possible impact on the active brain among ot hers comprise endpoints like event related potentials and cognitive performance. With re gard to sleep it has to be distinguished between studies, which assess sleep at a phys iological basis, i.e. based on sleep EEG, and those which rely on subjectively report ed sleep quality. The latter assessments can deviate substantially from EEG based indicato rs of sleep quality. Studies referring to subjectively assessed sleep quality are discu ssed separately in the section symptoms (see 3.6.3). Since the last Opinion eight studies coveri ng EEG-based macrostructure of sleep as primary or secondary endpoint (see Table 10) and six studies on EEG-power during sleep (see Table 11) have been published. In a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled cross-over study, Danker-Hopfe et al. ( 2011) whether a GSM (900 MHz, pulsed with 217 Hz) and/or a UMTS (1966 MHz) exposure applied by a specially developed antenna (Bahr et al. 2006, 2007) for 8h during time in bed has an effect on Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 105 the macrostructure of sleep. A cell-phone usage at maximum RF output power was simulated and the transmitted power was adju sted in order to approach, but not to exceed a SAR 10g of 2 W/kg. To avoid electromagneti c interference with the recording device additional filters and a shielding were applied. The sample comprised 30 healthy males (age range 18 - 30 years). In order no t to miss any possible effect 177 variables characterizing the initiation and maintenance of sleep we re investigated. In the GSM exposure condition six REM sleep related variables indicated significantly more REM sleep as compared to sham, while four NREM stag e 2 related variables showed a statistically significant decrease. The number of stage shifts from slow wa ve sleep to the light NREM stage 1 sleep was lower in the exposure co ndition and movement time was slightly higher. In the UMTS exposure condition only three sleep variables showed a statistically significant effect. The duration of the REM sleep period was longer while the one for NREM sleep was shorter. Furthermore, ther e was less NREM stage 2 sleep in the middle of sleep cycles. Although for GSM the number of statistically significant variables exceeds those expected by chance at the 5% significance level (9) the results do not indicate a negative impact of RF exposu re on sleep macrostructure. In a second study by this group, a possibl e effect of EMF exposure from mobile phone base stations on the sleep of residents (< 500 m distance from base station) was investigated in an experimental field stud y (Danker-Hopfe et al . 2010, see Table 10). Whole night exposure comparable to real-world scenarios for the general public living in areas with mobile phone service was realized by an experimental mobile phone base station, originally used for disaster re covery, containing GS M 900 MHz and GSM 1800 MHz base transceiver stations, a mast, cabl es, antennas and a power supply system. The sum signal simulated a base st ation transmitting near full capacity. For more than 90% of the study participants the field strength resulting from the experimental base station was between 0.01-0.9 V/m. The seven EEG-bas ed sleep parameters obtained from 335 subjects (mean age \u00b1 SD: 45.0 \u00b1 14.2 years; range 18-81 years) did not differ between sham and exposure nights. This study also analysed subjective sleep quality (see 3.8.3). Lowden et al. (2011) studie d possible effects of RF EMF exposure prior to sleep (duration: 3 h). They used a double-blind ex posure to either an 884 MHz GSM signalling standard including the low frequency amplitude modulation components of an uplink GSM signal: 2, 8, 217 and 1736 Hz with a 10 g peak spatial-averaged SAR of 1.4 W/kg or sham. The sample comprised 48 subjects (23 with mobile phone-re lated symptoms and 25 without symptoms, overall 27 females, ag e range 18-44 years). An ANOVA revealed that there were no differences between th e sensitive and the non-sensitive group and also a lack of a significant gr oup*exposure interaction, henc e the groups were pooled for further analyses. The results of full night polysomnography (7h) revealed that under exposure slow wave sleep wa s significantly decreased (and this was mainly due to a reduction of NREM stage 4), while the latenc y to NREM stage 3 and the amount of NREM stage 2 (min) were significan tly increased (see Table 10). In a study aimed at analysing possible mechanisms by which RF EMF could affect cortical excitability during sleep and sleep depe ndent performance changes in memory, Lustenberger et al. (2013) also looked at ch anges in the macrostructure resulting from an all-night exposure (see Table 10). The samp le consists of 16 healthy males in the age range 18-21 years. Subjects' head was exposed using a circular-polarized antenna facing down to the subject's forehead. They used a 900 MHz signal pulsed with 7 consecutive 7.1 ms pulses forming one 500 ms burst. \"The se 500 ms bursts were repeated every 4 s (Intermittent-1 phase, 0.25 Hz, correspondi ng approximately to occurrence of sleep spindles), and every 1.25 s (I ntermittent-2 phase, 0.8 Hz, corresponding approximately to frequency of slow oscillations) respectively. Exposure of 5 min Intermittent-1 was followed by 1 min with no exposure (OFF phase=, then 5 min Intermittent-2 was followed by a 7 min OFF phase. This 18 mi n sequence was repeated throughout the night. The peak spatial specific absorption rate averaged over any 10g tissue (psSAR10 g) during the 7.1 ms pulses was set to 10W/k g. This resulted in a burst average of 1.0 W/Kg. The whole night psSAR 10 g averaged to 0.15 W/kg.\" (L ustenberger et al., page 2). The exposed subjects showed a reduced total sleep time (p = 0.04) and consequently a Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 106 reduced sleep efficiency (p = 0.04). This was mainly due to increase of wake after sleep onset (p = 0.03), while NREM and REM sleep duration was not affected. Nakatani-Enomoto et al. (2013) investigated possible effects of a 3 h W-CDMA exposure starting 5 h prior to sleep on subjective perc eption of sleep quality, macrostructure of and the EEG power spectrum during sleep. Their sample comprised 19 subjects (12 males and 7 females) aged 22-39 years. Asse ssments were made on three consecutive nights (adaptation, sham and real exposure ). Exposure was applied in a double-blind, counterbalanced design in three 1h-blocks se parated by 5 min breaks, in which batteries were replaced. A not further specified phone controlled by a base station generator was used for exposure. Peak spatial SAR 10g values were calculated for a Japanese human head model resulting in 1.52 W/kg for the head and 0.13 W/kg for the brain. The location of the maximum was not specified. In this study none of the investigated endpoints: sleep stages and derived variab les, EEG power spectra (calcu lated for six EEG derivations and analysed for frequency bands nor narrow frequency bids) of stages wake, stage NREM2 and spindles as well as subjective ratings on sleep quality was affected. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 107 Table 10. RF-EMF effects and macrostructure of sleep Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 108 In a study, which aimed at an alysing the effect of pulse mo dulation on sleep EEG power Schmid et al. (2012a) used a GSM 900 MHz sign al pulsed with 217 Hz and 14 Hz. The 14 Hz signal was selected since this is in the EEG frequency range (11-15 Hz) where previous studies have shown a significant effe ct of pulsed exposure . They used SAR 10g 2 Schmid et al. (2012a) did not find diffe rences in the macrostructure of sleep following a 30 min exposure prior to sleep (see Table 10). The results are based on data from 30 young he althy men (20 - 26 years). EEG power in the spindle frequency range was increased during NREM sleep in the second sleep episode following the 14 Hz pulse modulation. For the 217 Hz pulse-modulated condition the increase was not statistically significant (see Table 11). The observation that pulse modulated RF-EMF alters brain physiology is consistent with previous research. The authors underline the considerable individual variability. Schmid et al. (2012b) investigated the effect of a 2 Hz pulse modula tion of an RF EMF exposure on sleep EEG and whether the same effects occur after magnetic field exposure with the same 2 Hz pulse se quence. The sample comprise d 25 healthy young males (20 to 26 years) of which two had to be excluded due to bad signal quality or long periods of wakefulness. Exposure was deliv ered for a duration of 30 min prior to sleep in a three way cross-over double-blind design. For both the amplitude modulation of the 900 MHz carrier and the time course of the magnetic field a low frequency signal containing components up to 20 Hz was used. These co mponents (2 Hz, 8 Hz and harmonics) had higher amplitudes compared to those in GSM uplink signals. For 900 MHz the peak spatial SAR 10g was 2 W/kg. The amplitude (temporal peak value) of the magnetic field w a s 0 . 7 m T i n t h e b r a i n . T h i s c o r r e s p o n d s t o 8 6 % o f t h e I C N I R P l i m i t . E L F m a g n e t i c fields from mobile phones are weaker. Ne ither of the exposure conditions had a significant effect on sleep macrostructure as compared to sham except for a reduced amount of REM sleep in the second sleep cycle under RF exposure (see Table 10). A statistically significant increase in EEG power in the spindle frequency range (13.75 - 15.25 Hz) was only seen following RF exposure in NREM sleep and in NREM stage 2 sleep for the whole night, the first, third and fourth sleep cycle. Additionally, for both exposure conditions increased spectral power was obse rved for NREM sleep as well as for NREM stage 2 sleep for frequencies in the delta an d theta frequency ranges (1.25 - 9.0 Hz). With regard to sleep cycles the differences occurred in cycl es 3 and 4 of the night. The REM sleep EEG showed an increased power in the alpha range frequencies (7.75 - 12.25 Hz) following RF exposure only and in the lower delta range (0.75 - 1.5 Hz) in both exposure conditions (see Table 11). The authors concluded that both the pulse- modulated RF field and the puls ed magnetic field affect br ain physiology; with higher frequency pulse modulation components not being necessary for the effect to occur. Furthermore, the results do no t support the hypothesis that previously observed effects of RF fields are based on demo dulation of the signal only. In the study by Lowden et al. (2011), samp le size for power sp ectra analyses was reduced from 48 to 32 due to artefacts. They observed an increased power after exposure in the frequency ranges 0.5 - 1.5 Hz and 5.75 - 10.5 Hz during the first 30 min of NREM stage 2, an increased power for 7.5 - 11.75 Hz in the first hour of NREM stage 2 sleep and finally in the 4.75 - 8.25 Hz bands in the second hour of NREM stage 2 sleep. The corresponding figure shows that for the se cond and third hour of NREM stage 2 sleep there were also single statis tically significant results for lower and higher frequency bands. There were no differe nces between subjects with and without mobile phone attributed symptoms. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 109 Table 11. RF-EMF effects and sleep EEG power In an attempt to investigate individual diffe rences in effects of mobile phone exposure, Loughran et al. (2012) retested 20 healthy su bjects (13 females, 27.9 \u00b1 6.5 years) who participated in an earlier study (Loughran et al. 2005) with altogether 50 subjects. As in the previous study a double-blind, counterba lanced cross-over design was used to investigate a possible effect of a 30 min GS M exposure (894.6 MHz, pulsed with 217 Hz; Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 110 hemispheric mean SAR10g = 0.11 W/kg, pe ak SAR10g = 0.674 W/kg) prior to sleep. Based on the results of the pr evious study participants were divided into \"increasers\" (n=8) and \"decreasers\" (n=12) ac cording to an increase or decrease of spectral power of the NREM sleep EEG in the 11.5-12.25 Hz fr equency range. Overa ll verum exposure was associated with a significant (p = 0.046) increase in power in the 11.5 -12.25 Hz frequency range in the first 30 min of NREM sleep. This effect was more pronounced in the \"increasers\" than in the \"decreasers\" (p = 0.038). No other significant changes were observed in frequency ranges, which were pr eviously reported to be affected (12.25 - 13.5 Hz and 13.5 - 14 Hz). Furthermore, fema les were more affected than males (p = 0.035) in this study. The au thors claim that their result s underline EEG effects to be sensitive to individual variab ility and that previous negative results are not strong evidence for a lack of an effect. Macrostructu re of sleep was not affected in this study (see Table 10). In the study by Lustenberger et al. (2013) de scribed with regard to exposure in more detail above, eight the contralateral mastoid. The sample consists of 16 healthy males in the age range of 18-21 years. Spec tral power was computed for C4A1 for the first 4 NREM and REM episodes. An increase in spectral power for frequencies up to 10 Hz was seen during NREM sleep episodes. Spindl e frequency ranges and REM sleep were not affected. Exposure as a factor showed a statis tically significant (p < 0.05) effect in just one frequency band (centred at 8.5 Hz), while the interaction between exposure and sleep episode was significant (p < 0.05) in 13 of 38 frequency bands (width 0.25 Hz) considered up to 10 Hz, and for 5 of the 16 frequency bands (width 0.25 Hz) up to 4.5 Hz. A more detailed analysis of slow wave activity (SWA) which was calculated as spectral power between 0.75 and 4.5 Hz, revealed that in contrast to the usual decline of SWA during the night, there was a statistically significant deviation in SWA in the 4 th NREM episode (p < 0.05), indicating a less pronounced SWA decrease under exposure (Table 2). Additionally, for NREM episode 4 two parameters based on the time-course of short time spectra were calculated: event-re lated spectra power (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC). were time-locked to eith er the real EMF pulses or to corresponding times during sham. Under exposure an increa sed ERSP and ITC changes were observed. The study by Lustenberger et al. (2013) for the first time looked at a possible RF EMF effect of sleep related performance improvemen t. They found a statistically significant (p = 0.03) reduced sleep-related performance im provement as assessed by the variance of performance in a motor sequence tapping (Table 10). Human studies - Resting state waking EEG Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 111 Table 12. RF-EMF effects and waking EEG (res ting state and related to cognitive tasks) Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 112 The literature has described effects of exposu re to electromagnetic fields on EEG power not only for sleep but also for waking EEG. Here, the alpha frequency band (the basic rhythm of the resting EEG in approximately 85 % of the population) seems to be affected. Many older studies must be criticized for methodological reasons (one reason being a single-blind exposure design), and recent studies are in so me cases contradictory. Since the last Opinion seven studies on RF effects on resting state waking EEG were published (Table 12). Croft et al. (2010) investigated age-related ex posure effects on EEGs (eyes open) in the alpha band for GSM (894.6 MHZ, pulse modulated at 217 Hz; peak 10g = 0.7 W/kg) and UMTS (1900 MHz; peak spatial SAR10g = 1.7 W/kg) in adolescents (13 - 15 years, n=41), young adults (19 - 40 years, n=42) and the elderly (55 - 70 years, n=20). Within each group of subjects they used a double -blind, counterbalanced, cross- over design. Effects were anal ysed for frontal and posterio r electrodes. Results showed an increased alpha power only in the GSM exposure condition and here only for young adults. A study by Vecchio et al. (2010) analysed age- dependent EMF effects on alpha activity in waking EEGs in 16 older (47-84 years) and 15 younger subjects (20-37 years). Participants were exposed to a GSM signal (902.40 MHz, modulation frequencies: 8.33 and 217 Hz) for 45 min with a maximum SAR of 0.5 W/kg emitted by a commercially available mobile phone which was set using a test card in a double-blind cross-over paradigm. EEG was recorded fo r 5 min prior to and following exposure at 19 electrodes. The authors found an increased inter-hemisphe ric coherence of fronta l alpha EEG activity after GSM exposure which was st atistically significant for the elderly subjects but not for the young ones. This might point to a GSM-EMF related inter-hemispheric synchronization of alpha rhythms as a function of physiological aging. Vecchio et al. (2012a) used the same study desi gn to investigate an exposure effect in patients with epilepsy. Data from 10 patients were compared to results from 15 age- matched controls from previous studies. Patients showed a statistically significant higher inter-hemispheric coherence of temporal an d frontal alpha-rhythms under exposure as compared to control subjects. According to the authors, these resu lts might indicate a GSM exposure effect on inter-hemispheric sy nchronization of the dominant (alpha) EEG rhythms in epileptic patients. The effects of a 30 min UMTS mobile-phone like (1947 MHz with SAR1g slightly less than 1.75 W/kg) exposure was investigated in a randomized double-blind cross-over study by Trunk et al. (2013) in 17 young subjects (9 females, 21.8 \u00b1 3.5 years). EEG was recorded at 3 sites 10 min prior and 10 min following exposure (sham and UMTS), while the subjects were watching a silent docu mentary. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for the mean log-transformed spec tral power for 6 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha I, alpha II, beta I and beta II). None of the frequency bands showed a statistically significant ex posure effect (see Table 12). Furthermore in a second experiment performed at another test sessi on event-related potentials (ERPs) and mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigat ed. There was no effect on amplitude and latency of the auditory ERP components (see Table 13). Loughran et al. (2013) presented the result s of a study on GSM 900 MHz mobile-phone like exposure on the waking EEG in 22 adolescents (12 ma les) aged between 11 and 13 years (12.3 \u00b1 0.8 years). Two of them had to be excluded from the EEG analyses due to high frequency noise in the signal. They applied three exposure conditions in a double- blind, randomized, and counter-balanced crosso ver design with a pl anar antenna at the left side of the participant's O2 (referenced to the linked mastoids) prior to (baseline recording) an d immediately as well as 30 and 60 minutes after an exposure session of 30 min duration. Time of da y was kept constant within individuals. The authors summa rize that there were no cl ear significant effects of exposure on the waking EEG. Moreover \"results suggest that contrary to popular belief, Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 113 adolescents are not more sensitive to mobi le phone emissions\" (Loughran et al. 2013, p.1). The impact of pulsing of GSM900-like RF sign als on the resting EEG was investigated by Perentos et al. (2013) in 72 healthy subjec ts (35 females and 37 males, mean age 24.5 \u00b1 5.4 years). In one single recording session participants received four 30 min intervals with 5 exposure free min at the beginning an d at the end and 20 mi n of exposure: sham, continuous RF, DTX pulsed RF, and DTX pulsed 4 min breaks between exposure inte rvals. The order of exposu res was counterbalanced and randomly assigned in a double-blind cr oss-over design. The EEG was recorded continuously during the 2-h session. The re cording device was protected against RF interference by shielding and filters. Expo sure was applied by a specially constructed handset mimicking the spatial exposure characteristics of GSM phones. Peak spatial SAR10g was measured in a phantom: 1.95 W/kg for the continuous wave condition. The DTX signal used the same amplitude resulting in much lower SAR values. The peak magnetic flux density was 25 T at the surface of the hand set. The authors exclusively looked at the alpha-band (8 - 12.75 Hz) an d observed a significant decrease in the power spectra during pulse modulated RF expo sure, which is not in line with previous observations indicating an increase in alpha power under RF exposure. Since the EEG spectral power with pulse modulated RF ex posure was not different from continuous wave RF exposure the authors concluded that their results do not support the hypothesis that \"pulsed\" RF is required to produce EEG effects. DTX-like ELF magnetic exposure did not affect alpha power. No significant pairwise differences in alpha power between exposure conditions have been observ ed in the post exposure period. Suhhova et al. (2013) investigat ed effects of a 450 MHz exposure modulated at 40 Hz on the resting state waking EEG wi th eyes closed in a sample of 15 subjects (6 females and 9 males, 23 - 32 years). Following a base line assessment two randomly assigned exposure levels were considered in a sing le-blind design: psSAR1g = 0.303 0.003 W/kg (field strength 2.45 V/m. This set-up (session) was repeated on the same day afte r a 15 min break with a reversed order of the two real exposures. Exposu re was delivered by a signal generator, a modulator, an amplifier and a quarter-wave antenna located 10 cm from the left side of the head. Each exposure condition consisted of five 2 min cycles with 1 min exposure off and 1 min exposure on. The first 30s of the 1 min segm ents were used for calculating deviations between on/off in percent. The same segmentation was done for the reference condition. (Note: This methodological approach leads to an increase between on and off also in the reference condition amounting to a \"change\" of at least 10%). Results showed a statistically significant increase in the EEG power in three of four EEG frequency bands: beta2, beta1, and alpha frequency bands at the higher SAR level, and in the beta2 frequency band at the lower SAR level. In a phantom measurement artifacts from RF exposure were identified in the EEG signal. Although the di sturbing 40 Hz component was removed from the EEG by filtering it is no t clear whether parameter shifts or other interferences with the EEG recording system may account for at least a part of the observed differences. Human studies - brain acti vity assessed by fMRI There are two studies investigating RF-EMF e ffects on brain activity with functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI). One (L V et al. 2014) invest igated resting state brain activity while the other (Curcio et al. 2012) investigat ed brain activity during a cognitive task. Lv et al. (2014) used resting state BOLD fMRI signals to analyse po ssible effects of a 30- min RF-EMF exposure to a LTE signal (2 .573 GHz) in a double-blind, cross-over, randomized and counter-balanced study. As sessments of spontaneous low frequency oscillations were made prior to and after a 30-min exposure. The sample comprised 18 subjects (6 females and 12 males) from 19 to 35 years of age (mean 24.9 \u00b1 3.9 years). Subjects had test sessions on two consec utive days with the following assessments: structural MRI, pre-exposure resting state fMRI, RF-EMF exposure (real or sham) and Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 114 post-exposure resting state fMRI. Exposure was delivered by a signal generator, amplifier, and a dipole antenn a located on the right hand side of the head. The delivered power of the antenna was measured and adju sted to produce a mean spatial peak SAR 10g of approximately 1W/kg. Outcome paramete rs were the ALFF, which indicates the absolute strength of spontaneous fluctuations within a specific frequency range (typically 0.01 - 0.1 Hz), and fALFF, which represents th e relative contribution of this specific frequency range to the whole detectable freq uency range (0 - 0.25 Hz). Both parameters were individually standardized to reduce va riability between subjects. A comparison of pre-post differences did not re veal significant differences in the sham condition. In the real exposure condition three brain regions showed significantly decreased ALFF values (after correction of the alpha level for multiple testing): cluster 1 located in the junction of the left superior temporal gyrus and the left middle temp oral gyrus, cluster 2 located in the posterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus and cluster 3 located in the junction of right medial fr ontal gyrus and the right paracentral lobule. fALFF was significantly reduced close to the junction of the medial frontal gyrus and the right paracentral lobule. No region showed an in creased ALFF or fALFF after correction. The study provided other than EE G-based evidence that RF-EMF may modulate resting state neural activity. However, devi ating from EEG, it has to be kept in mind that the MRI investigations involve stronger electromagne tic fields than the experimental ones. Curcio et al. (2012) investigat ed whether GSM exposure affe cts the brain BOLD response in a somatosensory Go-NoGo task in 12 he althy young males between 19 and 25 years (mean \u00b1 SD: 21.4 \u00b1 2.0 years). Female subjects were not included to avoid variation in the outcome parameters due to hormonal ch anges during the menstrual cycle. Paired electrical pulses separated by 150 ms (Go) an d single pulses (No-Do) were presented on either the left or the right hand in a balanc ed design for sequence. The Go stimuli had to be responded by pressing a button with th e respective hand. Th e study was performed double-blind cross-over in a counterbalance d design, the two sessions (sham and real exposure) were separated by one week, an d exposure lasted 45 min. Each session consisted of a pre- and a post-exposur e assessment with 3 runs each lasting approximately 10 min. During the task th e BOLD signal and re action times were recorded. Exposure was delivered by a comme rcial mobile phone controlled by a test card to transmit a basic GSM signal (ca rrier frequency 902.4 MH z, modulation 217 Hz and 8.33 Hz) at a peak power of 2 W (0.25 W average). The phone was fixed to a helmet with a distance of 1.5 cm from the tragus. A non-operational second phone was fixed at the other side for blindness and symmetry. BOLD responses revealed significant activations in some brain area s with Go responses, after bo th, real and sham exposure. Brain activity changes due to GSM exposure we re not observed in this study. A General Estimating Equation with three main factors (exposure, trial, and hand) did not reveal significant exposure effects on reaction ti me, which might be expe cted given the small sample size. An analysis of pre- post as sessment by exposure yielded a significant decrease of reaction time after real ex posure, which was not observed after sham exposure. Human studies - waking EEG related to cognitive tasks Three studies looked at effects of RF exposu re on the waking EEG related to cognitive tasks. One of these studies (Hountala et al. 2008), however, provides insufficient information on exposure for its assessment. Another one (Leung et al. 2011), is listed in Table 13 and discussed in the context of ev ent related potentials. Using the same exposure setup Vecchio et al. (2012b, Table 12) investigated whether the EEG effects observed in a previous study are related to alterations in cognitive-motor functions. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over de sign EEG was recorded continuously at 56 sites in 11 subjects (24-63 ye ars) during a go/no-go task before and after GSM and sham exposure. At the behavioural level, faster reaction times were observed in the post GSM exposure condition than in the pre GSM exposure condition (see Table 14). No statistically significant diffe rence was observed in the sh am session. To analyse task related EEG changes the alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) was computed at the individual level for low- and high-frequ ency alpha sub-bands. There was less power Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 115 decrease of widely distribute d high-frequency alpha rhythms in the post- than in the pre- exposure period of the GSM session while no effect was found in the sham session. The results indicate an exposure effect both at the EEG and the behavioural level. Human studies - event-related potentia ls (ERP) and slow brain potentials Since the last Opinion eleven studies were published which investigated RF effects on event related potentials or slow brain potentials (Table 13). In three of these studies (Maganioti et al. 2010, Colletti et al. 2011, Mandala et al . 2014) there is insufficient information on exposure to be considered in more detail in this review. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 116 Table 13. RF-EMF effects and event related potentials / slow brain potentials Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 117 Kwon et al. (2009) used the Mismatch Negati vity (MMN) task, which is an auditory ERP elicited by infrequent stimuli deviant in frequency, duration, intensity or gap from the repetitive frequent standard stimuli in a sound sequence. The sample comprised 17 (12 females) young healthy adults (23.1 \u00b1 4.5 ye ars). EEG was recorded at 9 sites (there was no radiofrequency interf erence) in three conditions: two with verum exposure and one with sham exposure at ea ch side of the head. Each exposure condition was applied for 6 min, and all exposures were applied consecutively in one session in an order counterbalanced across subjects. An externa lly generated signal (902 with 217 Hz; SAR 10g = 0.82 W/kg) fed to the antenna of a mobile phone was used for exposure. In this study precautions were take n to prevent possible se nsations of audible noise caused by equipment. It is not clear whether the study was double-blind. All types of deviants in stimuli resulted in a MMN, ho wever, there was no effect of GSM exposure on the results. The same exposure setup and experimental design was used to analyse the MMN in 17 children (13 girls), aged 11-12 years (Kwon et al. 2010a). In this single-blind study a short exposure did not result in significant exposure effe cts. The authors themselves claimed that this study only had enough power to detect large effect sizes. To investigate whether GSM expo sure has an effect on brains tem auditory processing the same exposure setup was used again in a sample of 17 young healthy subjects (11 females, 25.9 \u00b1 4.3 years) (Kwon et al. 2010b) . To eliminate GSM artefacts, which were identified during the recording of auditory brainstem responses (ABR), the position of the phone was adjusted. Hence, the experiments were not double-blind. The results did not show an effect on the ABR su ggesting that a short-term expo sure to mobile phones EMF does not affect the transmission of sensory stimuli from the cochlea up to the midbrain. Parazzini et al. (2010) investig ated possible effects of UMTS exposure on the auditory system in 73 volunteers (38 females and 35 ma les; 22.8 \u00b1 3.8 years). The ear with the better auditory functioning outcomes was se lected for exposure and assessments, which were made pre and post a 20 min exposure. The study was double-blind and cross-over. Sessions were scheduled at di fferent days. WCDMA exposure at 1957 MHz was delivered by a mobile phone controlled by software and connected to an amplifier and a patch antenna positioned close to the ear. Peak spatial SAR 1g was measured in a phantom to be 1.75 W/kg at 2 cm depth from the phantom sh ell surface, which roughly corresponds to the position of the cochlear. The authors pr evented any interaction between the exposure and the audiometric transducer. None of th e outcomes reflecting auditory function (hearing threshold level, distortion prod uct otoacoustic emissions, contralateral suppression of transiently evok ed otoacoustic emissions, and auditory evoked potentials, for which sample sizes varies between 25 and 57) showed statis tically significant exposure effects after correct ion for multiple testing. Possible effects of a 30 min UMTS exposure (simulated mobile phone use, 1947 MHz, SAR1g slightly less than 1.75 W/kg) on auditory event related potentials (ERP) in a mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment with 10% frequency deviant tones were investigated by Trunk et al. (2013) in 26 yo ung subjects (12 females, 24.1 \u00b1 6.7 years). The test was run prior and following a 30 min exposure. No EMF effects on amplitude and latency of any ERP component were observed. The same group also investig ated the effect of electrom agnetic fields (duration of exposure 15 min) when (co-)exposed with ca ffeine (3mg/kg) on event related potentials (ERP) in an oddball paradigm with 80% freque nt and 20% rare target stimuli (Trunk et al. 2014). The sample consisted of 25 healthy subjects (9 females and 16 males, mean age: 21.1 \u00b13.6 years) UMTS si gnals were delivered by a mobile phone controlled by a test software provided by the phone manufacturer. For ex posure a RF amplifier and a patch antenna mounted on a pl astic headset were used. SAR values were measured in a phantom to be peak spatial SAR 1g = 1.75 W/kg and peak spatial SAR 10g = 0.73 W/kg, respectively. The study was performed in a double-blind 4-way cro ss-over design, with the following experimental conditions: 1) no caffeine and no mobile phone, 2) caffeine only, 3) mobile phone only, and 4) caffeine and mobile phone. While the area under the Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 118 curve of the ERP and the reaction time we re significantly decreased under caffeine exposure, no effects of mobile phone exposu re alone or in combination with caffeine were observed for the four parameters ch aracterizing the P300 of the ERP and the reaction time. In a sample of 10 subjects (5 females, 20- 31 years) Tommaso et al. (2009) analysed a possible exposure effect on the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) during exposure to a) a GMS phone (900 MHz, SAR 10g = 0.5 W/kg) by a transmitting mobile phone and b) by a modified mobile phone wi th the RF power dissipated internally (SAR approximately 30dB less than in condition a); called sham in this paper) compared to c) a condition with the phone completely switched off. All three tests were done on the same day in a double-blind cross-over design . Electromagnetic interference of the EEG device was tested, but not in the experime ntal setting. A decreased amplitude of the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) , diffusely distributed over the scalp was observed for conditions a) and b). The author s interpreted their results as the consequence of reduced arousal and expectatio n of warning stimuli, explainable in terms of effects by both the GSM sign al and the ELF magnetic fields produced by currents in the internal circuits. Leung et al. (2011) used the same sample, exposure and st udy design as described by Croft et al. (2010) for the analysis of the waking EEG to investigate possible effects of 2nd (2G) and 3rd (3G) generation mobile phon es on EEG and behavioural outcomes in an auditory 3-stimulus oddball paradigm and an N-back task on working memory. The sample comprised 41 adolesce nts (13-15 years, 14.1 \u00b1 0.9 years), 42 young adults (19- 40 years, 24.5 \u00b1 4.5 years) and 20 elderly subjects (55-70 years, 62.2 \u00b1 3.9 years). EEG was recorded at 61 sites, 7 participants had to be excluded. Out of the six variables considered for the event related potentials (E RP) resulting from the auditory task (peak amplitude and latency of N1 P3a and P3b), th e only one showing an exposure effect was the N1 amplitude. It was larger in the 2G exposure condition than under sham (no age effects). The EEG analysis for the N-back ta sk revealed delayed ERD/ERS responses of the alpha power in both exposure co nditions as compared to sham. Since the last Opinion one study (Papageorgiou et al. 2011) was published, which analysed the effect of a Wi-F i signal (2.45 GHz, 0.5 V/m) on event related potentials (ERPs) evoked in three different conditions (inhibition, initiation and baseline) of a modified version of the Hayling Sentence Comp letion task. In a single-blind cross-over design with randomized exposure (Wi-Fi or sham) 30 subjects (15 females, 23.8 \u00b1 1.7 years) performed the test. EEG was recorded from 30 electrodes during exposure while performing the task. Th e only statistically si gnificant effect seen for the P300 amplitude was one for exposure*gender interaction in the inhibition condition (at 15 out of the 30 electrodes). In the absence of the Wi-Fi signal the amplitudes in males were greater than in females (not statistically significant), while under exposure this was reversed: females had significantly higher amplitudes. Human studies - cortical excita bility assessed by transcrania l magnetic stimulation (TMS) One study investigated the effect of a 45 min GSM-exposure on cortical excitability in 10 patients (5 females and 5 males, age range 19 - 67 years, mean: 39.9 \u00b1 18.1 years, two women were in menopause, for the othe r three assessments were made during the early follicular phase) with cryptogenic focal epilepsy originating outside the primary motor area (M1) by means of paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Tombini et al. 2013). In a double-blind counterbalanced cross-over three exposures (ipsilateral exposure (IH), cont ralateral exposure (CH) and sham) were applied 1 week apart. TMS was applied i mmediately before and following exposure. Exposure was delivered by a commercially available mobile phone equipped with a test card. The typical GSM signal (carrier freq uency 902.4 MHz, average power of 0.25 W) was delivered resulting in a peak spatial SAR of 0.5 W/kg according to measurements in a phantom (Ferreri et al. 2006). For weight ba lance and blinding an identical phone was placed at the other side of the head. Restin g motor threshold (RMT) and amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) prior to ex posure did not show interhemispheric Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 119 differences. The MEP ratio for paired TMS sh owed the well-known inhibition-facilitation curve with inhibition at interstimulus intervals (ISI) of 1 and 3 ms, lack of inhibition/facilitation at ISIs 7, 9 and 11 ms and facilitation at ISI 13 ms. Differences between hemispheres were only observed for IS I 1 ms where inhibition at the ipsilateral hemisphere was lower than at the contralate ral side. Following exposure there was no effect on RMT. The MEP amplitude revealed a significant hemisphere*condition*time interaction, which was due to a significant reduction of amplitude in the same hemisphere after EMF exposure of the contralateral side. The MEP ratio resulting from paired-pulses showed a signif icant increase at the contralateral hemisphere after exposure at the contralateral hemisphere as compared to the pre-exposure situation. These results indicate that EMF modulates cort ical excitability in epileptic patients only when exposure was applied contra lateral to the epileptic focus. Human studies - cognition Since the last Opinion 10 papers investigating RF-EMF effects on cognition (as primary focus of research or as a minor additional re sult) have been publis hed (Eltiti et al. 2009, Luria et al. 2009, Sauter et al. 2011, Ha reuveny et al. 2011, Leung et al. 2011, and Schmid et al. 2012a, 2012b, Vecchio et al. ( 2012b), Wallace et al. (2012), Loughran et al. (2013), see Table 14) as well as a systemat ic review and two meta analyses on the topic (Barth et al. 2008, 2012, Valentini et al. 2010 and 2011). Furthermore, Regel and Achermann (2011) published a paper with re commendations concerning methodological standards in this research area. Eltiti et al. (2009) investigated 114 sub jects (54.0 \u00b1 15.4 years, no information concerning males and females in the sample ) in a three-way double-blind cross-over design. Exposures were combined GSM 900 and 1800 signals, total: 100 W/m 2; UMTS 2020 MHz, 100 W/m2; and sham exposure. Power flux densities roughly correspond to the maximum an individual is ex posed to by real base stations. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no statisticall y significant differences for the outcome variables of three cognitive tests performed during exposure: forw ard digit span (DS), digit symbol substitution test (DSST) and me ntal arithmetic task (MA). Testing was done in test sessions at least one week apart at approximately th e same time of the day. 44 (20 females) out of the 114 subjects were us ed as an age-matched control sample for 44 self-reported sensitive individuals (18 fema les, 46.1 \u00b1 13.2 years). The authors claim that overall cognitive functioning was not affected by short-term exposure (50 min) to either GSM or UMTS. The sens itive group had an impaired performance on the DS task under both exposure conditions as compar ed to sham, which was not present after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Using a single-blind three parall el-group design Luria et al. (2009) investigated effects of a transmitting mobile phone on cognition in a spatial working memory task in 48 male subjects (age not reported). For exposure , a head-worn frame holding two standard mobile phones equipped with test SIM cards and controlled by a GSM test system was used. Either no transmission at all or on e phone at maximum output power (2 W) at 890.2 MHz, pulsed at 217 Hz, pulse duration 577 \u00b5s was set (max. SAR 10g values of 0.54 to 1.09 W/kg are reported.) Each of the 16 su bjects per group was exposed on the left or right side of the head or by sham during the cognitive test, which was divided into 12 blocks of 50 trials each. 15 additional trials before the start of exposure served for practising. The whole duration per subject wa s approx. 1 hour. Average RT of the right- hand responses under left-side exposure condit ion was significantly longer than those of the right-side and sham-exposure groups aver aged together during the first two time blocks. Authors conclude that experiment durati on, exposure side and responding hand may influence the outcome of experiments for detection of EMF effects. In a follow-up study (Hareuveny et al. 2011) the question was inve stigated, whether the results found by Luria et al. (2009) and previous studies re present an effect of EMF or whether they are due to other causes. The same single-blind design, but with 29 male subjects (age not reported) in two groups fo r left and right exposure (no sham) was used while the phones were equippe d with external antennas placed far from the subjects. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 120 This setup was chosen to prevent any sign ificant radio frequency exposure from the mobile phones. The weak emission from th e external antennas was measured, but an investigation of possible residu al exposure from the phones is not reported. A longer reaction time for right-hand responses under left side exposure co mpared to right side exposure was found as a trend. The authors claim that the results obtained without EMF are similar to those with EMF. This suggests that effects of mobile phones previously attributed to EMF could be the result of, fo r example, low frequenc y magnetic fields or warming caused by the phones' electronics. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 121 Table 14. RF-EMF effects and cognition Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 122 Using a double-blind cross-over design, Sauter et al. (2011) investig ated a possible effect o f R F-E MF e xpo sur e a s co m pa r e d to sha m on o utco m e s o f te sts on a tte nti o n (di vi de d attention, selective attention, and vigilance) and working memory. The sample comprised 30 healthy male subjects (25.3 \u00b1 2.6 years) who were tested on nine study days in which they were exposed to three exposure conditions (sham, GSM 900 MHz pulsed with 217 Hz and WCDMA 1966 MHz in a randomly a ssigned and balanced order). Exposure was delivered by a specially developed an tenna, and simulated a cell phone use at maximum RF output power. The transmitted power was adjusted in order to approach but not to exceed a localised SAR 10g = 2.0 W/kg. Each test se ssion comprised a morning and an afternoon session within a fixed timeframe. Subjects were constantly exposed for 7 hours and 15 min during the day. Reaction time in the divided attention task was significantly increased during WCDMA exposure in the morning session but not in the afternoon session, and only with regard to the optic part of the test. A better performance in the vigilance task was seen under GSM exposure in the morning - not in the afternoon. Overall, time-of-day effects were more pronounced. The results do not support that RF EMF exposure has a negative effect on cogn itive performance. Control for time-of-day in studies of cognitive performance has to be added to the list of issues that need consideration when designing bioelectromagnetic studies on cognitive performance summarized by Regel and Achermann (2011). The study by Leung et al. (2011) described in more detail under the heading Human studies - event-related potentials (ERP) and slow brain potentials also investigated the effect of 2G and 3G mobile phone signals on behavioural outcomes of the auditory 3- stimulus oddball and the N-back test. For the oddball test, the behavioural outcomes (accuracy and reaction ti me) were not affected by exposure in the total sample as well as in age groups analysed separately. The behavi oural data of the N-ba ck task showed that reaction time was not affected by exposure while accuracy showed an effect in the 3G exposure condition with better accuracy in th e sham condition and a significant effect of age. The exposure related reduced accura cy was only observed in the group of adolescents. The studies by Schmid et al. (2012a and 2012 b) mentioned above, which primarily aimed at investigating different pulse-modulations of RF-EMF and a pulsed magnetic field on sleep EEG, also looked at cognitive performa nce during the 30 min of exposure prior to sleep in the evenin g. No exposure effects were seen on reaction time in a simple (SRT) and 2-choice reaction time task (CRT) as we l l a s i n a n N - b a c k w o r k i n g m e m o r y t e s t paradigm with the 14 Hz and 217 Hz exposure (Schmid et al. 2012a). Following exposure to the 2 Hz magnetic field exposure a significant increase in the SRT was seen while performance accuracy was not af fected (Schmid et al. 2012b). The study by Loughran et al. (2013) which looked at effects of a GSM 900 MHz mobile- phone like exposure on the wa king EEG in 22 adolescents (12 males) aged between 11 and 13 years (12.3 \u00b1 0.8 years) also looked at cognitive performance. They applied three exposure conditions in a double-blind , randomized, and counter-balanced crossover design with a planar antenna at the left side of the part icipant's head: 1. 4 W/kg). Time of day for the investigation was kept constant within individuals. Participants performed the same three cognitive tasks as described above (Schmid et al. ( 2012a and 2012b)). No si gnificant differences between exposure conditions were observed for any of the three different tasks. Wallace et al. (2012) investigated acute effe cts of exposure to a TETRA base station signal (420 MHz; powe r flux density: 10 mW/m2 resulting in an estimated whole body SAR of roughly 0.3 mW/kg) on short-term memory, working memory and attention in subjects between 18 and 80 years of age. They had three exposure conditions, 1 week apart at approximately the same time of the day: an open provocatio n test session with both real and sham exposure was followed by two double-blind test sessions with either Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 123 sham or real exposure (duration 50 min). 48 sensitive (29 females, 19 males) and 132 controls (67 females and 65 males) comple ted all three sessions. After applying performance exclusion criteria the number of su bjects varied test sp ecifically between 36 and 48 for the sensitives and 107 to 129 for th e controls. The authors found no evidence for a negative impact of TETRA base station signals on memory or processing capacity in either the control or the se nsitive group in the double-blind condition. They also considered physiological measures recorded while the subjects performed the Backwards Digit Span and the Ospan Test. Neither in the control group nor in the group of sensitive subjects a significant exposure effect was observed for the means and standard deviations of heart rate, skin conduc tance and blood volumetric pressure. Human studies - regional blood flow, blood concentration and oxygenation changes Out of the four papers published since the last Opinion, one (single-blind) study (Volkow et al. 2011) among others lacks dosimetry, di stance between phone and head, as well as information about the anatomical distribution of SAR and he nce is not discussed in detail here. In a small study on 9 healthy male vo lunteers (age not reported) Mizuno et al. (2009, see Table 15) investigated, in a si ngle-blind randomized cross-over design, whether a 30 min exposure to WCDMA (SAR 10g = 2.0 W/kg) delivered by a microstrip patch antenna has an effect on blood fl ow as assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) with two scans during an d two scans after exposure. Electromagnetic interference to PET was tested. The results in dicate that EMF emitted by 3G WCDMA-type mobile phones do not signific antly change rCBF during or after 30 min exposure. The reason for choosing a single-bli nd design was \"because it was expected to disclose EMF effects whereas double blind studies tend to highlight null effects\" (Mizuno et al. 2009, p 537). Table 15. RF-EMF effects and regional bloo d flow, blood concentration and oxygenation A potential effect of intermitte nt UMTS-EMF exposure (peak SAR 10g W/kg and sham; exposure: 20 s on/60 s off) on blood circulation in the head (auditory region) was investigated by Sp ichtig et al. (2012) in a double-blind, randomized cross-over design. They used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and considered a short-term (occurring within 80 s) and medium-term (occurring from 80 s to 30 min) effects in a study sample of 16 heal thy young males (26.8 \u00b1 3.9 years) looking at changes in oxy- [O2Hb], deoxy- [HHB] and total haemoglobin [tHb] as well as at heart Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 124 rate (HR). Furthermore, subjec tive well-being, tiredness and counting speed in the task, which was used to control concentration, were considered. These parameters did not vary with exposure. During exposure to 0.18 W/kg, a significant short-term increase in [O2Hb] and [tHb] was found, which is small ( 17%) compared to functional brain activation. [HHb] showed a significant decrease at 0.18 W/kg and at 1.8 W/kg in the range of physiological fluctuations. The change in heart rate from baseline was significantly higher at 1.8 W/kg than for sh am with regard to medium-term effects. Possible effects of a short term exposure (15 min) to a RF EMF produced by a GSM mobile phone on thermal responses (ear canal and facial skin), local blood flow in the head, and the autonomous nervous system (ECG and continuous blood pressure) was investigated by Lindholm et al. (2011) in a double-blind sham-controlled cross-over design. Subjects (26 boys aged 14-15 years) were exposed to a mobile phone GSM test signal (SAR 10g = 2 W/kg) in a climatic chamber. Blood flow was measured using near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). No significan t exposure effects were observed for local cerebral blood flow, ear canal temperature, and autonomic nervous system responses. Ghosn et al. (2012) investigated whether an acute 20 min exposure to a commercial mobile phone controlled by manu facturer's test software to transmit a GSM signal at 900 MHz, 250 mW average had an effect on cerebral blood flow. Peak spatial SAR 10g was measured in a phantom to be 0.49W/kg. In a double-blind cross-over study sham and real exposure were applied in two separate test sessio ns. The sample comprised 29 subjects (10 males and 19 females) betwee n 21 and 35 years. Possible effects were investigated by transcranial Doppler sonography with middle cerebral arterial blood flow velocity, pulsatility index and resistance index as outcome parameters. None of these parameters showed significant e ffects during and after exposure. Human studies - others Besides Spichtig et al. (2012) and Wallace et al. (2012), which have already been mentioned, Havas et al. (2010), Havas and Marrongelle (2013), Parazzini et al. (2013), and Choi et al. (2014) investig ated RF-EMF effects in heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV). Due to problems with the exposure se tup, the studies by Havas et al. (2010) and Havas and Marrongelle (2013) are not further discussed. Parazzini et al. (2013) analysed the effect of a GSM expo sure on nonlinear dynamics of the heart rate variability in 26 subjects (12 females and 14 males, mean age: 25.5 \u00b1 1.5 years) without cardiac or nervous system disorders between 21 and 28 years. In a double-blind, randomly assigned cross-ov er design subjects were exposed by a commercial mobile phone contro lled by manufacturer's test software to generate a GSM signal at 900 MHz (peak power 2W which co rresponds to 0.25 W average). Subjects had two test sessions (sham and real exposure) at least one day apart. Exposure is described in more detail in a previo us paper (Parazzani et al. 2007). The sham condition was realized by a resistive load on the external antenna connec tor of the phone resulting in no transmission. For blinding an identically lo oking device with no e ffect was used in the real exposure condition. Local SAR was measured in a head phantom, the only information reported is that local max SAR in the area of interest (hypothalamus and brainstem) was lower than 0.02 W/kg. All a ssessments were done in the morning to minimize circadian variation. No effect of exposure on nonlinear dynamics of heart rate was observed in this study. In a double-blind randomized cross-over study Choi et al . (2014) investigated possible effects of a 32 min exposure to WCDMA on pe rception, eight subjective symptoms, heart rate, respiration rate and hear t rate variability. The sample comprised two groups: a) 26 adults (13 females and 13 males, 28.4 \u00b1 5. 1 years), and b) 26 teenagers (13 females and 13 males, 15.3 \u00b1 0.7 years). Exposure wa s delivered by a WCDMA module placed in a dummy phone, and controlled by a laptop. Double-blinding was assured by remote control of the laptop. Peak spatial SAR1g wa s measured to be 1.57 W/kg at the left cheek. Assessment of physiological parameters was performed for a duration of 5 min at four times: pre-exposure, after 11 and 27 min of exposure, and post exposure. Data Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 125 analysis is based on a compar ison of changes from baselin e (pre-exposure measure) by exposure separately for the two age groups. WCDMA exposure did not significantly affect the autonomous system, subjective symptoms and perception neither in adults nor in teenagers. There is one group of researchers (S\u00f6derqvis t, Hardell and co-workers) who looked at effects of RF EMF exposure on serum leve ls and discu ssed among others as putative in dicators of a dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (BBB: S100b) and the blood cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCSFB: TTR) or as key enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandin D2, which for example is involved in sleep regulation (\u00df-trace). S\u00f6derqvist et al. (2009a) performed a descr iptive cross-sectional study (n=314) to investigate whether S100B protei n levels were higher among frequent than non-frequent users of mobile and cordless desktop phones . Blood serum was analysed and set against self-reported mobile phones use. The study failed to show that long- or short-term use of wireless telephones was asso ciated with elevated leve ls of serum S100B. Logistic regression of dichotomized serum transthy retin (TTR) levels (a less brain-specific marker) derived from the same observational sample yielded increased odds ratios that were statistically not significant (S\u00f6der qvist et al. 2009b). Further explorative (hypothesis-generating) data analyses yielde d inconsistent results (S\u00f6derqvist et al. 2009b). In an experimental provocatio n study, S\u00f6derqvist et al. (2009c ) investigated the effect of a 30 min mobile phone exposure to an 890 MHz GSM signal with an average SAR 1g distribution of 1.0 W/kg in the temporal area of the head in 41 subjects (18-30 years, 24 females) using an indoor base station antenna . Repeated blood sampli ng before and after the provocation showed no stat istically significant increase in the serum levels of S100B, while for transthyretin a statistically significant increase was seen in the final blood sample 60 min after the end of the provocation as compared to the prior sample taken immediately after provocation (p=0.02). Analysis of the \u00df- trace protein revealed no significant exposure related changes (H ardell et al. 2010). The volunteers who participated in this study plus 22 addition al not exposed subjects were used for an observational epidemiological study showing that the concentration of \u00df-trace protein decreased with increasing number of years of use. S\u00f6derqvist et al. (2012b) have also looked at the data from the earlier descriptive cross- sectional study (S\u00f6derqvist et al. 2009a) to see whether use of wireless phones was associated with lower concentrations of \u00df- trace protein. Overall, no statistically significant association between use of wirele ss phones and the serum concentration of \u00df- trace protein was found, neither with respect to short-term nor long-term use. Given that mobile phone contact increases skin blood flow (SkBF) by heating Loos et al. (2013) investigated whether ther e is an additional RF-EMF sp ecific effect on SkBF. The sample consisted of 20 healthy, young Caucasian subjects (12 females and 8 males, mean age: 25 \u00b1 3.9 years). In two test session s, performed at the same time of the day, under constant ambient conditions SkBF and skin temperature (Tsk) were measured by a laser Doppler system. Exposures were rand omly assigned and the study was double- blind. Exposure was delivered by a commerc ial phone controlled by manufacturer's test software to deliver a peak 2 W (mean 0.25 W) 900 MHz GSM signal. The SAR was measured in a phantom resu lting in a peak spatial SAR 10g = 0.49 W/kg. The sham condition was achieved by a resistive load as described above for the Parazzini et al. (2013) study. Following a 30 min rest period to stabilize Tsk, a five min baseline assessment was made. During the 20 min exposu re (real or sham) measurements were made after 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min as well as 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 after the exposure had been stopped and system has been removed. Furthermore a heat challenge was applied 25 min after the end of exposure by locally he ating both sides of the face to 44\u00b0C for one minute. During real exposure the SkBF on the exposed side was significantly higher than during sham exposure, while temperature was not significantl y different between conditions. The heat challenge led to a significantly greater early peak value for SkBF at Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 126 the exposed side following real exposure as compared to sham. These differences were not observed at the unexposed (contralateral) side of the fa ce. The authors conclude that they identified specific, athermal modifications of the skin blood flow during mobile phone radiofrequency exposure. Kwon et al (2011) investigated how exposure to GSM-type RF fields (902.45 MHz; W/kg; SAR 10g in brain 0.23 W/kg) influenced cerebral glucose metabolism in male volunteers. The subjects were investigated with positron emission scanning (P ET) post-exposure and performed then also a simple vigilance test. Exposure caus ed a local suppression of glucose metabolism in the ipsilateral cortex, compared to sham co nditions. This effect was not correlated to skin temperature and had no effect on the outcome of the vigilance test. In a second study from the same group (Kwon et al. 20 12), the male subjects were exposed and scanned simultaneously, with the exposure em anating from three different anatomical locations. Exposure or sham exposure last ed for 5 minutes, and was concomitant with the vigilance test. No effects were noted on the cerebral blood flow or on the task performance. A slight temperature increase wa s noted in the ear canals during exposure. In a double-blind, sham-controlled cross-ov er study Vecsei et al . (2013) investigated potential effects of a WCDMA exposure on pa in threshold percepti on in response to thermal stimuli applied to the finger surface in 22 healthy young subjects (10 females and 12 males, 20-29 years). They used topical ca psaicin as a positive control to validate the protocol (capsaicin lowers the thermal pain threshold - TPT). EMF exposure was delivered for 30 min by a commercial mobile phone controlled by manufacturer's test software to generate a WCDM A signal (1947 MHz carrier fr equency, constant power) connected to a RF amplifier and a patch an tenna placed close to the head. SAR was measured in a phantom resu lting in a peak spatial SAR 10g of 0.73 W/kg. While the TPT was not affected by the UMTS-like EMF exposu re, results indicate a slightly stronger desensitization effect across repeated trials under exposure for the contralateral side. The biological relevance of this observation, which needs to be confirmed by other studies, however, is not clear. Discussion on neurophysiological studies Overall, neurophysiological stud ies on possible effects of RF ex posure on brain function in humans (macrostructure of slee p, power of the sleep EEG, resting state waking EEG, event-related potentials, slow brain potentials, cognition, as well as regional blood flow and oxygenation changes) yielded variable re sults. Reasons for this are, among others, different exposure conditions and set-ups, the great number of investigated outcome measures, missing replication studies in a strict sense, different levels of control of the vigilance state, and varying st atistical properties. Effects si zes are usually not reported. Furthermore, it is rarely stat ed that measures were taken to avoid interference between the recording system and the exposure when assessments are made during exposure. RF interference can lead to artefacts as shown by Fouquet et al. (2013) . On the other hand electrodes and cables of an EEG recording system change the RF field distribution (Murbach et al. 2014). In spite of the repeatedly stated \"con sistency\" of re sults showing that pulsed RF EMF exposure leads to sl eep EEG effects (SSM 2013), power spectra differences are observed 1) in varying EEG frequency bands (not only in the spindle frequency range), 2) with re gard to different reference sleep stages (NREM stage 2, NREM including all NREM stages, and REM), and 3) concerning different time frames (whole night, first 20 or 30 min of NREM sleep or NREM stage 2 sleep, first or later sleep cycles, 4th NREM episode). This variation is underlined by more recent studies. These results of single studies have not been conf irmed by exact replication studies performed by other laboratories. Most of the human studies have been perfor med in young subjects and predominantly in males. Since neurophysiological parameters might change with age, it is not known whether CNS effects might differently a ffect elderly or younger (children and adolescents) subjects. There are some studies indicating that effect s might vary with age and gender. In studies, which cover males and females separate analyses should be Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 127 performed in order not to miss gender specific effects. Very few of the studies, which include females, state that the menstrual cy cle was controlled, a factor, which affects most of the neurophysiological outcome parame ters. This requires adequate sample sizes for both males and females. Another aspect is that studies with a parallel group design should be avoided in studies investigating EE G effects. Especially the power spectra of the sleep EEG is known to show a high inter-in dividual variation and high intra-individual stability (Buckelm\u00fcller et al. 2006)) Furthermor e it is not known whether subjects with pre-existing medical conditions may be affected differently. Moreover, most of the provocation studies in vestigating possible RF-E MF effects on brain activity have used either a commercial mobi le phone for exposure or tried to mimic the exposure pattern of typical handheld device s . A l m o s t a l l o f t h e m h a v e r e p o r t e d t h e maximum SAR over 1 or 10 g but not a detail ed SAR distribution. In some cases more detailed information is available in earlier publications of the group. It is well known that different phone models give raise to very di fferent anatomical dist ributions (Wil\u00e9n et al. 2003, Deltour et al. 2011). To en sure reproducibility of such studies simulating the use of handset and its effects at least a detailed de scription of the hard ware and its use (e.g. distance from the head position according to standards etc.) should be provided. A brain region specific SAR distribu tion would be helpful for th e discussion of results. Conclusions on neurophysiological studies Most of the recent studies have reported an effect of RF exposure on the spectral power of sleep and the waking resting state EEG. The effects on sleep EEG, however, are not restricted to the spindle frequency range. Fu rthermore, half of th e experimental studies looking at the macrostructure of sleep (esp ecially those with a longer duration of exposure) also found effects, which, however, are not cons istent with regard to the affected sleep parameters. It seems that with regard to event-related potentials and slow brain oscillations, resu lts are inconsistent. There is a lack of data for specific age groups. One study indicates that children and adolescents seem to be less affected. Overall there is a lack of evidence that RF affects cognitive functions in humans. Studies looking at possible effects of RF fields on cognitive functions have often included multiple outcome measures. Where effects have been found by individual studies, these have typically only been observed in a small numbe r of these outcomes, with little consistency between studies as to which exact outcomes are affected. The earlier described evidence that RF exposu re may affect brain activities as reflected by EEG studies during wake and sleep is further substantiated by the more recent studies. However, the relevance of the small physiological changes remains unclear and mechanistic explanation is still lacking. 3.6.2.3. In vivo studies What was already known on this subject? The previous Opinion concluded that there were few studies on animals that investigated possible effects of RF exposure on cognitive f unctions and behaviour, and that there is no evidence from these studies that cognitive functions in animals are influenced by exposure. It was also stated th at there is no evidence of di rect neurotoxic effects at SAR levels relevant for mobile telephony. At high er SAR levels, activated glial cells were seen in a couple of studies. What has been achieved since then? A number of studies on animals have been published since the last Opinion. They range from focus on learning and memory, on behaviour, biochemica l brain responses, neurogenesis and cytotoxicity, to neurodegenerative diseases. Blood brain barrier Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 128 Studies of blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability after expo sures to permissible RF EMF levels have previously received some interest after findings reported by a Swedish group that suggested increased permea bility to albumin in the rat brain during some treatment combinations (Salford et al. 2003; Eberhard t et al. 2008). The change was observed after a 2 h exposure to whole body SARs fr om 0.01 mW/kg to 0.12 W/kg, and remaining two but not four weeks after exposure. Thes e findings were previously not supported by results from other research groups. Since th e last SCENIHR Opinio n, three independent studies have been published that were design ed to reproduce the conditions employed by the Swedish group. In these \"replication\" studies (Masuda et al. 2009; McQuade et al. 2009; Poulletier de Gannes et al. 2009) animal s (male Fischer 344 rats) were exposed to a 915 MHz GSM signal at whole body SARs be tween 0.0018 to 20 W/kg, which gave head SARs of 0.14-2 W/kg, for 30 min or 2 h. Assessment was done immediately after exposure or after 2-7 weeks. None of the stud ies could find any effect of RF exposure on extravasation, number of \"dark neur ons\", or other neurodegenerative whereas the used positive controls caused increased BBB permeability. In contrast, positive findings were repo rted by and Seyhan (2009, 2011) who exposed anaesthetised albino Wistar rats to CW 900 or 1800 MHz radiowaves (at 20 min; SAR-values in the single mW/kg range). In both studies, male rats responded with increased BBB permeability (as shown by Ev ans blue measurements), whereas female rats were unaffected. Both th e gender difference in response and effects at very low SAR-values raise questions regarding the validity of the results. A weakness in the studies is also the use of anaesthesia which brings about relevance issues. Taken together, the recent studies on BBB integr ity do not lend support to that exposure to mobile phone-like RF at SAR-values below or equal to 2 W/kg causes impairment of the BBB. Several of the studies are furthermore done in such a way that their relevance for risk assessment is questionable. Learning, memory and behaviour There are some studies addressing RF effect s on spatial learning, memory, and behaviour published since the last Opinion. However, several of these studies are not possible to evaluate, or not performed in such a way that they can be considered to be of sufficient quality for risk assessment. A study with some relevance was published by Hao et al. (2012) where male Wistar rats experienced a transient negati ve effect of exposure on a spatial memory task. The exposure was to a 916 MHz CW RF field, 10 W/m2 (no SAR values are given) (six h exposure per day; five days a week; ten weeks). Compared to controls (no sham exposure), exposed animals displayed impairment in completion of a spatial memory task in the middle of the exposure period, whereas values were comparable between the two groups at the end of the tria l. Implanted micro-electrode arrays (into the hippocampus) in one control and one exposed animal in dicated changes in el ectrophysiological parameters in the exposed brain. An interesting study was published by Hirata and co-workers (Hirata et al. 2010). Their aim was to determine at what whole-body SAR value thermal stress-related behaviour was induced in rabbits exposed to 2.45 GHz in a range of ca 100-1000 W/m2. The rabbit is highly susceptible to heat stress and an appropriate mode l organism for these kinds of studies. A core body temperature increase of ca 1oC was sufficient to induce thermal stress behaviour in some, but not all animal s. The threshold for onset of behavioural thermal stress was at approximately 110 W/m2, which corresponds to a whole body average SAR of 1.3 W/kg. A study on Wistar rats exposed to UMTS sign als (0, 2 and 10 W/kg SAR) for a period of 120 minutes showed no differences at an ex posure of 2 W/kg from the sham-exposed group in hippocampal derived synaptic lo ng-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), indicators of memory stor age and memory consolidation. In contrast, at 10 W/kg, significant reduct ions of LTP and LTD were observed (Prochnow et al. 2011). The authors conclude that UMTS exposure at a rate of 2 W/kg is not harmful to markers Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 129 for memory storage and memory consolidation. At higher exposure s, however, effects occur that can be distinguished from the stress-derived background. Maaroufi et al. (2014) studied whether comb ined 900 MHz exposure (probably CW) for 1 h/day during 21 consecutive days and iron overload (which is neurotoxic and can contribute to learning deficits etc.) influe nced the outcome of spatial cognitive tasks, neurochemistry, and oxidative stress. Calculated SAR-values in the male one-month-old Wistar rats were 0.05-0.18 W/kg (depending on position within th e field). The testing took place after that EMF expo sures and/or iron administrati on was completed. A proper sham conditions was not in place. It is uncl ear if any blinding procedures were adopted. In summary, the EMF treatment caused impairme nt of the object exploration task but not in the other behaviour tests. Some changes in dopamine leve ls in certain brain regions were noted, but not in all parts of the br ain. There were no consistent effects on parameters related to oxidative balance in the brain. The iron overload did not exacerbate the effects of EMF exposure. Hao et al. (2012) investigated the effects of a CW 916 MHz RF EMF on spatial learning and memory in Wistar rats. The animals we re exposed for 6 h/day, 5 day/week, 100 weeks, to a 10 W/cm2 field (in the middle of the cage ). Once per week during the exposure period, the completion time, numbe r of total errors, and neuron discharge signal (implanted microelectrode arrays in the hippocampus) were recorded while the rats were searching for food in a radial maze . A transient negative effect on performance was seen during weeks 4-5. The authors spec ulated in an adaptation to the long-term exposure. Unfortunately, this interesting study lacks proper dosimetry. Another study on memory and behaviour in Wistar rats was published by Junior et al. (2014). No effects on anxiety patterns or working memory were observed in study where male rats were exposed to a 1.8 GHz GSM-like signal for 3 days. Once again, this study is lacking proper dosimetry, so its relevance for risk a ssessment is not possi ble to ascertain. Another possible transient effe ct on memory was reported by Ntzouni et al. (2013). Unrestrained mice (C57BI/6J) were exposed for 66 or 148 days (90 min/day) to a 1.8 GHz signal (SAR 0.11 W/kg). The animals displayed impairment in an object recognition and an object location task immediately at the end of exposure. Four weeks later, without exposure, the expo sure effect was absent. Memory impairment in Wistar rats was repo rted by Wang et al. (2013) together with morphological effects on neuronal structures in the hippocampus. The exposure was to a 2.856 GHz RF signal at 0, 5, 10, and 50 mW/cm 2 (for 6 min). The two higher exposure levels were associated with effects on spatia l learning and memory at 6 h, 1 day, and 3 days after exposure. Sharma et al. (2014) reported a negative effe ct on spatial memory performance after a 2 day training period in Sw iss albino mice. The expo sure (10 GHz; 0.25 mW/cm2; 0.18 W/kg) lasted 2 h/day for 30 days. The au thors furthermore repo rted a concurrent decrease in protein synthesi s in the animal\u00b4s brains. Improvement in motor function was seen in a study from Odaci et al. (2013) on female Sprague-Dawley rats. Pups were exposed in utero (days 13-21 of pregnancy) and investigated on postnatal day 32. Exposure was to a 900 MHz signal, at 10 V/m. No SAR- values were reported and the number of animals was very low (3 in each group, control and exposed). Cognitive impairment (as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers) were reported in a study on male Fisher rats (900/1800 MHz; 0.6 mW/kg; 2 h exposure/day; 30 days) (Megha et al. 2012). Lu et al. (2012) reported negative effects on spatial learning and memory in a study on Wistar rats (2.45 GHz; 1 mW/cm2; 3 h/day; 30 days). The authors reported that effects were reversed by systemic glucose treatment. In summary, although some of the studies reported here suggest an effect at non- thermal levels on learning, memory or behaviour, any conclusive evidence cannot be drawn at present. Results are to some extent contradictory, and th ere remain significant Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 130 question marks regarding exposure, blinding , proper controls, and dosimetry in many studies. Neurogenesis and cytotoxicity There are some recent studies that suggest cell loss in certain brain areas after RF exposure at levels below the exposure guidelines. Thus, Bas et al. (2009) and Sonmez et al. (2010) exposed female Wist ar Albino rats during week s 12-16 (1 h/day for 28 days) to a 900 MHz continuously modulated RF field. The authors report that the output power from the signal generator wa s 2 W (peak), causing 10 W/m 2 in power density. During exposure, animals were restrained in a cylindrical tube, where the modelled SAR amounted to 0.016 (whole body) and 2 W/kg (head) respectively. Sham exposed animals were kept in a similar contraption, without RF exposure. The SAR-values in the investigated parts of the brain were not calculated. The total pyramidal cell number in the hippocampus (Bas et al. 2009) and the Purkinje cell number in the cerebellum (Sonmez et al. 2010) were sign ificantly decreased in the exposed animals. The same animals (n=6 for both sham and exposed groups ) were used in both these studies, that furthermore did not find any exposure-relat ed effects on body or brain weight. Newborn (postnatal day 7, P7) and young adult (P28) Wistar rats were used in a study by Oredacova et al. (2011). The animals we re exposed to a 2.45 GHz (average power density 20 - 67 W/m2) for 2 h, followed by a 2 h post-exposure period before euthanasia. Markers for proliferation were investigated by immunohistochemistry (semiquantitative evaluation) for the imme diate-early response gene c-fos and for NADPH-diaphorase. This short exposure duration resulted in increased c-fos levels in the subventricular zone in P7 rats and increase d NADPH-diaphorase staining in the rostral migratory stream in P7 rats. Based on mo rphology, exposed rats displayed a younger phenotype at P28 than cont rols. The results are contra dictory and the methodology including exposure description render the study unsuitable fo r any further conclusions. Caballo-Quintas et al. (2011) analysed expressi on of c-fos and the gl ial marker GFAP in several brain regions in normal and picrotoxin -treated (prone to undergo seizures) adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were i. p. injected with sub- convulsive doses of picrotoxin immediately prior to exposure of immobilized (plastic tubes) rats. The exposure was to a 900 MHz RF for 2 h, yielding an estimated peak SAR in the brain of 1.5-1.6 W/kg. Animals were sacrificed at diffe rent time periods afte r exposure (90 min, 24 h, 72 h) followed by immunohistochemica l staining of several brain regions. The results show immediate (90 min post exposure ) increase in the numbe r of c-fos positive cells in neocortex and paleocortex in expo sed and picrotoxin-tre ated animals, which persisted until three days after exposure. The levels of GFAP increased with time in exposed and picrotoxin-treated animals. The study suggests th at the epileptic brain could be more sensitive to RF exposure, leading to glial cell activation. Neurodevelopment from a functional point of view was studied by Aldad et al. (2012) who exposed mice in utero and investigated th em as adults for certain behavioural traits and electrophysiological characte ristics. Exposure is poorly described but is reported to be to a muted telephone (900-1800 MHz) du ring the entire gest ation period. After blinded investigations, the authors concluded that exposed animals displayed hyperactivity, memory defici encies, decreased anxiety, and impaired glutamatergic transmission. Alth ough the study employs relevant bi ological end-points, it cannot be used for any conclusions regarding pre-nata l mobile phone exposu re and functional development of the brain. These studies indicate some neurotoxic effect s (reduced neuronal cell number, glial cell activation) after exposure for several days to RF fields at SAR-levels below 2 W/kg. Additional studies with better dosimetry are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Additional studies on early development as well as th e effects on the pathologic brain are also justified. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 131 Neurodegeneration Ammari et al. (2010) have documented increa sed GFAP expression, and thus glial cell activation after exposures at 1.5 and 6 W/kg in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a 900 MHz EMF, modulated at 217 Hz (five days/week; ei ght weeks). Animals were then sacrificed three or ten days afte r exposure and brain sections analysed for GFAP expression by means of immunohist ochemistry. Performed SAR calculations (phantom modelling) showed that animals were exposed to either 1.5 W/kg (45 min/day) or 6 W/kg (15 min/day). Both exposure regime s caused significantly increased levels of GFAP in the investigated regi ons after three and ten- days post exposure. In almost all cases, the effects were more pronounced in animals exposed to 6 W/kg. The conclusion of this study is that RF exposure may activate glial cells, in particular astrocytes. This is a typical marker for damage to the CNS an d appears independent of injury agent. In contrast, studies from the Arendash gr oup (Arendash et al. 2009, 2010), suggest that RF exposure (GSM-like signal, 918 MHz, SAR 0.25 - 1.05 W/kg) of mice (normal or transgenic; mixed strain background) provided a protective effect against Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD) development. The transgenic mice (Tg mice) were engineered to over- express the proteins A and PS1 and thus easily develo p the neurodegeneration typical for AD. In Arendash et al. (2009), both norm al and transgenic litter mates were daily e x p o s e d ( 2 h ) f o r u p t o m o r e t h a n s i x m o nths to the RF. For both types of mice, beneficial cognitive e ffects were noted after exposure, an d in the case of Tg mice, the disease process was reversed to some exte nt. These animals were exposed for various time periods from the age of five months up to 13.5 months of age. A more recent study (Arendash et al. 2012) employed older animals (21-27 moths) that were exposed for two months. Also here, improved memory capacity (in the Y-maze test) was noted, in both normal and transgenic diseased animals. Th e authors showed that the treatment did not cause increased brain temperature, slightly increased body temperature, and reduced the blood-flow in the cerebral cortex. Despite the commendable approach in using Tg mice and the overall good quality in the biological parts of the study, it is necessary to replicate these resu lts using an improved design and larger groups. The studies by Ar endash et al. suffer gravely from their complete lack of dosimetry. The authors have erroneously calculated the SAR values for the exposed animals by directly using the measured values of the external electric field. In the formula for SAR calculation it is the internal electric field that should be used and this is not easily obtained from ju st a value of the external field. The mentioned studies show results that are contradictory in terms of RF effects on neurodegeneration. Increased GFAP staining wo uld indicate activated glial cells and thus increased risks for neurodegenerative processe s, whereas the other studies suggest that a disease process can be reversed. Additi onal studies conducted by independent laboratories that try to replicate and extend these findings are necessary to reconcile the different outcomes. Oxidative stress End-points related to stress and oxidative stress have been investigated in several recent studies, with different outcom es. Ait-Aissa and co-workers (2013) analysed several stress markers (3-nitrotyrosine, HSP25, HSP70) in brains of young rats exposed to a 2450 MHz Wi-Fi signal in utero (day 6-21 of gestation) or as newborns (up to 5 weeks). Exposures were done 2 h daily (blinded conditions) at 0, 0.08, 0.4 and 4 W/kg. None of the exposure conditions yielded results di fferent from the sham conditions. Sasdag et al. (2012) studied long-term effect s of 900 MHz in adult male Wistar rats. The animals were exposed 2 h/day (7 days/week) for 10 months in a carousel configuration. Levels of amyloid , malondialdehyde, and protein carb onyl were analysed, and only the latter was affected (higher levels in exposed than in sham controls). Oxidative stress effects were also seen in a study from Dash muk et al. (2013) on Fisher rats exposed to 900 MHz (80 W/kg SAR; 2 h/day; 5 days/week). Both malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were increased in exposed an imals. Eser et al. (2013) employed adult Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 132 male Wistar rats in their study on effects of 900, 1800, and 2450 MHz (1 h exposure/day; 2 months; 1.04 W/kg whole body SAR). The total antioxidative capacity and oxidative stress index levels were affected (decreased and increased respectively) in several structures of the brain. In utero exposure (0.9 W/kg; 10 min exposure/d ay during the entire gestation period) of foetal rat brain (restraining conditions) caused decreased antioxidant (SOD and GSH-Px) and increased malondialdehyde levels in a study by Jing et al. (2012). Also Naziroglu et al. (2012) observed oxidativ e stress in rat brains exposed to 2.45 GHz, which was counteracted by administration of the antioxidant melatonin. Taken together, several studie s suggest that RF exposure in in rodents can cause oxidative stress effects. The studies are howe ver often lacking in proper dosimetry and do not include proper positi ve controls. The magnitude of the changes are modest, and their biological sign ificance unclear. Other effects Maskey and co-workers (Maske y et al. 2010, 2012) have focu sed on RF-exposure effects on Ca2+-binding proteins in the mouse hippocampus. In both these studies, animals were exposed to an 835 MHz signal (whole body av erage SAR 1.6 or 4 W/kg) for various time periods. During exposure, animals were no n-restrained. Three hours after the last exposure, animals were sacrif iced and the brains prepared for immunohistochemical staining for calbindin, calretinin, or GFAP (o nly in Maskey et al. 2012) . In the first study, six week old male ICR mice were exposed for 1 h (5 days), 5 h (1 day), or 1 h for 28 days (only at 1.6 W/kg). Compared to controls (it is unclear if real sham conditions were employed), several significant changes in immunoreactivity in different hippocampal regions were seen. However, the changes foll owed no consistent pattern, and no dose- response pattern was seen. The more recent work (Maskey et al. 2012) used a similar experimental approach, with the modification that GFAP was also investigated, and a more specific cell type analysis in specific hippocampal regions was made. In addition the exposure was for 8 h/day, one month. Calbindin and calretinin immunoreactivity decreased in CA3, and dentate gyrus regions. Effects on GFAP levels were more equivocal, increasing only at 1.4 W/kg in CA1 and CA3 and at only 4 W/kg in dentate gyrus. The papers thus report chan ges in levels of certain Ca2+- binding proteins, but in an inconsistent way. There is furthermore no consistent effect on GFAP expression. A more recent work (Maskey et al. 2014) found decreased levels of the neurotrophins BDNF and GDNF in several cerebral nuclei. Possible effects on stress hormones (ACTH, corticosterone) and hippocampal memory storage and consolidation (LTP and LDP) on male Wistar rats were investigated by Prochnow et al. (2011). Six restrained rats inside a spherical sector waveguide were simultaneously exposed (2 h) to either 0 W/kg, 2 W/kg or 10 W/kg (which does not cause a temperature increase >0.1 oC in the rat brain). Blinde d conditions were applied and measures were taken to minimize stress to the animals. All exposure conditions (including sham) significantly increased ACTH and corticosterone levels compared to the cage control. The only significant difference to sham was noted for corticosterone in the animals exposed to 10 W/kg. Also regarding LTP and LDP, all exposures were different from cage control values. Exposure to 10 W/kg was also significantly different from sham and 2 W/kg for both LTP (decrease), and LDP (increase) suggesting a possibility that high SAR-values impair hippocampal memory capacity. Also, Bouji et al. (2012) focused on a sing le short exposure (15 min to 900 MHz GSM- signal, 6 W/kg) of rats. Markers (GFAP), inflammation (IL-1 IL-6), stress (corticosterone) and emotional memo in six-week-old and 12 month old male Sprague Dawley rats were investigated. The only noted effects were increased corticosterone levels in young rats, and enhanced emotional memory and increased IL-1 levels in the olfactory bulb in the older animals. In two recent studies in rats, Pelletier et al. have investigat ed the effects of constant RF exposure (900 MHz continuous wave, 1 V/m, 5 weeks) on thermal related behaviour and Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 133 sleep pattern. In the first stud y (Pelletier et al. 2013) contro l of body energy homeostasis (feeding behaviour, sleep, thermoregulation) was studied in juvenile male Wistar rats. The obtained results suggested that the exposure caused increased constriction of blood vessels, and increased food intake, but with out any effects on sleep pattern. In the second study from the same group (Pelleti er et al. 2014), the same rat model and exposure conditions were used for therma l preference and sleep stage distribution studies. Exposed animals shif ted their thermal preference after the exposure period towards higher temperatures. Also certain sleep parameters (duration, SWS frequency) were increased in the exposed animal s, whereas the PS was unaffected. Effects on body mass (decrease) in rats was observed by Sokolovic et al. (2012), whereas Kim et al. (2013) did not observed an y effects in brain glucose metabolism (915 MHz RFID signal; 4 W/kg; 8 h/day; 5 days/week; 2 or 16 weeks). No consistent pattern in monoamine transmitter levels in several brain regions could be seen in a study by Abould Ez z et al. (2013). Their exposure of adult male Wistar rats (1800 MH; 0.8 W/kg; 1, 2, 4 months of 1 h da ily exposure) displayed various levels of dopamine, norepinephri ne, and serotonin in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, and medulla oblongata in exposed compared to control animals. However, no specific pattern can be obtained from the data. In a study from Razavinos et al. (2014) electrophysiological properties of CA1 hippocampal neurons were investigated in Wi star rats exposed as foetuses (900 MH; 6 h/day). A decrease in neur onal excitability was seen. A gene expression analysis based on a cDNA microarray was performed by Yang et al. (2012). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (res trained) were exposed to a 2.45 GHz RF field (0 W/kg, 6 W/kg). MRNA from the hippocampus showed 23 up- and 18 down- regulated genes after the 6 W/kg exposure. Th is included the stress response genes for hsp27 and hsp70, which was further confirmed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. Conclusions on in vivo effects A number of different end-points have been studied at various SAR-l evels in both mice and rats. Although some positive findings ar e noted, they are inconsistent and appear mostly at levels well above guideline values. There is however a need to replicate certain of the studies, and also to perform studies at more stringent conditions (exposure and dosimetry, blinding, controls). 3.6.2.4. In vitro studies What was already known on this subject? There was no specific reference to any relevant in vitro studies on this subject in the previous Opinion. What has been achieved since then? There are only few in vitro studies published in this area, and their relevance for an assessment of effects on the nervous system is limited. Some studies related to neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) have ne vertheless been published. The rationale behind these papers has been that one feature often involved in NDD is activation of microglia and/or astrocytes, which will cause changes in radical homeostasis and subsequent cellular stress. Also, different viability related end-points in both neurons and glial cells have been investigated. Del Vecchio et al. (2009) exposed a choliner gic cell line and primary cultures of rat cortical neurons to a 900 MHz signal (1 W/kg; up to 144 h). There were no effects on cell proliferation or viability from this exposure. A co-exposure of RF with H 2O2 potentiated H2O2 induced cell death in the cell line, but not in the primary cultures. Co-exposures to RF and amyloid- or glutamate did not exert any ad ditive or synergistic effect to exposures to the chemicals. Vi ability was also investigated by Campisi et al. (2010) who Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 134 exposed primary rat astrocytes to 900 MHz CW or 900 MHz amplitude modulated at 50 Hz. Exposures were for 5, 10, or 20 minutes, at 10 V/m. None of the exposure conditions had any effects on viability. The only note d effect was that a 20 min modulated RF exposure caused ROS and DNA fragmentation (Comet assay) increases. Endpoints related to survival and cell death was also investigated in studies by Liu et al. (2012) and Zeni and co-workers (2012). Th e former study found that primary rat astrocytes, but not C6 glioma cells, were induced to undergo Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis after exposure to a 1950 MHz TD-S CDMA EMF at a SAR-value of 5.36 W/kg for 48 h. The study by Zeni et al. used a sim ilar exposure protocol (1950 MHz UMTS signal; 10 W/kg; 24 where PC12 rat phaeochromoc ytoma cells were exposed. End-points studied included DNA integrity, cell viability an d apoptosis, directly after the exposure or after 24 h post exposure. None of the end-points at none of the investigated time points were affected due to the exposure. Signs of oxidative stress du e to RF exposure at 1800 MHz (modulated at 217 Hz; 2 W/kg; 24 h exposure) were seen in a study by Xu et al. (2010) who noted increased levels of 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHdG) in primary rat cortical neurons. The effect level of RF was comparable to the effe cts of the positive control H 2O2, and counteracted by melatonin, suggesting that th e exposure is causing DNA damage via oxygen radical production. A paper from Sakurai et al. (2011) adopte d a microarray gene expression analysis approach, where human SVGp21 glial cells were exposed to a 2.45 GHz CW signal (1, 5, 10 W/kg; 1, 4, 24 h). The microarray analys is yielded 23 assigned gene spots, but subsequent qRT-PCR could not confir m any effects on gene expression. Possible microglia activation by RF exposure has been studied in a few papers. Work from Hao et al. (2010) and Yang et al. (2010) employed the N9 mouse glia cell line and exposed the cells to a 2.45 GHz pulsed EMF (2 \u00b5s pulse width; 500 pps pulse rate; 20 min exposure; 6 W/kg). The results consistently show indicators of microglia activation (including CD11b activation, NO and JA K1/JAK2). Any possible microglia activation was not studied at lower SAR-values. A similar line of investigation was published by Hirose et al. (2010), who exposed primary rat microglia to a 1950 MHz W-CDMA signal (0.2, 0.8, 2.0 W/kg; 2 h). There were no signs of microglia activation (inflammatory cytokines) after exposure. A study on mouse retinal ganglion cells (Ahlers and Ammerm\u00fcller 2013) focused on responses of the cells to light stimuli. Cell s were investigated before, during, and after exposure (GSM 900, GSM 1800; UMTS) and up to 35 min after exposure. No consistent effect of RF exposure on light responses was seen. Moretti et al. (2013) used cortical neuronal cultures on microelectrode arrays to investigate possible effects on neurotransmi ssion. Exposure was to a GSM-1800 signal (3 min) at 3.2 W/kg. This pilot study indicated some effects of the exposure in the form of decreased firing rate and bu rst rate in the cultures. Primary rat cortical neurons were studied by Zhang et al. (2013). Cultures were obtained from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats and expo sed to 2.45 GHz (10 min). Cell viability was decreased in exposed cells (4 W/ kg), with signs of apoptosis. Stress protein expression and apoptosis markers were investigated by Calabro et al. (2012) in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Cells were exposed for 2 and 4 h to 1800 MHz. Results did not indicate any co nsistent pattern, with levels increasing, decreasing, or remaining unchanged. Conclusions on in vitro studies The few available in vitro studies are not providing data useful for assessm ent of possible effects on the nervous system function or on disease processes in the nervous system. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 135 3.6.2.5. Conclusions on nervous system effects and neurobehavioral disorders Although the Danish National Birth Cohort study has reported results that suggest higher prevalence of some behaviou ral and health disorders in children whose mothers have been mobile phone users, thes e findings have not been confirmed in other studies. In general, the published epidemiological studies have methodological weaknesses. Recent epidemiological studies have not show n increased risks of neurological disease related to RF exposure. Regarding neurophysiological studies, th e conclusions from the previous SCENIHR Opinion that RF exposure may affect brain ac tivities as reflected by EEG studies during wake and sleep is confirmed by the more re cent studies. The relevance of the small physiological changes remains unclear and mechanistic explanation is still lacking. Overall there is a lack of evidence that RF affects cognitive functions in humans. A number of different end-points have been studied at various SAR-l evels in both mice and rats. Although some positive findings ar e noted, they are inconsistent and appear mostly at levels well above guideline values. There is however a need to replicate certain of the studies, and also to perform studies at more stringent conditions (exposure and dosimetry, blinding, controls). The few available in vitro studies are not providing data useful for assessm ent of possible effects on the nervous system function or on disease processes in the nervous system. 3.6.3. Symptoms What was already known on this subject? One of the more common health concerns asso ciated with RF exposure is the onset of short-term symptoms such as headaches, fa tigue and dizziness. Id entifying whether RF exposure can cause these symptoms has attrac ted a substantial amount of research. As well as assessing these effects in the genera l population, the existence of a group of people who report being particularly sensitive to various forms of el ectromagnetic fields including RF fields has also been of special interest. Due to the lack of evidence for a causal relationship this phenomenon is called 'idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields' (IEI-E MF) (Hillert, 2004). However it is also more commonly referred to as 'electromagnetic hypersensitivity' or 'electrosensitivity. The 2009 Opinion noted that several studies had tested the association between RF exposure and the onset of symptoms. These incl uded studies relating to both the general public and to people with IEI-EMF. Although some studies had reported an association between individual symptoms and RF EMF ex posure, there was no consistency in these findings. In addition, although multiple studies were found which tested whether participants could tell when they were bein g exposed to RF EMF, none had found that participants were reliably able to do this. The Opinion therefore noted that \"the conclusion that scientific studie s h a v e f a i l e d t o p r o v i d e s u p p o r t f o r a n e f f e c t o f R F o n symptoms still holds.\" What has been achieved since then? 3.6.3.1. Provocation studies Since the last Opinion was published, an a dditional paper has appe ared (Lowden et al., 2011) which contains more data from a study included in the 2009 Opin ion (Hillert et al., 2008). This double-blind experime ntal provocation study expo sed participants with and without IEI-EMF to an 884 MHz GSM signal (time averaged 10g psSAR of 1.4 W/kg) for three hours on one day and to a sham condition for three hours on another day. The new paper reports the effects of these exposu res on the quality of the participants' subsequent sleep, including measures of subjec tive fatigue, arousal, sleepiness and sleep quality. No effects of exposure were observed for any subjective outcome. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 136 Fifteen new experimental provocation studies have also been published since the last Opinion. These are summarised in Table 16. Five of these included pa rticipants with IEI- EMF, and all but two of them (Nam et al., 2009; Leitgeb et al., 2008) described using a double blind protocol. Twelve of the studie s assessed exposures that were designed to emulate those that might be received from a mobile phone or radio handset during a relatively long call (30 minutes to 3 hours) (Choi et al., 2014; Croft et al., 2010; Curcio et al., 2009; al., 2012; Loughran et al., 2012; et et al. 2012; Sp ichtig et al., 2012). Two studies observed a significant effect of their ex posures. First, Curcio et al. (2009) asked fifteen participants to score each of ten symptoms before and af ter exposure to a sham condition and a GSM 902.4 MHz signal generated by a mobile phone positioned near to th e participant's head. After discarding data from four participants because of \"technical problems,\" a marginally significant (p=0.04) increase in headache ratings was observed, but in the sham condition rather than the GSM condition. Se cond, Nieto-Hernandez et al. (2011) exposed 60 police officers with IEI- EMF and 60 without the condition to 50 minutes of sham exposure, 50 minutes of exposure to a sign al emulating that produced by a TETRA handset and 50 minutes of exposure to a co ntinuous wave signal . Unexpectedly, the continuous wave signal was a ssociated with a decrease in itching sensations, an effect which was observed only among the IEI-EMF gr oup. Despite testing a range of subjective sensations, none of the other handset-related studies identified any significant effects of exposure. Two provocation studies assessed the effect of exposures associated with mobile phone or radio base stations. Wallace et al. ( 2010), exposed participants with IEI-EMF and healthy control participants to TETRA base station and sham exposure conditions. After being exposed to both conditions in an initial non-blind session, 48 participants with IEI- EMF and 132 without IEI-EMF were exposed und er double-blind conditions to four brief exposures (two 'on' and two 'off') and two 50 minute exposures (one 'on' and one 'off'). Sixty-three symptoms were assessed at the end of each exposure. Under non-blind conditions, the participants and particularly those with IEI-EMF reported significantly greater symptoms during the TETRA exposure than during the sh am exposure. When tested under double-blind conditions, however, these effects were no longer apparent. In an attempt to assess longer-term exposure to base station signal s, Danker-Hopfe et al. (2010) travelled to 10 villages in Germany where there was no mobile phone service, only weak fields from other RF sources an d no on-going discussion about the potential health risks of EMF. In each village, all adult members of every household were invited to participate in their study. Over the course of ten nights, participants recorded their sleep quality while at home, using a standardised questionnaire (other outcomes are summarised in section 3.6.2.2). During five of these nights, the research team used their own experimental base station to transm it combined GSM 900 MHz and 1800 MHz signals in the village. The base station was set to a test mode to ensure that the signal did not register on any mobile phones in the village. The other 5-night period was used as the control condition. 365 participants completed the study, under double blind conditions. No effects of exposure were observed for any subjective measure of sleep quality. Finally, one additional study by Leitgeb et al. (2008) assessed whether shielding people from electromagnetic fields during the night would have any beneficial effects on their sleep. 43 volunteers who regularl y experienced sleep problems which they attributed to R F - E M F w e r e a s k e d t o s l e e p a t h o m e f o r three 3-night periods. During one of these periods, participants slept within a Faraday cage designed to protect them from RF-EMF exposure. During another period, participants slept within a placeb o cage which looked similar but lacked the shielding properties. The third period involved no cage and acted as a control condition. Objective and subjecti ve measures of sleep quality were recorded in this single-blind experiment. Although three of the volunteers did display positive effects as a result of sleeping within the genuine cage, the authors subsequently discovered that all three had br oken their blinding by checking which condition blocked Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 137 RF-EMF and cautioned that \"no reliable co nclusion can be drawn from... these three volunteers.\" The results of these individual studies, which have typically not found any effect of exposure to radiofrequency fi elds on self-reported symptoms, are supported by a series of meta-analyses conducted by Augner, Gnambs, Winker and Barth (2012). These authors identified nine single- or double-blind provocation studies which assessed the effects of GSM exposure on five self-repor ted symptoms (headach e, nausea, dizziness, fatigue and skin irritation) and which were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. No evidence was found in the meta-analyses that any of these end-points were affected by exposure. One additional double-blind experiment used a different paradigm from those detailed above to assess whether exposure to radiof requency fields affects pain tolerance thresholds (Vecsei et al. 2013). Twenty two students (mean age 22, standard deviation 2.65, 10 female) were exposed to a UMTS 19 47MHz signal (maximum SAR average over 1g=1.75 W/kg and over 10g=0.73W/kg) or a sham condition for 30 minutes on separate days. Participants were exposed to thermal stimuli of their index fingers over four blocks of trials (two blocks of trials during each exposure and two blocks after each exposure, with each block consisting of six trials). For each trial, participants were instructed to move the relevant finger away from a heatin g pad as soon as the heating stimulus was perceived as painful. The time taken to mo ve the finger was used as an objective measure of pain threshold. After each block of trials, participants also provided a subjective assessment of how painful the stimuli were. For the blocks of trials that occurred during the exposure, a non-significant (p=0.09) 'device x trial' interaction was observed, with the expected desensitisation of fingers to heat stimuli over time being slightly stronger in the UMTS condition than the sham condition. A significant three-way 'side x device x trial' interaction was also observed, suggesting that the desensitization interaction only occurred for the index finger that was contralateral to the exposure. Analysis of the subjective pain data also su ggested a significant effe ct, with pain ratings increasing between blocks (i.e . over time) during sham ex posure, but remaining steady during UMTS exposure. The use of a behavioural indicator of pain threshold in this study represents a novel step in this field. Whether the findings of this study, which had a good methodological design, can be re plicated remains to be seen. Eleven of the studies described in Table 16 ha ve also tested whether people are able to tell whether or not they are being exposed to RF (Choi et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2012; Nakatani-Enomoto et al. 2013; Nieto-Hernandez et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2010; Nam et al., 2009; al., Spichtig et al ., 2012). In addition, on e further study from Iran tested this ability in 20 students who reported symptoms which they attributed to their mobile phone (Mortazavi et al., 2011) . None of these studies has found any evidence that participants are able to make this discrimination, a result which holds true both for people with IEI-EMF and for those without it. Additionally, the meta-analyses conducted by Augner and co-workers (2012) pooled the results from seven double-blind studies which assessed people's abilities to detect radiofrequency fields, but without finding any evidence of such an effect. A second meta-analysis by R\u00f6\u00f6sli, et al. 2010) pooled the results of four double-blind pr ovocation studies, and also observed no evidence that people with or without IEI-EMF were able to correctly discriminate between conditions.

Observational studies In addition to experimental provocation studies, several observational studies have recently been published which assess the possible impact of longer-term exposure to RF on symptoms, well-being and ot her subjective outcomes. Several of these have relied on participants to self-report their level of expo sure to RF. In the larg est of these studies, Korpinen and Paakkonen (2009) tested whethe r self-reported use of various electrical devices were associated with six psychological symptoms experienced in the past 12 months among a random sample of 6121 Fi nns. Only one statistically significant association was found out of the 32 analyses that were conducted using these data. Redmayne et al. (2013) obtained data from 373 children (mean age 12.3 years (10.4 to 13.7 years)) and their parents wi th respect to cordless and mo bile phone use, use of and type of mobile phone headset, cordless phone frequency, and presence of Wi-Fi at home. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 140 The authors controlled for the following in th eir analyses: age, sex, the socioeconomic rating of the school (SES), having recently had a cold or flu, usual bedtime, exercise levels, weekend viewing/electron ic gaming hours, having a television in the bedroom, the number of times woken weekly by the cell ph one, and cell phone storage and carrying habits. Associations were found between head aches and having long or frequent mobile phone calls (compared to not, or hardly ever using a mobile phone) or using a wireless headset. Associations were al so found between tinnitus and having a cordless phone at home with a frequency less than or equa l to 900 MHz or 1.8 to 1.9GHz, and using a wired mobile phone headset. Feeling down or depressed was associated with using a wireless headset or having a cordless phone with a frequenc y of 900MHz or less. Waking in the night was associated with using a wi reless headset or not having Wi-Fi at home. Being tired at school was asso ciated with having a digita l spread spectrum cordless phone at home. Finally, having a painful text ing thumb was associated with making more or longer cordless or mobile phone calls, and sending more texts. Hutter et al. (2010) used a case-control desi gn to compare 100 patients attending an ear nose and throat clinic with tinnitus against 100 pati ents attending the same clinic but for other reasons and matched for age and sex. Both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to their mobile phon e usage. There was a si gnificant association between having tinnitus and using a mobile phone on the same side of the head for four years or more prior to the onset of the tinn itus (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.80). Khan (2008) compared self-reported mobile ph one use and symptoms among 286 medical students. Significant associations were found between higher use of mobile phones and higher rates of eight symptoms. Similarly, Kucer et al. (2014) assessed the association between self-reported mobile phone use and symptoms in a sample of 350 people from Turkey, finding associations between higher usage and head ache, joint pain and hearing loss. Szyjkowska et al. (2014) analysed ques tionnaire data from 587 people in Poland and identified associations between factors relating to self-reported mobile phone use and symptoms including headache, fatigue and heat sensations. In a cross-sectional survey of a sample of 250 people living near to a base station in Iran, Shahbazi-Gahrouei et al. (2014) identifi ed several significant associations between self-reported distance of resi dence from the base station and reporting of symptoms. In a sample of 57 participants, recruited fo r a provocation study, Augner and Hacker (2009) looked at the association between how far participants believe d they lived from a mobile phone base station, their self-reported daily mo bile phone use and various measures of symptoms, anxiety and well-bein g. Self-reported mobile phone use was not associated with any outcome, but lower self -reported distance from a base station was associated with higher levels of symptoms and anxiety. A survey of 251 citizens of a Bavarian town identified an association between symptoms and distance of residence from a mobile phon e base station, with participants divided into four groups for the analysis based on distance (Eger & Jahn, 2010). Although exposure was assessed at an aggregate level fo r each of the four distance categories in this study, no attempt was made to test wh ether objectively measured exposure within each residence was associated with the symptoms reported by each participant. An observational study using data from the Danish National Birth Cohort assessed the association between pre and postnatal exposu re to mobile phone signals and migraine- type or other headaches in seven year old children (Sudan et al. 2012). Both types of exposure were assessed through the mother's reports as to whether she had used a mobile phone while pregnant and whether her child currently used a mobile phone. Both migraine-type (prevalence roughly 1%) and other headaches (19%) were more common among children whose mother reported mobile phone use du ring pregnancy. The effect was small but statistically significant (ORs 1.2-1.3 for prenatal an d postnatal exposure about 1.5 for both combined). Adjustment fo r other factors associated with headache diminished the effect, suggesting that residual confounding is likely to have inflated the results. Frequency of calls and amount of ha nds-free device use as well proportion of time the phone was on were related to othe r headaches (only frequency of calls showed Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 141 an association with mi graine-type headache). In these analyses too, the effect was reduced after taking into account other factors. Although several significant associations have been found in studies relying on self- reported exposure, caution is required in interpreting the associations suggested by these various studies. First, it is possi ble that confounders explain some of the associations. For example, a recent st udy by Thomee et al. (2011) assessed the association between self-reported mobile phone use and symptoms of stress, sleep disturbances and depression. While several as sociations were found, these related more to lifestyle factors such as the self-reported stress associated with being easy to contact than to any bioelectromagnetic mechanism. Si milarly, reduced depre ssion in older adults as a result of cell phone us e has been observed but attributed to greater ability to interact socially with rela tives (Minagawa and Saito, 2014) , while the availability of electronic gadgets after bedtime has been asso ciated with poor sleep and obesity (Chahal et al., 2013). With respect to the stud y by Redmayne et al. (2013), unmeasured differences between 12yr old children who are and are not regular users of mobile phones, such as personality or social stress, may account fo r some of the associations that were observed. Second, self-reports of mobile phone use or of the distance to the nearest base station are known to be inaccura te and have a poor association with actual levels of RF exposure. In particular, for the st udy by Sudan et al. (2012), it is difficult to quantify what level of exposure to the foetus might have occurred during maternal use of a mobile phone, except that it was presumably very low. Third, a participant's description of their previous exposure to RF may itself be influenced by their knowledge about their current health status, resulting in spurious associations being reported. Again, this seems particularly problematic for the study by Suda n et al. (2012) where maternal use during pregnancy was not assessed until seven years later. Finally, even when a participant's self-report of their exposure to RF is accurate, it is still difficult to know whether any association with symptoms is the result of RF exposure per se or whether the association is the result of a 'nocebo' effect, whereby the participant' s belief that they are being exposed is sufficient to their trigger their symptoms (Rubin et al., 2010; Baliatsas et al., 2012). Several recent studies support this last suggestion. For example, Baliatsas and co- workers (2011) sent symptom questionnaires to a random sample of 3611 participants in the Netherlands. While the pe rceived proximity of a mobile phone base station to the participant's home was associated with thei r level of symptoms, actual proximity (as determined using a comprehensive database of base station locations) showed no such associations. Similarly, althou gh a survey of 30047 participan ts in Germany (Blettner et al., 2009) found a small association between th e objective distance from a respondent's house and the nearest base station and their level of symptoms, subsequent RF measurements made in the homes of 1500 of the participants found no association between symptoms and objecti ve levels of exposure ( Berg-Beckhoff et al., 2009). A survey of 500 participants in Poland (Bor tkiewicz et al., 2012) also observed an association between symptom reports and distan ce to the nearest base station, but not between symptom reports and th e electric field strength re corded within the house. In an attempt to move away from reliance on self-reported exposure and to control for possible worry as a confounder , G\u00f3mez-Perretta et al. (2013) reported findings from a re-analysis of an earlier paper (Navarro et al. 2003). Out of 215 symptom questionnaires that were distributed to resi dents of one Spanish town in 2001, 150 were returned and useable RF measurements were made in the bedrooms of 88 of these participants. Sixty- six of these participants were recontacted in 2012 and asked whether, in 2001, they had been worried about the presence of two local base stations and whether they believed the base stations might damage their health. Thirty-nine (59.1%) reported 'yes' to both questions. Many of the symptoms enquired about showed significan t associations with exposure levels in the bedroom, which remained after controlling for covariates including age, mobile phone usage and concern abou t the base stations. Using two questions eleven years after the event seems unlikely to provide a g ood measure of attitudes and perceptions towards the presence of mo bile phone base stations, however. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 142 Given the problems of finding an adequate way to assess exposure, a welcome advance in this area has been the development of pe rsonal exposure meters which can be worn by participants during their day to day liv es. The MobilEe-study has made use of these meters by asking 1484 children (aged 8 to 12yrs) and 1508 adolescents (aged 13 to 17yrs) to wear a personal exposure meter fo r 24 hours and to return various self-report and parent-report measures of symptoms, behaviour and mental health. The possible associations with behavioural disorders obse rved by this study (Thomas et al., 2010) are discussed in Section 3.5.2.1. A dditional papers using the Mo bilEe data have assessed the associations between exposure and physical symptoms (Kuhnlein et al., 2009; Heinrich et al., 2010; Heinrich et al., 2011; Milde-Busch et al., 2010), but have not observed any consistent effects. An alternative approach to assessing RF ex posure was applied by the Swiss Qualifex team, who used a questionnaire to assess a range of 'surrogate' measures that had previously been shown in a separate study to predict RF exposure as measured using personal exposure meters. Exposure assessmen t covered both far fi elds in residential setting and use of appliances such as mobi le phones, DECTs and WLAN. Information on mobile phone use was collected both from th e participants and ne twork providers. The participants were classified into three ex posure groups with cut-points at the 50th and 90th percentile. The questionnaire, which also measured a range of symptom outcomes, was completed at two time-points one year ap art by 1124 participants aged 30 to 60. No consistent associations were identified between exposure and non-specific symptoms, tinnitus or sleep quality (Frei et al., 2012; Mohler et al., 2010). Pe rceived exposure at baseline, however, (evaluated with a question about self-rated exposure compared with average population levels) was associated with symptom score and increase in self-rated exposure with headache. A more detailed an alysis of sleep quality was subsequently performed for 120 of the participants who wore an actigraph on their wrist for two weeks and completed a detailed sleep diary (Mohle r et al., 2012). Supplementary information on their exposure was also collected using an exposimeter in the bedroom and during a working day. Radiofrequency exposure was not associated with increases in daytime sleepiness score or sleep problems. Sleep du ration and sleep efficiency showed no association with any measure of EMF exposure in the sub-study. A systematic review of observational st udies by Baliatsas and co-workers (2012) identified two to four cross-sectional studie s (depending on the sp ecific outcome) which assessed the impact of objectively assesse d exposure to base station signals on subjective symptoms, which were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis and which were not judged to have a high risk of bias due to exposu re misclassifica tion, selective participation or confounding. In each meta-analysis \"highly exposed\" participants (based on the highest exposure category used by a study) were compared with the lowest exposure reference category. No significant e ffects of exposure were found for any acute or chronic symptoms. Discussion on symptoms The quality of the provocation studies which have included subjective outcomes can be evaluated against the standard criteria for randomised controlled trials, including the level of blinding, the use of randomisation and counterbalancing, the use of a sample size calculation, the reporting of participant drop-o uts and the registration of a study protocol in a publically-accessible registry prior to recruitment beginning. When assessed against these criteria, the provocation studies described in this update were of reasonably good quality, with double-blinding, randomisation and counterbalancing being the norm. Room for improvement still exists with respect to some elements, however. In particular, it is rare for studies in this field to describe an a priori sample size calculation, to register a trial protocol or to report how many dr op-outs occurred during the experiment. Other quality criteria are also relevant in the particular context of IEI-EMF. One issue that is sometimes raised concerns the appropriat eness of measuring subjective endpoints at all. Given that IEI-EMF is defined by the occurrence of symptoms which are attributed to electromagnetic fields, it is appropriate to test for the condition by studying the onset of Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 143 these symptoms. This does not preclude othe r endpoints also being studied. However, with some exceptions (e.g. Vecsei et al. 2013), the use of objective endpoints as 'surrogates' for subjective symptoms is no t always valid (Fleming and DeMets, 1996). A second general issue concerns the possib ility that some people may be genuinely sensitive to radiofrequency fields, but may be hidden amongst a larger number who believe they are sensitive, but who are mistak en. In this hypothetical scenario, studies which test the effects of exposure by asse ssing the average response of a group of participants with IEI-EMF may be unable to detect an effect unless a large sample size is used. Studies that were published before the cut-off date for this Opinion have previously explored this possibility by te sting individual participants with multiple exposures in an attempt to identify any individual who can relia bly detect or react to radiofrequency fields (Rubin et al. 2005; Rubin et al. 2010). These st udies have not found convincing evidence of this phenomenon, a finding supported in this update by Wallace et al. (2010). While it cannot be ruled out that some people experien ce symptoms as a result of exposure to RF, if this phenomenon exists at all it appears to affect only a small minority of all those who believe that they are affected. A third general issue relates to the level of detail given regarding SAR distribution. As noted for neurophysiological studies (see Section 3.6.2.2), the details provided are often limited. More specific issues relating to the quality of IEI-EMF provocation studies concern whether the experiments are a fair test of th e sensitivity reported by their participants. To be considered a fair test, studies should ensure that: the follow-up period after any exposure is long enough to allow a participant's symptoms to develop and be recorded; the ambient levels of electrom agnetic fields within the test ing room are not themselves sufficient to trigger symptoms; the interval between exposures is lo ng enough to prevent carry-over effects from occurring; and that the exposure used in the study is similar to that reported as problematic by the participants. Poor report ing by some studies included in this Opinion limited an assessment of them against these criteria. However, measures taken to ensure fairness have included: restricting participation to those people who report a short latency for their symptoms (Nieto-Hernandez et al., 2011; Leitgeb 2008); checking that ambient electrom agnetic fields are not problematic for participants or using shielding or other techniques to minimise levels (Nam et al., 2009; Nieto-Hernandez et al., 2011; Kwon et al., 2012; Leitgeb et al., 20 08; Wallace et al. 2010 ); ensuring that the interval between testing sessi ons was tailored to each participant (Nieto-Hernandez et al., 2011); and ensuring that on ly participants who reported sensitivity to the type of exposure being used in the study were recr uited (Leitgeb et al., 2008; Nam et al., 2009; Nieto-Hernandez et al. 2011; Kw on et al. 2012). Wallace et al. (2010) also demonstrated that their laboratory conditions were not a barrier to symptoms developing in their IEI- EMF participants during a set of preliminary, non-blind exposures. The most recent observational studies that have been published since the 2009 Opinion represent a substantial move forward in qua lity for studies assessing the relationship between long-term RF exposure and symptoms . Early studies that were suggestive of a link suffered from substantial methodological weaknesses due to thei r reliance on self- reported measures of exposure and their often poor contro l of confounding variables. Studies which have used objective measures of exposure have typically found no association between exposure and symptoms. While further work using this paradigm would be benefi cial, at present these studies suggest there is no causal link between exposure and symptoms. 3.6.3.3. Conclusions on symptoms The symptoms that are attributed by people to RF EMF exposure can sometimes cause serious impairments to a person's wellbeing . However, research conducted since the previous Opinion adds weight to the conclusion that RF EMF exposure is not the cause of these symptoms. This applies to the general public, children and adolescents, and to Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 144 p e o p l e w i t h I E I - E M F . R e c e n t m e t a - a n a l y s e s of observational and provocation data support this conclusion. For symptoms triggered by short-term exposu re to RF fields (measured in minutes to hours), the consistent results from multiple double-blind experiments lead to a strong overall weight of evidence that RF EMFs do not cause such effects. For symptoms associated with longer-term exposures (days to months), the evidence from observational studies is broadly consiste nt but has gaps, most notably in terms of the objective monitoring of exposure. Current evidence weighs towards an absence of effects due to RF EMF exposure. 3.6.4. Other effects of RF exposure The previous SCENIHR report concluded that there was no evidence for adverse health effects at levels below existing exposure limits on prenatal development and insufficient evidence concerning male fertility due to methodological limitations of published studies. The overall assessment found no in dication of an effect of RF fields on reproduction and development 3.6.4.1. Reproductive effects The possibility that human sperm could be particularly vulnerable to the use of mobile phones, and other sources of RF fields, has re ceived interest and attention. The previous SCENIHR report concluded that studies on male fertility were inadequate due to low statistical power and/or methodological problems. What has been achieved since then? Two main approaches have been used to inve stigate the effects of RF fields on male fertility in humans: either phone use has been estimated in men attending infertility clinics, or samples of sperm from healthy donors have been exposed to RF fields ex vivo . Some studies have used a mobile phone as exposure source, but these have not been included in this assessment. In addition, on e study examined reproductive outcomes in naval personnel who had been exposed to RF fields aboard a ship. Gutschi et al. (2011) examined 2100 men atte nding an infertility clinic from 1993 to 2007 and reported reductions in semen qualit y in men using mobile phones. Samples of semen were collected from patients and an alysed for sperm count and morphology, and concentrations of testosterone, FSH, LH and PRL. Patients with a history of smoking or alcohol consumption were excluded as were those with systemic di sease, orchitis and varicocele. Self-reported information was also gathered on phone use, and patients were placed in either use (n = 991) or no use (n = 1119) groups: the basis for this attribution was not described. Significant differences were found between groups in sperm motility, and in abnormal sperm morphology, although no difference in sperm count was seen. Users also showed significantly higher testosterone level and lower LH levels than no users. There are a number of lim itations with the study, incl uding lack of assessment of RF exposures from other sources of RF in the home and at work, exposures to other factors that might influence fertility (cofoundin g) and problems associated with recall bias regarding phone use. Reproductive outcomes were evaluated in a Norwegian study of navy personnel occupationally exposed to RF fields from radar and high-frequen cy antennas aboard speed boats (Baste et al. 2012). A total of more than 28,000 navy servicemen were included in the study, of whom half were land-based personnel and of those in the fleet a third had served aboard fast patrol boats. Spot measurements of electric fields were conducted in several locations aboard sp eed boats in 1998 and 2005. A measure of cumulative exposure was calculated based on job title, vessel type and duration of service. Average expo sure level was 0.4-2.3% of the ICNIRP guideline values in 1950- 1994 and 3.3-7.9% from 1995 for the rest of th e crew, but roughly 90 % for the captains of two of the boat types. Exposures during the three-month period preceding conception were analysed separately. Information on seven reproductive ou tcomes was obtained Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 145 from the comprehensive national medica l birth registry. Nearly 38,000 singleton pregnancies were included in the analysis. Low birth weight was associated with work on vessels, but no such relation was found for other measures of RF field exposure. Pre- eclampsia was associated with work aboard fa st patrol boats and an increased risk was found in all categories of RF exposure amon g men on such boats. Similar results were also found for perinatal mortality. The study used an exploratory approach with multiple comparisons involving seven outcomes and fi ve exposure classifi cations which suggest that some significant results are expected just by chance. The contribution of paternal factors is likely to be small for several of the outcomes in comparison with maternal factors and events during preg nancy. Uncontrolled confoundin g by lifestyle factors such as paternal smoking and alcohol consumption is also a concern, and no information on maternal exposures was available. It appear s that each pregnancy was regarded as an independent event, while children born to the same couple have dependence in terms of risks (this is likely to inflate the significance , but would not be expect ed to bias the risk estimates). De luliis et al. (2009) exposed purified human sperm to CW 1.8 GHz fields at a range of power densities for 16 h. The SARs were de termined by calorimetry to be 0.4 - 27.5 W/kg. Significant decrease s in motility and vitality were reported at 1 W/kg and above, as well as significant increases in mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA fragmentation at 2.8 W/kg and above. The magnitudes of these changes increased with increasing SAR. The samples were placed in 35 mm Petri dishes and exposed using a cylindrical waveguide, but the temperature in the waveguide does not appear to have been regulated using an incubator, but only controlled through the ambient temperature which was maintained at 21oC. Although the effects of increasing bulk temperature on ROS production in sp erm samples were inve stigated, there is a strong possibility that localised hot spot s would occur in the exposed samples, and numerical dosimetry is required to descr ibe the pattern of energy absorption. Using computer-assisted sperm analysis, Falzon e et al. (2008) reported that exposure for 1 h to GSM-like pulsed signals at 900 MHz at 2 or 5.7 W/kg had no effect on progressive sperm motility. There was also no effect on sperm mitochondrial membrane potential. Samples of sperm from 12 healthy donors were exposed to RF fields using a specially- constructed irradiation chamber that was held in a humidified incubator to ensure consistency of temperature; controls were kept next to the chamber. Numerical dosimetry was used to determine the SAR distribution in the samples, which was validated using physical dosimetry. Using a similar protocol, Falzone et al. (2010a) reported that exposure of sperm to pulsed 90 0 MHz fields for 1 h at 2 W/kg significantly reduced the size of the head of the sperm and the acrosome percentage of the head area. Exposure also caused a significant de crease in the numbers of sperm binding to oocytes in the hemizona assay, but had no effe ct on the ability of the sperm to initiate the acrosome reaction. The authors suggested that the changes in sperm morphology could have been artefactua l, and possibly a consequenc e of air-drying the semen samples (Cooper, 2012). Nevertheless, it was co ncluded that RF fields might affect male fertility and impair fertilizat ion rates. Falzone et al. (2010b) examined the effects of exposure on four markers of apoptosis. Sp erm samples from 12 donors were exposed to pulsed 900 MHz field at 2 or 5.7 W/kg for 1 h. and flow cytometry was used to measure caspase 3 activity, externalization of phosphatidylserine, induction of DNA strand breaks, and generation of ROS up to 24 h after expo sure. No significant fi eld-dependent effects were seen, suggesting exposure had not ha d any impact on pro-apoptosis events. Rago et al. (2013) reported that, compared to men who did not use a mobile phone or used one for less than 4 h per day, DNA fragmentation was significantly increased in men who used a phone for more than 4 h a day, pa rticularly in men who carried their phones in a trouser pocket (as opposed to a shirt po cket). Another eight in dices of semen quality were not affected, nor were any changes seen in morphology of the testes. Unlike some other studies, only healthy and fertile me n were assessed in th is study, men with andrological disease or other conditions that might affect the outcome pf the study were excluded, and all subjects used the same mobile phone. Phone use was assessed by Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 146 questionnaire but use of cordless phones or other sources of potential exposure do not appear to have been considered. As part of a study exploring the relationship between lifestyle factors and fertility in a population of 344 men, Jurewicz et al. (2014) reported that longer-term mobile phone use (and many other factors) adversely a ffected semen quality. After correction for multiple comparisons, it was found that, compared to men who had used a mobile phone for 0-5 years, the percentage of motile sper m decreased, and the percentages of atypical sperm and sperm with an abnormal head incr eased in men who had used a mobile phone for 11-25 years. The authors acknowledged that the study participants were drawn from those attending an infertility clinic, so may not be representative of the general population. Adams et al. (2014) performed a systematic re view and meta-analysis of 10 studies that had investigated effects of exposure to fiel ds associated with mobile phones on sperm quality. It was concluded that overall there were negative associat ions between exposure and sperm viability and motility, although an effect on sperm concentration was less clear. However, all except two of the studies in the p ooled analysis had used a commercial phone as an exposure source with little or no dosimetry to calculate the absorbed energy in the samp les. As explained elsewher e, a mobile phone is not acceptable as an exposure source without detailed dosimetry, and studies with such methodological shortcomings should not have been included in the pooled analysis. Liu et al. (2014) also performed a systematic review and meta-analy sis on mobile phone use and semen quality using data from humans exposed in vivo or ex vivo , and in vivo studies using rats. While the studies were evaluated for quality, and studies failing to meet inclusion criteria were excluded, several studies using a mobile phone as an exposure source were included. Four out of six human cross-sectional studies examined in the systematic re view reported negative effect s, although the meta-analysis (conducted using four studies) indicated no adverse effects on sperm concentration, motility, viability or morphology. The authors listed the limitations with this type of study, which included potential publication bias for studies reporting positive results, large heterogeneity between diffe rent studies, and recall bias. Although not concerned with male fertility per se, the effects of mobile phone use on erectile dysfunction (ED) were investigated in a pilot study by Al-Ali et al. (2014). Using questionnaires to assess phone use, it was found that the total time spent on the phone per week was not different between 20 men who had been complaining of ED for six months or more and 10 healthy men with no complaints, although those with ED carried their phones switched on fo r significantly longer than men without ED. The authors concluded that total time of exposure from mobile phones was more important than exposures occurring during actual use, and recommended larger studies to confirm these results. Information on where on the body the subjects carried their phones was not given. As part of a study into factors affecting peri natal morbidity, the effects of using mobile phones by 500 pregnant women on birth weight and birth time was investigated by Col- Azaz (2013). It was found that mothers who used a mobile phone during pregnancy had significantly shorter pregnancies with a grea ter number of pre-term births compared to mothers who did not use a phone. In addition , talking on a mobile phone for more than an hour per day was also asso ciated with a shorter pregnanc y compared with talking on the phone for less than an hour per day. Phone usage and pregnancy duration were assessed using retrospective questionnaire and ma y be subject to recall or other bias; no validation of reported phone use was atte mpted. The mechanis m for these changes remains elusive and unknown. Discussion on reproductive effects Studies have continued to investigate the possibility that exposure to low level RF fields from mobile phones and other sources can affect male ferti lity, but none of the recent studies are particularly informative. Most of the ex vivo studies have reported at least Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 147 one positive effect, but all these studies are subject to a variety of methodological limitations, and at least on e study reporting changes in sperm morphology may be attributable to artefact. A Norwegian study examining paternal RF field exposures aboard patrol boats was large, but confounding by uncontrolled lifestyl e factors cannot be excluded. Similarly, a study examining men attending an infertility clinic is also subject to possible confounding and recall bias regard ing phone use. Two meta-analyses of the available data produced no clear evidence of co nsistent adverse effects on semen quality. Whether mobile phone use by expectant moth ers during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes remains largely unexplored. It is not possible to weigh the evidence on male fertility due to a lack of informative studies. 3.6.4.2. Developmental effects What was known on this subject? Numerous studies have shown that RF fields are teratogenic in animals at exposure levels that are sufficiently high to cause a significant elevatio n in core maternal temperature (>1oC); there is no consistent evidence of adverse effects at non thermal levels. The previous Opinion described two studies investigating male fertility in rats, one negative and one positive, but the dosimetry of the testes were not sufficiently characterised in either; one st udy also used a mobile phone as exposure source. There was a lack of proper dosimetry in two st udies describing effects on development. What has been achieved since then? Many animal studies have investigated effects of RF fields on male fertility and on pregnancy outcome and development. Some of these studies used a commercial mobile phone, sometimes in standby mode, as the source of expo sure in their experiments. Unfortunately, such studies are of no use fo r health risk assessmen t, as the exposures would have been highly complex and very variable, especially if the animals were unrestrained and free to move in their cages. In addition, the emissions from a mobile phone in standby mode would be negligible (Hansson Mild et al., 2012). These, and other studies with inadequate dosimetry, ha ve not been included in this assessment. Male fertility Using a reverberation chamber to expose the animals, Lee et al. (2010) reported that daily exposure of SD rats to CDMA signals at a whole body SAR of 2 W/kg twice a day for 45 min, 5 days/week for 12 weeks, had no significant effect on direct and other measures of spermatogenesis. Assessments included sperm counts and histological evaluation of the testes, as well as apop tosis measured using the TUNEL assay. In addition, here was also no change in the expression of p53, bcl-2, caspase-3, key proteins related to apoptosis. In a further study, Lee et al. (2012) exposed rats to a combined CDMA and WCDMA signal at 4 W /kg for 45 min/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks. No effects were found on testicular function, including sperm count and stage of sperm cycle, testosterone concentration in blood, or on malondialdehyde concentration and appearance of apoptotic cells in the testes . In both studies, exposure had no effect on rectal temperature. Imai et al. (2011) investigated the effects of 1.95 GHz WCDMA fields associated with IMT-2000 phones on testicular function in Sp rague-Dawley rats. An imals were exposed 5 h/day for 5 weeks at a whole body SAR of 0.08 or 0.4 W/kg: the local SARs (1 g average) in the testes were calculated to be 0.2 and 1 W /kg. There were no significant differences in the absolute or relative weight s of the testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles or prostate, compared to values in sham ex posed rats. There were also no changes in sperm count, mobility or in the appearance of the sperm (except for a significantly higher sperm count in the testes, but not the epididymis, of the animals exposed at 0.4 W/kg). The stage of the sperm cycle was unaffected by exposure. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 148 No significant effects on testicul ar function were found by Troi et al. (2013) following short-term, intermittent expo sure of 9 male Wistar rats to 915 MHz GSM signals. Restrained animals were exposed using a GTEM cell for 1 h/day for 2 weeks at a whole- body SAR of 0.6 W/kg. The animals were exam ined immediately at the end of the last exposure for testis weight and morphology, an d for the number, mobility or structure of epididymal free sperm. Tas et al. (2014) investigated the effects of long-term exposure to 900 MHz fields on male fertility in rats. A group of seven animals were individually restrained and exposed using a carousel system to GSM 900 signal s for 3 h/day, every day for 12 months; control animal were sham-exposed. The aver age SAR in the testes and prostate were calculated to be 0.04 W/kg, average whol e-body SAR was simila r, with a maximum whole-body SAR of 2 W/kg. No significan t effects were seen on epididymal sperm concentration or motility, or on testes weight or general morphology, although the percentage of normal sperm was lower, and the thickness of the tunica albuginea was reduced in the exposed animals. In a ddition, spermatogenesi s (assayed using the Johnsen biopsy score) was significantly redu ced by exposure. The authors suggested that chronic exposure may accelerate degenerative changes in the testis, but this is based on data from relatively modest numbers of animals. Chaturvedi et al. (2011) reported that wh ole-body exposure of mice to CW 2.45 GHz fields at 0.04 W/kg for 2 h/day for 30 days ha d no significant effect on epididymal sperm count or motility. Treatment groups were very modest, however, consisting of 5 animals, which limit the usefulness of this study. A later study by the same group reported that sperm count and viability were decreased in mice that had been exposed to CW 2.45 GHz at an averaged, whole-body SAR of 0.018 W/ kg for 2 h/day for 30 days (Shalin et al., 2014). In addition, exposure produced significant changes in testicular morphology, decreased plasma testosterone levels, and in creased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the testis, liver and other tissues; exposure also resulted in a reduction in the activity of antioxidant enzyme s. Although 20 animals were exposed in total, most parameters were measured in 15 animals, although some endpoints, including testes morphology, were examined in only five animals. Overall, it was suggested that infertility may result from chronic, low level irradiation via a ROS/RNS-mediated pathway. The local SAR in the testes was not calculated. In a series of studies, Behari and co-workers have examined the effects of long-term, low level exposure to various RF fields on fertility and testicular function in Wistar rats. In these studies, the observ ed changes are attributed to a fi eld-induced increase in reactive oxygen species. However, the size of the tr eatment groups is mostly very small (n = 9 or less); comparable results are found irresp ective of applied fr equency; and the whole body SARs have been provided using simple models with no attempt made to calculate the local SAR in the testes using computational dosimetric models. Kesari and Behari (2010) reported changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes in epididymal sperm as well as effects on apoptosis and the sper matogenesis cycle usin g superoxide dismutase and histone kinase the activity of catalase in creased; apoptosis significantly increased and the percentages of sperm in S and G 2/M phase, assessed by flow cytometry, significantly decreased. In this study, freely-moving anim als were exposed to CW fields for 2 h/day for 45 days, at a whole-body SAR of 0.8 mW/kg . Similar results were also reported by these authors using CW 10 GHz fields at 0.014 W/kg (Kumar et al. 2011a, 2012, 2013). Kumar et al. (2011b) reported that exposure to 50 Hz-modulated 2.45 GHz fields at 0.014 W/kg for 2 h/day for 60 days resulted in significant increa ses in caspase-3 and creatine kinase activity in sperm. Serum concentrations of testosterone and melatonin were also significantly decreased in the expo sed animals. Ghanbari et al. (2013) exposed rats for 8 h/day for 2 weeks to signals repr esenting either GSM phone handsets (pulsed 915 MHz) or base stations (pulsed 950 MHz). Bo th signals had no effect on either sperm count or testes morphology but both caused a significant decrease in sperm viability and motility. In addition, exposure to handse t signals for 3 weeks resulted in further significant decreases in sperm viability and motility. Total antioxidant capacity in sperm Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 149 was also reduced by exposu re, but longer exposures di d not increase the change significantly. Caveats exist with this study: only the average field strength was given (1.6 mW/cm2), and there was no indication of the actual SAR in the animals. Further, six freely-moving animals appear to have been exposed as a group at any time, so the absorbed dose to any individu al or their testes would be uncontrolled and variable. Qin et al. (2014) reported changes on numerous measures of male fertility in rats after repeated, low level exposure to 1800 MHz fiel ds. Beginning at vari ous times throughout the light-dark cycle, groups of restrained animals were exposed using a GTEM chamber to a CW field at a whole-body SAR of 0.04 W/kg for 2 h/day for 32 days. Exposure was associated with significant re ductions in testosterone, dai ly sperm production and sperm motility, with concomitant changes in the activities of two testes marker enzymes and in the expression of two genes encoding en zymes involved in sperm production and maturation. However, the largest effects were seen when exposures coincided with peak time of plasma testosterone concentration (a s observed in sham-exp osed animals) which was towards the end of the dark phase and be ginning of the light phase. The circadian rhythms for most parameters we re either altered in exposed animals, or in the case of testosterone, abolished. The effects of long-term exposure to Wi-Fi signals on male fertility in rats were investigated by Dasdag et al. (2014). In th is study, a group of eight adult males were housed together in a cage held 50 cm fr om the antenna of a generator producing 2.4 GHz fields at 50 mW, and exposed cont inuously for 24 h/day, 7 days/week for 12 months. Compared to another group of eight similarly-housed animals not exposed to the field, exposure significantly increased defects of the head of the sperm and the weights of the epididymis and seminal vesicles, di ameter of the semini ferous tubules, and thickness of the tunica albugi nea were all decrease. There we re no significant effects on sperm motility or concentration, or on the we ight of the testes. Th e SAR used is quoted at 2.42 mW/kg (1g average) but the text presen ts the results of theo retical calculations suggesting the local SAR in the testes was in the region of around 0.5-1 mW/kg (10 g average). However, absorbed power would de pend on the behaviou r of the animals and be highly variable, making it impossible to replicate the exact exposure conditions used in this study. Pregnancy outcome and development Ogawa et al. (2009) examined th e effects of head-only exposu re of Sprague-Dawley rats to a 1.9 GHz W-CDMA signal during pregna ncy. Mothers were exposed using a head- mainly system for 90 min each day at 0.67 or 2 W/kg on gestational day 7 to 17. Mothers and foetuses were examined on gest ational day 20 for implantation and foetal losses, internal abnormalities and external malformations. No significant changes were seen in either the mothers or foetuses. Bas et al. (2009b) reported that exposure of Wistar rats to CW 900 MHz fields for 90 min/day from conception until birth resulted in significant losses in pyramidal cell numbers in area CA1 at 4 weeks of age as measured using optical fractionator techniques. Mothers were exposed using a head-only system. The low numbers of animals used (results were obtained from 3 litters per treatment) means no conclusions can be drawn. Lee et al. (2009) reported no significant effects on mouse foetuses following daily, combined exposure to 849 MHz CDMA an d 1.95 GHz W-CDMA si gnals throughout pregnancy, at a whole-body SAR of 4 W/kg or to CDMA signals at 2 W/kg. In a follow-up study, Jin et al. (2011) reported that exposure s of young rats to these signals for a year had no adverse impact on health: no signif icant changes were seen except for some altered parameters of the complete blood count and serum chemistry. Takahashi et al. (2010) reported a lack of teratological effects following whole-body exposure of pregnant rats to a 2.14 GHz W-CDMA base station signals. Freely-moving animals were exposed for 20 h per day from day 7 of gestation to weaning; SARs used were 0.028-0.040 and 0.066-0.093 W/kg in mothers which corresponded to 0.029 or Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 150 0.068 W/kg in the foetus, and 0.061-0.067 and 0.143-0.156 W/kg in offspring. Offspring were scored for visceral and skel etal abnormalities, external malformations, growth, and physical and reflex development. From 5 week s of age, offspring were also assessed for functional development by measuring behavi our in an open fiel d arena and spatial learning in a water maze. In addition, the fertility and reproductive ability of the offspring at 10 weeks was assessed. A few significan t effects were reported but these were discounted as being transient or inconsistent. However, in the probe trial in a water maze task, the exposed males spent a small but sign ificant increase of time in the target quadrant compared with the sham-exposed animals, suggesting a modest improvement in learning had occurred. Sambucci et al. (2010) examined the early and late effects of acute, daily exposure to a WiFi signal during pregnancy with particular emphasis on the immune system. Pregnant C59BL/6 mice were exposed to a pulsed 2. 45 GHz signal at 4 W/kg from day 5 of gestation for 2 h each day. Animals were re strained during exposure. No effects on pregnancy outcome were seen, and there we re no consistent effects on immune parameters including B-cell compartment and anti body production in offspring at 5 or 26 weeks of age. Sporadic differences were note d, but these were attributed to the effects of confinement stress during exposure, or to sex- or age-related changes. In a follow-up study examining the effects of exposure on th e T-cell compartment, no consistent field- related effects were seen at either time point on T cell counts, phenotype, or on thymocyte proliferation, and no effects were seen on peripher al (spleen) T cells (Laudisi et al., 2012). A companion study examined the effects of early postnatal exposure to WiFi signals on the maturation of the immune system in mi ce (Sambucci et al. 2011) and no consistent field-dependent effects were found. Newborn animals were exposed for 2 h/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks at a whole body SAR of 0.08 or 4 W/kg. A\u00eft-A\u00efssa et al. (2012) reported that prenatal and postnatal exposure of free-running rats had no significant effects on immunological markers or on growth. Animals were exposed using a reverberatory chamber to a 2.45 GHz Wi -Fi signal for 2 h/day, 5 days/week from day 6 to 21 of gestation, and then from birt h to postnatal day 35 at a whole-body SAR of up to 4 W/kg for pregnant animals, and up to 9 W/kg for offspring. Blood samples were collected on postnatal day 35 and analysed by ELISA for antibodies related to 15 antigens related dama ge or pathology. Poulletier de Gannes et al. (2012) have also investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 2.45 GHz WiFi signals on the development of rats. Preg nant animals were exposed using a reverberation chamber for 2h/day. 6 days/week for 18 days at a whole body SAR of 0.08, 0.4 and 4 W/kg. There were no signif icant effects on pregnancy outcomes, or on the weight and postnatal development of th e offspring. Exposure was also without significant effect on the heal th or behaviour of the pregnant animals. A second study investigated the effects of Wi Fi signals in rats exposed before and during pregnancy (Poulletier de Gannes et al., 2013 ). Six week-old male rats were exposed for 1 h/day, 6 days/week for 3 weeks, and seven week-old female rats were similarly exposed for 2 weeks; mating pairs of animals were then exposed for a further 3 weeks. Freely-moving animals were exposed using reverberation ch ambers at a whole-body SAR of 0.08 or 4 W/kg; control animals were sham-exposed . At the end of exposure, males were examined for testes histopathology, and preg nant females were examined the day before delivery for pre- and post-implantations losses, numbers of fo etuses and external abnormalities. No field-dependent effects were seen at either SAR, In contrast, results of a study by Naz ro lu and co-workers (\u00d6zorak et al ., 2103; \u00c7etin et al., 2014) suggest prenatal and early postnatal expo sure of male rats may increa se oxidative stress in testis and other tissues. Restrained rats were ex posed to either pulsed 900, 1800 or 2.45 GHz fields using a carousel-type system for 60 min/day, 5 days/week during gestation and until six weeks old. The averag e whole body SAR was calcul ated to be 0.18-0.15 W/kg, with a reported range of 0.001 to 1.2 W/kg (presumably the lower values represent absorption during early embryo foetal development). Effects we re found that appeared to depend on the length of exposure (or age of animals) but not on frequency of the applied field. \u00d6zorak et al. (2103) found that lipid peroxidation levels in the kidney and testis Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 151 decreased at 4 weeks of age, were not change d at 5 weeks, and decreased in the kidney and increased in the testis at 6 weeks; total antioxidant status decreased throughout, and iron (Fe) concentration in kidney tissues increased. Glutathione peroxidase levels decreased in the kidney and increased in the testis at 4 week s of age and were unaffected thereafter. Exploring effects of 900 and 1800 MHz only, \u00c7etin et al. (2014) found lipid peroxidation levels in the liver increased at all times, but were unaffected in the brain. Glutathione peroxidase levels decr eased in both the brain and liver at 4 and 5 weeks and were unaffected at 6 weeks; brain iron levels were increased throughout exposure. Overall, these effects are suggestive of the possibility of some increased risk to normal development from oxidative stress, but they are far from conclusive. Using a similar protocol to the above study, Dundar and co-workers examined the effects of prenatal and early postnatal exposure to a 2.45 GHz field pulsed at 217 Hz on growth and development in female rats (Sangun et al., 2014). Restrained animals were exposed using a carousel-type system in an EMF-shielded room for 60 min/day at 0.1 W/kg: one group of 4 pregnant females was exposed du ring gestation and then female offspring were exposed from postnatal day 21 days unt il puberty (prenatal group); another group of female offspring from 4 pregnant anim als was exposed from day 21 until puberty (postnatal group); other animals were sh am-exposed. Exposure was found to cause some significant effects that appeared to depend on the exposure period. Neither exposure period had an effect on birth weight of offspring, bu t the rate of weight gain by the prenatal group was lower than that of the other groups, alth ough daily food and water consumption of both exposed groups were greater than those of the control group. Onset of puberty was also sign ificantly delayed in the prenatal group (by about 14 days compared to controls). Total oxidant status in the brain and ovary were significantly increased in the prenatal gr oup, and the oxidative stress index was increased in both exposed groups. IGF-1 levels were also significantly lower in the postnatal group However, exposure had no sign ificant effect on the histolog y of the hypothalamus or on ovarian follicular count. Overall, it was concluded that the field had induced chronic stress in the exposed animals, particularly during the pr enatal period, resulting in restriction of postnatal growth and delayed onset of puberty. The effects of early postnatal exposure to GSM 1800 signals in the de veloping brain were investigated by Watilliaux et al. (2011). Youn g Wistar rats were exposed for a single 2 h period on postnatal day 2, 15 or 35 at wh ole body SAR of 0.13-1.2 W/kg, corresponding to a local SAR in the brain of 1.7-2.5 W/kg. No evidence of early neural cell damage in any brain region was seen 24 h after exposure, as measured by expression of HSP60 or HSP90 or for markers for glial development or activation. There was also no significant effect on the proteins involved in astroglial modulation of glutamate neurotransmission. Ozlem Nisbet et al. (2012) reported that ea rly exposure to RF fields increased the maturity of male rats. Young animals (2 da ys old) were exposed to 900 or 1800 MHz for 2 h/day for 90 days. The whole body SAR vari ed with age, and was between 3 and 1.2 mW/kg with 900 MHz, and 0.05 and 0.01 mW/kg with 1800 MHz. Exposure at both frequencies was associated with higher levels of testosterone, and an increased motility of epididymal sperm which had fewer abnormalities. The haematological effects on long-term, low level exposure of rats to RF fields were investigated by Adang et al. (2009). Groups of free-moving animals were exposed every day for 2 h for up to 21months to either CW or pulsed (at 1 Hz) 970 MHz fields or to 9.70 GHz CW fields. The SAR in the animals was not calculated, but the power density was measured at 2.06 W/m at 970 MHz and 3.2 W/m at 9.70 GHz. Blood samples were regularly taken during exposure. Small but significant increases were observed in all groups of exposed animals for most variab les examined, especial ly after the first 3 months of exposure, with pulsed fields ge nerally causing a reduced response compared with CW fields. Survival was also significan tly decreased in animal s exposed to 9.70 MHz CW fields. This result is intriguing, as it is not consistent with the results of earlier long- term studies. The absence of dosimetry here is of concern, but exposure did not induce Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 152 increases in rectal temperature nor induce behavioural signs of thermal stress in the exposed animals. Sommer et al. (2009) examined the effects of lifetime exposure to 1.966 GHz UMTS signals over four generations of mice. Freely-moving animals were exposed for 23.5 h/day, in groups of 2 or 3 adults, 2 adults and 6 pups or 4 young mice, at 1.35, 6.8 or 22 W/m2 (corresponding to whole body SARs fo r adult mice of 0.08, 0.4 or 1.3 W/kg1). No significant changes were seen on testicular function or female fertility, rates of malformations and abnormalities or on earl y development of offspring. Exposure was associated with a trend towards lower food consumption in exposed males, possibly due to a decrease in metabolism caused by the ab s o r p t i o n o f R F e n e r g y . T h i s e f f e c t w a s independent of exposure level and occu rred in all four generations of mice. Discussion on developmental effects Animal studies allow the effects of long-term exposure to RF fields on testicular function and development to be examin ed in detail. Unlike the situation with humans, it is possible for animals to be expo sed to controlled and well-c haracterised fields without possible confounding from other RF sources in the environment. The timescale of in utero and post-natal development in rodents is also amenable to investigation in laboratory studies. Recent well-conducted studies indicate that long-term, repeated exposures to WCDMA and/or CD MA signals at whole body SARs of up to 4 W/kg are not associated with adverse effects on testicular function in rats. Such results are consistent with a number of other studies reporting a lack of effects in the ab sence of significant testicular heating. In contrast, one laboratory has reported that long-term, low-level exposure at 2.45 or 10 GHz may cause advers e effects in sperm through a field-induced increase in reactive oxygen species. Howeve r, these and similar studies are of modest size, and confirmatory studies with larger numbers of animals would be useful. For acute exposures, it is possible that the time of da y when exposure occurs could be a significant influence on outcome. Most recent studie s investigating effects on pregnancy outcome and development of the offspring have b een large and well conducted, and so can provide very useful information. These studies found that low level prenatal and early postnatal exposure to a variety of RF si gnals was not associat ed with any adverse outcome, although one study suggested early postnatal expo sure increased maturity in male rats, and another suggested long-term, low level exposure of rats may reduce survival. In addition, no significant effe cts were seen following almost continuous, lifetime exposure of mice over four generations. Conclusions on reproduction and developmental effects The previous SCENIHR Opinion concluded th at there were no adverse effects on reproduction and development from RF fiel ds at non-thermal exposure levels. The inclusion of more recent human and animal data does not change that assessment. Therefore, it is concluded that there is strong overall weight of evidence against an effect of low level RF fields on re production or development. 3.6.5. Conclusions on the health effects of exposure to RF fields Neoplastic diseases Overall, the epidemiological studies on RF EMF exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumours. Furthermore, they do not indi cate an increased risk for other cancers of the head and neck region. Some studies raised questions regarding an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma in heavy users of mobile phones. The results of cohort and incidence time trend studies do not support an increased risk for glioma while the possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open. Epidemiological studies do not indicate increased risk for other ma lignant diseases including childhood cancer. A considerable number of well-performed in vivo studies using a wide variety of animal models have been mostly negative in outcome. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 153 A large number of in vitro studies pertaining to genotoxic as well as non-genotoxic end- points have been published since the last Opin ion. In most of the studies, no effects of exposure at non-thermal levels were repo rted, although in some cases DNA strand breaks and mitotic spindle di sturbances were observed. Nervous system The earlier described evidence that RF exposu re may affect brain activities as reflected by EEG studies during wake and sleep is further substantiated by the more recent studies. With regard to these findings, studies which aim at investigating the role of pulse modulation and which use more experimental signals indicate that effects on the sleep EEG are neither restricted to NREM sleep (one study indicates effects also in REM sleep) nor to the spindle frequency range. It seems that depending on the EMF signal the theta and delta frequency range in NREM sleep can al so be affected. Furthermore, half of the experimental studies looking at the macrostructure of sleep (especially those with a longer duration of exposure) also found effects, which, however, are not consistent with regard to the affected sleep parameters. Therefore, given th e variety of a pplied fields, duration of exposure, number of considered leads, and statistical methods it is presently not possible to derive mo re firm conclusions. Symptoms Symptoms that are attributed by some peop le to RF EMF exposure can sometimes cause serious impairments to a person's quality of life. However, research conducted since the previous SCENIHR Opinion adds weight to the conclusion that RF EMF exposure is not causally linked to these symptoms. This applies to the general public, children and adolescents, and to people with idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF ). Recent meta-analyses of observational and provocation data support this conclusion. For symptoms triggered by short-term exposu re to RF fields (measured in minutes to hours), the consistent results from multiple double-blind experiments give a strong overall weight of evidence that such effects are not caused by RF exposure. For symptoms associated with longer-term ex posures (measured in days to months), the evidence from observational studies is broa dly consistent and weighs against a causal effect. However, it has gaps, most notably in terms of the objective monitoring of exposure. Other effects Human studies on neurological diseases an d symptoms show no clear effect, but the evidence is limited. Human studies on child development and behavioural problems suffer from conflicting results and methodological limitations. Therefore, the evidence of an effect is weak. Effects of exposure on foetuses from moth er's mobile phone use during pregnancy are not plausible owing to extrem ely low foetal exposure. Studies on male fertility are of poor quality and provide little evidence. 3.7. Health effects from IF fields 3.7.1. What was already known on this subject The previous Opinion outlined that \"very little research on IF in occupational settings or for the general public has been presente d since the previous Opinion, and no epidemiological studies have appeared. Conseque ntly, the data are still too limited for an appropriate risk assessment\". It was also recommended that research into health effects from IF fields should be given a priority. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 154 3.7.2. What has been achieved since then Despite the wide range of sources of IF MFs, there are still very few studies that address possible health effects of IF exposures. A case in point is that no epidemiological studies have been published since the last SCENIHR Opinion. The few relevant studies that have been identified include both in vivo and in vitro approaches. Weinberg et al. (2012) provided experimental data on PNS thresholds to oscillating magnetic field stimulation from 2 to 183 kHz in 26 adults human. It was found that for 0.4 T stimulations, the probability of sensation was markedly reduced at frequencies of 101 and 183 kHz when compared to the probabilit y of sensation at 2 and 25 kHz. This is of interest in designs of human and preclinical MRI systems. In line with studies performed mainly in th e 1990\u00b4s, possible teratological effects of 20 kHz, triangular shaped, MF were investigat ed on ICR mice foetuses (Lee et al. 2009). This signal is emitted by video display terminals and inconsistent effects of exposure on embryo development in several species have been documented (s ee Juutilainen 2005 for a review). The work by Lee et al. employed a 20 kHz vertical MF, 30 \u00b5T peak-to-peak, which was applied for 8 h per day from gest ational day 2.5 to 15.5 as whole-body exposure. This flux density was chosen since it is the occupational exposure limit for 20 kHz MF in Korea. Exposed and sham-exposed animals were placed during treatment in separate rooms. A background 60 Hz MF was re ported only for the exposure situation (ca 0.11 \u00b5T). Animals were sacrificed on gestation day 18, whereafter dams and foetuses were investigated for a number of end-points. No exposure-related effects were noted in the dams, including clinical signs, body weig ht and body weight gain. The foetuses were investigated for viability, malformations, weight and length, and gender. In addition, the investigation included observations of implantation end-points. In no single case, was any effect of exposure noted. This study ex tends the work by the same group where the effects of the 20 kHz signal at 6.25 \u00b5T peak intensity were investigated. That study also came out as negative, i.e. revealing no expo sure-related effects (K im et al. 2004). The relevance of these low MF exposure levels in studies on mice for the human situation is difficult to evaluate. A series of studies of IF exposure effects on embryonic development has been published by Nishimura and co-workers (Nishimura et al., 2009; 2011; 2012). Their work has its rationale in the increasing domestic use of induction ovens or cookers in Japan. Consequently, 20 and 60 kHz sinusoidal MF effe cts were investigated in these studies. In Nishimura et al. (2009) Whit e Leghorn chick embryos were exposed during the first 2, 7, or 11 days of embryogenesis. A 20 kHz ve rtical sinusoidal B-field (0.011, 0.11, or 1.10 mT by Merritt-like coils in true exposu re-sham experiments (blinded exposure and analysis conditions). The eggs were placed horizontally, and the calculated maximal E-field within the eggs was 1.8 V/m for the 1.1 mT exposure, which however does not reflect the true exposure of the embryo itself. No significant effects on any investigated parameter was seen after the experiments (per formed in triplicate), at any of the investigated flux densities. In addition, embryos treated with retinoic acid (a known teratogenic agent) responded as expected with embryonic death and developmental abnormalities in 40-60% of sham exposed embryos, which was similar to the outcome in the MF treated specimens. Th e same group employed Crl:CD(SD) rats in two subsequent studies, where effects of 20 kHz or 60 kHz MF (sine wave) on embryonic organogenesis (Nishimura et al. 2011) and fertility and ea rly embryogenesis (Nishimura et al. 2012). In the first of these studies, pr egnant rats were exposed to either a 20 kHz (0.2 mT rms) or 60 kHz (0.1 mT rms) vertical MF for 22 h/day (gestation day 7 to 17). The dams were sacrificed on day 20, wher eafter maternal toxicity, reproductive performance and prenatal mortality, litter viability, weight, and abnormalities were investigated. The experiments were performed twice for both types of MF. The occasional end-point differed between exposed and sham in single experiments, but this was not repeated. This includes a skelet al variation which was signific antly increased in one of the two 20 kHz experiments, and an increased foet us sex ratio (more females than males) in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 155 the second of the two 60 kHz experiments. No other end-points differed between foetuses from exposed or sham conditions. The most recent of the studies from this group (Nishimura et al. 2012) employed the same MF exposure, but with th e important difference that ex posure was confined to both male and female animals 14 days prior to and during mating. Pregnant females were furthermore exposed until gestation day 7 an d subsequently sacrificed. A large number of parameters regarding fertility, maternal and paternal toxicity, and early embryonic development were investigated. The only si gnificant differences between exposed and sham were seen in one of two 60 kHz experi ments, where the body weight in pregnant mice was lower in exposed animals. One grou p exposed to 20 kHz had lower body weight than their unexposed counterparts. However, no effects on reproductive outcome were documented in this study. Three in vitro studies emanating from concern for ne gative health effe cts from exposure to IF of the type coming from induction hobs were published in the investigated period. The first study exposed cultured hamster CHO- K1 cells to a 23 kHz MF (6.05 mT rms; 2 h) and investigated genotoxicity (cell growth; comet assay - bot formation; HPRT gene mutation ) (Sakurai et al. 2009). Cells were seeded, cultured for 16 h, and exposed to MF, sham or an appropriate positive control for 2 h, followed by further culture for up to 5 days. The MF exposure did not cause any different effects than sham exposure, whereas the positi ve controls gave expected results. Stress responses (expression levels of hsp27, hsp 70, hsp105, phosphorylation of hsp27 and its nuclear translocation) were investigated in A172 human glioblastoma cells. Here, heat treatment (42.5 or 43 oC) served as positive control. No MF exposure-related effects were seen. In subsequent studies, the same group investigated a more su btle end-point, i.e. global gene expression. A human astroglia cell line was used and exposed to the 23 kHz field, but at 100 \u00b5T rms (2, 4, or 6 h) after which cell cycle analysis and microarray analysis of gene expression was performed. Results were compared to the positive control (heat 43 oC, 2 h). No effects from exposure on either cell cycle distribution or gene expression were seen (Sakurai et al. 2012). Moreover, an absence of alteration in gene expression profile of human-foetus- derived astroglial cell s (SVGp12) exposed to a magnetic field at 23 kHz for 2, 4 and 6 h (2 mT rms) wa s also reported (S akurai et al., 2013). In view of the expected increa se of occupational exposure to IF, studies on biomarkers and health outcomes in workers, which are based on reasonably sized groups with well- characterized exposure, would be inform ative. This could be supplemented with experimental studies. 3.7.3. Conclusions on health effects from IF fields There are few new studies on health effects from IF expo sures in general, and no epidemiological studies have been conducted in particular. Some in vivo studies report on the absence of effects on reproduction and de velopment of IF fields up to 0.2 mT in a frequency range of 20-60 kHz. As in the previous SCENIHR Opinion, there are still too few studies available, and furthermore no epidemiological studies have been conducted. In view of the expected increase of occupational exposure to IF, st udies on biomarkers an d health outcomes in workers are recommended. This could be su pplemented with experi mental studies. 3.8. Health effects from ELF fields 3.8.1. Neoplastic diseases 3.8.1.1. Epidemiological studies What was already known on this subject? Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 156 The previous SCENIHR statement endorsed the IARC assessment of classifying ELF magnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans due to consistently observed increased childhood leukaemia risk in epidemiological studies (SCENIHR, 2009); the latter stems mainly from two pooled analys es based on studies completed before the year 2000, showing a two-fold ri sk increase with ELF magnet ic fields above 0.3-0.4 \u00b5T (time-weighted average) but raising concer ns about shortcomings of those studies preventing a causal interpretation (A hlbom et al., 2000; Greenland et al., 2000). What has been achieved since then? Childhood cancers Several studies on childhood cancers were comp leted later and not included in the pooled analyses by Ahlbom et al. (2000) or Greenland et al. (2000), some of them reviewed in the SCENIHR 2009 statement, but another pooled analysis of the more recent studies became just available in 2010 (Kheifets et al ., 2010a). Of the included studies in the new pooled analysis, four were conducted in Europe (Germany, UK, 2 from Italy), and one each was conducted in Japan, Brazil and Australia. There were a total of 10,865 cases and 12,853 controls; however, total numbers in the high-exposure categories were small, even for this large data set. In the pooled analysis , combined ORs increased with increasing exposure, with non-significant ORs for exposure categories of 0.1-0.2 \u00b5T, 0.2-0.3 \u00b5T and 0.3+ \u00b5T, compared being 1.07 (CI 0.81-1.41), 1.16 (CI 0.69-1.93) and 1.44 (CI 0.88-2.36), respective ly. For 0.4+ \u00b5T compared <0.1 \u00b5T, the combined OR was 1.46 (CI 0.80 -2.68). Th e combined OR increased when Brazil was omitted and was 2.02 (CI 0.87-4.69) for 0.4+ \u00b5T, very similar to the doubling in risk in the pooled analysis of earlier studies (Ahl bom et al., 2000). No ot her individual study made such an impact on th e overall result; the concern about the Brazilian study was their choice of controls. Indivi dual studies used in the pooled analysis but not in the last SCENIHR statement were the ones from the UK (Kroll et al., 2010), Brazil (W\u00fcnsch-Filho et al., 2011), and one of the two from Italy (Malagoli et al., 2010). A study in the US (California) was published after the conduct of the new pooled analysis, with indoor and outdoor contact voltage and ELF magnetic field measurements collected for 245 cases and 269 controls (Does et al., 2011). For magnet ic fields, no associ ation with childhood leukaemia risk was seen (> 0.20 \u00b5T: OR= 0.76, CI: 0.30-1.93). In addition, no statistically significant associ ations were seen between child hood leukaemia and elevated indoor contact voltage levels (OR= 0.83, CI: 0.45-1.54) or elevated outdoor contact voltage levels (OR= 0.89, CI: 0.48-1.63), providing little evidence that contact currents represent a plausible mechanism to explain the association between ELF exposure and childhood leukaemia risk. There was also some renewed interest in investigating childhood leukaemia risk in relation to dist ance to the closest high-voltage power line, which may be interpreted as a proxy of expo s u r e t o m a g n e t i c f i elds, although with several limitations (Maslanyj et al., 2009). In a study in France involving 2779 cases and 30,000 population controls, the OR living wi thin 50 m of a 225-400 kV power line was 1.7 (CI: 0.9-3.6) (Sermage-Faure et al., 2013); there was no association beyond this distance. Pedersen et al. (2014a), using 1698 cases and 3396 controls in a case-control study in Denmark, found no association living within 200 m of a nearby high-voltage (132-400 kV) power line (OR 0.76; CI: 0.40-1. 45). The same group also reported that while there was no interaction between dist ance to power line and exposure to air pollution, there was one with radon exposure , albeit based on very small numbers and possibly a chance finding (Ped ersen et al., 2014b). In the UK, based on 16,630 cases diagnosed between 1962-2008 and 20,429 controls , no association was seen within the 200 m corridor to the nearest high-voltage (275- 400 kV) power line, with an OR of 1.00 (CI: 0.75-1.34) (Bunch et al., 2014). There were also no associat ions with any other cancers. Kheifets et al. (2010b) carried out a pooled anal ysis of studies on ELF magnetic fields and risk of childhood brain tumour s following the analytical appr oach of the pooled analyses for childhood leukaemia described above, including 10 individual epidemiological studies. The ORs for childhood brain tumours compared to a reference category of up to 0.1 \u00b5T Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 157 were 0.95 (CI: 0.65-1.41), 0.70 (CI: \u00b5T. A Japanese study (Saito et al., 2010) reported a very high OR with wide CI for exposures of 0.4+ \u00b5T (10.9, CI: 1.05-113) based on 3 cases, but was included in the pooled analysis finding no effect. A population-based case-control study in Germany investigated if children whose parents were exposed preconceptionally at work to EL F magnetic fields had an increased risk of developing cancer (Hug et al., 2009). The an alysis included 2,382 controls and 2,049 cases (among them 846 children with acut e leukaemia and 444 children with central nervous system tumours). No increased canc er risks in children whose fathers were occupationally exposed to ELF magnetic fiel ds above 0.2 \u00b5T, or even above 1 \u00b5T were observed. In a meta-analysis provided in this paper combining all previous studies on this topic for leukaemia, a pooled risk esti mate of 1.35 (CI: 0.95-1.91) was observed; given the high degree of hete rogeneity in the reported re sults and the suggestion of publication bias as identifi ed by this meta-analysis. Other uncertainties that may influence the differences between studies in clude selection bias and information bias. According to the authors, their quantitati ve summarization has, therefore, to be interpreted with caution. In an Australian case-control study on ch ildhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia published later than this meta-analysis, 379 case an d 854 control mothers and 328 case and 748 control fathers completed an occupational hi story questionnaire (Reid et al., 2011). There was no association between maternal (OR=0. 96; CI: 0.74-1.25) or paternal (OR=0.78; CI: 0.56-1.09) exposure to ELF any time before the birth and risk of leukaemia. In a UK register-based case-control study includin g for other leukaemias; ex posure was based on an assessment of occupational groups by an occupational hygienist (Keegan et al. 2012). Maternal ELF exposure and risk of childhood brain tumour s was addressed in a Canadian case-control study (Li et al., 2009). A total of 548 incide nt cases and 760 healthy controls were included in this study and quantitative occupational ELF exposure in \u00b5T units was estimated using individual exposure estimati ons or a job exposure matrix. Using the average exposure metric measured before co nception, an increased risk was observed for astroglial tumours (OR=1.5, CI: 1.0-2.4). During the entire pregnancy period, a significantly increased risk was observed for astroglial tumours as well as for all childhood brain tumours and significantly in creased risks were specifically observed among sewing machine operators. Under the hypothesis that ELF magnetic fields may promote growth of leukaemia cells, investigators have studied the relationship with length of remission and overall survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemi a (ALL). Previous studies in the US and Germany reported poorer surviv al in children with ALL expo sed to ELF magnetic fields above 0.2/0.3+ \u00b5T, but the number of ex posed children was small (SCENIHR, 2009). A pooling study reported results obtained from over 3000 children with ALL with ELF magnetic field exposure data from Canada , Denmark, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, who were followed for up for 10 years fo r relapse, second neoplasm, and survival (Sch\u00fcz et al., 2012). The hazard ratios by 0.1 \u00b5T increases were 1.00 (CI: 0.93-1.07) for event-free survival analysis and 1.04 (CI: 0.97-1.11) for overall survival. ALL cases exposed to 0.3+ \u00b5T did not have an increased risk of relapse or of dying, with hazard ratios of 0.76 (CI: 0.44-1.33) for event-fr ee survival and of 0.96 (CI: 0.49-1.89) for overall survival (Sch\u00fcz et al. 2012). There is little new data available on the a ssociation between quanti tatively assessed ELF magnetic fields and the risk of childhood leukaemia; meta-analysis of studies published 2000-2009, however, confirms an approximatel y two-fold increased risk at average magnetic field levels above 0.3/0.4 \u00b5T. Conc erns remain that the association may be or even entirely expl ained by methodological shortc omings of the epidemiological studies. A large study on ELF magnetic field exposure and survival after childhood leukaemia did not provide support for an effect on the leukaemia prognosis. No Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 158 association has been observed for the risk of childhood brain tumours. The possible association between preconceptional parental occupational exposure to ELF magnetic fields and risk of cancer in their offspring has also been st udied, but most studies provide no support for an effect of ELF magnetic fi elds. In conclusion, the new epidemiological data do not alter the assessment that EL F magnetic field exposure is a possible carcinogen based on the reported asso ciation with childhood leukaemia risk. Adult cancers Elliott et al. (2013) co nducted a register-based case-con trol study on adult cancers in relation to distance from high-voltage power lines in England and Wales. They compared 7823 leukaemia cases, 6781 brain and centra l nervous system tumour cases, 9153 malignant melanoma cases, and 29,202 female breast cancer cases with a control group consisting of other cancers (n=79,507). For distances closest to the power lines, ORs ranged from 0.82 (CI: 0.61-1.11) for melano ma to 1.22 (CI: 0.88-1.69) for brain and central nervous system tumours, hence, provid ing no evidence of an association. They also estimated the magnetic field strength in relation to the power lines, and for calculated fields exceeding 1 \u00b5T compared to <0.1 \u00b5T, ORs ranged from 1.17) for melanoma to 1.08 (CI: 0.77-1.51) fo r female breast cancer, again showing no evidence of any association. Albeit the large study sample, one caveat is that the control group is also patients with cancer, assuming that those ca ncers included in that group were not related to magnetic field exposure. Adult cancers were also investigated in a large number of studies in occupational settings, reviewed in IARC (IARC, 2002). Th e vast majority howe ver lacks individual quantitative exposure assessm ent, and no consistent picture emerges. More recently, job-exposure-matrices (JEM) were construc ted to better inform about exposure, and applying such a JEM to a multinational case -control study on brain tumours (subset of the Interphone study (Interphone, 2010)) showed no overall association between cumulative exposure to ELF (in \u00b5T-years), with ORs of 0.80 for glioma and meningioma, respectively, in the highest exposure category (Turner et al., 2014). Fo r the shortest latency of 1-4 years, however, the OR for glioma was statistically significant elevat ed (OR 1.67, CI: 1.36-2.07), raising the question of an effect of ELF on tumour prom otion. In a previous case-control study in France (Baldi et al., 2011), an association with ELF exposu res was seen for meningioma, both occupational and reside ntial (OR tional ELF MF exposure). Discussion on epidemiological studies Pooled analyses of the more recent stud ies on ELF magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia confirm those of earlier studies, however, the new generation of studies shows little methodological advancement compar ed to the ones conducted before 2000. Therefore it remains difficult to judge whether the appare ntly quite robust empirical association is likely to be causal or a result of methodological shor tcomings of the studies such as information bias, selection bias an d confounding. In part icular, low response rates among controls remain a concern. Identi fication of alternativ e explanations made little progress as well as finding further evidence for biological plausibility. In particular, a large study investigating childhood leukaemia survival in relation to ELF magnetic field exposure did not observe an association, addi ng no support to the hypothesis that ELF magnetic field may promote pre-leukemic clones both related to the risk of developing leukaemia as well as the risk of a relaps e of leukaemia after successful treatment. Studies on other childhood cancers or adult cancers show no consistent associations. It is important to note a common misunderstanding when interpreting the \u00b5T exposure levels used in the epidemiological studies. In all the childhood cancer studies mentioned above, the \u00b5T levels reflect average exposure measured over longer durations of up to several days, but not instantaneous exposure. Conclusions on epidemiological studies Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 159 The previous assessment of the 2009 SCEN IHR Opinion on a possible association between long-term exposure to ELF magnetic fields and an increase d risk of childhood leukaemia remains valid. A positive association has been observed in multiple studies in different settings at different points in time. Little progress has been made in explaining the finding, neither in terms of a plausible mechanism for a causal relationship with magnetic field nor in identifying alternative explanations. 3.8.1.2. In vivo studies What was known on this subject? Overall, most animal studies do not suggest that magnetic fields can cause tumours or enhance the growth of implanted tumours. Nevertheless, one group has published several studies showing accelerated deve lopment of chemically-induced mammary tumours in Sprague-Dawley rats. The previous Opinion described a further study from that group showing comparable effects in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Also described was a study using Wister rats that reported cytoge netic changes in bone marrow cells following long-term exposure to magnetic fields at 1 mT. What has been achieved since then? Previously, L\u00f6scher and co-workers have repo rted that rat (sub-) st rains show different sensitivities to the effects of magnetic fiel ds on the development of mammary tumours, and they suggested that genetic background plays a pivotal role in these responses. Fedrowitz and L\u00f6scher (2012) have explored th is further, by comparing gene expression in the mammary glands of female F344 rats (which are considered to be a magnetic field-susceptible strain) and female Lewis rats (which are considered to be non- susceptible). Following continuous exposure to a horizontally-polarised, 50 Hz magnetic field at 100 \u00b5T for 14 days, the RNA samples from the mammary glands of 5 animals in each treatment group were pooled and analys ed using a whole genome microarray. Only fold changes of 2.5 or more were considered of significance. Overall, the expression of 21 transcripts was found to be regulated by expo sure: 9 were increased in Lewis rats, while 8 were increased and 6 decreased in F344 rats . Of these the most striking were the 832- fold decrease in -amylase, 662-fold decrease in parotid secretory protein and 39-fold decrease in carbonic anhydrase 6 expression found in F344, but no t in Lewis rats. The precise role of these transcripts in mammary tissues is largely unknown. Fedrowitz et al. (2013) described a series of animal experiments performed over a four year period in which the activity and expression of -amylase protein were determined in mammary tissues following exposure to 50 Hz magnetic fields at 100 \u00b5T for up to 28 days. For this analysis, the mammary glan ds were dissected into two samples, the cranial and caudal gland complexes. The first set of experiments found that exposure for 14 and 28 days resulted in a significant increase in amylase activity in the cranial mammary gland complex but not in the caudal complex in F344 rats. A significant increase was also seen in Lewis rats expo sed for 14 days, but only in the cranial complex. A second experiment did not replicate these effects, and found that 14-day exposure of F344 rats resulted in no change in amylase activity in the cranial complex of F334 rats, and a significant increa se in the activity in the ca udal complex. For Lewis rats, exposure resulted in no changes in eith er gland complex. Protein expression of - amylase, measured in one of these experiments, was signific antly elevated in the caudal but not the cranial complex. These differences in activity between sets of experiments could not be explained, alth ough it was noted that magnetic fields had increased - amylase activity in both, not decreased it. In another set of experiments, no changes were found on -amylase enzyme activity in serum of F344 rats following magnetic field exposures of 1, 7 or 14 days compared to sh am-exposed controls. It was concluded that -amylase might be a possible biomarker for ma gnetic fields effect s , a l t h o u g h i t w a s acknowledged that it would be a difficult marker to use in animals because of its sensitivity to stress. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 160 A few studies have used circularly polarised fi elds that are similar to the fields produced in the environment by some types of ov erhead powerlines. Negishi et al. (2008) investigated the effects of lo ng-term exposure to magnetic fields on the incidence of chemically-induced malignant lymphoma/lymphat ic leukaemia in mice. CD-1 mice were injected with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (60 \u00b5g/mouse) within 24 h of birth, and at 4 weeks of age were randomly allocated to a treatment group (each consisting of 50 males and 50 females). Animals were exposed in a dedicated exposure facility to 50 Hz, circularly polarized fields fo r 22 h/day, 7 days/week for 30 weeks at 7, 70 or 350 \u00b5T, and another group was sham exposed. The anim als were checked daily for behaviour and clinical signs of morbidity, and any animal that died during exposure underwent an extensive histopathological examination, as did the remaining animals at the end of the exposure period. The experime nt was repeated twice. For both experiments, whether examined separately or pool ed, the cumulative proporti ons of exposed mice with malignant lymphoma/lymphatic leukaemia were not significantly different from those in the sham exposed groups, indicating that ma gnetic fields had not promoted chemically- induced lymphoma/leukaemia. Two studies from the same laboratory report that long-term exposure of rodents to 60 Hz circularly polarised magnetic fields has no significant co-p romoting on either chemically-induced tumours or spontaneous tumours in predisposed animals. In the first study, Chung et al. (2008) treated pregnant F334 rats on day 18 of gestation with ethylnitrosourea (ENU) (10 mg/kg) to induce brain tumours in the offspring. These animals were exposed to magnetic fields of up to 500 \u00b5T from age of 4 weeks for 21 h/day for up to 38 weeks. No consistent fiel d-dependent changes were seen on survival rate, body weight, or haematology and no si gnificant differences in tumour incidence were seen between the sham-exposed group and the 3 exposed groups. In the second study, Chung et al. (2010) exposed female AKR mice to magnetic fields of up to 500 \u00b5T for 21 h/day from 4-6 weeks of age for up to 42 weeks. Exposure was without consistent effect on any of the measured outcomes, in cluding mean survival time, body weight, micronucleus assay, haematology values, or lymphoma incidence. Sporadic positive effects were noted in both studies but these we re discounted due to a lack consistency. Bernard et al. (2008) investigated the effect s of 50 Hz magnetic fields on leukaemia using an animal model of childhood B-acut e lymphoblastic leukaemia. Beginning when they were 3 months old, male WKAH/Hkm ra ts were given n-butylnitrosourea (BNU) in their drinking water 5 days a week for 24 w eeks to initiate leukaemia. Animals were exposed in four replicate experiments to 50 Hz magnetic fields, bo th without and with harmonics at 150, 250 and 350 Hz, at 100 \u00b5T for 18 h /day, 7 days/week for 52 weeks. Another group of animals used a posi tive control were pre-treated with radiation before BNU treatment. To detect leukaemia, a range of haematological parameters and differential blood cell counts were measured , and immunophenotypin g was performed to define the leukaemia phenotyp e . I t w a s f o u n d t h a t e x p o s u r e b o t h w i t h a n d w i t h o u t harmonics had no effect on any of the othe r measured parameters, including survival, loss of body weight, cumulative incidence or type of leukaemia, bu t significant changes were obtained in the positive control group. In order to gain insight into potential mech anisms whereby magnetic fields could affect the development of childhood le ukaemia, Kabacik et al. (2013) investigated the effects of exposure to magnetic fields on bone ma rrow in young mice using three sensitive transcription methods. Juvenile animals ( 21 day old) were exposed for 2 h to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 100 \u00b5T and changes in gene expression in bone marrow were assayed 4 h after exposure using High Coverage Expre ssion Profiling (HiCEP), Illumina arrays or quantitative real-time polymerase chain re action (QRT-PCR). Four transcripts were identified using HiCEP as showing significan tly different expression between exposed and sham-exposed mice: two of these (AK1575 20 and F10-NED) had no known function although one (Picalm) may be rearranged in human lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia. However, these differences were not confir med using two different QRT-PCR assays or the microarrays, and it was concluded that no robust field-depend ent changes had been seen. The authors commented on the difficulties of demonstrating small changes in gene Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 161 expression that may occur following in vivo exposure to magnetic fields that are due to inherent variability of biological responses and the technical limitations in the sensitivity of existing technologies. Rageh et al. (2012) also investigated potent ial mechanisms into increased cancer risk and reported that continuous, sub-chronic ex p o s u r e o f y o u n g r a t s t o 5 0 H z m a g n e t i c fields could induce genotoxic and cytogenetic changes. In th is study, rats were exposed at 0.5 mT using a solenoid-based exposure system for 30 days beginning when they were 10 days old. It was found that expo sure significantly increased DNA damage in brain cells as measured by al kaline single cell gel electr ophoresis and also increased micronucleus induction as measured numbers of polychromatic erythrocytes and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow. In addition, the mitotic index of bone marrow cells was increased, as were the levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase in brain cells suggesting exposure had increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Discussion on in vivo studies Motivated by the observed increased leukaemi a risk in children, experimental studies have investigated the carcinogenic potentia l of magnetic fields using animals. These studies have tended to use traditional rodent models and do not support the epidemiological findings. However, these experimental studies suffer from a number of limitations (Lagroye et al., 2011) . Firstly, the absence of appropriate animal models for childhood leukaemia is of concern. Most stud ies have not used directly relevant models, although one recent study did use a rat mode l of B-cell acute ly mphoblastic leukaemia and this did not find any fiel d-dependent effects on leukae mia. However, mouse models of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are now beco ming available, such as the ETV6-RUNX1 (TEL-AML1) model (e.g. Schlin dler et al., 2009; van der Weyden et al., 2011) and it is expected that improved models should become accessible in the near future (Ziegelberger et al., 2011). Studies with these models should be a research priority. In addition, few studies ha ve also been carried out with ex posures during gestation, when the initial events are considered to occur in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, so future studies should include this possi bility. Further, it is possible that the exposure conditions used in experimental studies were far from optimal to reveal effects, because the biologically-relevant factor(s) no t been identified, although ma ny studies have used fields well in excess of values commonly found in the everyday environment. Finally, the possibility of strain-specific increases in sensitivity to magnetic fields is intriguing, and could lead to the identification of biomarkers, and this should be investigated further. All experiments should be of suffici ent size and sensitivity to adequately detect an effect of a predefined size to avoid the possibility of type II errors. Conclusions on in vivo studies Previously SCENIHR (2009) conc luded that animal studies di d not provide evidence that exposure to magnetic fields alone caused tumours or enhanc ed the growth of implanted tumours. The inclusion of more recent st udies does not alter that assessment. In addition, these studies do not provide furthe r insight into how magnetic fields could contribute to an increased risk of childhood leukaemia. 3.8.1.3. In vitro studies What was already known on this subject? The previous SCENIHR Opinion observed that some studies indicated that ELF magnetic fields alone and in combination with carc inogens induce both genotoxic and other biological effects in vitro at flux densities of 100 T and higher. It was further noted that there is a need for independent replication of certain studies suggest ing genotoxic effects and for better understanding of combined effects of ELF magnetic fields with other agents and their effects on free radical homeostasis. What has been achieved since then? Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 162 In vitro studies may be relevant for assessment of ELF MF effects on neoplastic diseases, depending on the cell type used, endpoints investigated, and th e exposure. Although there are a substantial number of in vitro studies published in the scientific literature, only a fraction is relevant for the present Opinion. Relevant study endpoints include genotoxicity (genetic damage), cell prol iferation, cell surv ival and death, cell differentiation and transformation, signal transduction events, acute effects on ion homeostasis (especially Ca2+), and radical ho meostasis. Not all of these endpoints are represented in the literature that wa s used for the present assessment. Vijayalaxmi and Prihoda (2009) published a meta-analysis on genetic damage in mammalian somatic cells expose d t o E L F M F . T h e i r a n a l y s i s i n c l u d e d d a t a f r o m 8 7 separate original publications (from 1999-2007). The studies included in vitro as well as in vivo animal studies, and also data from hum an occupational stud ies. Since all data were pooled in the paper, it is not possible to specifically analyse the contributions from in vitro studies to the meta-analysis, but the author\u00b4s descriptions of the material suggest that the majority of the studies were in vitro studies. The meta-analysis considered the ELF MF-related exposure ch aracteristics (frequen cy, flux density, occupational exposure) exchanges). The most commonly employed frequency was 50 Hz and fields with a flux density of 1 mT were predominantly used in the studies. Most of the studies investigated only one endpoint. The meta-analysis revealed that a small but statistically significant difference was present between MF-exposed and control cells, with an increase in genetic damage at certain exposure conditions. Mean indices for chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei for both exposed and control cell s were similar to the levels seen in a historical database. The authors also concluded that publication bias (underrepo rting of negative findings) was evident in the studied material. A study by Kim et al. (2010) documented th at an early marker of DNA double-strand breaks (phosphorylated H2AX) and the down-s tream effector Chk2 (checkpoint for DNA damage during progression of the cell cycle) both were induced by a 30-min exposure to a 60 Hz MF (6 mT) in human IMR90 lung fibrob lasts and HeLa cells. A repeated exposure (30 min during each of three consecutive days) also led to induction of apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) in both cell types. The study lacks a proper sham exposure and other essential information regarding exposure is lacking. Significantly better described is the study from Focke et al. (2010) where they replicated an earlier study by Ivancsits et al. (2003). The main finding in the older stud y was that intermittent exposure to 50 Hz MF increased DNA strand breaks in primar y human fibroblasts. Focke and co-workers used the alkaline Comet assay to detect DNA strand breaks in normal human fibroblasts from three different donors and in HeLa cells. Exposure consisted of a 50 Hz MF (1 mT) for 15 h. Importantly, the exposure was either continuous for 15 h, or intermittent (5 min on, 10 min off) during the 15 h period. A small but statistically significant increase in DNA damage was seen after the intermittent exposure, but only in the fibroblasts. Furthermore, the authors provid e evidence that suggests that the effect is from the MF, and not from any induced E-fiel d. In addition, the response to MF was different than the one obtained after H2O2 treatment, suggesting that the primary effect on DNA is not coming from increased levels of oxygen radica l species. The study also indicates that the noted DNA damage is due to an MF-dependent induction of apoptosis in a subpopulation of cells. These recent studies on genotoxi city suggest that exposures to ELF MF at 1 mT or higher exert at least modest DNA-damaging activity in cultured human cells. A series of studies regarding effects of weak 50 Hz MF on proliferation have recently been published by a Spanish group. Thus, Trillo et al. (2012) studied proliferation, DNA synthesis and DNA and protein content in tw o human cell lines (neuroblastoma NB69 and hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells) exposed to a ve rtical 50 Hz MF. Exposu re was intermittent (3 h on and 3 h off) for 42 h, in the presence or absence of all-trans-retinol. MF alone (0.10 mT) enhanced proliferation in both ce ll lines, whereas MF and retinol together Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 163 caused different (opposing) effe cts in the two cell lines. Th e authors followed up this study in 2013 (Trillo et al. 2013) where prol iferation and proliferation markers were investigated in the NB69 ce lls. The previous effects of a 0.10 mT MF exposure (intermittent; 3 h on and 3 h off; 42 h) were confirmed. Also a weaker MF (0.01 mT) caused similar responses on cell number (increase 12.5 and 14.8 % compared to sham controls for 0.01 and 0.10 mT respectively). The MF effects were again counteracted by retinol addition. The importance of intermittency for proliferation effects in this cell line was documented in another study (Martine z et al. 2012). The NB69 cells were here exposed for 63 h to a 0.10 mT MF, either continuously or intermittently (5 min on and 10 min off; or 3 h on and 3 h off). Only intermittent exposure caused significant increases (10-15% increase compared to sham control) in percent of cells in th e S-phase of the cell cycle and increased cell numbe r. Finally, the group also published a study where the effects of a 0.01 mT MF (intermittent exposure ; 3 h on and 3 h off; 24, 42, or 90 h) on proliferation in HepG2 cells were investigated. Also this lower flux density increased proliferation, and decreased levels of differe ntiation markers. However, the MF effects were prevented by melatonin in physiological concentrations (10 nM). In summary, the studies from this group have documented proliferation stimulating effects of intermittent, but not continuous, ex posure to 50 Hz MF at low flux densities (0.01 and 0.10 mT respectively). Another proliferation related study has been published by Basile et al. (2011), who found that a 50 Hz MF (30 A/m; no flux density value was given) for 6 h did not influence ROS levels, hsp70 protein levels, or apoptosis, but did increase the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BAG in two human melanoma cell lines. Zhang and co-workers also evaluate the effect of MF exposure on cell proliferation and phenotype. They exposed human epidermal stem cells (hESC) to a 5 mT at 1, 10, and 50 Hz for 30 min/day for 3, 5, or 7 days. At the th ird, fifth, and seventh day of exposure cell proliferation resulted significantly enhanced in a frequency-dependent manner, with the highest cell proliferation rate at 50 Hz. Su ch an increase was due to an increased percentage of cells in the S ph ase of the cell cycle, with a de crease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase, examined seven days after exposure by flow cytometry. Moreover, 7 days exposure did not modify cell morp hology and cell-surface antigens, suggesting lack of effects on cell phenotype (Zhang et al., 2013). Marcantonio et al. (2010) focused on all-trans-retinol-induced neuroblastoma BE(2) cells. Retinol treatment caused increased levels of several differentiation markers (neurite outgrowth; expression levels of the genes for p21, cdk5, cyp19). These effects were enhanced by simultaneous exposure to a 50 Hz MF (1.0 mT; 24-72 h). The MF exposure also caused a decrease in cell number, due to an increased proportion of the cells in the G0/G1 phase. The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 is a useful tool for investigation of carcinogenic effects of chemicals and physical agents sinc e a possible transformation of the cells cause an increase in colony formation, which ca n be quantified. Lee and co-authors (2011) exposed these cells to a 60 Hz MF (1.0 mT) fo r 4 h. MF exposure was either alone or in combination with ionizing radiation, H2O2, or c-Myc overexpression . The transformation potential of none of these agents was influenced by the MF exposure. The question of MF-effects on differentiation and gene expre ssion was also addressed by Sulpizio et al. (2011). The au thors exposed human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells for 5, 10, or 15 days to a 50 Hz, 1.0 mT sinusoidal MF. Besides analysis of cell number, viability and proliferation (which all increased in ex posed compared to control cells), the main endpoint was a proteome analysis. A number of common protein spots were found, of which 86 unique proteins were identified and classified. Proteins belonging to the group of cellular organization and proliferation, and the group of cellular defence mechanism underwent the largest changes (increase) in cells exposed for 15 days. Regarding individual proteins, 3 new pr oteins appeared in cells exposed for 10 days, and an additional 6 new proteins were detected in samples exposed for 15 days. These altogether 9 new proteins belong to the groups of cellular or ganization and proliferation, Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 164 and to cellular defence mechanism. The authors argue that the protein changes correspond to the changes in pr oliferative potential seen af ter exposure, and that this reflects a phenotypic shift towards a more undifferentiated state. The pineal hormone melatonin exerts anti-pro liferative effects on estradiol-stimulated breast cancer cells in vitro . This observation was previously used in several studies where the effect of weak sine-wave 50 or 60 Hz MF was investigated (see SCENIHR 2007, 2009). Even at very low flux densities (1.2 \u00b5T), it was shown that the melatonin- inhibition of proliferation was counteracted by MF exposure. Rece ntly, Girgert and co- workers (Girgert et al. 2009) have extended these studies. Here the authors employ a variant of MCF-7 breast cancer cells that ar e transfected with the gene for the melatonin- receptor MT1, and thus very sensitive to melatonin-treatment. In estradiol-treated cells, melatonin decreased binding of the transcription factor CREB to the promoter of BCRA-1, and also decreased mRNA levels of BCRA-1, p53, p21WAF and c-myc. Exposure to a 50 Hz MF (1.2 \u00b5T; various exposure time s dependent on end-point investigated) counteracted these melatonin-e ffects and also the proliferat ion inhibition exerted by melatonin. Thus in several studies, this group reported significant effects at flux density levels far below those used by most other authors. Discussion on in vitro studies In summary, a number of in vitro studies published over the past years are relevant for the question of ELF MF exposu re and neoplastic disease. However, the studies are too few and too scattered in scope and approach to provide any foundation for a conclusion on the possible neoplastic effects of ELF MF exposure. Furthermore, the studies do not provide any conclusions regarding mode of action for effects of ELF MF. However, some studies provide interesting findings that justify additional research efforts. Thus, there are indi cations that DNA damage occu rs in cultured human cells during certain exposure condit ions. Effects are primarily noted at a flux density of 1 mT or higher. Even at lower flux densities (0.10 mT and below), MF exposure has been shown to stimulate proliferation. The effect can possibly be related to effects on signal transduction and gene expression. An intriguing observation is that certai n studies report exposure effects due to intermittent, but not due to continuous ex posure. The area has not received much attention, but can be an opener of studies into mechanisms. Conclusions on in vitro studies As concluded in the previous SCENIHR Opinio n, data suggest that ELF MF may induce both genotoxic and other biological effects in vitro at flux densities of 100 T and higher. The mechanisms are not estab lished and the relevance for a connection between ELF MF exposure and childhood leukaemia is unclear. 3.8.1.4. Conclusions on neoplastic diseases The new epidemiological studies are consistent with earlier findings of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 \u00b5T. As stated in the previous Opinions, no mechanisms have been identified and no support is existing from experimental studies that could explain these findings, which, together with shortcomings of the epidemiological studies prevent a causal interpretation. 3.8.2. Nervous system effects and neurobehavioral disorders 3.8.2.1. Epidemiological studies What was already known on this subject? Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 165 The previous SCENHIR Opinion indicated a possible increase in Alzheimer's disease arising from exposure to ELF, stressing the need for further epidemiological and laboratory investigations. What has been achieved since then? A cohort study found no indication of an in creased mortality from motor neuron disease related to employment in electronic work (Parlett et al. 2011). The U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Survey with 300,000 pe ople followed up from the early 1980's was analysed. Exposure assessment reli ed on job titles at baseline, with further classification based on a previously constructed job-exposu re matrix. Causes of death were obtained from the National Death Index. Information on several potential confounders including race/ethnicity, education and in come was available. Despite th e large cohort size, only 40 deaths from motoneuron diseas e occurred during an average of 8.8 years of follow-up. The crude hazard ratio was somewhat above uni ty, but after adjustment it indicated no excess among the quartile of population with the highest potential for ELF exposure (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.39-2.50). No gradient acro ss exposure strata was found. The study was limited by the relatively crude exposure as sessment, and low statistical power due to small number of events. A Danish registry-based ca se-control showed no asso ciation between residential exposure to power lines and ri sk of Alzheimer or Parkinso n disease (Frei, et al. 2013). The cases (nearly 2000 with motor neuron di sease, 8000 with multiple sclerosis, 16,000 with Parkinson disease and 20,00 0 with Alzheimer) were iden tified from the nationwide hospital discharge registry and matched contro ls population registry . Residential history was constructed for the past 20 years and di stance from high-voltage power lines was calculated using geographical information system for about 90% of the subjects. Information was also available on marital stat us, education and income (the latter two at small area unit level). No indication of increased risks were found for ever having lived <50 m from a high-voltage power line, nor for duration of such resi dency. Only in a sub- group analysis of Alzheimer disease in th e age group 65-74 years, an association was reported (HR 1.92, 96% CI 0.95-3.87). The re sults did not confirm the findings of the Swiss cohort study reporting increased risk s of Alzheimer disease for living 15 years within 50 m of a power line. A meta-analysis of 17 studies on occupati onal ELF exposure and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis found some evidence for an increase d risk, but the findings were not consistent and indications of publication bias were detected (Zhou et al. 2012). The summary analysis showed elevated risk in case-control studies (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05-1.84), but not cohort studies (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.80-1.69) . Similarly, increase d risk was indicated in studies using clinical diagnosis of ALS, but not in those relying on death certificates. Asymmetric funnel plots and Egger's test indicated an excess of small studies with increased risks, suggesting pu blication bias. The Swedish tw in study with 216 cases (2/3 classified as Alzheimer's di sease) showed elevated risk s for occupational exposures exceeding 0.12 \u00b5T only for the subgroups with age of onset less or equal to 75 years and for manual workers but not the entire st udy population (Andel et al., 2010). Furthermore, there was no exposure-effect gradient, i. e. the findings suggest a protective effect of low exposure. A meta-analysis covered 42 studies on occupa tional ELF exposure and neurodegenerative disease (Vergara JOEM 2013). Only PubMed wa s searched, no other databases and only publications in English language were included. Of the 27 case-control and 15 cohort studies, only three employed measurements of ELF, five used classification by an industrial hygienist and 14 JEM or similar exposure tabulati ons. Twelve of the studies reported selectively only some of the fi ndings. Total number of cases for various outcomes was not reported. Overall, occu pational ELF showed associations with motoneuron disease and Alzh eimer's disease (pooled summary ORs 1.26-1.27), but not with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis o r a l l d e m e n t i a s . Studies with disease prevalence as outcome showed stronger associ ations than those addressing incidence or mortality. Mortality studies showed also significant though smaller associations, while Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 166 incidence studies showed no excess risk of AD and a non-significant increase in MND. Studies with assessment of level of ELF exposu re showed less evidence of an effect than those relying on job titles alone for motoneur on disease, while for Alzheimer's disease no such difference was observed. The few studie s with measured ELF fields showed some elevation in risk for both AD and MND, though not significant. In multiple metaregression, only prevalence studies show ed significant association after adjustment for various study features (e xposure assessment, source of outcome data, selective reporting, source of funding). There was evid ence of selection bias with smaller studies showing larger effects, in particular for Al zheimer's disease. The authors interpreted the findings providing only limited support for an association of ELF with neurodegenerative diseases. The results were not consistent and some effect of publication bias was shown. In most analyses, studies with the most robu st features of design or conduct did not show more evidence of effect than less reliable studies. Ov erall, there seemed to be more evidence for an association of ELF wi th AD than MND (cohort studies, studies without indication of selective reporting and st udies assessing level of ELF), but this could be partly attributable to publication bias. Even if they do not provide definitive evidence, the findings by no means demonstrate the lack of an association. A case-control study assessed the relationsh ip between occupational ELF exposure and cognitive dysfunction (Dav anipour et al. 2014). The subjects were 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 or older interviewed in th eir homes in five US states in 1993-1994 as the baseline survey of H-EPES E study. Mini-Mental state ex am was used to evaluate cognitive performance, with sco re <10 classified as severe cognitive dysfunction. This resulted in low prevalence of dementia (1.6 %). Exposure was assess ed based on a single job title only, no occupational histories were available. Also, any job title could be reported, as it was not defined as the most re cent or the longest held occupation. Five occupations were classified as involving high exposure (ave rage >10 mG or peak >100 mG, 3.5% of the subjects), but practically a ll subjects in the high exposure group were seamstresses (87 out of 105) or welders (14 subjects). The prevalence of severe cogn itive dysfunction was 2% in the low exposure group, 1% in the intermediate and 5% in the high exposure group. The crude odds ratio for dementia related to high occupational exposure was 3.4 (95% CI 1.3- 8.9). The results were based on five exposed cases only in the \"high\" exposure category . No meaningful adjustment could be performed due to the small number of observations. No analyses were presented for mild or mode rate dementia. Different types of dementia (Alzheimer and vascular dementia) were not considered separately. No information was obtained on some risk factors and potentia l confounders such as family history of dementia, or medical history including diabet es, depression, choleste rol, blood pressure or obesity. Heavy alcohol use predisposes to dementia and the question regarding \"ever consumption\" of alcohol is unlikely to capture the relevant information. No association was found with education (<12 vs. 12 or more years), which is surprising. Conclusions on epidemiological studies Only few new studies have been published since the previous Opinion. Although the new studies in some cases have methodological weaknesses, they do not provide support for the previous conclusion that ELF MF exposure increases the risk for Alzheimer\u00b4s disease. 3.8.2.2. Neurophysiological studies What was already known on this subject? The previous Opinion summarizes from animal studies that there is some evidence for effects on the nervous system from ELF magn etic fields above about 0.1-1.0 mT. It is stated that there are still inconsistencies in the data, and no defini te conclusions can be drawn concerning human health effects. What has been achieved since then? Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 167 Since the last Opinion, 13 papers on effects of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MF) on human brain function (EEG, functional imaging and behavioural outcomes) have been published. Four of these studie s (Perentos et al. 2008, Shafiei et al. 2012, Amirifalah et al. 2013, Shafiei et al. 2014) were noted but not considered for the present Opinion due to insufficient information on exposure and/or dosimetry. Since mobile phones, in addition to RF, also emit ELF MF of varying spectra depending on the operating mode, several groups investigat ed effects of various real or simulated magnetic fields as generated by the circuitry of GSM handsets while transmitting. Schmid et al. (2012b) and Tommaso et al. (2009) inve stigated both RF and ELF effects on the sleep EEG and event related potentials duri ng wake, respectively (see 3.6.2.2). Here studies are reported in which only effects of ELF signals are studied. The effect of short-term ELF MF exposure (2 min) with varying ELF frequencies (50, 16.66, 13, 10, 8.33 and 4 Hz) was analysed (Cvetkovic and Cosic 2009) based on 1-min recordings with regard to stimulation specific outcome frequency bands: stimulation with 16.33 with 4 Hz: theta Hz). The magnetic flux density generated by Helmholtz coils was 20 T. The sample comprised 33 healthy su bjects (24 males and 9 females) in the age range 20-59 years. The study was double-blind with a cross-over design (sessions performed consecutiv ely at the same day separate d by a 30 min break). Out of 320 post-hoc t-tests (16 electrodes, five band s/stimulation, two exposure conditions and two test sessions) none was si gnificant after Bonferroni adju stment of the alpha level. A Bonferroni adjustment to 80 tests (16 EEG recording sites* five paired stimulation frequencies and outcome EEG frequency band s, tests of interaction terms were not considered in this adjustment) lead to five statistically significant results, which the authors discuss in the context of exposure. Ho wever, none of these results reflected an exposure effect. One of the results indicated a pre-/post difference independent from exposure and four were related to interactio n effects of condition and session. Exposure as such did not lead to a statistically significant result. Legros et al. (2012) analysed the effect of an exposure to a 60 Hz 1.8 mT ELF MF for the duration of one hour as compared to sham in 73 subjects (46 males and 27 females, 28 \u00b1 9 years) using a double blind counterbalanced cross-over design wi th test sessions on separate days. The magnetic fields were generated by Helmholtz-like coils of 1.6 m diameter. Each test session lasted 105 min and was composed of four 15 min test sessions (two under exposure, one before an d one following exposure) separated by 15 min rest. The test battery included resting EE G analysed at 8 sites (2 min eyes open, 2 min eyes closed), postural tremor assessmen t (1 min eyes open, 1 min eyes closed), voluntary hand movements and postural osci llations (30 sec eyes open, 30 sec eyes closed). None of the EEG variables, the tr emor variables and the voluntary alternating hand movement variables showed a significant effect of exposure as main factor. After restricting the frequency range of oscillations from 2 - 20 Hz to 7 - 12 Hz a significant session*block interaction was observed, suggesti ng an increase of tremor power in this frequency band after 45 min of MF exposure . The results of a repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant session *block*eyes effect for thr ee out of seven variables characterizing standing balance data. Sway velocity was lower under ELF MF exposure in the eyes closed condition on ly as compared to sham. These results, which need replication, suggest the possibili ty of a MF effect leading to a small increase in tremor amplitude in a restricted frequency range an d to a small decrease in standing balance oscillations when eyes are closed. The same group (Corbacio et al. 2011) invest igated a possible effect of a 60 Hz 3mT exposure (30 min duration) on 15 outcome parameters of 10 psychometric tests (see Table 7) in a sample of 99 subjects (60 fe males and 39 males, 18-49 years) assigned randomly to one of three exposure condit ions: sham/sham; sham/MF exposure, and MF exposure/sham (parallel-group magnetic field generated by Helmholtz like coils was perpendicular to th e sagittal plane. A double blind design was Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 168 used (personal communication). A statisticall y significant (p = 0.01) interaction effect was seen for one out of the 15 variables. The score of the digit span forward test did not show a practice related impr ovement (which was seen unde r sham exposure and which was observed for 11 out of the 15 variab les) under both exposure conditions. Capone et al. (2009) investigated the effect of a 45 min ELF pulsed magnetic field exposure on brain function in 22 subjects (9 males and 13 females, 27.6 \u00b1 9 years). 14 of these subjects underwent a single-blind tr ue or sham exposure in a randomized cross- over design. Eight subjects on ly received the true exposu re. The ELF magnetic fields were delivered by a thin ring -shaped coil position ed horizontally around the head. The coil was driven by rectangular voltage pulses of 1.3 ms at 75 Hz resulting in a peak flux density of 1.8 mT. Cortical excitability was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The observed effect (increase of intracortical facilitation -ICF- after true exposure) is not warranted since they used a wrong statistical analysis paradigm not taking into account the paired nature of th e data. They compared sham exposure results from a subsample of 14 subjects to tr ue exposure results all 22 subjects. Robertson et al. (2010) used fu nctional brain imaging to inve stigate a possible effect of low-intensity low-frequency magnetic fields on neuroprocessing. In a parallel group design 31 subjects in the age range of 18 - 60 years were included in the study and either assigned to a sham group (17) or to a true-exposure group (14). A complex s e q u e n c e o f E L F m a g n e t i c b u r s t s w i t h v a r y ing time intervals resulting in a spectrum containing frequencies from DC up to 300 Hz was used. Magnetic fields were generated utilizing the Z-axis gradient coil of the MRI scanner. The flux density (or its gradient) was set in order to reach the 200 T amplitude as used in previous studies at the level of the subject's eye brow. These fields are much lowe r than ELF MF fields generated during the fMRI measurement. Subjects received acut e thermal pain stimu li at the hypothenar region of the right hand. Significant interact ions have been observed between pre- and post-exposure activation between sham and true exposure for several brain areas, indicating that ELF MF might induce neuromodulation. Other human studies There are two studies from the same group investigating effects of a 1800- T, 60 Hz exposure (McNamee et al. 2010) and a 200- T, 60 Hz exposure (McNamee et al. 2011) on skin blood perfusion, skin temperature, he art rate and heart rate variability. McNamee et al. (2010) recruited 58 self-reported heal thy volunteers (19 females and 39 males, mean age: 27 \u00b1 8.5 years) between 18 and 55 years. Two sessions (sham and real exposure) were applied consecutively in a double-blind, counterbalanced cross-over design. Each session lasted 105 min and co nsisted of four 15-min measuring blocks, which were interspaced by three 15-min \"rest\" periods. In the real exposure condition, exposure was turned on after the first measurement block for 1 hour, the last measurement block in the real exposure si tuation was made 15 min after the exposure had been switched-off. Exposure was delivered by two coils (diameter: 1.6 m; distance between coils 1.2 m). They were enclosed in water pipes and temperature was stabilized. Subjects were seated between the coils with their head in the centre of the quasi- homogeneous field. Fi eld distribution was calculated and measured. The cardiovascular parameters were not affected by the 1800- T, 60 Hz MF in this study. In a pilot study with 10 subjects between 18 and 55 years (mean age: 24.0 \u00b1 3.0 years) McNamee et al. (2011) investigat ed possible effects of a 200- T, 60 Hz exposure on skin blood perfusion and heart rate. This study wa s single-blinded. Sham and real exposure were applied counterbalanced on separate da ys. The exposure system was the same as described in the McNamee et al. (2010) study (see above). Each exposure session lasted for 86 min and comprised four periods of meas urement, each lasting 3 min. After 5 min of seated rest a first baseline measurem ent was performed, than the exposure was started for the next 60 min. After 15 and 45 min measurements were made for a 3-min period. During these measurement periods the MF was switched off. A final measurement Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 169 was made 15 min after the end of exposure. The MF used in this study did not affect skin blood perfusion, heart rate, an d mean arterial pressure. In a double-blind randomized cross-over st udy Kim et al. (2013) investigated possible effects of a 32 min exposure of the head to a 60 Hz 12.5 T magnetic field on perception, eight subjective symptoms and physiologi cal changes. The sample comprised two groups: a) 30 adults (15 females and 15 male s, 27.9 \u00b1 5.9 years), and b) 30 teenagers (16 females and 14 males, 14.8 \u00b1 1.4 years). Th e magnetic field was applied to the head by a pair of coils (distance 50 cm between the coils) specially constr ucted for this study. Background fields were controlled. Assessmen t of heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability was performed for a duration of 5 min at fo ur times: pre-exposure, after 11 and 27 min of exposure, and post exposure. Data analysis is based on comparison of changes from baseline (pre-exposure measure) by exposure separately for the two age groups. Physiological parameters and subjecti ve symptoms were not affected in either group, and neither group correctly perceived the magnetic fields. Another study which aimed at analysing re sting blood pressure was noted but not considered due to insufficient dosime tric information is Rikk et al. (2013). Conclusion on neurophysiological studies The approaches to investigate possible effect s of exposure on the power spectra of the waking EEG are quite heterogeneous with regard to applied fields, du ration of exposure, number of considered leads, and statistical methods. Therefore, these studies are not useful for drawing meaningful conclusions. Th e same is true for the results concerning behavioural outcomes and cortical excitability. 3.8.2.3. In vivo studies What was already known on this subject? The previous Opinion of 2009 described further studies that suggested that the long-term e x p o s u r e o f r o d e n t s t o 5 0 H z m a g n e t i c f i e l d s m a y h a v e a n e f f e c t o n m e m o r y a n d anxiety, and may affect the an tioxidant defence system of th e brain. The direction of the behavioural effects appears to depend on the characteristics of the applied field, but the important parameters are still poorly define d. Another study repo rted magnetic field exposure was without effect on a mouse model of ALS. What has been achieved since then? Studies have continued to use behavioural methods to investigate the effects of magnetic fields on memory and anxiety in animals: other studies have investigated the use of target-specific treatments. There are an in creasing number of isolated studies using novel methodologies which present a greater challenge to synthesize the results into a coherent picture. Jadidi et al. (2007) reported acute exposu re to 50 Hz magnetic fields impaired consolidation of spatial memory in rats. Rats were given two blocks of training trials on the same day on the standard (spatial memory) version of the water maze task or in a cued version (where the location of the esca pe platform was indica ted by a visible ball) and a probe trial was conducted two days la ter to measure memory. The animals were immobilized during field ex posures and their heads pl aced within a small coil electromagnet for 20 min. For the spatial task , it was found that exposure at 8 mT, but not 2 mT immediately after training impaired performance in the probe trial, whereas exposure at 8 mT immediately before the probe trial had no effect, suggesting exposure had not impaired retrieval. For the cued task, exposure at 8 mT immediately after training had no effect on performance in the probe trial. None of the exposure had any effect on motor performance of the task. Cui et al. (2012) reported that exposure of mice to 50 Hz magnetic field at 1 mT for 4 h/day for 12 weeks did not cause any changes in behaviour in an open field, but resulted in significant impairments in learning in both the spatial version of the water maze task Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 170 and in a cued version. Training occurred over four days, as is standard, but a probe trial (without the escape platform being presen t) was not performed to measure spatial memory. In addition, exposure was reported to affect markers of oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum (the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidise (GPx) were decreased, and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased). Exposure at 0.1 mT was with out any significant effect. Li et al. (2014) investigated the effects on long-term exposure to a magnetic field on spatial memory in Sprague-Dawley rats. Continuous exposure to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 100 \u00b5T for 90 days had no effect on the ac quisition of the task in terms of either escape latencies or swimming distances, nor did this exposu re have any effect on task performance during a second training session. During the probe trial conducted at the end of each training session, exposure had no significant e ffects on behaviour, with all groups showing comparable memory. This suggests that long-term exposure had no significant effects on either acquisition or retention of the task. Wang et al. (2013) explored the effects of 50 magnetic fields on spatial memory in juvenile outbred albino Kunming mice. Anim als were exposed at 2 mT for 60 min/day from postnatal day 23 to 35 and their be haviour was measured using a Y-maze and water maze. It was found that exposure had no significant effect in the Y-maze, but acquisition of the water maze was significantly improved as was retention of the location of the escape platform measured in a probe trial. However, as was acknowledged by the authors, the sham-exposed anim als showed poor retention in the probe trial, at no better than chance levels. Exposure no significant effect on body weight, or on swim speed in the water maze. Duan et al. (2013) investigated the effects of intense magnetic fields on water maze behaviour in ICR mice. Animals were exposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils to a 50 Hz field at 8 mT for 4 h/day for 28 days. Temper ature in the exposure cage was maintained at 23 oC and the cage itself was decoupled fr om the coils. The ex posed animals took significantly longer to escape from the water, and during the probe trial spent less time in the target quadrant and swam a greater di stance than controls, indicating impairments in learning and memory for the task. Expo sure was also associated with increased oxidative stress in the hippocampus, includin g increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased supe roxide dismutase (SOD) and GPx activities. In addition, the morphology of the hippocampus was change d in exposed animals with a decrease in numbers of neurons. Exposure gradually redu ced body weight, becomi ng significant after 14 days. All these effects were attenuated by repeated, daily administration by gavage of a solution of procyani din compounds extracted from lotus seedpods. This was attributed to the antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities of the extract. Effects on consolidation of a non-spatial, passive avoidance step-down task were reported by Foroozandeh et al. (2013). Adul t male and female mice were conditioned using mild electric foot shock to avoid ste pping off a small platform. Immediately after this conditioning trial, animals were exposed to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 8 mT for 4 h using a water-cooled electromagnet with forced ventilation. A retention test was performed 24 h later, when it was reported that exposed animals showed significantly decreased step-down latencies compared to sham exposed controls suggesting exposure had impaired the long-term memory of the task. However, this conclusion seems premature. The data are only presented as mean values with no indication of variation, but the mean step down latency of the control mice appears very short compared to published values for this test, and is only around 1 s longer th an the value in the conditioning trial. Similarly, the mean step down latency of the exposed animals following treatment is shorter than that in the conditioning trial, which also seems unusual, suggesting exposure had affected more than just consolidation processes. The reason why the controls and exposed animals did not behave as expected was not discussed. The animals were sham-exposed by being plac ed in the inactive electromagnet for 4 h and although this produced similar results to untreated controls, no comparisons between treatment groups were performed. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 171 Two studies from the same group have studied effects of magnetic fi elds on anxiety and stress. Balassa et al. (2009) investigated whether single, acute exposure to a 500 \u00b5T field for 20 min had effects on behavioural an xiety and social interaction in adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Behaviour was meas ured in an elevated-plus maze (EPM) immediately after exposure, wh ile the exploration of a nove l object placed in the home cage was measured for 10 min immediately after exposure (groups of 10 different animals were used in each test). Differences in behaviour were recorded in the maze, with the exposed animals moving less than controls, plus the number of open arm entries and time spent in the open arms were signific antly decreased. Differe nces were also seen with the novel object, with exposed animal s approaching and exploring the object less than controls. Two tests of social interactions were also carried out, and no differences in behaviour were seen: in one te st, the animals were placed in a neutral environment with an unfamiliar rat for 10 min each day for 5 days; in the other, a rat was placed in the cage of a larger male rat for 10 min. In the second study, Szemerszky et al. (2010) investigated the effects of repeated, short- term and continuous long-term exposures. Animals were exposed to a 50 Hz magnetic fi eld at 500 \u00b5T for 8 h/day for 5 days or for 24h/day for 4-6 weeks. Neither short- nor long-term exposure pr oduced significant changes in behaviour in the EPM measured 48 h after terminal of short-term exposure, or 48 h before the end of long-term exposure . After 4 weeks of continuous exposure, animals were tested in a forced swim test, and exposed animals spen t significantly longer floating (as opposed to sw imming or struggling to escape), suggesting enhanced depression-like behaviour. No e ffects were found on body weight or on the weight of the thymus or adrenal glands, nor did either ex posure produce differences in haematocrit levels. Blood glucose levels were unaffected by short-term exposure, although they were significantly elevated after 6 weeks exposure. Plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone were determined along with pre-proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA levels in the adrenal gland the hypo axis: only POMC mRNA levels were significantly elevat ed after 6 weeks exposure. It was concluded that long-term exposure may be a mild stre ss to rats because it had produced a few signs of chronic stress; howeve r, many markers were unaffect ed. For both studies, the exposure system consisted of a pair of Helmholtz coils, but the noises or vibrations produced are not described. He et al. (2011) reported magnetic field effects on behavioura l anxiety and spatial memory in rats that depended on the length of exposure each day. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 50 Hz magnetic fields at 2 mT for 1 h or 4 h per day; they were tested in an open field and an EPM after 3 weeks, and in a water maze after 4 weeks. In all tasks, it was found that exposure for 1 h per day was without significant effect, but exposure for 4 h caused increased levels of behavioural anxiety in both tests, and reduced the latency to find the platform in the water maze and improved retention in the probe trial. The noise and vibration levels from the exposure coils were not reported and it is possible they could have an influence on the measured outcomes. Korpinar et al. (2012) reported that long-term, continuous exposure of Wistar rats to a 50 Hz field at 10 mT resulted in a significant increase in behavioural anxiety, as measured in an EPM, but there was no effect on activity and exploration, as measured using a hole board. Animals were exposed fo r 21 days using a series of solenoid coils placed beneath the holding cages. An air ga p was used to uncouple the cages from the coils, and wooden plates were used to insula te the cages from the heat generated by the coils, although the success of th ese measures was not recorded. The effects of long-term exposure to magnet ic fields on stress and emotional behaviour in mice were examined by Kita oka et al. (2014). Groups of fo ur week old, male ICR mice were exposed using a cylindrical coil appara t u s t o a 5 0 H z m a g n e t i c f i e l d a t 1 . 5 m T (corrected by authors in Erratum) for 5 h/ day for 25 days. Four behavioural tests were conducted during the exposure period, and no differences were found in the open field or EPM, but a significantly increased latency to enter the light compartment during a light- dark test was found, with an increased immo bility time and decrea sed distance moved in the forced swim test. Plasma corticosterone levels (obtained after 1 week of exposure) Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 172 were increased in exposed mice but plasma AT CH and the expression of genes related to stress response did not change. It was conc luded by the authors that exposure had induced anxiety and depression-like behaviour due to increased corticosterone secretion that was independent of the HPA axis. The results are interesting, but it is not clear when the behavioural tests were carried out, and th e animals appear to have been tested after varying lengths of exposure to the magnetic field, confounding the results. Salunke et al. (2013) also investigated the effects of long-term exposure to magnetic fields on anxiety using three behavioural tests. Groups of adult Swiss mice were exposed to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 1 mT for 8 h/day using a pair of Helmholtz coils, and anxiety was measured after 7, 30, 60 or 90 days of exposure; each animal was tested only once. It was found using an EPM, an open field arena and a social in teraction test that exposure periods for 30 days or more signif icantly increased anxiety without affecting locomotion. There was a significant elevation of both GABA and glutamate levels in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of mice exposed for 120 days . In order to investigate the role of GABA and glutam ate further, other mice that had been exposed (or sham- exposed) for 120 days were injected at sub-e ffective doses with a GABA receptor agonist (NMDA or MK-801) and anxiety le vels measured in the three ta sks. It was found that the glutamate analogs modulated fi eld-induced anxiety (with NM DA increasing and MK-801 decreasing measures of anxiety) and behaviour in all tasks was not affected by the GABA analogs. Overall, the authors concluded that magnetic fields can produce an anxiogenic effect in rodents, and that this might be related to activation of NMDA glutamate receptors. Jana et al. (2012) reported that exposure to 50 Hz magnetic fields for 7 days resulted in age-related changes in the motor behaviour of Mongolian gerbils. Groups of animals were housed between 20 and 40 cm from an electr omagnet producing a gradient 50 Hz field, such that the field in the ce ntre of the cages was 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mT. The behaviour of the gerbils was monitored in an open fiel d arena (away from the electromagnet) for 60 min using a video tracking an d analysis system at four in tervals during the exposure period, and 3 days after exposure. Treatm ent group sizes were relatively modest, consisting of 5 - 7 animals. The data were analysed in two 30 min periods (although the reasons for this decision were not explicitly given). For 3 month old gerbils, significant increases in distances moved, average speed and stereotypic movements of the head, and significant decreases in i mmobility time were reported after 1 day of exposure, and only in the first 30 min of each assessment period, but no dose response was apparent; no consistent effects were observed 3 days after exposure. For 10 month old gerbils, the changes in behaviour were le ss consistent and significant changes were mostly seen again after 1 day of exposure and only in the first 30 min of ea ch assessment period, a l t h o u g h e x p o s u r e a t 0 . 5 m T p r o v i d e d s o m e evidence of causing effects throughout exposure; significant changes in all behaviours were observed 3 days after exposure. The results were attributed to differential effects on neurotransmitters in the brain structures that control exploratory activity in young and adult gerbils. Previously this group had reported that continuous exposure of Wistar rats for 7 days to a 0.5 mT field affected serotonergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex (the affinity of serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors was decreased and their density was increased) although no effects were seen on dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors in the striatum (Jana et al., 2009). Prato et al. (2013) examined th e sensitivity of adult male CD -1 mice to 30 Hz magnetic fields. Analgesia (anti- nociception) could be gradually in duced in mice by placing them for 1 h per day for 5 days in mu-metal cages that attenuated the ambient magnetic fields more than 50-fold. Each cage also contained 4 coils in a Merritt-like configuration to produce a magnetic field. It was found that exposure of animals in the cages to 30 Hz fields at 65 or 33 nT reduced the magn itude of the analgesi c response induced immediately after exposure. An algesia was measured using a hot plate test to quantify latency of foot withdrawal to a thermal stim ulus. No effects were seen using a stainless steel cage, suggesting the non-in volvement of electric fields. In addition, exposure to a Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 173 horizontal static field (0 Hz ) at 44 \u00b5T reduced analgesia by approximately half the value produced by time-varying (30 Hz) fields. Compared to the situation with magnetic fields, very few behavioural studies have been conducted using electric fields. Hawakawa et al. (2007) studied the effects 50 Hz electric fields at 16 kV/m (rms, unperturbed) on pl ace aversion conditioning in Wistar rats. Whereas unexposed animals were conditioned to avoid the white half of a shuttle box apparatus over 6 daily trials using light as the unconditioned stimulus, this aversion response was not shown by animals exposed to the electric field, and they still preferred to spend more time in the white half of th e apparatus. However, the exposed animals initially had a greater preference for the white compartment than the sham-exposed animals, and the effects of noise and vibr ation from the exposure system were not considered. The field used was also above th e perception threshold range of rats (2- 10 kV/m). Mechanistic studies Studies have continued to investigate potential interaction mechanisms and a number of possible mechanisms have been suggested, in cluding effects on ne ural plasticity, and changes in oxidat ive stress. Akdag et al. (2010) investigated the effect s of long-term exposure on apoptosis and oxidative stress in rat brain tissues. Male Sp rague-Dawley rats were exposed to 50 Hz fields at either 100 or 500 \u00b5T for 2 h every da y for 7 months. As an indication of cell death at the end of exposure, active caspase- 3 expression was analysed subjectively by two investigators using immunohistochemistr y: no field-dependent effects were seen. A number of markers for oxidative stress were examined, and apart from a significant decrease in catalase levels at both intensities, significant changes in MDA levels, total antioxidant capacity and total oxidative stre ss were only seen in the group exposed to the higher field intensity. Ther e was no effect on myeloperox idise levels. Taken together, it was concluded that long-term exposure had increased oxidative stress through an increase in radical oxygen species production. The effects of acute exposure to 60 Hz fields on the antioxidant systems in rat brain were investigated by Martinez-Samano et al. (2012). Immobilised or freely moving male Wistar rats were exposed for 2 h at 2.4 mT using a Helmholtz coil system. Compared to unexposed and unrestrained controls, exposure of freely moving animals produced lower values for SOD and for catalase activity, wher eas restraint plus exposure also produced significant changes in glutathione content and NO levels. Selakovi et al. (2013) investigated the effects of exposure to a gradient 50 Hz magnetic field on oxidative stress in brain tissues of 3 and 10-month old Mongolian gerbils. Small groups of animals were placed in thei r home cages at set distances from an electromagnet to produce averag e fields of 0.1, 0.25 or 0. 5 mT in the cages. Animals were continuously exposed for 7 days, and oxidative stress was measured immediately or 3 days after cessation of exposure. All ex posures produced a field-dependent increase in NO levels, superoxide production, SOD ac tivity and MDA levels in all brain areas examined, in both 3 and 10 month old gerbils . These changes persisted in 10-month-old gerbils measured 3 days afte r exposure, although they we re reduced or absent in 3 month old animals at that time point. It wa s concluded that magnetic field exposure had significantly increased producti on of free-radical species. Ho wever, treatment group sizes are fairly modest, and as mentioned above (Jana et al. 2012), since the field strength depends on the distance from the magnet, animals in neighbouring cages could have been exposed to a range of overlapping fiel d strengths. Akdag et al. (2013) reported intensity-dependent changes on oxidative stre ss in brain tissues of adult, male Wistar rats. Animals were exposed to 50 Hz fields at 100 or 500 \u00b5T for 2 h/day for 10 months using a Helmholtz coil apparatus within a Faraday cage. At the end of exposure, - amyloid protein levels in homogenized brai n samples remained unchanged by exposure at both field strengths, but MDA and protein carbonyl levels both increased significantly with exposures at 500 \u00b5T producing significantly larger effects. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 174 Manikonda et al. (2014) also re ported effects on oxidative st ress in rat tissues following long-term exposure to power frequency magn etic fields. Wistar rats were housed individually in cages covered by a stainless steel mesh and exposed to 50 Hz fields at 50 or 100 \u00b5T for 90 days continuously using a system off coils wound on wooden bobbins; sham exposure was performed using a sim ilar set of non-energised wooden bobbins. Significant effects were seen that depended on the region of the brai n and field intensity: MDA levels and glutathione pe activity were increa in the hippocampus and cerebellum at both 50 \u00b5T and 100 \u00b5T, but only at 100 \u00b5T in the cortex; superoxide dismutase activity was increased in all br ain areas at 100 \u00b5T only; and the level of reduced glutathione and oxidiz ed glutathione (GSH/GSSG ra tio) was decreased in all brain areas at 100 \u00b5T and decreased in the cerebellum only at 50 \u00b5T. Exposure had no significant effect on body weight. Overall, the authors concluded that long-term exposure to the magnetic field had induced oxidative stress in the rat brain. In a brief communication, Chu et al. (2011) also reported th at acute exposure to 60 Hz fields affected lipid peroxida tion and antioxidant defence mechanisms. Exposure at 2.3 mT for 3 h was found to significantly increase MDA and production of hydroxyl radicals in the cerebellum of male Balb/C mice, as well as increase SOD and decrease ascorbic acid levels. There was no significant change in glutathione or GPx. In what otherwise appears to be a well-conducted study, no informatio n was provided on the exposure system nor on metrology or dosimetry, although other studies from the same group suggest they may have used a Helmholtz coil system. But without this information it is impossible to assess any contribution to the observed effect from potentia l stress associated with the generation of the field. Frilot et al. (2009, 2011) reported increases in localised glucose ut ilization in the brain following exposure to magnet ic fields. Female Sprague-Da wley rats were exposed to either a continuous or intermittent (2 s on, 2 s off) 60 Hz field at 250 \u00b5T for 45 min. The animals were either restrained during exposure (to ensure the angle between the field and the body axis of the animals was kept constant), or they were free to move. Noise and vibration produced by the exposure system were minimised, and it was reported that animals did not respond behaviourally to the pr esence of the field. Neuronal activity was measured by positron emission tomogr aphy using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Intermittent field exposure wa s associated with significantl y increased FDG uptake in the mid-sagittal region of the hi ndbrain (possibly in the medu lla or cerebellum due to uncertainties in localization) only in animals held in a fixed orientation to the field; continuous exposure produced far smaller changes in uptake. It was proposed that the induced electric fields had ex erted a force on oligosaccharide side chains bound to ion- channel gates in a membrane, so opening those gates and increasing ne uronal activity. It was reasoned that randomizing the direction of the field would re duce FDG uptake by mitigating the cumulative effect of the field on the ion channe l gates. Frilot et al. (2009) reported that exposure to an intermittent ma gnetic field (2s on, 5s off) produced evoked potentials with a latency of about 500 ms of field onset, when analysed by a novel technique called recurrence analysis (which is capable of detecting nonlinear relationships) although not when analysed by traditional time-averaging techniques. Reyes-Guerrero et al. (2010) reported that ex posure of female Wistar rats to a 60 Hz magnetic field caused biphasic chan ges in estrogen receptor-beta (ER ) gene expression that depended on the phase of the estrous cycle: exposu re significantly decreased expression during oestrus and significantly increased expre ssion during diestrous. No changes were seen in proestrous or metestro us, or in males and ovariectomised rats; nor in ER expression in any treatmen t group. Unrestrained rats were exposed at 1 mT using a Helmholtz coil system for 2 h/day for 9 days, and mRNA levels in the olfactory bulb were analysed using RT-PCR with a GAPDH control. Using Western blots, Stras\u00e1k et al. (2009) in vestigated the effects of a 50 Hz magnetic field on the protein level of c-Jun and c-Fos in the brains of young ICR mice. The level of c - F o s w a s f o u n d t o b e u n a f f e c t e d b y e x p o s u r e a t 2 m T f o r 4 d a y s i n b o t h m a l e a n d female mice, but c-Jun was si gnificantly decreased in the olfactory lobes and the right Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 175 hemisphere in both sexes. However, the statistical analysis is not presented, and the numbers of animals in each treatment group are not given: group sizes could be fairly modest because they were ta ken from just one litter. The effects of magnetic fields on NO signalling in the brain have been studied by Cho et al. (2012). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were ex posed to a 60 Hz field at 2 mT for 5 days using a pair of Helmholtz coils. It was found that NO levels in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum were significantly increased fo llowing exposure, which correlated with an increase in the numbers of neurons expr essing neuronal NO synthase activity. Conventional and electron micr oscopy did not reveal any changes in the morphology or number of neurons, suggesting the increa sed production of NO had not induced pathology. Nevertheless, given the emerging im portance of NO as a signalling molecule in the brain, the finding that magnetic fields may increase NO production could have important consequences for health and well-being. The expression on hsp70 mRNA in the brain tissues of CD1 mice exposed to 50 magnetic fields was investigated by Villarini et al. (2013). Animals were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, 1 or 2 mT for 15h/day for 7 days using a pair of rectangular coils in a Helmholtz-like configuration. No consistent effects on hsp7 0 expression were seen using real-time RT- PCR (expression was only significantly elevat ed in the hippocampus at 0.1 mT) and no effect on hsp70 protein was seen using West ern blot analysis. Co met assays indicated that exposure at 1 mT temporarily increased the amount of DNA strand breaks in the hippocampus and cerebellum, while exposure at 2 mT also temporarily increased DNA damage in the cortex-striatum. In all cases, any field-induced damage had been repaired after 24 h. The capillaries in the circumventricular organs (C VOs) that include the pineal gland and the area postrema exhibit increased vascular permeability due to their cellular morphology. The effect of magnetic fields on permeability in the CVOs was investigated by Guti\u00e9rrez-Mercado et al. (2013). Male Wistar rats were exposed to 120 Hz magnetic fields at 0.66 mT using a pair of Helmholtz coils for 2 h/day for 7 days. Animals remained in their home cages within the coils at all ti mes, and were habituated to the system for 3 days before exposure starte d. Animals were injected with tracer (colloidal carbon) immediately after the final exposure, and thei r brains examined using light and electron microscopy. Compared to sham-exposed animal s that were housed within non-energised coils for 10 days, it was found that exposure significantly increased permeability in the CVOs and their vascular area was increased. The permeability of th e blood-brain barrier in the hippocampus and cortex was also increased by exposure. Balassa et al. (2013) reported th at prenatal and early exposure to magnetic fields caused long-lasting changes in neuronal functions and plasticity in the brains of Wistar rats. Using a Helmholtz coil apparatus, foetal animals were exposed to 50 Hz fields at 0.5 mT for 7 days continuously starting in the seco nd week of gestation or young males were exposed to 3 mT for 7 days starting on post natal day 3 were made. Electrophysiological recordings were made using brain slice prepar ations of the cortex and hippocampus at 2 months of age. It was found that foetal (not postnatal) exposures significantly increased basic synaptic excitability in the hippocampus and cortex (measured by amplitude of evoked field potentials). Foet al exposure also affected sy naptic plasticity (exposure significantly inhibited paired-p ulse depression, and decrease d long-term potentiation) in the cortex but not in the hippocampus: no effects were seen following postnatal exposure. Overall, it was sugge sted that exposure had caused a long-lasting increase in the excitatory state of the neuron s in the cortex and hippocampus. Fournier et al. (2012) also reported lo ng-lasting changes in adult hippocampal microstructure and function in rats following intermittent (10 s on, 40 s off) exposure to low intensity, complex magnetic fields throughout gestation. Exposure was achieved using a pair of Helmholtz coils at end of the home cage, with distance from the coils used to produce different intensities. It was found that exposure at 30-50 nT resulted in impairments in the learning of a fear-condi tioning paradigm along with reductions in overall hippocampal size with subtle changes in morpholo gy: exposure to weaker or stronger fields did not produce these effects. The result is biologically intriguing, but the Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 176 complex and unusual nature of the field, plus the narrow intensity window for the effects may limit the relevance of these studies. Xiong et al. (2013) found that the morphology of cortical neurons was affected by long- term exposure to magnetic fields. Adult rats were exposed to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 0.5 mT for 4h/day for either 14 or 28 days , and cell morphology was assessed in Golgi- stained sections of the medial endorhinal cortex using imag e analysis techniques. It was found that exposure at both time periods induced a decrease in spine density of the dendrites of stellate and pyramidal neurons. Exposure also caused changes in spine shape that depended on the sp ecific type of dendritic spin e and the length of exposure. Overall the author suggested that exposure-induced changes in dendritic spines might provide some explanation for the field-rela ted changes that have been observed in cognitive function. Very few recent studies have investigated the effects of electric fiel ds, possibly due to the difficulties of avoiding perceptu al effects of the field by the animals. Akpinar et al. (2012) found that repeated, acute exposure of female rats to 50 Hz electric fields resulted in prolongation of the components of the visual evoked potential, as well as in increases in total oxidant status and lipid peroxidation in the brain and retina. Electric fields were generated using a pair of copper plates conn ected to a transformer, and groups of 5 animals were exposed to fields of 12 or 18 kV/m (unperturbed values) for 1 h per day for 14 days. Effects were generally larger at the higher field intensity. The possibility of perceptual effects cannot be ruled out usin g these field values, however. The authors suggested that the plastic cages holding the animals would have provided some shielding, although the rats themselves and their behaviour could lead to local enhancements of the field. Potential therapeutic applications Some studies suggest that low intensity magnetic fields may provide novel therapeutic benefits, possibly by increasing neurogen esis and so deliver protection against neurodegenerative disease and by restoring fu nction following injury to nervous tissues. Shin et al. (2011) reported th at repeated exposure of C57B L/6 mice to 60 Hz magnetic fields at 0.3 or 2.4 mT 1 h/day for 14 days resulted in intensity-dependent increases in locomotory activity as measured using an automatic video tracking system. This hyperactivity was largest immediately after th e last exposure and di minished with time thereafter it remained signif icantly elevated 1 day after exposure using 0.3 mT, and 1 week after exposure using 2.4 mT; activity was not elevated at 3 months after either exposure. Numbers of cells sh owing fos-related antigen (FRA) expression in the striatum and nucleus accumbens were si gnificantly increased 2 h af ter the last exposure, and these remained significantly el evated for 1 year. Exposure at 2.4 mT produced larger effects than 0.3 mT. Injection of the mice with SCH 233390, a dopaminergic D1 receptor antagonist, but not with sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist, 30 min before each exposure resulted in an atte nuation of the effects on acti vity and FRA-positive cells, suggesting these effects were mediated by stimulation of D1 receptors. The authors acknowledged that the role and physiological significance of the long-term changes observed require further clarific ation, but they suggested that magnetic fields could be of benefit in improving Parkinson's symptoms. Grassi and co-workers have investigated the ef fects of magnetic fields on neurogenesis in hippocampus of mice of juvenile and adult mice. Cuccurazzu et al. (2010) investigated the effects of 50 Hz magnetic fields on neur ogenesis in the hippocampus of adult mice. Adult C57BL/6 mice were expose d at 1 mT using a solenoid for 1-7 h/day for 4 or 7 days. It was found that exposure si gnificantly increased numbers of immature neurons in the dentate gyrus, with a trend for longer daily ex posures to have larger effects. Exposure also significantly increased the expression of three ge nes involved in neuronal commitment and differentiation, Hes1, Mash1 and NeuroD, and genes encoding a voltage-gated Ca channel ( 1C s u b u n i t s o f C a v1.2). Electrophysiological recordings indicated that the newly gene rated neurons became functionally integrated in to the Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 177 hippocampus, resulting in enhanced synaptic plasticity. Overall, the authors suggested t h a t m a g n e t i c f i e l d s m a y h a v e a r o l e t o play as a treatment for neurodegenerative disease. A similar suggestion was reached by Leone et al. (2014). This study exposed young adult C57BL/6 mice to 50 Hz magnetic fields at 1 mT for 3.5 h/day for 12 days, A solenoid was used to produce the field, an d the behaviour of the animals was assessed using a water maze and a novel object recognit ion task 30 days after exposure finished. It was found that exposure si gnificantly improved performance in both tasks compared to controls: animals in the water maze showed decreased latencies to find the escape platform and spent more time in the target quadrant during the probe trial; and animals in the object recognition task spent more time exploring the novel object and less time exploring the familiar object. Other animal s were injected i.p. with BrdU (100 mg/kg) immediately before each exposure, and th e numbers of proliferating and immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were assessed ex vivo 24 h or 40 days after exposure using immunohistochemistry. Exposure was found to have significantly increased neuronal numbers at both time po ints. Podda et al. (2 014) also performed a similar experiment investigating neurogenesis in juvenile mice. In this study, mice were first injected with BrdU (100 mg/kg) for 3 co nsecutive days, then 9 days later were exposed to the magnetic field for 3.5 hours/per day for 6 days; mice were killed 3 or 9 days after exposure. It was found that exposu re significantly increased cell proliferation, significantly increased protei n expression of NeuN a neural marker suggesting an increase in neuronal maturity, and significan tly decreased apoptosis. The performance of mice in a recognition memory task (tested on day 4, 5 and 6 of exposure) and a water maze task (on day 9 to 13 after the exposu re) was also significantly improved by exposure. The authors concluded that magnetic fields had incr eased the survival of newly developed hippocampal cells. Tasset et al. (2012) reported a protective effe ct of magnetic fields in a rat model of Huntingdon's disease in which animals were injected with 3-nitroprorionic acid (3NP) to induce neurological and behavi our changes. Male Wistar ra ts were exposed to a 60 Hz magnetic field at 0.7 mT for 2 h in the morn ing and 2 h in the afternoon for 21 days. The animals were held immobile in plastic cylinder s, and their heads placed between a pair of horizontal Helmholtz coils. Animals were injected i.p. with 3NP (20 mg/kg) on 4 consecutive days immediately be fore exposure to the magnetic field. 3NP alone caused a significant decrease in dopamine levels (m easured in a homogenised half brain), and decreased locomotion in an op en field test and increased i mmobility time in a forced swim test. These effects were reduced in an imals also given exposure to the magnetic field, although dopami ne levels were lower compared to controls and immobility time was very much reduced. Exposure to magnetic fields alone had no significant effects. Compared to controls, levels of brain- an d glial-derived neurotrophic factors were significantly increased in all treatment groups, including animals just exposed to the magnetic field. Histological examination of the brains revealed that 3NP had increased neurodegeneration and neuronal cell loss in the striatum that were largely reversed by the magnetic field, as were 3NP-induced effects on caspas e-3 and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Similarly, exposure to the magnetic field reversed the 3NP-induced changes in glutathione, lipid-peroxidation products and in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels. In addition, Tasset et al. (2013) found that ex posure to the magnetic field modulated expression of NF-E2-related fact or 2 (Nrf2) a transcription fa ctor that is responsible for regulating a battery of antioxidant and cellular protective genes in response to oxidative stress. Using Western blot analysis, it wa s found that 3NP treatment alone decreased Nrf2 protein levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus of brain cells, and Nrf2 levels in 3NP- treated rats were significantly increased (alt hough they were still reduced compared to control values). This suggests a possible mech anism whereby magnetic fields were able to reverse the neurotoxic effects induced by 3NP treatment. In order to assess whether magnetic fields increased obsessive comp ulsive disorder, Sa lunke et al. (2014) investigated the effects of magnetic field on marble-burying behaviour in adult, male Swiss mice. Animals were expose d to 50 Hz fields at 1 mT fo r 8 h/day for up to 120 days using Helmholtz coils. All exposures increased the numbers of marbles buried in a 30 min period in an arena containing 20 marbles, with longer exposu res producing larger effects. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 178 Locomotion was not affected. Exposure for 120 days had no effect on dopamine or serotonin levels in the cortex, hippocampus or hypothalamus, but NO levels were significantly increased. Marble-burying behaviour was increased by daily i.p. injection with NO precursors and nitric oxide syntha se (NOS) inhibitors attenuated the response. Thus the increase in marble-burying behaviour was attributed to increased NO levels, particularly in the cortex. In order to help to develop prevention strategies against potential field-induced neurot oxicity, Celik et al. (2013) investigated the effects of magnetic fields exposure on manganese (Mn) accumulation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were exposed to 50 Hz fields at 1. 5 mT for 4 h/day. 5 days/week over 45 days using a Helmholtz coil apparatus within a Faraday cage. Rats also received Mn solution (3.75, 15 or 60 mg/kg body weight) every other day by gavage. Mn levels were determined immediately after exposure in brain, kidney and liver tissues by spectrometry. It was found that Mn ingestion alone increased Mn levels in the brain and other tissues, and these levels were further significantly increased with magnetic field exposure. However, the numbers of animals used was small, with five animals in each treatment group. Das et al. (2013) reported that intermittent exposure to low intensity magnetic fields can provide a significant recovery of function ca used by spinal cord hemisection. One day after surgery to cut the left hand side of the spinal cord at T13, rats were exposed to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 17.96 \u00b5T for 2h/day for 6 weeks. Using a battery of tests to assess behaviour, nociception and neurophysiol ogy, it was found that exposure caused a significantly improved pattern of locomotion in an open field throughout the six weeks of the study, along with increased recovery fr om pain, and faster restoration of bladder function. However, there were no sham-sur gery or sham-exposure groups. A further study (Kumar et al. 2013) investigated the ef fects that magnetic fi eld exposure (at 17.96 \u00b5T for 2 h/day for 8 weeks) had on pain behaviour in rats following complete spinal cord transection at T11. It was found that loco motion in an open field was significantly increased in exposed animals, but remained well below values in sham animals (whose treatment was not defined). At the end of th e exposure period, beha vioural pain ratings were subjectively scored for 60 min following injection of algogen (5% formalin solution) into the left dorsal hindpaw. Transection al one gave significantly reduced pain ratings compared to sham controls, whereas transect ion with exposure gave values between the sham and transected alone groups. In additi on, magnetic field exposure reversed an observed decrease in 5-HT in the cort ex, and also reversed the increase in norepinephrine and GABA in the brain stem seen with transection alone. These are interesting results but only a single magnetic field intensity was used in both experiments, and why the particular value was chosen was not explained. The lack of an appropriate sham control group in on e experiment is also of concern. Conclusions on in vivo studies Animal studies have continued to investigate the effect of magnetic fields on neurobiology using various models and exposure conditions. While generally these studies are of good quality, many have used single field strengths, sometimes well in excess of exposure guideline valu es. Also, the possibilities of noise or vibration produced by Helmholtz coil-based exposure systems ha ve not always been addressed adequately, and solenoid-based systems, wh e r e a n a n i m a l ' s b e h a v i o u r i n t h e c a g e w i l l a f f e c t i t s exposure, are not ideal. Largely consistent with earlier results, recent studies have r e po r te d th a t e xpo sur e to E LF m a gne ti c fi e l ds ha s no e f fe ct o n a cti vi ty o r l o co m o ti o n. There is some evidence from animal studies that exposure t o E L F M F m a y a f f e c t t h e performance of spatial memory tasks (bot h deficits and improvements have been reported) and engender subtle increases in behavioural anxi ety and stress. Other studies have investigated potential molecular and cellular mechanisms, and despite a number of studies continue to report candidate mech anisms, particularly regarding effects on reactive oxygen species, none has been firmly identified that operates at exposure levels found in the everyday environment.. Several stud ies have tried to reve al subtle effects of magnetic fields through their interactions with drugs or other interventions but these have not produced any compelling evidence of field-induced change s on nervous system Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 179 function. Some, studies have suggested that magnetic fields may offer potential therapy against neurodegenerative diseases, although these results requir e confirmation and clarification. Finally, no additional insights regarding the effects of electric fields are possible, due to the almost co mplete absence of new data. 3.8.2.4. In vitro studies What was already known on this subject? It was stated in the previous SCENIHR Opinion that \"Very few recent in vitro studies have investigated effects from ELF fields on dise ases other than cancer and those available have very little relevance for understanding any disease connection. There is a need for hypothesis-based in vitro studies to examine specific diseases\". What has been achieved since then? There are few suitable in vitro model systems for nervous sy stem effects and disorders such as NDD. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate in vitro studies that are using nerve cells or glial cells, in combination with relevant experimental end-points (cell survival and death; cell differentiation, radical homeostasi s, expression of inflammatory markers; synaptic transmission, functionalit y of the blood-brain barrier). Previously it was noted that a few studies have focused on differentiation into the neuronal phenotype of undifferentiated or lowl y differentiated precurso rs of nerve cells. Since the last Opinion, a study by Saito et al. (2009) used P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. The cells were induce d to differentiate if exposed to 10 mT (50 Hz; 21 days exposure), but not at a lower flux density (1 mT). The expression o f MA P2 a nd spi ke frequencies increased, whereas the glial ma rker GFAP decreased. In another study, primary cultures of newborn mouse cortical neuronal stem cells were stimulated to increase their differentiation rate after contin uous 50 Hz MF exposure (1.0 mT) for up to twelve days (Piacentini et al . 2008). The differentiation was s een as enhanced expression of neuronal markers and enhanced Ca v-channel expression and activity. In a study by di Loreto et al. (2009) primar y cultures of embryonal rat cortical neurons were used. The cells were exposed for seven days to a 50 Hz MF (0.1 or 1.0 mT). The higher exposure level had stronger effects, if effects occurred at all. The 1.0 mT exposure caused increased vitality and decreased apop tosis, possibly due to the enhancement of neurotrophic support. This seems to be inde pendent of radical home ostasis disturbances, since redox status, MDA levels, and enzymati c activities were unaffected by exposure. The study did not include any positive control(s). Synaptosomes (isolated synaptic terminals fr om neurons) from one adult male sheep was used by Afrasiabi et al. (2014) in a study where they investigated sine wave ELF MF effects on acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity. The authors generated the MF in a set of Helmholtz coils in the frequency range 50- 230 Hz at flux densit ies from 0.3-1.7 mT. Exposure duration was from 15-120 min. The re sults indicated a biphasic response to the ELF MF. Flux densities ranging from 0.8- 1.2 mT at frequencies of 150-230 Hz (all investigated exposure durations) as well as 0.3-0.6 mT at 50-90 Hz increased AChE activity. In contrast, exposure at 1.2-1. 7 mT at frequencies ranging from 50-90 Hz decreased enzyme activity. Ob viously, the study needs to be replicated before the potentially interesting findings can be used for any assessment of health effects. Furthermore, there is no information regard ing background EMF and blinding procedures in the article. The role of voltage-gated T-type Ca 2+-channels in responses to ELF MF was investigated by Cui et al. (2013). The auth ors transfected T-type channe ls (Cav3.1, wave 50 Hz MF (0.2 mT; 0.5-3 h exposure duration). The exposure caused inhi bition of preferential ly the Cav3.2 channel type, which also was seen in experiments where native channels (in mouse primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons) were inve stigated. By using various types of receptor antagonists, the authors coul d show the probable involveme nt of increased arachidonic Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 180 acid and subsequent increased leukotriene E4 levels in the MF response. The study seems to have been performed wi thout proper sham conditions. Embryonic neural stem cells ha ve the potential to differentia te to mature neurons upon proper stimulation. It has been suggested that MF exposure can influence neuronal differentiation. This is the topic in the stud y by Ma et al. (2014) who obtained embryonic neural stem cells from the telencephala of embryonic day 13.5 BALB/c mice. The cell cultures were exposed to 50 Hz sinusoidal MF (either 0.5, 1 or 2 mT for 3 days; or 2 mT for 1, 2 or 3 days intermittently (5 min on/10 min off); double-blind conditions; sham and exposure randomly selected by computer). Cells were cultured under conditions that either promoted proliferation or differentiati on, and a number of bi ological end-points were studied (cell viability, DNA synthesis, neurosphere diameter, ce ll cycle progression, specific protein and mRNA expression). In sh ort, exposures had no effect on any of the end-points, with exception of some of the ge ne expression profiles during intermittent exposure. Thus, some genes that influence earl y stages of neural differentiation were up- regulated, although this had no effect on the phenotype of the cells. This nevertheless leaves the possibility open that intermitte nt exposures can have other effects than continuous exposure. Differentiation to nerve cells fr om stem cells was also investig ated in an interesting study from Seong et al. (2014). Both human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells were possi ble to induce to neuronal di fferentiation by means of a 50 Hz 1 mT MF exposure (8 and 6 days resp ectively). Neuronal molecular markers as well as morphology and electrophysiological pr operties supported that MF exposure led to neuronal differentiation. The authors then ambitiously undertook a transcriptome analysis, comparing the transcripti onal profiles of MF-induced neuronal cells with those of sham-treated cells. Data showed that 57 ge nes expressed significant changes (>1.5 fold) due to exposure. Most of these genes were transcription factors, and in many cases associated to expression of th e Egr1 gene. Elegantly, the au thors then showed that Egr1 is necessary (by gene knockdown, but no t sufficient (overexpression) for neuronal differentiation. Further studies in the same direction have been published by Bai et al. (2013), Cho et al. (2012), and Kim et al. ( 2013). All studies empl oyed the same cell culture model and could demonstrate induction of neuronal differentiation (as determined by presence of various neuronal markers) , appearance of neurons specific cellular structures and also electr ophysiological properties. Discussion on in vitro studies The in vitro studies are mostly acute or short-term (with exposures ranging from minutes to a few days) and also limited by the fact that they almost always only include one cell type, primary cultures of neuronal precursors or established cell lines. The studies do not allow any conclusions regarding a possible effe ct of ELF MF exposure on, for example, development of neurodegenerative diseases, bu t offer some results that are interesting and possibly worthwhile following up, in cluding the noted po sitive effects on differentiation. Especially the possible effects of ELF MF expo sure on embryonic neuronal stem cells offer interesting possibilities for future stud ies. Besides these mentioned studies, there are no in vitro findings documenting effects on disease markers or transmitter systems. Conclusions on in vitro studies Like in the previous Opinion, the few available in vitro studies do not provide any support for drawing conclusions on the possible e ffects of ELF on the nervous system and neurobehavioral disorders. 3.8.2.5. Conclusions on nervous system effects and neurobehavioral disorders Only a few new epidemiological studies on neurodegenerative diseases have been published since the previous Opinion. They do not provide support for the previous conclusion that ELF magnetic field exposure could increa se the risk for Alzheimer's disease or any other neurodegen erative diseases or dementia. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 181 Regarding neurophysiological studies, due to methodologic al weaknesses, these studies are not useful for drawing me aningful conclusions. The sa me is true for the results concerning behavioural outcomes and cortical excitability. Largely consistent with earlier results, recent in vivo studies have reported that exposure t o m a g n e t i c f i e l d s h a s n o e f f e c t o n a c tivity or locomotion, but may affect the performance of spatial memory tasks (bot h deficits and improvements have been reported) and engender subtle increases in behavioural an xiety and stress. There is some evidence that these effects may be grea ter with higher intensity fields and with longer durations of exposure, but the magnitude or direction of effect canno t be defined with accuracy. In vivo studies that have investigated potential molecular and cellular mechanisms have not identified any mechanism that operates at levels of exposure found in the everyday environment. Animal studies that have sugge sted that magnetic fields may offer potential therapy against neurodegen erative diseases requ ire confirmation and clarification. No additional insights regarding the effects of electric fields are possible, due to the almost complete absence of new data. As in the previous Opinion, the few available in vitro studies do not provide any support for drawing conclusions on the possible e ffects of ELF on the nervous system and neurobehavioral disorders. 3.8.3. Other effects of ELF fields exposure 3.8.3.1. Symptoms What was already known on this subject? As with RF exposure, exposu re to ELF fields has been suggested to cause symptoms, with some people describing themselves as being particularly sensitive to ELF exposure. This reported sensitivity falls within the broad definition of IEI-EMF. The 2009 Opinion concluded that no consistent relationship had been demonstrated between ELF exposure and symptoms, neither in the general public nor in people with IEI-EMF. What has been achieved since then? Since the 2009 Opinion, ten experimental pr ovocation studies have tested whether exposure to ELF affects symptoms, well-being or other subjective outcomes, or whether participants can discriminate betwee n real and sham ELF exposure. In a study described in detail in section 3.8.2. 2, Legros et al. (2012) analysed the effect of an exposure to a 60 Hz 1.8 mT ELF MF for the duration of one hour as compared to sham in 73 healthy participants (46 males an d 27 females, 28 \u00b1 9 years) using a double blind, counterbalanced cross- over design with test sess ions on separate days. The magnetic fields were generated by Helmholt z-like coils of 1.6 m diameter. Each test session lasted 105 min. Participants complete d a field detection ques tionnaire after each exposure. No evidence was found that they were able to discriminate between the conditions. McNamee et al. (2011) tested the effects of 60 Hz MF exposure at 200 \u00b5T for one hour in 10 healthy volunteers, using a double-bli nd, counterbalanced cross-over design. Physiological variables including heart rate (HR) , heart rate variability (HRV), skin surface temperature and blood pressure were assessed. Participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire relating to field detection. The exposure was delivered using the same apparatus as in Legros et al. (2012). This st udy identified no significant effects on HR, HRV or skin surface temperature. No effect s on blood pressure were observed either. Participants were unable to accurately detect the exposure condition. McNamee et al. (2010) tested 58 volunteers (mean age 27 +/-8.5 years) in a double- blinded protocol involving MF exposure at 60 Hz, 1800 T (1 hour of exposure, real or sham). Once again, exposure was delivered us ing the same apparatus as that in Legros et al. (2012) and participants were asked to complete a field dete ction questionnaire. Participants were unable to accurately detect the MF exposure condition. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 182 Corbacio et al. (2011) investigated a possible effect of a 60 Hz 3mT exposure (one hour duration) on 15 outcome parameters from 10 psychometric tests (see section 3.8.2.2) in a sample of 99 participants (60 females an d 39 males, 18-49 years) who were assigned randomly to one of three exposure condit ions: sham/sham; sham/MF exposure, and MF exposure/sham (a parallel-group design). Participants completed a field detection questionnaire at the end of each exposure. No evidence was found that they could discriminate between the conditions. Kim et al. (2012) assessed the e ffects of real or sham exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field (12.5 \u00b5T) generated above the heads of 15 IEI-EMF participants and 16 control participants. Each participant received one real and one sham exposure under double- blind conditions. Out of the eight symptoms that were measured, the only significant effect was a presumably spurious increa se in perceived warmth among control participants during the sham condition. Ther e was no evidence that either group could discriminate between the conditions. Kim et al. (2013) exposed 30 adults (mean age 27.9 plus or minus 5.9 years; 15 female) and 30 teenagers (mean age 14.8 plus or minus 1.4 years) in a double-blind, randomised experiment to a magnetic field (12.5\u00b5T at 60 Hz, generated using coils positioned either side of the participant's head) or a sham cond ition. Conditions occurred on separate days and lasted for 32 minutes. During and after each condition, participants were asked about the presence of eight symptoms and whether they co uld perceive any exposure. No effects of exposure were observed on these outcomes. McCarty et al. (2011) expose d a single participant with IEI-EMF to ten 100-second conditions involving a 60 Hz electric field (300 V/m around the head) and to ten sham conditions. The participant was asked to desc ribe any symptoms th at she experienced, which were subsequently coded as 'none,' 'mild' or 'more than mild.' In a second study, the same participant received sham, continuous or pulsed (10 Hz) field exposures (five of each, lasting 100 seconds) and was again as ked to describe her symptoms. The authors reported that in the first study, the partic ipant experienced more symptoms in the real condition than the sham condition. In the se cond study, she experienced more symptoms in the pulsed condition than the sham condition. However, it has subsequently been suggested that analysing the data accordin g to whether symptoms were present or absent would have resulted in a different se t of findings (Rubin et al., 2012; Marino et al., 2012). A third study involving this part icipant observed that she was unable to discriminate sham exposure fr om exposure to carrier frequencies of between 60 Hz to 500 kHz during a series of 300 two-second tria ls (McCarty et al. 2011). According to how the exposure was done, it is not possible to determine if transients at the on/off were present and thus part of the total exposure . Robertson et al. (2010) exposed 47 healthy participants under single-blind conditions to magnetic fields of either 100 \u00b5T (n=6), 200 \u00b5T (n=14), 1000 \u00b5T (n=10) or a sham condit ion (n=17) for 15 minutes. Exposures were preceded and followed by a functional MRI investigation. Reduced activation in the anterior cingulated and insula regions of the brain in re sponse to a painful thermal stimulation of the hand was observed following the 1000 \u00b5T and 200 \u00b5T conditions, suggesting reduced processing of pain stimuli. Participants in the 1000 \u00b5T condition were also significantly more likely to believe they were genuinely being exposed than those in the sham condition. Landgrebe et al. (2008) assessed the ability of 89 people with and 107 people without IEI-EMF to detect transcranial magnetic stim ulation by using a series of sham exposures and real exposures of intensities ranging fr om 0% to 57% of the maximum output of their stimulator (1.8 T). Perception thresh olds for the real magnetic pulses were comparable in the two groups. Maestu et al. (2013) assessed the impact of very low-intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation in a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Twenty-eight patients with fibromyalgia were randomised to receiv e exposure delivered through a magnetic stimulator consisting of an EEG cap with 33 stimulation coils evenly distributed across the head. Each coil produced a magnetic field of approximately 43 nT at a distance of 1cm Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 183 and 0.9nT at a distance of 4cm. A low frequency (8Hz) square function was used. Exposure occurred for one session per week ov er the course of ei ght weeks. Twenty-six patients were randomly allocated to rece ive an equivalent sham exposure. Median pressure pain threshold across 18 points on each patient's body was measured as the primary outcome. The stimulation group ex perienced a significantly improved pain threshold compared to the sham group ov er the eight weeks of the study. Some secondary outcomes (ability to perform daily activities, sleep quality, perceived pain) were also improved. Koteles et al. (2013) tested whether 29 people with and 41 people without IEI-EMF were able to detect the presence of a 50 Hz, 500 \u00b5T magnetic field applied over their right hand. The field was applied ten times per participant, in 60-second trials. Ten sham conditions were also applied. The control grou p was found to be no better than chance at detecting the exposure. The IE I-EMF group, however, were significantly better than chance. The ratio of hits to false alarms was 1.22 in the IEI-EMF group, while it was 1.14 in the control group. In addi tion, one member of the cont rol was able to detect the magnetic field \"almost perfec tly\" and replicated his perf ormance in a second testing session. The researchers noted th at additional testing of this participant is planned, and that replication of the study as a whole is warranted. Finally, in a double-blind provocation study focusing on the neurophysiological and behavioural effects of exposure for one hour to a 60 Hz, 1,800 \u00b5T magnetic field, Legros et al. (2012) found that their 73 participants were unable to accurately assess whether the field was present or not. Aside from these experimental provocation st udies, several observational studies have also assessed the possible association betwee n exposure to sources of ELF fields and symptoms or other subjective effects. Za manian et al. (2010) compared the mental health of three groups of workers: those exposed to electromagne tic fields and noise during their work at a power station, powe r station workers exposed to noise only, and administrative staff from a telecommunications company ex posed to neither noise nor electromagnetic fields. The authors noted wors e mental health in the group exposed to EMF. However, no attempt was made to control for any diffe rences in work patterns or culture between these groups. It is unlikely that the rema rkably high prevalence of mental disorder (78.2%) and so cial dysfunction (94.5%) iden tified within the noise and EMF group could be due solely to the effects of EMF. Monazzam et al. (2014) assessed subjective sl eep quality and levels of distress in 40 employees of a petrochemical complex. Partic ipants were categorised on whether they had higher or lower occupational exposures to EMF (based on the lo cation of the jobs: high voltage substations versus the contro l and engineering room s). Those categorised a s h i g h e r e x p o s u r e w e r e s i g n i f i c a n t l y m o r e l i k e l y t o s u f f e r f r o m p o o r s l e e p a n d psychological distress. However, the auth ors also measured EMF throughout the workplaces. Although details ar e scarce in the paper, they re ported finding no significant relationship between exposure level and either outcome. Korpinen and Paakkonen observed significan t associations between use of a desktop computer and psychological symptoms in their sample of 6121 Finns (Korpinen & Paakkonen, 2009; see Section 3.6.3 for deta ils). However, no attempt was made to control for other, non-EMF re lated differences between users and non-users of desktop computers. A subsequent analysis of th is dataset demonstrated that, amongst respondents who experienced neck pain, the occurrence of various other musculoskeletal symptoms was associated with the use of desk top or laptop computers, presumably as a result of poor ergonomics (Korpi nen, Paakkonen and Gobba, 2013). Milde-Busch et al. (201 0, see Section 3.6.3) observed so me associations between use of electronic devices and headaches among thei r sample or 1025 adolescents, but cautioned that the inconsistency in their findings made it unlikely that these findings were valid. Kucer et al. (2014) assessed the associatio n between self-reported computer use and symptoms in a sample of 350 people from Tu rkey, finding associat ions between higher Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 184 usage and headache, vertigo/dizziness and tension-anxiety, but without attempting to control for any potential confounding variables.3.14.5 Finally, Baliatsas et al. ( 2011) assessed whether the distance from a powerline to a participant's house was associated with reports of symptoms in their sample of 3611 residents of the Netherlands. Although perceived proximity was associated with symptom reports, objective proximity was not. Conclusions on symptoms The studies published since the 2009 Opinio n show discordant results. However, observational studies suffered from weaknesses and do not provide convincing evidence o f a n e f f e c t o f E L F e x p o s u r e o n s y m p t o m s i n t h e g e n e r a l p o p u l a t i o n a n d m o s t experimental evidence also points to the absence of any causal effect. 3.8.3.2. Reproductive effects The relationship of residential ELF-EMF exposure from powerlines to pregnancy outcomes was evaluated in two reports of a Canadian co hort study. The material consisted of more than 700,000 live births in Montr\u00e9al and Qu\u00e9bec City during 1990-2004 (Auger et al. 2011). Exposure assessment was based on di stance between residence and nearest powerline. The end-points eval uated included preterm birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age. Information on mother 's age, parity, mari tal and socioeconomic status, and ethnicity was also available. More than 12,000 births were classified in the highest exposure category (<50 m from the powerline). No increased risks were found for any of the outcomes (adjusted ORs 0.99- 1.04, with upper conf idence limit of less than 1.10). Some uncertainty was due to the fa ct that the address was available only at time of birth, and lack of information on po werline voltage, earlier reproductive outcomes or lifestyle factors such as smoking. A sim ilar analysis was conducted for stillbirths in 1998-2007 (Auger et al. 2012). The material cons isted of 2033 stillbirths, also including pregnancy terminations due to foetal anomalies (foetal death with weight 500g regardless of gestational age) and more than 500,000 live births (singl etons only for both categories). Non-significantl y elevated odds ratio was fo und for distance <25 m from powerline (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9-2.4), without a clear trend by distance or increase in the second highest exposure category. Besides th e above mentioned limitations, the analysis also had a small number of exposed stillbirth s (16 in the highest exposure category), which hinders precise risk estimation. An Italian case-control study assessed the relation between power lines and congenital anomalies (Malagoli et al. 2012). The material covered 228 congenital anomalies during 1998-2006 in Reggio Emilia (including livebirths, stillbirths and induce d abortions), with a similar number of pregnancies as controls (matched by calendar year, hospital and maternal age). Magnetic flux density was esti mated from distance from residence (during the first trimester) and average load of the line. The number of exposed subjects was too small to meaningfully evaluate the risk. Only one case and five controls had exposure levels exceeding 0.1 T (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0-2.0). A two-year prospective study in China enrolled pregnant women at 8 weeks of gestation and women planning pregnancy during 2010- 2012 (Wang et al. 2013). The study area chosen was two towns with high prevalence of ELF exposure from power lines. Spot measurements of 50 Hz magnetic field were performed with Nard a EFA-300 devices at the front door and on the street in front of the house. The median levels were 0.1\u00b5T and the exposed group was defined as those wi th a magnetic field above the median. In analyses of the front door measuremen ts, 8% of the pregnant women in the low exposure group had a miscarria ge, while the proportion in the high-exposure group was 12%. When the high-exposure group was subdi vided, no gradient was found for the average front door measurements, but a higher risk of miscarriage was seen in women with the highest maximal values of measured fi elds on the street in front of the house. Similarly, for continuous field strength me asurements a significan t increase was found only for the maximal values on the stre et, but not for the average front door Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 185 measurements. The women with miscarriage were slightly younger and had more commonly lower education and history of previous pregnancy problems or depression. Adjustment for these factors did not substantially alter the results. Details of recruitment and participation of th e subjects were not gi ven. No measurements were performed within the home of the su bjects, which reduces the validity of the results. The finding that miscarriage was associ ated with magnetic fi eld on the street, but not at the front door seems counterintuitive as front door should be a better indicator of the residential exposure. It was unclear why the maximal values and not the average for the street were used in the analysis and this may be a post hoc decision suggesting exploratory data analysis. Only a third of the subjects had exposure levels above the median, but this could be due to a peak ed exposure distri bution (kurtosis). A large cohort study covered 140,000 live si ngleton births in 2004-2008 in Northwest England (de Vocht et al. 2014). Residential prox imity to power lines, cables, substations, or towers was used as the exposure indica tor and it was estimated based on postal codes. The outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age and were obtained from a perinatal surv ey database covering 21 maternity units. Information was also available on maternal ag e ethnicity and parity. Complete data on all variables was available only for 53% of the bi rths and information maternal smoking only for a third of the included births. An alternative analysis using propensity score matching show ed a similar result, with a lower birth weight for residence <50 m th ough of smaller size and borderline significance, but the findings were not consistent internally as a higher birth weight was found for distance <100 m (de Vocht et al. 2014). The frequencies of various outcomes ranged 6-9% (7800-12,000 cases). Less than 1% resided within 200 m of the cl osest ELF-EMF source and dist ance was associated with deprivation index. No statistically significant differences in risk were found for proximity to a source of 50m or less, 100m or less or 200m or less compared to the reference distances for any of the selected birth ou tcomes. The highest exposure group (<50 m distance) had less than 10 events for all outcomes in the main analysis, with odds ratios ranging 1.3-1.7. Higher, but non-significant o dds ratios were reported in the subset of the data from the most recent years with maternal data available. An analysis using the mean birth weight of all babies, instead of the proportion of ma rkedly reduced birth weight, a significantly lower birth weight wa s found for residence <50 m from the closest EMF source based on 89 children (difference 125 g). The main analysis did not reve al any significant association, and it is unclear if the analysis of mean birth weight was pre-specified or carried out post hoc. The validity of the exposure classification based on postal codes rather than house coordinates is uncertain. In conclusion, recent results do not show an effect of the ELF fields on the reproductive function in humans. 3.8.3.3. Effects of foetal exposure to ELF on children's health Maternal ELF exposure during pregnancy was associated with the risk of asthma in the offspring by age 12 (Li et al. 2011). A cohort of pregnant women was enrolled during the first trimester of pregnancy and a 24-hour measurement was carried out. An interview on socio-demographic and li festyle factors was also carried ou t. Information on diseases in the offspring was obtained from the database of the health insura nce provider. Of the original 1063 women, 626 were included in the analysis and a fifth of their children were later diagnosed with asthma. Compared with the lowest exposure decile, 10% with the highest exposure had a statically significant more than three-fold risk of asthma. The risk was also higher relative to the majority of the women in the cohort (with exposure between 10th and 90th percentiles), but the difference was not significant. Yet, the risk of asthma was also significantly associated with the mean field strength as a continuous variable. Subgroup analyses showed the risk mainly among first-born children and the Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 186 risk was also higher among mothers with a history of asthma. The results appear surprising, but the study has strengths incl uding prospective setting with a measured exposure and information on several potentia l confounding factors. To some extent the findings may reflect a reduced risk in the su bset with the lowest exposure levels and more detailed information on exposure -effect relation would be useful. An analysis of childhood ob esity from the same study su ggested an association with residential EMF exposure (Li et al. 2012). The material was the same as above, with 733 mother-child pairs available for the analys is. Exposure classification was based on dividing the subjects into three groups based on the 90th percentile of the magnetic field level of the 24-hour measuremen t (cut-points at 0.15 and 0.25 T). Obesity was defined as weight exceeding the 97.5th percentile of the CDC growth charts. However, as many as 12.9% of the children were considered to be obese. On average 11 (median 33) weight measurements were available per ch ild. The age span covered was not reported, but 40% were followed up until at least age 11 years. For a subset of about 45%, information on activities and eating habits wa s also obtained at some point of time. The results indicated a significant association between measured magnetic field and childhood obesity (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.05-3.22 for the hi ghest exposure category). In this paper, no risk estimate for a continuous exposure indicator was reported. The association was even stronger for those follow ed up until age 11 years and for persistent obesity (defined as more than half of all weight measurements meeting the 97.5 th percentile criterion). In an analysis using body mass index for children aged six years or older, a non-significant association was found fo r field strength >0.15 T (OR 1.87, 95% CI 0.90-3.86). The strengths were similar to those mentioned above. Exposure classification was not consistent with the earlier paper and the defini tion of obesity was not state of the art (as ideally body fat should be measured) or even consistent with the standard definition of overweight or obesity (which is based on body mass index, rather than weight alone). T h e W H O r e c o m m e n d a t i o n i s + 2 S D i n t e r m s o f B M I f o r o v e r w e i g h t a n d + 3 S D f o r obesity, while CDC uses cut-points at 85th and 95th percentiles. The motivation for adoption of non-standard definition in the paper is unclear. In conclusion, recent results fo r the first time show an asso ciation between ELF fields and childhood obesity and asthma; however, these re sults need to be reproduced to evaluate their significance for risk assessment. 3.8.4. Conclusions on health effects from ELF fields Neoplastic diseases The new epidemiological studies are consistent with earlier findings of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 \u00b5T. As stated in the previous Opinions, no mechanisms have been identified and no support is existing from experimental studies that could explain these findings, which, together with shortcomings of the epidemiological studies prevent a causal interpretation. Nervous system Epidemiological studies do not provide convincing evidence of an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including de mentia, related to ELF MF exposure. Furthermore, they show no evidence for adve rse pregnancy outcomes in relation to ELF MF. The studies concerning childhood health outcomes in relation to maternal residential ELF MF exposure during pregnancy involve some methodological issues that need to be addressed. They suggest implau sible effects and need to be replicated independently, before they can be used for risk assessment. Largely consistent with earlier results, recent studies have re ported that exposure to ELF m a g n e t i c f i e l d s h a s n o e f f e c t o n a c t i v i t y or locomotion. There is some evidence from animal studies that exposure to ELF MF ma y affect the performance of spatial memory tasks (both deficits and improvements ha ve been reported) and engender subtle increases in behavioural anxiety and stress. Other studies have investigated potential molecular and cellular mechanisms, and despite a number of studies continue to report Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 187 candidate mechanisms, particularly regarding effects on reactive oxygen species, none has been firmly identified th at operates at exposure le vels found in the everyday environment. Symptoms Overall, existing studies do not provide conv incing evidence for a causal relationship between ELF MF exposure an d self-reported symptoms. Other effects Recent results do not show an effect of the ELF fields on the reproductive function in humans. 3.9. Health effects from Static Fields including MRI exposure 3.9.1. Human studies What was already known? The previous SCENHIR looked at several studies performed where volunteers were exposed to either the static field of an MRI only, or to a diagnostic procedure which also includes exposure to low an d high frequency fields. The previous Opinion concluded that instantaneous effects on neuronal functioning of movement in particular, through a SMF or SMF gr adient as used in clinical practice might be possible. However SCENHI R stressed the need for furt her confirmation of these studies. What has been achieved since then? In 2009 ICNIRP updated their gu idelines for static magnetic field exposure, and in the paper (ICNIRP, 2009) a review of the scientific evidence is given, from what is known on the interaction mechanism(s) to epidemiological studies. The new values are 2 T for head and trunk, and for limbs 8 T can be allowed. The values are to be regarded as spatial peak exposure limits. Since the previous SCENIHR report (2009) a few other studies have been published. A systematic review and meta-ana lysis of studies, which have assessed the health effects of static magnetic fields, identified four studies published between 1992 and 2007 which included sensory perceptions as an outcom e (Heinrich et al., 2011). All four reported effects including dizziness and vertigo. Yama guchi-Sekino et al. (2011) reviewed the properties of static and puls ed EMF that affect biological systems, and discussed the recent ICNIRP update. Three further observational studies including subjective outcomes have appeared since the 2009 Opinion was published. These ques tioned MRI employees occupationally exposed to a 9.4 T MRI (Patel et al., 2008), and healthy volunteers or patients who underwent a 7 T or 1.5 T MRI (Theysohn et al., 2008; Heilmaier et al., 2011). Each study identified several symptoms attributed to the exposure, in particular vertigo. The studies by Theysohn et al. (2008) an d Heilmaier et al. (2011) both suggested that 7 T is more likely to result in symptoms than 1.5 T, alth ough these symptoms are seemingly still well tolerated by the majority of patients. Franco et al. (2008) published a review on health effects of exposure to the static magnetic fi eld (SMF) in MRI. From cellular studies they did not find any specific effect as a consequence of exposure to SMF. Studies on volunteers showed that short-term exposure to SMF induces a variety of acute effects: (i) vertigo, nausea and a metallic taste in the mouth occur during body or head movement with SMF in T range, (ii) changes in blood pressure and heart rate within the range of physiological variability occur for exposures to SMF up to 8 T. These findings are in line with several publications on acute transien t adverse effects (such as dizziness, nausea, headaches, a metallic taste and visual disturbances) related to exposure to the static and time-varying magnetic fields present in, but also surrounding MRI systems. Nor were effects on cognition measurable immediately after exposure had ended (Schlamann et al. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 188 2010a). Van Nierop et al. (2012) showed that the neuro-cognit ive functioning is modulated when human volunteers were expose d to movement in stray field from a 7 T MRI scanner. In a subsequent paper based on the same experiment, van Nierop et al. (2013) tested whether exposure to a sham, low and high static magnetic stray field from their 7 T MRI scanner affected body sway. Re duced postural stability was identified across several measures. Data from a controlled trial using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) does suggest a transient alteration in cortical excitability after undergoing an MRI investigation (Schlamann et al. 2010b). Although a threshold level seems to exist for at least some of the acute effects (Cavin et al. 2007), all effe cts could already be me asured well below 2 Tesla and 6 T/s. Heinrich et al. (2013) published a study on how cognitive functions in subjects undergoing MRI are acutely impaired by stat ic magnetic fields. 41 healthy subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological examination while in MR units of differing field strengths (1.5, 3.0, and 7.0 T), including a mock imager with no magnetic field as a control condition. The exposure was not found to have a significant effect on cognitive function at any field strength . However, sensory perceptions did vary according to field strength. Dizziness, nystagmus, phosphenes , and head ringing were related to the strength of the static magnetic field. Within the same study, also stress markers in blood and saliva were investigated, with a negative outcome (Gilles et al. 2013). Field surveys of MR engineers (De Vocht et al. 2006b) and nurses (Wil\u00e9n et al. 2010) routinely working with MRI scanners have furt her shown that they regularly experience adverse transient effects including dizziness/vertigo, nausea, concentration problems, memory loss, tiredness or drowsiness, illusions of movement, and ringing sensations in the head during their work as well as sufferi ng from sleeping disorder. The frequency of occurrence of these symptoms seemed mainly to be associated to the strength of the MR systems, the time spent in th eir neighbourhood, and the sp eed with which workers move through these fields. Recent experimental studies among voluntee rs who were placed inside the static magnetic stray field of MRI scanners suggest an effect of static field exposure on eye movement [Roberts et al., 2011; Mian et al ., 2013]. Subjects developed nystagmus while lying in the bore of 3 T and 7 T MRI sca nners. The authors propose an underlying mechanism based on Lorentz forces acting on the endolymph (i.e. the fluid in the labyrinth of the inner ear) [Roberts et al ., 2011; Antunes et al., 2012; Mian et al., 2013; Glover et al., 2014, Ward et al., 2014]. More recently, Theysohn et al. (2014) recorded body axis rotation and sway path in 46 healthy volunteers in total. Participants were e x p o s e d t o n o M R e x p o s u r e , t o a 1 . 5 T M R I e x p o s u r e o r t o o n e o f f o u r 7 T b r a i n M R I scenarios (normal, with no RF excitation, with no gradients, or with a short duration of exposure achieved by moving pa rticipants into the bore and directly out again). Exposure for all sessions lasted 30 minutes, except for the short 'in and out' exposure which lasted about one minute. Sway path data showed si gnificantly greater sway in participants exposed to the 30 minute 7T conditions at tw o minutes post exposu re. This effect had resolved by 15 minutes post exposure. All 7T conditions were al so associated with changes in a measure of body axis rota tion, which persisted at 15 minutes post exposure. Schaap et al. (2014) has recently conducte d an observational study among more than 300 employees of clinical and research MRI facilities in the Netherlands. The study reports on the occurrence of acute transi ent symptoms among these workers, and assesses the association of these symptoms with static magnetic field exposure. The study shows an increased incidence of acute transient symptoms among health care and research staff working with closed-bore MRI scanners of 1.5 to 7 Tesla. Incidence of symptoms was positively associated with scanner magnet strength. Noteworthy is also a recent study by Rausch enberg et al. (2014) on reported symptoms on individuals scanned in 7 and 9.2 T scann ers and a study showing promising results Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 189 when using diphenhydramine in the prevention of vertigo an d nausea among patients at 7 T MRI. Both studies however were on pa tients and therefore hardly relevant for employees exposed to the stray-fields of ultra-high field MRI-scanners. The (long-term) health significance of thes e acute neurobehavioral effects and reported symptoms among employees who repetitively work near MRI systems is as yet unknown. Nevertheless, these dose-dependent effects (De Vocht et al. (2006b), De Vocht et al. (2007b), Wil\u00e9n et al. (2010) coul d theoretically lead to an incr eased risk of accidents and errors by workers that are harmful for themse lves or for patients under their care, for example during MRI-guided in terventional procedures). M\u00f6llerl\u00f6kken et al. (2012) investigated if an acute high exposure to EMF could have possible adverse effects on male reproduc tive health. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers participated in a balanced cross-over study with exposure using a head scan in real MRI with whole-body transmitting coil and one set up for sham MRI exposure. Serum-blood samples of inhibin B, testosterone, binding globuline and estradiol were taken before and after the different scans. Ne ither immediately afte r, nor after 11 days were any differences observed in the hormon e levels comparing real and sham MRI. The lack of effects of EMF on male reproductive hormones should be rea ssuring to the public and especially for men examined in MRI. Adverse effects on other endpoints than male reproduction or possible chronic effect of multiple MRI scans were not investigated in this study. There is some evidence on genotoxic effect s in patients undergoing MRI examination. Simi et al. (2008) studied the level of micronucleated lymphocytes in cultured lymphocytes of eight subjects before and afte r a cardiac MRI (CMR). Energy absorbed by the subjects was calculated to range from 19 to 306 J. An increase in micronucleus frequency, measured by the cytokinesis bl ock method, was reported in lymphocyte cultures established immediately after the MRI in all individuals, with a 2-fold increase in mean micronucleus frequency in comparison with the samples collected before the examination. A statistically significant increase in micronuclei was still seen in samples obtained 24 h after the scan but not after 48 h, 72 h, 90 h or 120 h. Fiechter et al. (2013) studied genotoxic effects in 20 prospect ively enrolled patients who underwent 1.5 T CMR. A commercially available MR scanner equipped with a maximum gradient strength of 42 mT/m and a maxi mum gradient speed of 180 mT/m/ms was used and the mean CMR scan duration was 68 + 22 min with an average contrast media bolus of 15 + 4 ml. Peripheral mononuclear ce lls were studied for DNA damage using immunofluorescence microscopy of foci positive for ph osphorylated gamma-H2AX in nuclear DNA, indicative of sites of DNA doub le strand break repair. The median and mean numbers of foci per mononucle ar cell were, respectively , 0.066 and 0.143 in baseline samples (collected prior CMR scan) an d 0.190 and 0.270 after the CMR scan; the difference (1.6-fold for median, 1.9-fold for mean) was statistically significant (P<0.05). In addition, gamma-H2AX-positive foci were qu antified in CD3-positi ve T-lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The analysis revealed a stat istically significant increase in geometric mean of fluorescence intensity (arbitrary uni ts) of T-lymphocytes after the MRI (median 3232, 1.17-fold; mean 3395, 1.14-fold) as comp ared with samples collected before the scan (2758; mean 2989) which was statistically significant. Discussion on human studies The studies on effects on DNA integrity after an MRI scan are clearly of interest to follow up. However, it is not clear what part of the exposure in the scanner causes the effect: static, switched gradient field or the pulsed RF field. From other in vivo and in vitro studies it seems unlikely that the static field alone could ca use this. Further studies on DNA integrity and MRI exposure are needed, an d perhaps it is time to discuss cohort studies of patient undergoing scans. Conclusion on human studies Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 190 Observational studies have shown that movement in strong static magnetic fields may cause subjective outcomes like vertigo and naus ea. These are more likely to occur in field strengths above 2 T. 3.9.2. Animal studies What was already known on this subject? The previous SCENIHR Opinion pointed out that despite the fact that there are quite a few studies published, the data are still no t adequate for a proper risk assessment, primarily because of many mixed an d sometimes contradictory findings. What has been achieved since then? Several studies on animals have been published since the previous Opinion, covering work on nervous system effects and behavi our, embryonic development, and various physiological parameters and organ functions. In addition, there are also studies aimed at understanding more basic interaction mechanisms. There are no studies that have directly investigated any relationship between SMF exposure and tumour development. Howe ver, one study (Strelczyk et al. 2009) investigated Syrian gold hamsters carrying syngenic A-Mel-3 melanomas implanted into the dorsal skin. Three days after tumour ce ll deposition, animals we re exposed to a 586 mT SMF for 3 h. Subsequently, tumour angiogenesis and microcirculation as well as tumour development was followed for seven days. Compared to control animals, tumours in exposed animals were growing more slowly, and displayed impaired microcirculation (investigated with in vivo fluorescence microscop y). Additional histologic investigations suggested that the vessels in SMF-expose d tumours were fewer in number and with structural deficiencies. Reproduction and development The nematode C. elegans is a recognized and valuable model system for studies of many biological processes, especially on the molecular levels, including development and aging. The usability is due in part to the short life-span and a multitude of well characterized mutant strains that are available. In a stud y by Hung et al. (2010), both wild-type and mutant nematodes were exposed to SMF (up to 200 mT; continuously during the entire experiment). In wild-type nematodes, the maximal life-span was shortened from 31 to 24 days by a 200 mT exposure, and the medi an life span from 16 to 13 days. The expression of genes known to be asso ciated with aging and development of C. elegans were investigated with quantitative real-time RT-PCR, showing that SMF exposure indeed affected expression of severa l genes (clk-1, lim-7, unc-3, age-1). In addition, mutant nematodes deficient in these genes did not respond to the SMF. The shortening of the life-span was in further experime nts seen to be a function of accelerating through larval stages of development. Almost all significan t effects were seen at 200 mT, whereas lower B-field strengths mostly were ineffective. Another model organism was used by Savic et al. (2011) who follo wed development and viability in the fruitfly D. melanogaster , from egg to adult. In parallel, a closely related species, D. hydei was also studied. The specimens were exposed to a 60 mT SMF continuously during the investigated period. There was a small but statistically significant reduction of developmental time in D. hydei , and decreased viability (measured as percentage of eclosed adults) in both specie s. The eclosion was also faster in both species. In a study on pregnant mice (C57BL/6) Laszlo et al. (2009) showed that a gradient SMF (2.8-476.7 mT whole body exposure) delaye d preterm birth induced by the bacterial endotoxin LPS. The exposure occurred for 40 mi n on a daily basis, starting either on day 1 or day 14 of gestation. LPS was admi nistered on day 15 and preterm birth was expected within 17 h. The group treated from day 1 had preterm birth delayed more than those that were treated the day before LPS injection. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 191 Spermatogenesis in adult male albino rats was studied by Monfarad et al. (2009). The animals were exposed to a 1.5 T MF (expos ure poorly described) for 30 min, with or without prior treatment to vitamin C and/or vitamin E (intraperitoneal injection 30 min before MF exposure) and sacrificed 16 or 29 da ys post exposure. On histological sections, germ cell number and se miniferous tubule diameter were investigated. Both end-points were reduced in the exposed animals, an ef fect which was counteracted by the vitamin injections. Nervous system effects The group of Houpt et al. have published a series of studies on the effects of strong static MF on behaviour. The studies have typically employed female adult Sprague-Dawley rats, which were exposed to a 14.1 T SMF, within the bore of a magnetic used for MRI (with the RF off). This field strength level is very high, and not very likely encountered. It has previously been reported th at strong MF causes vertigo and furthermore circling behaviour, acquisition of a condition taste aversion (CTA) to saccharine, and induction of c-fos in the brain stem of rodents (Houpt et al. 2003). In a study by Cason et al. (2009), the hypothesis that such effects of SMF are dependent on the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear was tested. Chemically labyrinth-ectomized rats (by intratympanic injections of Na-arsanalite, which destroys the hair cell s ) a s w e l l a s i n t a c t but sham-labyrinth- ectomized (saline injection inst ead of Na-arsanalite) rats were exposed (30 min) to the 14.1 T MF. Intact rats displayed expected be haviour (circling, saccharine avoidance) and increased c-fos expression, wher eas ectomized rats showed no increase in circling, did not acquire a CTA, or display elevated c-fos levels. In another stud y from the same group (Houpt et al. 2010), the expe rimental paradigm was used to show that repeated treatment (2-3 times 30 min) to the 14.1 T MF causes habituation. Only momentary passages into and out of the MF was enough for CTA, whereas longer exposures were needed for circling to occur (Houpt et al . 2011), suggesting that substantial exposure time is needed for rats to display all behavioural effects of exposure. Finally, the most recent study (Houpt et al. 2012) shows that rats immediatel y tend to tilt their heads during exposure, in a direction oppo site to the circ ling direction. The group of Laszlo et al. have published se veral studies on SMF and pain reduction. The study by Antal and Laszlo (2009) showed that whole body exposure of adult male mice (Balb/c) for 30 min, once per day (14 days ) to an inhomogeneous SMF (476 mT peak) alleviates allodynic pain in the hind paw. Th ere was a modest effect if the exposure was applied on days 1-14 post operation, and a mu ch stronger effect if the exposure took place on days 15-28 after surgery. Pain redu ction was seen also in another experimental paradigm, where male CFLP mice were subjec ted to a writhing test (Laszlo and Gyires 2009). Pain was induced by i.p. injection of 0. 6% acetic acid, whereafter the stretching and writhing movements of the animals were recorded. Animals were either exposed to a 0.1, 0.3, or 3 mT field outside an MRI magnet , or to a 3 T field inside the magnet bore. The exposure followed immediately upon acetic acid injection, and th e animals\u00b4 reactions were followed for 30 min. The 3 T exposure re duced the writhing frequency compared to controls with 68%, which was significantly di fferent from all other treatments. A different exposure system was used in another work (Laszlo et al. 2009), where the male CFLP mice were once again subjected to the writhing-inducing acetic acid injections. The exposure (inhomogeneous SMF, 2-754 mT) sign ificantly reduced writhing 10, 20, or 30 min after exposure (also 10, 20 or 30 min). In order to see if behaviour characteristics were affected by the MF expo sure, possible anxiogenic or an xiolytic effects were studied with the elevated plus maze test, and locomotor activity was investigated by means of the \"Conducta System for beha vioural and activity studie s\". No other effects than reduced writhing were seen after exposures. It is unclear from these articles if blinded conditions were used when possible. A very comprehensive study was published by Hoyer et al. (2012) who exposed pregnant mice to a 7 T static MF daily (75 min per da y) from day 1.5 to 18.5 post conception. This period allows for exposure to be pres ent during implantation, early embryonic development, and organogenesis, all very se nsitive stages in development. Pups were Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 192 subsequently investigated with a battery of behavioural tests, from an age of 10 weeks and onwards, which means that the animals were adult duri ng testing. Both exposure and sham exposure (a mock MRI scanner) were performed. In addition, a sound recording was made from the MF exposure situation and played back to the sham exposed animals. Tests were performed on tw o cohorts (separated six months in time), that comprised both male and female offsprin g. In total, 26 male animals and 18 females were investigated. No differences in body weight between exposed and sham exposed were noticed, although gender differences were seen (males heavier in both cohorts). Exploration behaviour was investigated by Novel Cage, Open Field, and Novel Object Tests, with no documented exposure effects. Absence of exposure effects was also documented after motor coordination tests (Rot arod), thermal pain sensitivity (Hot Plate Test), anxiety like behaviour (Elevated O- Maze, Dark-Light-Box Test), associative learning (fear conditioning), and spatial working memory (T-Maze). There was a trend (statistically not significant) towards an effect of exposure for immobility latency in the Porsolt Forced Swim Test, which investigated depressive-like behaviour. This study, thus, indicates that repeated pre-natal exposure to a 7 T MF does not exert adverse effects on emotional and cognitive behaviour in the adult mouse. Two additional studies from the same group regarding fertility, pregnancy and embryonic and post-embryonic development was subseq uently published. In Zaun et al. (2013), mice were exposed daily in uter o to different static magnetic field strengths at the bore entrance or in the isocenter of 1.5 T and 7 T MRI systems du ring the entire course of prenatal development. The repr oductive organs and the fertility in adulthood of these animals were investigated. The only observed effect was reduced placental weight in the offspring of the in utero exposed female mice . Other parameters including fertility were not affected. In the study by Zahedi et al . (2013), pregnant mice were exposed for 75 minutes daily during the entire course of pr egnancy at the bore en trance, representing the position of medical staff, and at the isocenter, representi ng the position of patients, of a 1.5 T and a 7 T human MRI scanner. The au thors reported that no effect of static magnetic field strength was observed with regard to pregnancy rate, duration of pregnancy, litter size, still births, malformation s, sex distribution, or postpartum death of offspring. During the first 8 weeks of postna tal development, mice exposed in utero to a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T or stronger showed a slight delay in weight gain and in time to eye opening compared to controls. Another approach to see if behaviour is affect ed by SMF was seen in a paper by Lee et al. (2012) who performed experiments on the nematode C. elegans . Adult worms were exposed for up to eight days in SMF rang ing from zero to 200 mT. The mobility end- points crawling speed and mobility (number of sine waves propagating per minute along the body axis) were recorded. A significant decline (ca 25-40%) in both end-points was seen from exposure for four days and lo nger, at field strengths of 150 and 200 mT (stronger effects at 200 mT). Gene expression analysis of 120 randomly selected genes revealed that certain genes involved in ap optosis and oxidative stress were upregulated by exposure. The importance of apoptotic path ways for the mobility decline increased by the SMF was then further stre ngthened by use of selected mutant nematode strains. Exposure to a 200 mT static MF did not caus e mobility decline in these animals. A combination of an in vivo and in vitro study was presented in the interesting paper by Nikolic and co-workers (2012) who employed the spontaneously active Br neuron from the brain-subesophageal ganglion of the snail Helix pomatia . Both the intact snail and the isolated Br neuron were exposed to a 10 mT SMF for 15 min. In the brain, exposure caused increases in the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase (the \"Na+/K+-pump\"), in the activity of the Na+/H+-exchanger (leading to more alkaline cellular conditions,) and increased ATP consumption. Current clamp re cording of the dissected neuron confirmed the increased activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase, leading to a hy perpolarization of the membrane resting potential. These effects were abolished if agents blocking phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation were admi nistered during exposure, suggesting that this exposure primarily causes changes in phosphorylation status of membrane- Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 193 associated proteins in specific signal transduction pathways, which then lead to effects on the physiology of the cell. Metabolism Some studies on effects on in vivo metabolism have been pub lished in recent years. A series of papers from the same group (E lferchichi et al. 2010a; 2010b; 2011; Jahbib et al. 2010) have repeatedly investigated a 128 mT SMF and its effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in 6-7 week old male Wistar ra ts. In one study (Elferchichi et al. 2010a), animals were exposed for 1 h/day during 15 da ys. At the end of the exposure period, a series of parameters were measured during post-prandial conditions. The exposed group (six animals) displayed increased levels of blood glucose, whereas the insulin levels were lowered. Furthermore, increased levels of glycerol, cholesterol, phospholipids and lactate were documented, whereas triglyceride levels did not deviate from those in control animals (n=6). A glucose tolerance test on fa sted animals showed a significant increase in blood glucose among exposed, noticeable af ter 20 min. On the tissue level, glycogen depositions in skeletal mu scle and liver were depleted (44% and 25% decrease compared to controls) in exposed rats. In another study (Elferchichi et al. 2011) the same group used the same experimental protoc ols in a comparison with Zucker rats (a diabetic strain). The outcome of the SMF expo sure on the Wistar rats (hyperglycemia, low insulin, depleted glycogen reserves) ov erlapped with non-exposed Zucker rats. The conclusion is that the SMF exposure triggers a pre-diabetic state in normal rats. In Lahbib et al. (2010) the results of exposure is that if exposu re is 15 days instead of five, effects on glucose and lipid metabolism are more pronounced. It is unc lear if these three papers constitute separate studies, or if th e results from one single experiment are used in separate papers. Furthermore, the numbers of animals are small, and it is not clear if the animals are from the same or separate litters. A contradictory finding regarding effects on glucose metabolism is provided in a study from Laszlo et al. (2011) where CD1 mice are exposed to an inhomogeneous static MF (2.8-476.7 mT peak-to-peak). The authors in vestigate body weight (although only in another strain, CFLP), blood glucose and no ciceptive temperature threshold (increasing temperature hot-plate test) in exposed and sh am-exposed rats, as well as in rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ). Exposure went on daily (30 min) for up to 12 weeks. MF exposure had no effects on the investigated end-points in normal rats, whereas in the group treated with the highest levels of ST Z (and thus most diabetic), the exposure caused a significant glucose decrease. This outcome is opposite to the diabetogenic effects of SMF reported above. A major differe nce is naturally the different species (rats and mice respectively). Both research groups fail to report if blinded conditions were employed or not. In yet another paper from Elferchichi et al. (2010b), the effect s of SMF on ionic composition in the rat spinal cord were investigated. These are probably the same animals as those that were used in the other studies from this group. At the end of the five day exposure period, (128 mT; 1 h/day), samples from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and from the blood serum were analysed with respect to calcium (increase in CSF after exposure, unchanged in serum), iron (inc reased in CSF, decreased in serum), magnesium (unchanged) and copper (unchanged). Other effects Lin and co-workers (2009) performed a stud y where 5-week-old Balb/c mice were injected with the bacterial endotoxin LPS (lipopolysaccharide) which causes sepsis. The LPS was injected intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg which caused 90% mortality after 48 h. Animals were either controls, or treated with a 0.25 T static MF for 1 or 2 h before LPS administration, alternat ively after the LPS inje ction. The survival rate was higher in SMF- treated animals than in unex posed, and highest (47%) in the group pre-treated for 2 h before LPS. Further studies suggested that th e SMF may cause this protective effect by stimulating release of IL-1ra (interleukin-1 receptor agonist), which would counteract the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1 that LPS causes. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 194 Wang et al. (2009) employed a gradient SMF (0.2-0.4 T; 2.09 T/m; exposure 1-11 cts on angiogenesis in vivo an in vitro . The in vivo model (the chicken choioallantoic membrane) displayed significantly lower vascular numbers, and also lower haemoglobin content than unexposed samples. Wound healing in diabetic 3 month old Spra gue-Dawley rats was improved by 180 mT SMF (Shen et al. 2010). Wound healing rate , gross healing time, and wound tensile strength were all positively infl uenced by exposure (5-19 days). The use of SMF for blood pressure buffering during acute blood pressure rise was investigated in a study on adult male rabbits (Gmitrov 2010). Blood pressure was pharmacologically increased (successive injec tions of nitroprusside and phenylephrine), and the effects of a 300 mT SMF were compared to those of the ca lcium-channel blocker verapamil. The permanent magnets generating the MF were located at the level of the sinocarotid baroreceptors. Expo sure for 40 min caused a significant buffering of the blood pressure increase, although at a level lower than the ones obtained with verapamil. Exposure of male adult Wistar rats to a 128 mT SMF (1 h/day; 5 days ) caused changes in radical homeostasis, specifically anti oxidant enzymes (Ghodbane et al. 2011). Concomitantly, the exposure was seen to deplete selenium levels (kidney, muscle, brain), which was suggested by the authors to cause disturbances in the antioxidant systems. Discussion on in vivo effects A number of studies are reporting that effects occur with SMF exposures in animals, at B- field levels from mT - T. However, many of the findings are limited to single studies in the specific area, and need replications be fore any firm conclu sions can be drawn. Over the years, many studies report on e ffects on the nervous system. Several of the findings regarding nervous syst em effects reported here are contradictory. On one hand, studies that are reporting pain reduction are co nsistent and in line with what the group in question have reported prev iously. On the other hand, the studies where behaviour has been investigated, including at very high field strength levels, are not generating consistent effects. Mechanisti c studies addressing basic e ffects on neurons would have the potential to resolve several of these inconsistencies. Inconsistency is also obvious in the studie s focussing on glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar exposure conditions are causing opposi te effects, in rats and mice respectively. Conclusions on in vivo effects Taken together, the findings reported here do not provide any firmer foundation for a proper risk assessment of stat ic MF exposure than what wa s available for the previous Opinion. 3.9.3. In vitro studies What was already known on this subject? Concerning in vitro studies the previous Opinion of 2009 stated that the results support the hypothesis that SMFs can affect the expression of spec ific genes in mammalian cells, although the effect is depe ndent on the exposure charac teristics (duration, field gradient). Studies on genotoxicity, cell growth and apoptosis provided not univocal results. What has been achieved since then? Several endpoints have been investigated afte r exposure of different cell types to SMFs. The results are reported belo w and summarized in Table 17. Gene expression and genotoxicity Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 195 Alteration of gene expression has been detected in several investigations carried out using primary mammalian cells as well as cell lines exposed to SMFs from few \u00b5Tesla up to 10 T. Changes in the expression of MACF-1, a gene encoding for cytoskeletal proteins, were detected in osteoblast-like cells exposed to la rge gradient high MF (magnetic force fields of -1360, 0 and 1312T2/m). Different effects (up- or do wn-regulation) were found as a function of the exposure cond itions (Qian et al., 2009). Up-regulation of hematopoietic and cell cycle-related genes was found in human placental and umbilical cord blood cells expo sed to 10 T for 16 h (M onzen et al., 2009). By exposing HUVEC cells to 60 or 120 \u00b5T for 1 or 24 h Martino and co-workers found no changes of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) gene expression, although an up- regulation of the eNOS (endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase) was recorded after 24 h exposure (Martino et al., 2010). Feng and co-workers (2013) exposed human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells for 1-4 h to a 0.5 T, MF. Cell growth inhibition was detected in exposed cultures compared to controls (no sham exposed samples were incl uded in the study). Moreover, microarray of cells exposed for 1 hour to MF showed that 19 cell cycle and apopto sis-related genes had 2-fold up-regulation and 40 genes had 2-fold down-regulation. MF also significantly arrested cells in G2 and M phases. Politanski et al. (2013) investigat ed the effect of static magn etic fields on ROS formation in lymphocytes from male albino Wistar rats . The exposure was carri ed out at 0 mT (50 \u00b5T magnetic field induction opposite to the geomagnetic field) and 5 mT by placing cell cultures inside a pair of Helmholtz coils, which provided a highly homogenous field. ROS formation was measured after 15 min, 1 and 2 h of exposure to the SMF by using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dich lorofluorescin diacetate. Th e results indicated that a significant increase in ROS formation was indu ced by 5 mT exposure compared either to unexposed cultures and to cult u r e s e x p o s e d t o 0 m T . I n t h i s p a p e r , t h e e f f e c t o f c o - exposures to SMF and x rays was also inve stigated (see sectio n 3.11.2). Comparisons were carried out with respect to control cultures (no sham-exposed cultures were set up). Gioia et al. (2013) evaluated the effect of chronic exposure to a 2mT SMF on primary cultures of swine granulosa cells (GCs). This cell model was select ed due to its pivotal role in female reproduction; in fact, GCs surround and sustain the development of the female gamete, providing meta bolic and regulatory factor s for the oocyte. Moreover, they have an important endocrine activity concurring to the ovarian steroid hormones production. No effect on cell viability was detected, but the doubling time was significantly reduced in exposed samples after 72 h of culture. At th e same time, the cell length and thickness significantly changed, while the cell orie ntation was unaffected. Evident modifications were induced on actin and a- tubulin cytoskeleton after 3 days of exposure and, simultaneously, a change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and mitochondrial activity started to become evident. Moreov er, exposure longer than 72 h determined a significant alteration of progesterone and es trogen production. In this study, no sham- exposed samples were set up. The results obta ined in exposed cultures were compared to control cultures (incubator). Nakamichi and co-workers exposed primary fo etal rat brain progenitor cells to 100 mT from 2 up to12 days. A promotion of different iation into neurons through over-expression of proneural genes was detected after 12 da ys exposure, but not for shorter exposure times (Nakamichi et al., 2009). Similar resu lts were reported by Wang et al., who detected differentiation of hum an embryoid body derived ce lls after exposure to 0.25 T for several days (Wang et al., 2009). A transient up-regulation of several genes involved in cell division was also reported by Polid ori et al. (2012) in HUVEC cells exposed for short (4 h) or long (24 h) periods to SMF of comparable intensity (0.3 T). The same Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 196 research group reported increased expressi on of one of the main genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis in the same experimental conditions (HUVEC cells exposed to 0.3 T for 24 h), together with an increase in ROS formation after 4 h, that reverted after 24 h exposure. Meanwhile, DNA damage was obse rved for exposure durations of 2, 4 and 24 h and unaffected for longer periods (48 and 72 h) (Potenza et al., 2010). Expression of HSP70 was evaluated by La ramee and co-workers. They exposed rat primary fibroblast cells (RAT1), transfecte d with a HSP70 promoter-linked luciferase reporter, to static magnetic flux densities of 1 to 440 mT for 16, 24, and 48 h starting at both 24 and 48 h post transfection. HSP70 ex pression was followed for up to 96 h and showed a dependence on fl ux density, exposure dura tion, and start time post transfection. A nonlinear response in expressi on was observed for increasing flux density with a maximum of a 3.5-fold increase ov er control occurring at 48 h of exposure starting 48 h after transfecti on. Laramee et al., (2014) DNA damage was also evaluated by other rese arch groups. An increase in DNA migration was detected in human lymphocytes exposed for 1 h to inhomogeneous (0.3, 1.2 or 47.7 T/m) SMF or for 4 and 18 h to homogeneou s (160 mT) SMF (Kubinyi et al., 2010). On the contrary, lower SMF (8.8 mT) did not induce alterations in DNA migration of human leukemic cells exposed for 12 h (Chen et al., 2010; Qi et al., 2011). Exposure of human lymphoblastoid TK6 cell s to 705 mT SMF led to a reduction in the level of both constitutive H2AX phosphorylation and ATM activation (two parameters related to repair of constitutive and induce d DNA damage). The effect was not cell cycle phase specific as the decrease was comparab le across all phases of the cycle and was detected after 5 and 24 h exposure, although in the latter case an higher difference respect to unexposed cultures was recorded (Halicka et al., 2009). The authors stated that, since the constitutive DNA damage is one of the main ca uses of aging and predisposition to cancer, the effect de tected can be regarded as protective. Oxidative stress and membrane effects Three papers reported transient increase in ROS production, consistent with the hypothesis that SMF can interfere with th e cell redox status. A sharp increase was detected in human embryonic lung fibrobla sts exposed for 18 h to a magnetic field ranging from 35 to 120 mT. The effect reve rted after 5 days continuous exposure (Sullivan et al., 2011). Transien t increase in ROS levels was also reported in HUVEC cells after exposure to 300 mT for 4 h, which reve rted after 24 h exposure (Potenza et al., 2010). Zhao and co-workers reported an incr ease in ROS level in two human-hamster hybrid cells (A L and 0 AL cells) and in Chinese Hamster ovary-derived cells (XRS-5) after three h exposure to 8.5 T SMF. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was significantly decreased in AL cells exposed to 8.5 T but no t to 1 or 4T SMF for either 3 or 5h. In addition, ATP content signif icantly decreased in the tw o deficient cell lines ( 0 AL and XLS-5) exposed to 8.5T SMF for 3h. With fu rther incubation of 12 or 24h without SMF exposure, ATP content retrieved to the control level in the hybrid but not in the deficient cells (Zhao et al., 2011). Changes in cell membrane ultrastructure (i ncrease in cell membrane permeability) were reported in human leukemic cells exposed to 8. 8 mT for 12 h by the group of Qi (Chen et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011). Alteration of calcium flux was de tected by Wang et al. in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) exposed up to 3 h to a SMF ranging from 0.23 to 0.28 T. Moreover, increased ATP levels and reduced cAMP levels, Nitric Oxide production, p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation, together with a decrease in cell proliferation and iron uptake were also found. Since these effects are qualitativel y similar to those obtained with a class of drugs candidates for treatment of Parkinson' s disease (PD), the authors suggest that SMF could be a promising non-invasive tool to treat PD and potentially other neurological disorders (Wang et al., 2010). Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 197 No membrane protrusion was observed in rat spinal cord astrocytes exposed to 2.1 T up to 72 h (Khodarahmi et al., 2010). Cell growth, differentiation and viability The results reported on cell gr owth and viability are not univo cal. No effect was detected in HUVEC cells exposed from 4 up to 72 h to a 300 mT SMF (Potenza et al., 2010). Primary cultures of rat astroglial cells also resulted unaffected by higher SMF exposure (2.1 T) (Khodarahmi et al., 2010) . Similar results were obtain ed in terms of cell cycle progression both by Zhao et al. (2011), who exposed huma n-hamster hybrid cells and CHO-derived cells for 3 h to 8.5 T, and by Sarvestani et al. (2010) on rat bone marrow stem cells exposed for 5 h to SMF of lower intensity (15 mT). Dini and Panzarini (2010) report ed that exposure to 6 mT of several cell types induced a decrease in phagocytosis and endocytosis and an increase in apoptotic rate. Such effects resulted dependent on the degree of macrophage differentiation. In three papers, an increase in cell proliferation of HUVEC cells was noted. Polidori et al. (2012) reported a 25 % enhancement in cell pr oliferation after 4 h exposure to a 300 mT SMF, together with a transient up-regulation of several genes involved in cell growth and division. Martino et al. also fo und an increase in cell number either after 24 h (but not after 1 h) exposure to 60 or 120 \u00b5T SM F (Martino et al., 2010) and 48 h exposure (Martino et al., 2011). In the latter case, the resulting effect was suppressed by treatments with free-radical scavengers. Different results were found by other authors. A reduction in cell proliferation was also detected in PC12 cells exposed for 3 days (Wang et al., 2010) and in human embryoid body derived (LVEC) cells exposed up to 6 days to a SMF ranging from 0.23 to 0.28 T (Wang et al., 2009). In the latt er the authors also record ed case changes in gene expression related to signalling and different iation and altered mo rphology. The effect resulted in cell type dependent since no va riation with respect to unexposed cells was detected in human embryoid kidney (HEK AD293) cells. Feng and co-workers found a decrease in proliferation of human osteosar coma cells, grown on a surface of poly-L- lactide (PLLA) substrate and exposed to 0.4 mT for 5 days. The effect was recorded after 1 and 3 days of exposure. In addition, cells showed a more differentiated phenotype after 1 day exposure (Feng et al., 2010). Similar resu lts were detected in primary foetal rat brain progenitor cells that decreased cell proliferation an d differentiated into neurons (over-expression of proneuronal genes) under 100 mT SMF for 12 days. Shorter exposure duration did not result in any effect (Nakamichi et al., 2009). Up-regulation of hematopoietic- and cell cycl e-related genes and increase in the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells was found in human placental and umbilical cord blood CD34 cells exposed to 10 T for 16 h. Also, in this case, shorter exposure duration did not exert any effect (Mon zen et al., 2009). Table 17.

Conclusions on in vitro effects In most of the available studies, SMF induced effects in the cellular endpoints investigated, although in some cases the ef fects were transient. Gene expression was affected in all studies, with predominantl y up-regulated outcomes. These new studies confirm the previous SCENIHR conclusions. 3.9.4. Conclusion on health effects from SMF exposure In most of the available in vitro studies, SMF above 30 T induced effects in the cellular endpoints investigated, although in some cases the effects were transient. Gene expression was affected in a ll studies, with predominantly up-regulated outcomes. These new studies are consistent with th e results of previous studies. A number of studies are reporting that effect s of SMF exposures o ccur in animals, at levels ranging from mT to T. However, since many of the findings are limited to single studies, they do not provide any fi rm foundation for risk assessment. Observational studies have shown that moveme nt in strong SMF may cause effects, such as vertigo and nausea. These can be explai ned by established interaction mechanisms and are more likely to occur in fields abov e 2 T. The relevance of these effects for the health of personnel remains unclear. 3.10. Health effects from combined exposure to different EMF What was already known on this subject? In the previous Opinion of 2009 the topic related to combined exposures to more than one EMF frequency was not discussed. What has been achieved since then? 3.10.1. Combined exposure in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) environment In the MRI environment, worker s and patients are exposed to high static magnetic fields, fast gradient magnetic fields and strong radiofrequency electrom agnetic fields. Thus, exposure in MRI suite represen ts a particular case of comb ined exposure to different EMF. Most of the investigations carri ed out on this topic refer to human studies. In particular, Schlamann et al. (2010) investigated possible cognitive effects of MRI examinations at 1.5 and 7 T by means of tran scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In 12 healthy, right- handed male volunteers TMS was performed, first to specify the individual motor threshold, and then the cortic al silent period (SP) was measured. Then, the volunteers Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 200 were exposed to the 1.5-T MRI scanner for 63 minutes using standard sequences. After the MRI examination another TMS session fo llowed. Fifteen minutes later, TMS was repeated. Four weeks later, the complete setting was repeated using a 7 T scanner. Controls were lying in the 1.5 T scanner for 63 minutes without scanning and lying in a separate room for 63 minutes. TMS was pe rformed in the same way in each case. Immediately after MRI exposure , the SP was highly signific antly prolonged in all 12 subjects at 1.5 and 7 T. The motor threshold was significantly increa sed. Fifteen minutes after the examination, the measured value tended toward normal again. Control conditions revealed no significant differences . The transitory effects on human cortical excitability seen in the study do not seem to be caused by the static magnetic field, since no significant differences be tween the examinations at 1. 5 and 7 T were detected. The radiofrequency pulses and/or th e gradient fields seem to be responsible for the measured effects. In an editorial, Bluemke (2010) commented on these results and asked if they had discovered a new physiological effect. However, he says that the answer is not clear since several controls in their study are lacking. The acoustic noise is very high during MRI scanning, and it is possi ble that the TMS parameters could be affected by brain exposure to high sound levels. The reproducibility and reliability of the TMS machine are unknown. Unfortunately, Schlam amann et al. (2010) used a wide variety of MRI pulse sequences, including both gr adient-echo and spin-echo sequ ences. These sequences vary widely in their duty factor s and energy deposition. And as pointed out by both the authors and in the editorial, further studies are necessary to explore the cause and possible clinical impact of these effects since the cellular, molecular, and apparently neurologic effects of these high-field st rength MRI scanners are largely unknown and must continue to be investigated. Gobba et al. (2012) reported that three female health operators with implanted copper IUDs, had developed menometrorrhagia (a condition in which prolonged or excessive uterine bleeding occu rs irregularly and more freq uently than normal) some months after an increase of the working time in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Unit (1.5 T), that progressively disappeared when the previous organization, involving discontinuous work shifts at MRI, was re-e stablished. No known factors were evidenced in the 3 operators. A possibl e mechanism is suggested to be the low-frequency currents induced in the wires of the IUD during the mo vements of the operator inside the static magnetic field. The problem of possible in teractions between copper IUDs and EMF induced by MRI has been considered in pati ents undergoing imaging, but the possible risk in MRI Unit operators has been largely neglected. Gobba et al. conclude that the possibility that MRI operators with implanted metallic IUDs should be included in the group of \"workers at particular risk\" according to the EU Directive 2004/40/EC. M\u00f6llerl\u00f6kken et al. (2012) investigated if an acute high exposure to EMF could have possible adverse effects on male reproduc tive health. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers participated in a balanced cross-over study with exposure using a head scan in real MRI with whole-body transmitting coil and one set up for sham MRI exposure. Serum-blood samples of inhibin B, testosterone, binding globuline and estradiol were taken before and after the different scans. Ne ither immediately afte r, nor after 11 days were any differences observed in the hormon e levels comparing real and sham MRI. The lack of effects of EMF on male reproductive hormones should be rea ssuring to the public and especially for men examined in MRI. Adverse effects on other endpoints than male reproduction or possible chronic effect of multiple MRI scans were not investigated in this study. There is some evidence on genotoxic effect s in patients undergoing MRI examination. Simi et al. (2008) studied the level of micronucleated lymphocytes in cultured lymphocytes of eight subjects before and afte r a cardiac MRI (CMR). Energy absorbed by the subjects was calculated to range from 19 to 306 J. An increase in micronucleus frequency, measured by the cytokinesis bl ock method, was reported in lymphocyte Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 201 cultures established immediately after the MRI in all individuals, with a 2-fold increase in mean micronucleus frequency in comparison with the samples collected before the examination. A statistically significant increase in micronuclei was still seen in samples obtained 24 h after the scan but not after 48 h, 72 h, 90 h or 120 h. Fiechter et al. (2013) studied genotoxic effects in 20 prospect ively enrolled patients who underwent 1.5 T CMR. A commercially available MR scanner equipped with a maximum gradient strength of 42 mT/m and a maxi mum gradient speed of 180 mT/m/ms was used and the mean CMR scan duration was 68 + 22 min with an average contrast media bolus of 15 + 4 ml. Peripheral mononuclear ce lls were studied for DNA damage using immunofluorescence microscopy of foci positive for ph osphorylated gamma-H2AX in nuclear DNA, indicative of sites of DNA doub le strand break repair. The median and mean numbers of foci per mononucle ar cell were, respectively , 0.066 and 0.143 in baseline samples (collected prior CMR scan) an d 0.190 and 0.270 after the CMR scan; the difference (1.6-fold for median, 1.9-fold for mean) was statistically significant (P<0.05). In addition, gamma-H2AX-positive foci were qu antified in CD3-positi ve T-lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The analysis revealed a stat istically significant increase in geometric mean of fluorescence intensity (arbitrary uni ts) of T-lymphocytes after the MRI (median 3232, 1.17-fold; mean 3395, 1.14-fold) as comp ared with samples collected before the scan (2758; mean 2989), which wa s statistically significant. Two studies were carried out on lymphocyte cultures from healthy donors exposed in vitro. Lee and co-workers invest igated the induction of genotoxic effects in human peripheral blood lymphocytes from one dono r exposed from 22 to 89 min to a 3 T MRI scanner. An increase in the frequency of ch romosomal aberration (CA) and micronuclei (MN) and in the extent of DNA migration (comet assay) was detected, although it resulted time-dependent in the case of CA and MN (Lee JW et al., 2011). Similar experimental conditions were applied by Sz erencsi and co-workers, and different results were obtained. In particular, peripheral blood samples from three healthy donors were exposed to electromagnetic fields produced by 3T magnetic resonance imaging equipment for 0, 22, 45, 67, and 89 min during the scanning procedure. To evaluate DNA damage, blood samples from each donor were processed to apply the alkaline comet assay and the micronucleus assay. No effects were detected in exposed cultures while in positive controls, exposed to 4 Gy gamma rays, a significant increase in the comet parameters and in MN frequency was induce d, as expected (Sze rencsi et al., 2014). 3.10.2. Combined exposure to RF Since the recent development and use of mo bile electronic devices employ different frequencies of RF signals, hum ans are simultaneously expose d to more than one signal. A scanty number of papers is available on this topic and most of them are by a research group from the Korea Institute of Radiolog ical and Medical Science (Seoul, Korea). Most of the in vivo investigations have been carried out on rodents, and are summarized in table 18. Lee et al (2009) evaluated teratogenicity in ICR mouse foetuses by exposing pregnant mice to combined CDMA and WCDMA signals at SAR of 4 W/kg (2 W/kg for each signal). Mice received two 45 minutes exposures separa ted by 15 min intervals daily through the entire gestational period. Animals were killed on the 18th day of gestation and foetuses were examined for mortality, growth reta rdation, changes in head size and other morphological abnormalities. No observable adverse effects on mouse foetuses were detected for all the experimental co nditions adopted (Lee et al., 2009). In subsequent studies, anim als were simultaneously exposed to CDMA and WCDMA RF signals at SAR of 4 W/kg (2 W/kg for each signal). The exposure was 45 min per day and the total exposure duration varied on th e basis of the endpoint investigated. In particular, testicular function was examined in male SD rats exposed for a total of 12 weeks. No differences between -RF exposed and sham-exposed animals were detected in sperm count, blood serum testosterone concentration, malondialdehyde concentration in Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 202 testis and epididymis, frequency of spermato genesis stages and appearance of apoptotic cells in the testis. Moreover, ap optosis-related proteins in the testes (p53, bcl2, cyclin G1 and GADD45) also resulted un affected by the RF exposu re. Therefore, the authors concluded that simultaneous exposures had no effects on the rat reproductive system (Lee et al., 2012a). Lack of effects was also found on immunofunctions of male Sprague- Dawley rats exposed for up to 8 weeks, eval uated as subtype population of splenocytes and cytokine production (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-1, interferon (IFN)- and or IL-6, TNF- , and immunoglobulin (Ig) of IgG and IgM from blood serum (Jin et al., 2012a). The authors also evaluated lymphoma development in AKR-mice, a suitable model of lymphoma, exposed for 42 weeks in the same experimental conditions reported above. No differences with respect to sham-exposed a n i m a l s w e r e d e t e c t e d i n t e r m s o f b o d y mass, lymphoma incidence, lymphoma malign ancy or metastasis infiltration to the spleen, lung and liver. However, occurrence of metastasis infiltration to the brain was higher in exposed mice with respect to sham-exposed ones. The authors concluded that, due to the long exposure dura tion and the high SAR level, the results do not indicate a health hazard for neoplastic development an d more advanced experiments are needed to elucidate the observed effect (Lee et al., 2011a). In another paper, several parameters of the endocrine system were measured in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed up to 8 weeks. In this study the effect of CDMA signal alone was also evaluated (849 MHz, 4W/kg). Animals were di vided into two groups and were sacrificed after 4 or 8 weeks of expo sure. No alterations of serum levels of melatonin, thyroid stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxin, adenocorticotropin and sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen ) were detected for all the experimental conditions investigated (Jin et al., 2013). Only one investigation has b een carried out by an indepe ndent research group. They exposed adult male Sprague-Dawley rats fo r 1 hour to 900 MHz (2 W/kg), 2450 MHz (2 W/kg) or both (1 W/kg each; 2 W/kg in to tal). After 24 h animals were sacrificed. No differences in general cell mo rphology and apoptosis were re corded respect to negative controls, either after single and simu ltaneous exposures (Lopez et al., 2012). Table 18. Combined exposures to RF: in vivo studies Reference Model Combined exposure Results Lee et al., 2009 ICR pregnant mice CDMA (837 MHz) + WCDMA (1950 MHz), 2 W/kg each Two 45 min exposure/day through the entire gestational period No effects on mortality and several morphological abnormalities on mouse foetuses Lee et al., 2012a Male S-D rats CDMA+WCDMA, 2 W/kg each 45 min exposure/day for 12 weeks No effects on reproductive system Jin et al., 2012a Male S-D rats CDMA+WCDMA, 2 W/kg each 45 min exposure/day for up to 8 weeks No effects on immune system Lee et al., 2011b AKR mice CDMA+WCDMA, 2 W/kg each 45 min exposure/day for up to 42 weeks No effects on lymphoma development Jin et al., 2013 SD-rats CDMA signal al one, 4 W/kg; CDMA+WCDMA, 2 W/kg each 45 min exposure/day for up to 8 weeks No alterations of several parameters of the endocrine system Lopez et al., 2012 Male SD-rats 900 MHz, each; 1 exposure No effects on cell morphology Wideband Code Division Multiple Access. Concerning in vitro studies, the effect of single or combined exposures was investigated in human carcinoma cell lines in terms of DN A synthesis, cell cycle distribution and cell cycle regulatory proteins. MCF7 cell cultures were exposed either to the code division multiple access (CDMA, 837 MHz) signal alone or simultaneously to CDMA and wideband Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 203 CDMA (WCDMA, 1950 MHz) for 1 hour. The SA R was 4 W/kg for CDMA signal exposure alone and 2 W/kg each (4 W/kg in total) for combined CDMA plus WCDMA signals. Neither single nor combined RF radiation had any effect on the endpoints investigated (Lee et al., 2011b). The same research group also evaluated the in duction of oxidative stress in human breast epithelial MCF10A cells exposed for two hours in the experimental conditions described above, but in this study the effect of the WCDMA signal alone was also tested. No statistically significant differences were found in the levels of ROS, in the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide di smutase and in the rati o of reduced/oxidized glutathione when exposed cultur es were compared to sham-exposed ones (Hong et al., 2012). In another study the authors investigated the effect of longer exposure duration on the expression level and phosphorylation states of sp ecific heat cell cultures were exposed for four hours or for two hours on three consecutive days to CDMA signal alone (4 W/kg) or in combination with WCDMA (2 W/kg for each signal). Again, no significan t differences were detected between RF exposed and sham- exposed samples (Kim et al., 2012). In a more recent study, the authors exposed three different ne uronal cells such as U 87, PC12 or SH-SY5 Y to combined RF radiation (83 7 MHz CDMA plus 1950 MHz WCDMA) for 2 h at 2 W/kg SAR level to investigate the effects on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at different time poin ts (1, 3, 6 and 12 h) after exposure. Results indicated absence of effects in all the cell types for all conditions tested, except for 6 h post exposure in U87 ce lls and 12 h post exposure in PC12 cells, in which a slight but statistically significant effect was detected. Measurement of ROS levels in neuronal cells after 2 h co-expos ure to multiple RF signals and 100 M H 2O2 were also carried out at 1, 3, 6 and 12 h post exposure and no significant changes were detected. Absence of cooperative effects was also dete cted when co-exposur es were carried out with 100 and 200 M menadione and ROS analysed after 0.5, 1 and 3 h. (Kang et al., 2014). The results of in vitro investigations are summarized in table 19. Table 19 . Combined exposures to RF: in vitro studies Reference Cell type Combined exposure Results Lee et al., 2011b Human breast cancer cells (MCF7) CDMA (837 CDMA + WCDMA (1950 MHz), 2 W/kg each 1 h exposure No effects on DNA synthesis, cell cycle distribution and cell cycle regulatory proteins Hong et al., 2012 Human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) CDMA, 4 W/kg; WCDMA, 4 W/kg; CDMA each 2 h exposure No induction of oxidative stress (ROS formation, SOD activity and GSH depletion) Kim et al., 2012 Human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) CDMA, 4 W/kg; CDMA + WCDMA, 2 W/kg each 4 h exposure or 2 h on three consecutive days No variation in the expression level of HSPs and MAPKs Kang et al., 2014 MHz), 2 W/kg each 2 h exposure ROS formation evaluated 1, 3, 6 and 12 h after RF exposure. ROS increase in U87 cells at 6 h and in PC12 cells at 12 h. No effect in the other conditions. No effect in cultures co-exposed to H2O2 or menadione Combined exposures to different EMFs Novikov and co-workers evaluated the effects of combined exposures to ELF and SMFs on BALB/c mice. The animals were intraperitoneally transplanted with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells and then exposed one hour/day for 12 days to a combination of SMF (DC; 42 \u00b5T) and alternating MF (AC; 1, 4.4 and 16.5 Hz). For each frequency, several series of experiments have been performed with intensities ranging from 40 to Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 204 500 nT. Moreover, other experiments have been carried out at 16.5 Hz carrier frequency in the presence of a modulating frequency of 0.5 Hz. For each of the AC components the optimal intensity for survival of animals was adopted to perform a combined exposure (1 Hz, 300 nT; 4.4 Hz, 100 nT; 16.5 Hz, 150 nT). Th e results obtained sh owed that in the combined exposure the antitu mor activity was higher than in the single frequency exposures. In animals without tumours no pathological deviation from the norm was detected, indicating lack of in trinsic toxicity of the combin ed exposures (Novikov et al., 2009). Conclusions on health effects from combined exposures to different EMFs The few available studies on combined exposure to different EMFs do not provide sufficient evidence for risk assessment. The studies reporting on effects on DNA integrity after an MRI investigation are clearly of interest to follow up. However, it is not clear which component of the complex EMF exposure during scanning may cause the effect: SMF, switched gradient MF or the pulsed RF EMF. Further studies on DNA integrit y and MRI exposure are needed, and the feasibility of cohort studies of MRI patients and occupationally ex posed personnel should be discussed. 3.11. Health effects from co-exposure to environemtal stressors 3.11.1. Animal studies What was already known? In the previous Opinion of 2009 (SCENIHR 2009), the few studies available in the literature suggest that co-exposures with EL F fields may be co-car cinogenic, while no evidence was achieved in the case of RF fields. What has been achieved since then? ELF fields Two co-carcinogenesis investigat ions have been carried out. Jimenez-Garcia et al. 2010 concurrently exposed Male Fischer-344 rats to 120 Hz, 4.5 mT, 50 min/d for 32 days and to N-Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) an d 2-acetylaminoflu orene (2AAF), two hepatocarcinogenesis-inducers. After 7 days fr of co-exp osure an inhibition of pre-neoplastic lesion induced by the chem ical treatments was detected. In particular, a reduction in cell proliferation (decreased expression of Ki-67 and cyclin D1 proteins) was reported, not associated wi th apoptosis. However, this interesting result has been obtained on a small number of animals for each treated group (6) (Jimenez-Garcia et al., 2010). In contrast, no differences in 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)- induced hematopoietic neoplasia was reported by Negishi et al. They co-exposed CD-1 mice to a 50 Hz magnetic field (7, 70 or 350 \u00b5T field intensity) for 22 h/d, 7 days/week for 30 weeks (Negishi et al., 2008). Rajkovic et al. reported cooperative e ffects of MF (50 Hz, 100 and 300 \u00b5T 4h daily exposure) and the pesticide at r a z i n e o n m a l e W i s t a r r a t s . T h e y f o u n d a n i n c r e a s e d number of degranulated mast cells for all the co-exposure protocols applied, compared to atrazine treatment alone. It should be poin ted out that the exposure duration is not clearly mentioned (Rajkovi c et al., 2010). Wang and co-workers also reported cooperative effects of ELF fields and chemic al treatments. They exposed Sprague-Dawley rats to a 20 Hz MF (14 mT) 1 h/day for 12 da ys and, after MF exposure morphine was administered. They found a decreased densit y of dopamine receptors upon morphine withdrawal respect to morphine treatment alone. The effect of combined treatment tended to normalize as morphine withdrawal days increased (Wang et al., 2008). Celik and co-workers (2013) employed Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the effect of ELF field exposure on the accumu lation of manganese in vari ous rat tissues. Manganese at Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 205 different doses was administer ed every two days for 45 days , while ELF exposure (50 Hz, 1.5 mT) was carried for 4 h/day, for 5 days/w eek during the same period of 9 weeks. Manganese treatment increased accumulation levels in kidney, liver and brain with respect to control rats. Moreover, ELF expo sure increased this accumulation. Some studies have tried to reveal subtle behavioural consequences of exposure to magnetic fields through their interactions with drugs or interventions that cause known biological effects. Canseven et al. (2007) investigated the e ffects of magnetic fields on drug-induced seizure activity in female Swiss albino mice. Seizures were induced in female mice by injection of pentylenetet razole at a sub maximal dose (60 mg kg-1 in 0.1 ml saline); this dose induced a grand-mal seiz ure within a few minutes. Exposure to a 50 Hz magnetic field at 0.2 mT had no significant effects on seizure latency or duration, or on mortality. Animals were exposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils for either 1 h before and 30 min after injection, 1 h before and 30 min sham exposure after injection, or 1 h sham exposure before injection and 30 min of exposure after injecti on The coils used were not shielded against electr ic fields, but the measured elec tric fields were negligible. Gulturk et al. (2010) investigated the effect of long-term expo sure to magnetic fields on the permeability of the bloo d-brain barrier (BBB) in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model. Male Wistar rats were exposed within a solenoid that was producing a 50 Hz field at 5 mT, for 30 min on /15 mi n off, for 165 min/day for 30 days; sham exposed animals were placed wi thin the solenoid without the field being generated. The magnitudes of any noise, vibration or heat from the solenoid when energised were not described. BBB permeability was assessed using Evans Blue ex travasation. It was found that BBB permeability was significantly increase d by treatment with STZ or magnetic field alone (and by the same amount), and in combination they caused an even greater increase in permeability; daily injection with insulin reduced these effects, although permeability remained well above values for sham exposed animals. STZ reduced weight gain but exposure to magnetic fields had no effect alone and no additive e ffects with STZ. Compared to their own baseline valu es, STZ significantly in creased blood glucose levels four-fold, whereas magnetic fields caused a small but sign ificant decrease, and together the resultant increase in blood pressure was signif icantly less than that caused by STZ alone, but still around a three-fold in crease over baseline, and was similar to the effects of treatment of these animals with insulin. Finally, STZ increased mean arterial blood pressure, but the magnetic field had no significant effect either alone or in combination with STZ. Overall, the authors co ncluded that exposure to magnetic fields increases the vulnerability of the BBB in diabetes, but trea tment with insulin reversed this sensitivity. Lei et al. (2013) also employed the STZ-induced diabetic rat model to study the effects of pulsed magnetic fields in re lieving behavioural signs of di abetic peripheral neuropathy (DNP). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were expo sed to pulsed 15 Hz fields for 8 /day, 6 days/week for 7 weeks using a modified Helmho ltz coil exposure system (consisting of 3 coils of 800 mm diameter, spaced 304 mm ap art) connected to a pulsed generator producing a train of 0.2 ms pulses for 5 ms every 60 ms. The peak intensity of the field was 1.6 mT. Compared to sham exposed an imals with induced diabetes, exposure significantly increased the thre sholds for withdrawal of the hind paws to tactile stimuli (mechanical allodynia) and to noxious heat st imuli (thermal hyperalgesia). Exposure also attenuated the development of neuropathogical changes associated with diabetes. It was suggested that pulsed fields might prove an effective therap y for the treatment of DNP in humans. Rau et al. (2012) reported that magnetic fields inhibited hype ractivity induced by transient global cerebr al ischemia. Following surgical occlusion of both common carotid arteries for 10 min, adult Mongolian gerbils were exposed continuously to a gradient 50 Hz field from an electromagnet for 7 da ys; animals were housed 20 cm from the electromagnet, so that the field in the cent re of the cages was 0.5 mT, with a range of 0.2 - 2 mT; the exposure of each animal would be uncontrolled and depend on their location in the cage. The behaviour of the an imals in an open field arena was analysed Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 206 using a video tracking system for 60 min on four days during exposure and on day 7 after exposure. It was found that transient ischemia induced sign ificant increases in distance moved, stereotypic head movements and body rotations for the first 4 days. However, exposure to the magn etic field significantly reduce d these effects for the first 2 days, and thereafter the reductions were not significant. The author s speculated that the magnetic field may have produced the changes in activity through an influence on the opioid system. Rau et al. (2013) examined the histology of the hippocampus of these animals and found that exposure to the magnetic field helped to overcome the damage caused by ischemia. It was reported that ischemia significantly affected cell morphology and increased cell death, magnetic field exposu re alone caused no consistent effects, but exposure combined with ischemia resulted in a reduction in numbers of dying neurons (at 7 days after termination of field expo sure) compared to ischemia alone, and increased numbers of GFAP-labelled astrocyt es and microglial cells (immediately after exposure). A companion study (Rau Balind et al., 2014) suggested that increases in oxidative stress could be transiently induced in the hippocampus, striatum or cortex by either global cerebral ischemia or by exposure to the magnetic field, but oxidative stress was significantly reduced follow ing combined ischemia and ma gnetic field treatment. In this study, the activities of superoxide di smutase and malondialdehyde and production of nitric oxide and superoxide were measured at the end of field exposure (to assess immediate effects) or a further 7 days later (for delayed effects). Magnetic fields alone had a significantly greater effect than i schemia alone, and wh y combined treatment should reduce the magnitude of the immediate effects is no t obvious. Generally, delayed effects were much reduced for all treatments except ischemia alone, with most measured parameters returning to control levels. However, a single control value for each of the measured parameters was provided at both assessment times withou t any indication of variability. Zhang et al. (2013) found that exposure to magnetic fields had no influence on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease-like changes induced by chronic aluminium (Al) treatment. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either 50 Hz magnetic fields at 100 \u00b5T using a pair of Helmholtz coils, given Al overload (AlC l3 solution, 2g/l, in their drinking water) or both treatments for 12 weeks. Compared to unexposed and untreated control animals, Al increased escape latency an d total distance swum in a water maze during acquisition trials and impaired retention of the task during the probe trial; exposure to 50 Hz fields had no effect on performance; and combined exposure did not have an increased effect compared to Al alone. Al treatment with or without magnetic fields significantly increased levels of Al in the cortex, and increased A concentration and neuronal losses in the cort ex and hippocampus: magnetic fields alone did not affect these outcomes. Al significantly reduced wate r intake and body weight gain during the study period, possibly due to differences in palatability of the AlCl3 solution. Deng et al. (2013) investigat ed whether memory impairments produced in mice by chronic Al treatment could be modulated by magnetic field exposure. It was found that water maze performance was impaired in K unming mice that had been treated for 8 weeks with either 50 Hz fields at 2 mT for 4 h/day, 6 days/week, given daily Al loading (200 mg/kg) or given both magnetic fields an d Al. In addition, in all three experimental groups there was neuronal cell loss and over expression of phosphor ylated tau protein in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, plus su peroxide dismutase ac tivity was decreased and malondialdehyde was increa sed. It was concluded that there was no evidence that combined exposure had any caused any synerg istic effect, although both Al loading and magnetic fields could produce si gnificant effects on their own. The results are summarized in Table 20. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 207 Table 20.

No effect of co-exposure on Al and MF- induced neuronal cell loss; 2015 01 20 208 RF fields For RF fields two co-carcinoge nesis investigations have also been carried out. Tillmann et al. exposed female B6C3F1 mice to 1966 MHz, UMTS signal, 4.8 W/m2 20h/day from gestational day 6 up to 24 months and to n- ethylnitrosourea (ENU) on gestational day 14. They found increased malignancy and multiplicity of lung carcinomas in co-exposed animals respect to animals exposed to ENU alone (Tillmann et al., 2010). In a second investigation, carried out by Pa ulraj and Behari, no effects of co-exposures were detected. They expose d Swiss albino mi ce to 112 MHz modulated W/m2 0.75 W/kg and 0.1 W/kg, respectively). Two co-exposure protocols we re applied: a) exposure of 2 h/day, 3 days/week for 16 weeks and treatments wi th DMBA, and b) 14 days exposure and intraperitoneal injection of ascites carcinom a cells. In all case s RF was given after treatments. For all the experimental conditions tested the authors reported no increase in tumour growth and development respect to carcinogenic treatm ents alone (Paulraj and Behari, 2011). Behavioural and neurochemical deficits were the focus of a study by Maaroufi and co- workers (2014). They exposed Wistar rats to 900 MHz EMFs in absence and in presence of ferrous sulfate to test the hypothesis of a possible link between iron overload in the brain and neurodegenerative disorders. Rats were exposed 1h/day during 21 consecutive days at SAR of 0.05 and 0.18 W/kg , depending on the position of the rat in the exposure chamber, and, in the case of co-exposures , were concurrently daily subjected to injection of ferrous sulfate. Rats exposed to RF field resulted impaired in the exploratory activity but not in the navigation and working memory tasks. Alteration in monoamine content was also detected ma inly in the hippocampus area. Combined treatments did not potentiate behavioural an d neurochemical deficits with respect to EMF alone exposed rats. In several investigations a protective effect of RF pre-exposure against exposure to ionizing radiation was reported. Four papers have been published by Dr. Cao's research group. In a first study male Kunming mice were exposed to 900 MHz (1.2 W/m2) 1h/day for 14 days and then treated with 5 Gy gamma-rays. Less severe hematopoietic pathological alterations (cell reduction, he matopoietic tissue volume, decreased edema) were detected in co-exposed animals resp ect to those exposed to gamma ray alone (Cao et al., 2010). In a second investigat ion the authors pre-exposed male Kunming mice to 900 MHz, 0.12, 1.2 and 12 W/m2 (calculated SARs 0.00548, 0.0548 and 0.548 W/kg) 1 h/day for 14 days and then the animals were treated with gamma-rays (8 or 5 Gy). A significant increase in survival time (8 Gy) and a significant reduction in hematopoietic tissue damage (5 Gy) was detected (Cao et al., 2011). In a third study pre-exposure of male ICR mice to RF in the same experimental condition but 4h/day for 1, 3, 5, 7 or 14 days, followed by 3Gy gamma-rays, resulted in a decreased DNA migration (comet assay) respect to mice ex posed to gamma-rays alone, except for RF exposure of 1 day (Jiang et al., 2012). In a more recent investigat ion, the authors pre- exposed adult male ICR mice to 900 MHz at an SAR of 0.548 W/kg for 4h/day for 7 days and then the animals were subjected to an acute whole body dose of 3 Gy gamma rays to investigate the chromosomal damage in pe ripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) tissues. Combined treatments resulted in a significant decrease in micronucleus indices compared to gamma rays alone, in both PB and BM tissues (Jiang et al., 2013). The authors suggested an adapti ve response induced by pre-exposure to RF field. The four studies were carried out with the same exposure system , as reported in Cao et al., 2011 and Jiang et al., 2012 and 2013. The results described above are summarized in Table 21.

Nevertheless, due to the small number of investigations available and the large variety of protocols adopted (different ch emical or physical treatments and different EMF exposure conditions), it is not possible to draw concrete conclusions. Further investigations should be carried out to clarify the role of EMFs in increasing/decreasing the effect of other treatments. 3.11.2. In vitro studies What was already known? In the previous Opinion, the studies on coop erative effects of ELF fields resulted all positive: the co-exposure induced enhancemen t or decrease of the effect induced by chemical or physical agents. Co-exposures wi t h R F f i e l d s w e r e a l so reported, but the results were conflicting. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 210 What has been achieved since then? A large number of in vitro investigations have been carrie d out on a variety of biological targets and by applying diffe rent co-exposure protocols. Static Fields - Eight papers have been devoted to investigate the combined effects of SMF and chemical or physical agents, as reported in Table 22. In six studies the results indicated an enhancement of the effects induced by chemic al/physical treatment alone. Moreover, in two studies an increase or a decrease was recorded, on the basis of the experimental conditions investigated. The research group of Professor Qi reported an increased killing effect of several drugs currently used for chemotherapy when hu man leukemic cells K562 were concurrently exposed to a SMF of 8.8 mT. In particular , Chen et al. detected an increased cell membrane permeability after 12 h exposure; moreover, co-exposure with Cisplatin (DDP) induced a more pronounced decrease in cell pr oliferation and an arre st at the S phase of the cell cycle, together with an altered DMA migration pattern (alkaline comet assay) respect to DDP treatment alone. The extent of the effects resulted dependent on the DDP dose used for combined exposures. The author s suggested that SMF is able to alter the cell surface ultrastructure (Chen et al., 2010). Similar resu lts were obtained when co- exposures were carried out with Adriamycin (Qi et al., 2011). In a third investigation the authors confirmed that cell killing induced by different anticancer drugs was enhanced by co-exposures. The effect of SMF combined with taxol or cyclophosphamide resulted additive, while it was syne rgistic with DPP or doxoru bicin (Liu et al., 2011). Poniedzialek et al. (2013) evaluated the effect of gradient static magnetic field (SMF) on ROS production in peripher al blood human neutrophils in vitro . Blood samples were exposed in an inhomogeneous SMF (in a south or north pole of the field) for 15, 30 or 45 minutes. The maximum value of magnetic flux density (B max) amounted to <60 mT. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was employed as respiratory burst stimulator. A statistically significant change in ROS production was induced in unstimulated and PMA- stimulated neutrophils and the effects were hi ghly correlated with the exposure time and depended on the orientation of the field. In particular, 15 min exposure induced a decrease, while 45 min resulted in an increase in ROS formation. In this study no sham- exposed samples were set up and the result s of exposed cultures were compared to control cultures (incubator). Moreover, the numb er of donors involved in the study is not reported. Concerning combined treatments with ph ysical agents, human peripheral blood leukocytes were exposed from 0.5 to 24 h to inhomogeneous (0.3, 1.2, 47.7 T/m) or homogeneous (159.2 \u00b1 13.4 mT) SMF, given alon e or with gamma rays (4 Gy). Several co-exposure schedules were applied (SMF before or after -rays). The results showed an increase in DNA migration (comet assay) as a function of the SMF characteristics either when SMF was given alone and after gamma i rradiation. No cooperative effects were found if SMF preceded irradiation (Kubinyi et al., 2010). On the contrary, Sarvestani et al. reported enhancement of X-ray induced arre st in G2/M phase of the cell cycle in rat bone marrow stem (BMSC) cells with SMF (15 mT for 5h) provided after 0.5 Gy X-ray, although co-exposures with SMF before X-ray have not been performed. In this case no effects of SMF alone were dete cted (Sarvestani et al., 2010). In an investigation carried out by Feng and co-workers (2013) human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to a 0.5 T MF, alone or in combination with ionizing radiation (4 Gy x rays given after MF exposu re). Cell growth inhibi tion and up- or down- regulation of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis resulted increase in cells exposed to MF and x rays, compared to cells exposed to x rays alone. In this study, no information is given on the employed MF ex posure system. Politanski et al. (2013) also investigated the effect of static magnetic fields given in combination with x rays. They evaluated ROS formation in lymphocytes from male albino Wistar rats. The SMF exposure was carried out at 0 mT (50 \u00b5T magnetic fi eld induction opposite to the geomagnetic field) and 5 mT by placing cell cultures inside a pair of Helmholtz coils, which provided a highly homogenous field. ROS formation was measured after 15 min, 1 and 2 h. The Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 211 results indicated that a significant increase in ROS formation was induced in cultures co- exposed to X rays and 5 mT compared to cultures exposed to x ray alone, while a reduction in ROS formation was recorded in samples co-exposed to x ray and 0mT, with respect to samples exposed to x ray alone. In this study sham-exposures were not performed. Table 22.

Qi et al., 2011 Human leukemic cells (K562) 8.8 mT 12 h with or w/o ADM No effects of SMF or ADM on metabolic activity when given alone. Combined treatments resulted in inhibition of metabolic activity, DNA damage and arrest of the cell cycle. Liu et al., 2011 Human leukemic cells (K562) 9 mT 12-24 h with or w/o Taxol, Doxorubicin, DDP and cyclophosphamide Concurrent exposures Changes in cell surface ultrastructure; combined exposures enhances the killing effect of drugs as a function of the experimental protocol (exposure duration, drug concentration).

Sarvestani et al., 2010 Rat bone marrow stem cells 15 mT 5 h X-ray before SMF No effect of SMF alone on cell cycle progression. Enhancement of X-ray arrest in G2/M phase. Feng et al., 2013 Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) 0.5 T 1-4 h 4 Gy x rays after SMF Increase in x ray-induced cell growth inhibition and up- or down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis. Politanski et al., 2013 Albino Wistar rat lymphocytes 0 mT (50 \u00b5T MF opposite to the geomagnetic field) and 5 mT 15 min, 1 and 2 h 3 Gy x rays after SMF Increase or decrease in ROS formation in cultures co- exposed at 5 mT and at 0 mT, respectively. ADM: Adriamycin; DDP: Cisplatin; PMA: Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ELF fields Gene expression was investigated by Marc antonio et al., 2010. The authors exposed human neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)C to 50 Hz MF, 1 mT, for 24-72 h in presence or absence of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a neuronal differentiating agent. Co-exposed cells showed a significant incr ease of mRNA levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and cdK5 genes, both involved in neural differentiation and a more differentiated morphological traits (a higher Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 212 neurite number/cell, and an increased ne urite length). They also evaluated the expression of cyp19 gene, involved both in neuronal differentiation and stress response: it resulted enhanced by ATRA treatment an d significantly enhanced further by MF-co- exposure. In addition, decrease d cell proliferation and increa sed proportion of cells in G0/G1 stage was also detected following co -exposures. The authors suggested that MF- concurrent treatments of neuroblastoma ce l l s w i t h M F a n d A T R A c a n s t r e n g t h e n t h e effect of ATRA alone (M arcantonio et al., 2010). Garip and Akan exposed K562 human leukaemia cells concurrently to a 50 Hz MF (1 mT) and H 2O2. Three hours exposure resulted in a st atistically significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells, comp ared to cells treated with H 2O2 alone. ROS formation and expression of heat-shock protein 70 (hsp-70) also were enhanced co-exposed cultures, although statistically not significant. Since exposure to MF alone was found to decrease the number of apoptotic cells and to increa se the HSP levels and ROS formation, the authors concluded that the effect of MF on biological systems stri ctly depends on the status of the cell (Garip and Akan, 2010). Exposure of human hepatoma cells to a 100 Hz MF at 0.7 mT carried out before or after x-ray irradiation also was found to enhanc e x-ray induced apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin V assay. MF exposure was delivered for two cycles (30 min on/12 h off) with doses of x-ray from 2 to 10 Gy or for six cycles with 2 Gy. The effect became more pronounced if ELF MF exposure was given fo r six cycles and before the X-ray exposure (Jian et al. 2009). A time-dependent increase in cell proliferation and in protein oxidation was reported by Eleuteri et al. in human colon adenocarcino ma CaCo 2 cells exposed for 24, 48 and 72 h t o a 5 0 H z M F ( 1 m T ) i n p r e s e n c e o f 1 2 - O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a tumour promoter able to activate protein kina se C, with respect to cells treated with TPA alone (Eleuteri et al., 2009). However, in th is paper the authors do not discuss the induced E field, current or the effect due to magnetic field. Genotoxicity was investigated in five papers. Luukkonen et al. reported that 24 h exposure of human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells to a 50 Hz MF (100 \u00b5T) immediately followed by 3 h treatment with Menadione re sulted in an enhancement of Menadione- induced DNA damage, DNA repair rate and MN formation. The authors found similar results when co-exposures were carried ou t with methyl-metane sulfonate for 3 h, although the increase was not found to be statistically significant (Luukkonen et al. 2011). In a more recent investigation the same research group observed that human SH- SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed to a 50- Hz, 100-\u00b5T MF for 24 h showed a slight increase (<2-fold in comparison with sham treated control) in MN measured flow cytometrically 11 and 18 days after the end of the treatment. The results came from a co-treatment experiment wher e the MF exposure was follow ed by a 3-h treatment with menadione (at 0, 1, and 20 \u00b5M). The effects of MF (and of menadione) were statistically significant in a 3-way ANOVA where MF and me nadione were fixed factors and replicate a random factor. Statistics were not provided se parately for MF at 0 dose menadione, but MN induction by MF appeared to be sim ilar regardless of mena dione. The authors interpreted this effect as induced genomic instability that has previously been described, e.g., for ionizing radiation. Immediately afte r the exposure, MF was reported to induce ROS (DCFH-DA assay) and superoxide in mito chondria, and to decrease glutathione in ANOVA of the whole series, but the influence of MF alone seemed to be non-existent or low (superoxide) without menadione (which decreased both ROS and glutathione and increased superoxide) and was also low in co -exposure with menadione. Superoxide in cytosol and mitochondrial activity were affe cted by menadione but not by MF. 8 days after the end of the treatmen t, MF increased mitochondrial activity without menadione but did not affect the levels of ROS, glutat hione, lipid peroxidati on, or superoxide. 15 days after the exposure, the only parameters re ported to be significantly affected by MF were lipid peroxidation (apparent also without menadion e) and ROS production (obvious only at 20 \u00b5M menadione). According to the au thors, the results suggest that changes in oxidant/antioxidant balance induced by an initial effect of MF can lead to genomic Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 213 instability. Even if the effect on MN freque ncy seemed to be rather small, a prolonged increase in the level of chromosome damage may be expected to ha ve significance with respect to carcinogenesis (Luukkonen et al., 2014). Cho et al. (2014) employed PHA stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors to investigate the effects of ELF-EMF generated by MRI scanner on gadolinium (a contrast agent for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging) toxicity. Genotoxicity (strand breaks and MN induction) and cytotoxicity (cell viability, ROS and apoptosis) were investigated. Exposures/sh am exposures (60 Hz, 0.8 mT) of different duration up to 48 h, based on the biologic al parameter investigated, were carried out concurrently with several doses of gadolinium (0.2-1.2 mM). The results indicated that EMF exposure was able to enhance the gadolin ium induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Different results were reported by Buldak et al.: they exposed AT478 murine carcinoma cells to a 50 Hz MF, 1 mT, for 16 minutes and to cisplatin for 24 h, given concurrently or immediately after MF. A decrease in cisplatin-induced DNA mi gration was detected in co- exposed cultures, together with a decrease in ROS formation and antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, GSH-Px) as well as malo ndialdehyde concentration, compared to treatments with cisplatin al one (Buldak et al., 2012). Negative results were reported by Jin et al. (2012) who co-exposed mouse fibroblasts or human lung fibroblasts for 4 h to a 60 Hz MF (field intensity of 0.01, 0.5 and 1 mT) and hydrogen peroxide, ionizing radiation or c-Myc activation. In all cases no variation in MN frequency was detected respect to treatments with genotoxic agents alone in both cell types, although no clear information is repo rted on the co-exposure protocol adopted. Cellular transformation was evaluated by Lee et al. in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts exposed to a 60 Hz MF (1 mT) for 4 h in combination with several stress factors (ionizing radiation, hydrogen peroxide or myelocytomatosis oncoge ne (c-Myc) activation). No combined effects were detected for all the experimental conditions tested (Lee et al., 2012). The possibility that MF could modify biological responses to UV radiation by causing an overall change in oxidative reactions was investigated by Markkanen et al. Murine L929 fibroblasts were exposed to 50 Hz MF of 100 or 300 \u00b5T during 1 h UV exposure (240 J/m2) or for 24 h before it. No significant effects of MF on oxidative reactions were detected, as assessed by measuring ultr a weak chemilumines cence. The authors concluded that in the experimental conditions tested, MF is not able to modify the biological response of UV ra diation (Markkanen et al., 2010). The results reported above are summarized in Table 23. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 214 Table 23.

Luukkonen et al. detected an increase d DNA migration (comet assay) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells co-exposed to 8 72 MHz, continuous wave, (5 W/kg for 1 h) and menadione with respect to menadione-tr eated alone cells. This increase was not detected when a GSM signal was em ployed (Luukkonen et al., 2009). Zhijian et al. exposed human lymphoblastoid B-cells to 1800 MHz (SAR of 2.0 W/kg) and Doxorubicin (DOX). RF was given intermittently (5 min on/10 min off) for two hours, and several co-exposure protocols were tested. Th e authors detected influence on repair of DNA damage induced by DOX as a function of the exposure schedule (Zhijian et al., 2010), although in a previous paper the same research group reported that 24 h RF- Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 215 exposure in the same experime ntal conditions, followed by X-rays (0.25 - 2 Gy) did not induce variation in DNA damage (comet assa y) induced by X-rays in human white blood cells (Zhijian et al., 2009). Manti and co-workers exposed human periph eral blood lymphocytes to 4 Gy X-rays followed by 24 h exposure to 1950 MHz, UMTS (SAR 0.5 and 2 W/kg ). The RF field did not exacerbate the yield of X-rays-induced aberrant cells, as assessed by chromosomal aberrations, although the fr equency of exchanges per cell in X-ray irradiated cells resulted increased, es pecially at 2 W/kg (Manti et al., 2008). Four papers were published by the same rese arch group, showing that 20 h pre-exposure of human peripheral blood lymp hocytes to RF fields are ab le to reduce the genotoxic effects induced by chemical or physical mutagens, as assesse d by the evaluation of MN frequency. Such an effect was detected in cultures pre-exposed either to 900 MHz, GSM signal (Sannino et al., 2009a) or to 1950 MHz, UMTS, and treated with mi tomycin-C. In the latter case a SAR-dependent effect was al so detected (Zeni et al., 2012). The authors further evidenced that cells were required to be exposed to RF in the S-phase of the cell cycle to exhibit the reduce d DNA damage (Sannino et al., 2011). In a more recent investigation, the authors al so demonstrated the ability of 20 h RF exposure (1950 MHz, UMTS, 0.3 W/kg SAR) to induce protection towards X-ray induced chromosomal damage in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures (Sannino et al., 2014). They stated that taken together, their results in dicate the ability of RF exposure to induce adaptive response (AR). Gajski and Garaj-Vrhovac reported an increase in DNA migration, evaluated by means of the alkaline comet assay, in rat blood ly mphocytes exposed for 30 minutes to 915 MHz (GSM) 2.4 W/m2 (calculated SAR of 0.6 W/kg); treatments with honeybee venom given 4 hours before or immediately be fore RF resulted able to pr otect against RF-induced DNA damage (Gajski and Garaj-Vrhovac, 2009). Other studies reported absence of combined e ffects in terms of geno toxicity. Sannino et al., exposed human fibroblasts from healthy donors and sub jects affected by Turner's syndrome for 24 h to 900 MHz RF field (GSM signal, SAR of 1 W/kg) followed by 1 h treatment with 3-Chloro-4-(dichlorome thyl)-5-Hydroxy-2(5h)-furanone (MX), a carcinogen produced during chlorination of drinking water. No increase in MX-induced DNA migration was detected in co-exposed cultures (Sannino et al., 2009b). Luukkonen and co-workers also failed to fi nd enhancement of DNA migration in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells concurrently exposed to 872 MHz, continuous wave and GSM, (5 W/kg for 3 h) and ferrous chloride plus Diethyl maleate. Lack of cooperative effects was also detected in terms of ROS production and vi ability when cells were co- exposed to Ferrous chloride fo r 1 h (Luukkonen et al., 2010). Absence of variation in ferrous ions-induced ROS and cell viability was also reported by Brescia et al. (2009) in human lymphoblastoid T cells (Jurkat) co-exposed to 1950 MHz, UMTS signal, irrespective of SAR values (0.5 and 2 W/kg), exposure duration (5-60 min or 24 h) and co-exposure schedule (ferrous ions treatment concurrent or after RF exposure). On the contrary, Del Vecchio and co-workers reported an increase in some parameters related to oxidative stress following co-expos ures to 900 MHz. They co-exposed SN56 cholinergic and primary cortical fragments. Cell death due to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide was increased by RF co-exposure in SN56 cells but not in primary neurons, while combined treatments with a 25-35 beta-amyloid fragment did not affect cell viability in either cell types (Del Vecchio et al., 2009). The paper by Canseven et al. (2014) deals wi th the effect of expo sure to 1800 MHz, GSM signal on apoptosis and viability of Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) cells with or without Gemcitabine, an inhibition of DNA synthesis and apoptosis inducer. Cell cultures were Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 216 exposed to RF for 24 h at a SAR value of 0.35 W/kg. For co-exposure experiments, Gemcitabine was given for 24 h before RF measured using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining, resulted significantly increased, with a decrease in viability, in cells exposed to RF alone, compared to sham exposed cultures. Co-exposures showed significant increase in apoptotic cells and decrease in viability compared to cultures exposed to RF alone. In this investigation, cultures treated with Gemcitabine alone have not been includ ed in the study design. Only one paper deals with malignant transformation that resulted unaffected in mouse embryonic BALB/3T3 fibroblasts initiated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) and co- exposed 2142 MHz, W-CDMA RF fields at SARs of 0.08 or 0.8 W/kg and 12- Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Hirose et al., 2008). Further research is needed in order to clarif y the relevance of these exposures to cancer in humans under real life exposure conditions as well as to explore the potentially beneficial (prote ctive) effects.

No tumour co-promotion health effects from co-exposure to environmental stressors Experimental results reported since the previous opinion indicate that co-exposures of environmental stressors (such as physical or c h e m i c a l a g e n t s ) w i t h E L F o r R F l a c k consistency. Under the same conditions, effe cts might be increased, decreased or not influenced at all and are not linked to specific experimental protocols. Due to the small number of available investigations and the large variety of protocols used (different chemical or physical treatments and different EMF exposure conditions), it is not possible to draw definitive conc lusions. Therefore, th e relevance of co-exposures of environmental stressors (such as physical or chemical agents) with ELF or RF to human health under real-life exposure conditions remains unclear. 3.12. EMF effects on implanted medical devices It is known that people with implanted act ive and passive medical devices belong to a group that needs special attention when doing risk assessment for exposure to electromagnetic fields . Medical electronic devices\u2014such as pacemakers, and passive metallic implants (orthopaedic prostheses )\u2014implanted in people of working age are increasingly used. EMF, if su fficiently intense, may interf ere with electronic medical devices causing malfunction and subsequent injury or illness. Potential interactions include electromagnetic interference, st atic magnetic fields which may cause displacement of ferromagnetic implants , and time-varying EMFs which may cause electrostimulation or heating of adjacent ti ssue, depending on the device or implant and the frequency of the fields. Hocking and Hans son Mild (2008) have published a guidance Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 218 note providing generic advice in risk identi fication, risk assessmen t and risk control for managements of workers with medi cal implants exposed to EMF. There have been some recent studies on the effect of EMF on active and passive implants. Tiikkaja et al. (2012a,b; and 2013) have performed thorough analyses of how pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defib rillators (ICDs) may be affected by an external ELF magnetic field. They first made an experiment al study where they exposed pacemakers (Tiikkaja et al. 2012a) and ICDs (T iikkaja et al. 2012b) to magnetic fields (2 - 1000 Hz, sinusoidal, pulse, ramp, and square waveforms) created in a Helmholtz coil and with the devices immersed in physiological saline solution in a plastic box. It was observed that pacemaker malfunction occurr ed in six of the 16 pacemakers, starting almost immediately upon expo sure to the strong MF. At some frequencies when using ramp or square waveforms, interference even occurred at levels below public exposure limits. For the ICDs, malfunctions occurred in 11 of the 17 specimens tested. In most cases, no interference occurred at magnetic field levels below the occupational safety limits (ICNIRP 2010). Tiikkaja et al. (2013) followed up the expe rimental studies with a study on eleven volunteers with pacemakers an d 13 with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The effect of ELF magnetic fi elds (sine, pulse, ramp, and square waveform ) with flux densities up to 0.3 mT was investigated. Bi polar settings caused no interference, but three of the devices tested in unipolar sensin g mode were affected by the highest fields. One was also affected by an EAS gate and a welding cable. The authors conclude that in most cases, employees can return to work af ter implantation of a bipolar pacemaker or an ICD, but require an appropriate risk assessment. However, pacemakers programmed to unipolar working mode can cause danger to their users in envi ronments with high electromagnetic fields. Other studies of interest regarding compatibility problems with active implants are for instance Barbouri et al. (2009), Joosten et al. (2009) Korpinen et al. (2012), Souques et at (2011) and Seidman et al. (2010). The interference with medical devices is a well-known phenomenon in MRI investigations and there are several publications dealing wi th the heating of the implant and adjacent tissue. However, related risk assessment goes beyond the mandate for this Opinion. 3.13. Research re commendations Research to date has not been able to iden tify with any certaint y any adverse health effect resulting from exposure to EMFs at an y frequency or intensity typically found in the workplace or everyday environment. Epidemio logical studies have reported associations between EMF exposure and cert ain diseases, most notably for an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with exposure to low fr equency magnetic fields, but none of these associations can be considered causal, pr imarily because of shortcomings of those studies, the lack of support from laboratory studies, and an inability to identify biophysical interactions mechanisms. However, not all areas have been studied to the same extent, and research with some frequencie s or modulations is very limited, and this is particularly true regarding new and emerging technologies. A number of areas were identified where th e information regarding health effects is either absent or insufficient, or is too di scordant to allow science-based assessment of the possibility of health effects. It is recommended that steps are taken to fill these gaps in knowledge, as outlined in the following list of research recommendations. These recommendations are organised by frequency, starting with static fields and rising through the spectrum to THz fields. In addi tion, recommendations are made for research on combined exposures to various frequenc ies and co-exposures with other stressors. The previous Opinion from SCENIHR (2009a) al so made research recommendations that were enlarged in a second Opinion on research needs and methodology (SCENIHR 2009b). Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 219 3.13.1. Static fields including MRI exposure With regard to static electric fields, ther e is little information from representative population based samples on thresholds for perception, annoyance, and other effects, especially in the presence of varying ion conc entrations in the air. There is a need to collect such data with high priority in view of the upcoming construction of high-voltage DC overhead powerlines. [R1]. There is very little information regarding the health effects of occu pational exposure to MRI fields. Therefore, long-term prospective or retrospective cohort studies on workers that are exposed to high stra y fields from the construction or operation of MRI devices are recommended as a high priority [R2]. Th ese studies could be used to investigate long-term risk of disease, but also use potential biomarkers for cancer risk and neurological disease as intermediate end-points. As noted in the previous Opinion, MRI is al so increasingly used in paediatric imaging diagnosis. A cohort study in to the effects of MRI exposure on children is recommended as a high priority [R3] provided that the feasibility of such a study can be shown in a pilot phase. A retrospective study would have the advantage of allowing future extension of follow-up and incorporation of addition al endpoints. Internal comparison between patients with different levels of exposu re (number of examinations, body areas examined) would be the most appropriate de sign. These recommendations are made in order to improve knowledge about possible ri sks associated with MRI: they are not motivated by existing evid ence of adverse effects. It has been reported that DNA integrity in patients may be affected after an MRI investigation, although the animal and mechanistic data do not suggest that static magnetic fields alone are resp onsible. Therefore further st udies investigating genotoxic effects following MRI investigations in either patients or volunteers are recommended as a medium priority [R4]. As members of staff are increasingly working in the immediate vicini ty of MRI equipment, studies investigating possible cognitive effects of exposure to magnetic gradient fields are recommended as a medium priori ty in humans and animals [R5]. Mechanistic studies with static magnetic fi elds that address basic neurophysiological effects on neurons are recommended as a low priority [R6]. These have the potential to resolve inconsistencies in the data rela ting to effects on nervous system. Further studies on potential developmental effects in animals [R 7], and studies with volunteers exploring effects of exposure at 3 T and above on the cardiovascular system [R8] are recommended as a low priority. In all the available in vitro studies with static magnetic fiel ds, gene expression resulted in alterations. Studies on gene expression and epigenetic studies are recommended with medium priority [R9]. 3.13.2. ELF fields Epidemiological studies indicate an increased risk of leukaemia in children exposed to magnetic fields, although there is a lack of support for such an effect from laboratory studies. Further studies using recently-developed mouse models of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are recommended as a high priori ty [R10]. These should include exposures during gestation when the initiating events are considered to occur. The possibility of strain-specific increases in sensitivity to magnetic fields is recommended as a medium priority [R11], since this could lead to the identification of biomarkers. These experiments should be of sufficient size and sensitivity to reject the possibility of false positives. Whether exposure to magnetic fields may affect the development or progression of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear and further epidemiological and experimental studies are re quired. A cohort or register-based case- Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 220 control study on magnetic fiel d exposure Alzheimer's diseas e incidence or mortality is recommended as a high priority [R12]. Labo ratory studies are also necessary to gain insight into possible mechanisms, and studies using validated models of Alzheimer's disease are recommended as a high priority [R 13]. Of particular interest would be the identification of potential biomarkers. A recent study suggests an association between maternal magnetic fi eld exposure during pregnancy and asthma and childhood obesity in offspring. These intriguing results require independent confirmation and study using a cohort of pregnant women with measured field exposures, detailed information on pote ntial confounding factors and using standard definitions of obesity is recommended as a medium priority [R14]. Two provocation studies have identified single participants (out of the many who have been tested in this way across the literature ) who seemed to react consistently to the presence of electric or magnetic fields (McCarty et al., 2011; Koteles et al., 2013). Independent replication of the ability of the spec ific participants tested in these studies to react to ELF fields is therefore recommended a s a h i g h p r i o r i t y [ R 1 5 ] . T h e s e s t u d i e s should use best practice methods, includin g the prior registration of a protocol. 3.13.3. IF fields Research in this area remains very limited and there are very few data regarding health outcomes. The previous Opinion focused on the risks on pregnancy outcome from anti- theft devices in shops because of the expo sed area of the body, exposures that may exceed reference levels, and the numbers of young women working in these jobs. In the absence of new epidemiological data, this study remains a high priority [R16], provided reasonably-sized occu pational groups with sufficien t exposure can be identified and their exposures can be well-characterize d. These studies shou ld also investigate potential biomarkers of exposure, provided appropriate control groups can be chosen. This work should be supplemented with ex perimental studies using a wider range of exposures and such studies are recomme nded with a medium priority [R17]. 3.13.4. RF fields Although there is little evidence that moderate use of mo bile phones is associated with any cancer in the head and neck region , a prospective cohort study in adults investigating long-term effects of RF fields associated with use of mobile phones is r e c o m m e n d e d w i t h a h i g h p r i o r i t y [ R 1 8 ] . The study should be of sufficient size and duration to allow the evaluation of realisti c effect sizes. The st udy should reflect the latest developments in exposure assessmen t, and additional ou tcomes could include cerebrovascular and neurod egenerative disease. While the only available study found no increased risk, whether children show an increased tumour risk to RF fields remains unclear. Further studies of the effects of RF fields associated with mobi le phone use and brain tumours in children are recommended as a high priority [R19]. These should incl ude children of a younge r age than those that have been studied to date, and be of sufficient duration to include assessments of cancer risk later in life. Where practical, other sour ces that produce significant RF exposure of the brain should be included in assessing exposure. No further studies investigating the genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of RF fields in animal models are recommended. However, this recommendation should be reconsidered following the publication of the US National Toxicology Program study that is nearing completion. Several in vitro studies have reported effects on non-fixed DNA damage following RF exposure. Further studies on DNA migration, spindle disturbance and foci formation are recommended with a medium priority [R20] to provide additional data and clarification. The available evidence regarding mobile use on development, cognitive function and behaviour in children does not suggest that adverse effects occur, but the data are Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 221 limited and further studies are recommended with a medium priority [R21]. These studies should include charac terisation of exposure patte rns in (mothers) children and adolescents, and validated exposure assessmen t. Experimental studies with immature animals can address some of the questions re lating to effects on early development of the brain and behaviour. Most neurophysiological studie s on possible effects of RF ex posure on brain function in volunteers have been performed with youn g and predominately male subjects. Since brain structure and brain physiology changes with age possible RF EMF effects may also show age dependencies. It is not known wh ether effects may change with age, and further studies using elderly and children and adolescent su bjects are recommended as a medium high priority on sl eep and sleep EEG power [R22], waking EEG [R23], and a medium priority on cognition [R24]. In particular, every study assessing EEG during exposure must ensure that the RF signal does not affect the acquisition of the EEG. If the device used to record the EEG does no t offer an adequate resistance against electromagnetic interference, ei ther detectable artefacts in the EEG signal or subtle changes of the electrical prop erties of the recording syst em might occur and bias the results. Future studies should report th at they have considered this problem. Studies on possible effects on cognition must pay attention to numerous other factors that can affect the test results. These incl ude exposure design (cross-over vs. parallel group design, exposure before or during testing, avoida nce of carryover effects), selection of test subjects (age, sex, inclus ion and exclusion criteria), consumption of caffeinated beverages and alcoho l, motivation, test sequence and duration, and time of day. For example, a study of 30 young me n (Sauter et al. 2011) showed that after correcting for multiple testing, the time of day was the only factor that affected the results of cognitive tests: exposure had no effect. Overall, there is a high priority rese arch need for (preferably multicentre) neurophysiological studies in volunteers wi th pre-defined effect sizes, based on a priori considerations of power and sample size (typ e I and type II errors and adequate sample size for the statistical test(s) to be used) for data analysis according to a predefined analysis protocol [R25]. There are a few studie s indicating that women are more affected than men, exposure effects vary with age, and that patient popula tions could be more affected than healthy subjects. Hence, prop osed studies should cover a wide range of ages, look at data for females and males se parately and, if possi ble, include patient populations, e.g. insomniacs in sleep studies or patients with neurological disorders including neurodegenerative diseases. Although most studies have suggested that RF fields are unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms that are attributed to them, it is clear that these symptoms can have a major detrimental impact on quality of life. Additional research on RF mechanisms of these symptoms is recommended as a low priority [R26]. Research recommendations relating to symptoms that currently have no adequate medical explanation are outside of the remit for this Opinion. However, other ex pert bodies should consider whether the evidence base for treating patients who attr ibute symptoms to EMF is currently adequate. The evidence suggesting th at RF fields affect male ferti lity is weak and the existing ex vivo studies reporting positive effects have methodological problems. Cohort studies are recommended only if a study design is available that can overcome potential confounding and recall bias regarding phone use and the study has appropriate exposure assessment. An animal study investigating effects on reactive oxygen species activity in field-exposed sperm is recommended as a low priority [R27] provided the study has sufficient power to detect subtle changes (reported effect sizes are modest) and employs detailed computational methods to characterise the absorbed power in the testes. 3.13.5. THz technologies Considering the expected increa se in the use of THz technolo gies, experimental research related to possible adverse effects on the skin and the cornea is recommended as a high Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 222 priority [R28]. In particular, human and anim al studies should focus on the effects of long-term, low-level exposure on the skin, and on the effects of high-intensity, short- term exposure on the cornea. Studies to da te have used a relatively narrow frequency range (0.1-1 THz) so future studies sh ould also use higher frequencies. Monitoring of occupati onally-exposed groups for skin and eye changes and disorders is recommended as medium priority [R29], provid ed suitably-sized gr oups with sufficient and can be identi fied with an appropri ately matched control group. 3.13.6. Combined exposures to EMF Although few studies have examined this possibility, the available data suggest that combined exposures to different fields or si gnals do not cause sign ificant effects with total exposures below international guideline values. Further laboratory studies investigating effe cts of combined exposures on genotoxicity, cancer, development and neurobehaviour are recommended as a medium priority [R30]. In particular, since people are exposed to a variety of frequencies in the everyday environment, the effects of co mbined exposures to low and high frequencies should be examined. 3.13.7. Co-exposure with other agents Further animal studies are recommended as me dium priority to clarify the role of co- exposure to magnetic fields as a co-carcino gen [R31] and the apparent protective effects of RF fields against the ionizing radiation [R32]. Further in vitro research is needed to clarify the relevance of combined exposures to human carcinogenicity under real life conditions and to explore the potentially beneficial (protective) effects of such exposures on humans. These studies are recommended with a medium priority [R33] provided that justif ication can be provided for the chosen model (for both EMF exposure and co-treatment). 3.13.8. Exposure assessment Microdosimetry aims at the quantitative investigation of the interaction of electromagnetic fields at the microscopic level, i.e. at cellular or subcellular levels. With the emergence of THz technology and nanose cond pulses applications this area of exposure assessment needs to be strengthen ed both experimentally (e.g. single cell exposure setups) as well as the theoretically, since it may result in the elucidation of underlying biophysical mechanisms that are still missing. This research subject [R34] can be considered of medium priority. The dielectric properties of tissues are of utmost importance in the exposure assessment with numerical techniques, both for medical applications as well as experiments in bioelectromagnetics. There is a scarcity of data and systemat ic studies in the literature for these properties at static fields and the lower ELF and THz ranges, introducing a high degree of uncertainty in the evaluated electr omagnetic field distri butions. Dielectric spectroscopy measurements of - preferably - human tissues from su bjects of different ages, gender or physiological condit ions [R35] are of high priority. In prospective epidemiological studies it is useful to be able to characterize personal exposure with several types of metrics both for the general public and the workers. The instrumentation that is available currently is either detailed and expensive, making itself prohibitive to be used for large samples, or cheap and prone to la rge uncertainties and exposure misclassification. It is necessary, but at a medium priority, to continue the research in the manufacturing of new affordable instrumentation or the improvement of existing specialized exposure meters [R36]. It is equally important to launch new methodologies in collecting exposure data at a personal or an environmental level with Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 223 the use of simple everyday eq uipment, like mobile electronic devices, and techniques like crowd-sensing [R37]. Table 25. Research recommendations by type of field and priority Type of field High priority Medium priority Low priority SMF inc MRI 3.14. Guidance on research methods As mentioned in section 3.2, there are a number of limitations and practical difficulties common to all lines of scientific research de aling with the study of the biological and possible health effects of EMF. These limitations have often resulted in data that are unsuitable or unusable for the purposes of ri sk assessment. In this section, several recommendations are made to researchers whic h are intended to function as a guide to improve experimental design and to offer some minimum requirements to ensure the quality of the data that are collecte d can be used for risk assessment. Because of the large number of different en dpoints and protocols that are used in bioelectromagnetics research, it is not po ssible to produce a single, multipurpose exposure setup that is applicable to all ty pes of study. Neverthe less, a generic design algorithm for the development of experimental setups in th is area was published more than ten years ago by Kuster and Sch\u00f6nb orn (2000). This document described the minimal requirements necessary to achieve the appropriate quality of data for risk assessment. It was the intention of the authors that those guidelines \"might be of benefit not only as a yardstick for setup designers, but also for reviewers and bodies evaluating programs and studies\". Unfortunately, this objective has only been partially accomplished, because studies have continued to be published which do not comply with several critical requirements of the document. Recently, more detailed guidance has become available on experimental design for in vitro experiments using RF fields . Although it is still not possible to specify a single exposure system, it is possible to specify some priorities in design to ensure that the appropriate exposure system is identified and used (Paffi et al., 2010). Among the most important priorities to be met in the procedure of designing or choosing an in vitro exposure system is the ability to accurately determine the elec tric and magnetic fields in the exposed samples and to ensure there ar e experimental conditions optimal for cell growth. Controlled conditions are also required for biological materials that are not limited to in vitro experiments using RF fields. The appropriate cell model has to be chosen for specific experimental approaches, and the standardization of cell culture is achieved by controlling the mate rials, such as cells and cult ure medium, that interact and determine the properties of the whole sy stem. More than one endpoint has to be investigated for each cellular target in or der to also balance me chanistic vs. toxicity studies. Thus, a combination of techniques, confirming and/or complementing each other, is recommended for the reliable detect ion of effects. A general requirement for the biological assay in a well-designed in vitro experiment is the high sensitivity, and particular care must be de voted to set up accurate ex perimental control samples. Negative and positive controls provide evidence for controlled experimental conditions, while sham exposed samples, and blind exposu re conditions are also necessary. Finally, Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 224 the procedures established in preliminary expe riments have to be recorded in writing and strictly followed throughout the subsequent experiments in a Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-like approach. These have to allow und erstanding of what was done, and why it was done, and to allow the biological rele vance of the study to be independently scrutinized and the reliability and validity of the findings to be assessed. There should always be enough information in publications to allow the experiments to be repeated by independent laboratories (Zeni and Scarfi, 2012). Exposure assessment in all biological experi ments should be as accurate as possible. However, the evaluation of electric and ma gnetic field distributions is not trivial, especially when dealing with humans and laboratory animals, since the field distributions depend not only on physical factors such as wavelength, but also on biological factors such as body size and body shape, and on va riables such as body posture. Nevertheless, calculations and measurements of the ab sorbed energy within the organism are important to determine not only how much energy was absorbed, but also where absorption actually occurred in the body (P affi et al., 2013). Indeed, organ-specific dosimetry is considered necessary to help to establish causality. The methodology for dosimetry in animal experiments with a special emphasis on uncertainty calculations and both intra- and inter-animal va riation is given by Kuster et al. (2006). In addition, Paffi et al. (2013) provide a systematic review and cla ssification of in vivo microwave exposure systems used for bioelectromagneti cs research in the last decade. The main features of each system's typology are pr esented and discussed fo r different types of experiments. This review of the strengths and weaknesses of each exposure system is useful for identifying the features necessary for new studies. While the majority of recent human provocat ion studies have been of reasonably good quality, scope remains for researchers to improv e the future methodolog ical rigour of this field still further. In particular, the quality of reporting in many papers can sometimes make it difficult to assess ex actly what was done, how it was done or even why it was done. Particular issues currently exist in terms of the details provided as to which areas of the brain were exposed, how double-blindi ng was achieved, how the sample size for the study was determined, how the issue of co nducting multiple statistical analyses was treated, and, in case of not statistically significant results, a power consideration should be addressed. With respect to exposure of the brain, a guidance for the design of respective exposure setups already exists in the literature (Kuster et al., 2004) as well as comparisons between various setups (Boutr y et al., 2008) and exemplary studies of thorough dosimetric analysis (Schmid et al., 2012; Murbach et al., 2012) at different frequency ranges. In particular, for provocation studies with cognitive performance as the investigated parameter, several aspe cts of experimentation and corresponding recommendations were given by Regel and Achermann (2011). It is apparent that the large majority of human provocation studies in this field fail to lodge their experimental protoc ols with a publically accessibl e repository before starting their data collection. Publishing a detailed protocol has become a common practice for \"any research study that pros pectively assigns human partic ipants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes\" (Laine et al. 2007) and is now recommended or required by many mainstream medical journals, the World Health Organization and the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA General Assembly, 2008). Registration guards against pu blication bias for studies as a whole, and selective reporting of outcomes or analyses within specific studies. It is disappointing that registration has not, as yet, been adopte d as standard practice among researchers investigating effects of EMF. Benefactors, rese archers and journal editors within this field should consider how regist ration can be encouraged. These methodological problems also apply to epidemiological studies. A very good introduction in such problems, although specif ic to mobile phones and cancer, is the work by Auvinen et al. (2006), which can help researchers identify and eliminate potential limitations of their own study designs. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 225 4. OPINION As part of its mandate, the SCENIHR is asked to continuously monitor new information that may influence the assessment of ri sks to human health in the area of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and to provide regular updates on the scientific evidence base to the Commission. A sufficient number of ne w scientific publications have appeared since the last Opinion of 2009 to warrant a new analysis of the scienti fic evidence on possi ble effects on human health of exposure to EMF. In addition, th e development of novel technologies using THz fields calls for new assessments also in this frequency range. Held on 16-17 November 2011, the Internat ional Conference on EMF and Health, organized by the European Commission under th e auspices of the SC ENIHR, provided an overview of the most recent sci entific developments in this ar ea as a first preparation for a future scientific Opinion. Consequently, the SCENIHR is being asked to examine this new scienti fic evidence and to address in particular the four major ques tions listed in the Terms of Reference. 1. To update its Opinion of 2009 in th e light of newly available information. In most of the sections of the Scientific Rationale in the current Opinion, reports appearing in the literature afte r 2009, i.e. after the publicat ion of the previous Opinion, have been considered. Therefor e, the present Opinion covers studies that were published (at least electronically) betw een 2009 and June 30, 2014. Howe ver, certain sections of the Scientific Rationale were not covered in the previous Opinions. In such cases, reports published before 2009 have also been take n into account for the risk assessment. 2. To give particular attention to is sues affected by important gaps in knowledge in the previous Opinions, especially: 2a. the potential adverse effects of EMF on the nervous system, including neuro- behavioural disorders and on the risk of neo-plastic diseases; RF fields Previous studies suggesting that RF exposure may affect brain activi ties as reflected by changes in the EEG during wake and sleep are confirmed by resu lts of more recent studies. However, given the variety of app lied fields, duration of exposure, number of considered leads, and statistical methods it is difficult to derive firm conclusions. For event-related potentials and slow brain oscillations results are inconsistent. Likewise, studies on cognitive functions in humans lack consistency. The biological relevance of reported small physiological EEG changes re mains unclear, and mech anistic explanation is still lacking. A reasonable body of experimental evidence now suggests that exposure to RF does not trigger symptoms, at least in the short-term . While additional observational studies are required to assess whether longer-term expo sure could be associ ated with symptoms, the evidence to date weighs against a causal effect. Human studies on neurological diseases an d symptoms show no clear effect, but the evidence is limited. Human studies on child development and behavioural problems suffer from conflicting results and methodological li mitations. Therefore, the evidence of an effect is weak. Effects of exposure on foet uses from mother's mo bile phone use during pregnancy are not plausible owing to extremely low foetal exposure. Overall, the epidemiological studies on RF EMF exposure do not show an increased risk of brain tumours. Furthermore, they do not indi cate an increased risk for other cancers of the head and neck region. Some studies raised questions regarding an increased risk of glioma and acoustic neuroma in heavy users of mobile phones. The results of cohort and incidence time trend studies do not support an increased risk for glioma while the Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 226 possibility of an association with acoustic neuroma remains open. Epidemiological studies do not indicate increased risk for other malig nant diseases including childhood cancer. A considerable number of well-performed in vivo studies using a wide variety of animal models have been mostly negative in outcom e. These studies are considered to provide evidence for the absence of a carcinogenic effect. A large number of in vitro studies pertaining to genotoxic as well as non-genotoxic end- points have been published since the last Opin ion. In most of the studies, no effects of exposure at levels below exposure limits were recorded, although in some cases DNA strand breaks and spindle disturbances were observed. IF fields This part of the frequency spectrum remains poorly investigated with respect to potential health effects resulting from exposure to EMF. ELF fields Studies investigating possible effects of ELF MF exposure on the power spectra of the waking EEG of volunteers are too heterogeneous with regard to applie d fields, duration of exposure, number of considered leads, an d statistical methods to draw any sound conclusion. The same applies for the resu lts concerning behavioural outcomes and cortical excitability. Only a few new epidemiological studies on neurodegenerative diseases have been published since the previous Opinion. They do not provide support for the previous conclusion that ELF magnetic field exposure could increa se the risk for Alzheimer's disease or any other neurodegenerative diseas es or dementia. Animal studies that have suggested beneficial effects of strong magnetic fields require confirmation. The evidence with respect to self-reported symptoms is discordant. While most studies have not found an effect of exposure, two experimental studies have identified individual participants who may reliably react to magnetic fields. However, replication of these findings is essential before weight is given to these results. The new epidemiological studies are consistent with earlier findings of an increased risk of childhood leukaemia with estimated daily average exposures above 0.3 to 0.4 \u00b5T. As stated in the previous Opinions, no mechan isms have been identified and no support from experimental studies could explain these findings, which, together with shortcomings of the epidemiological studies prevent a causal interpretation. 2b. the understanding of biophysical mechanis ms that could explain observed biological effects and epidemiological associations; Despite a number of studies continuing to report candidate mechanisms, particularly regarding effects on reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defence, no mechanism that operates at levels of exposure found in the everyday environment has been firmly identified and experimentally validated. It is important to stress here the difficulties of demonstrating small changes in gene expression that may occur following in vivo exposure to EMF which are due to inherent variability of biological responses and the technical limitations in the sensitivity of existing technologies. 2c. the potential role of co-exposures with other environmental stressors in biological effects attributed to EMF. Experimental results reported since the previous opinion indicate that co-exposures of environmental stressors (such as physical or c h e m i c a l a g e n t s ) w i t h E L F o r R F l a c k consistency. Under the same conditions, effe cts might be increased, decreased or not influenced at all and are not linked to specific experimental protocols. Due to the small number of available investigations and the large variety of protocols used (different chemical or physical treatments and different EMF exposure conditions), it is not possible to draw definitive conc lusions. Therefore, th e relevance of co-exposures of environmental Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 227 stressors (such as physical or chemical agents) with ELF or RF to human health under real-life exposure conditions remains unclear. 3. To review the scientific evidence available to understand the potential adverse health effects of EMF in the THz range. The number of studies investigating potential biological, non-thermal effects of THz fields is small, but has been increasing over recent years, due to the availability of adequate sources and detectors. In vivo studies indicate mainly bene ficial effects on disorders of intravascular components of microcirculation in rats under immobiliz ation stress, but do not address acute and chronic toxicity or carcinogenesis. In vitro studies on mammalian ce lls differ greatly with respect to irradiation conditions and endpoints under investigation. Studies suggesting effects of exposure have not been replic ated in independent laboratories. Some theoretical mechanisms have been proposed, but no conclusive experimental support is available. 4. To develop a set of prioritized rese arch recommendations updating previous efforts in this area (in particular by the SCENIHR and the WHO). These recommendations should include methodological guidance on the experimental design and minimum requirements to ensure data quality and usability for risk assessment. A set of prioritized research recommendations and method ological guidance on the experimental design and minimu m requirements to ensure da ta quality and usability for risk assessment are provided in chap ters 3.14 and 3.15 of the Opinion.

GLOSSARY This section includes technical terms and definitions used within the document. The definitions are given in alphabetical order. Alpha-band/waves : A specific frequency range (8-13 Hz) of the human EEG activity which is associated with relaxed wakefulness. Conductivity : A property of a material that dete rmines the magnitude of the electric current density when an electric fi eld is impressed on the material. Confounding factor (confounder) : A confounding factor in an epidemiological study is a variable which is related to one or more of the variables defined in a study. The confounder may mask an actual associat ion or falsely demonstrate an apparent association between the study variables where no real association between them exists. If confounding factors are not measured and considered, bias may result in the conclusion of the study. Contralateral : On the opposite from another structure. Contralateral use of mobile phone : Preferred side of the he ad during mobile phone use corresponds to the side of th e head opposite to the tumour. Crossover design : A cross over design is a special situation where a separate comparison group is not present. Instead, ea ch subject receives both treatments or is exposed to both sham and active exposure and the outcomes under the two conditions are compared within the same subjects. Thus, the subject serves as his/her own control. Ideally in a crossover design, a subject is randomly assigned to a specific treatment/exposure order. Dielectric properties : In the context of this document the properties of a materials conductivity an d permeability. Double-blind (study) : Blinding is used to prevent co nscious as well as subconscious bias (e.g. by expectations) in research. In a double-blinded study the participants as well as the researchers are unaware of (blind to) th e nature of the treatment (e.g. a new drug or placebo) or the exposure condition (e.g. the exposure under study or sham) that the participants receive in the study. Ecological studies : An ecological or correlational study is one in which the unit of analysis is an aggregate of in dividuals and information is co llected on this group rather than on individual members. The association between a summary measure of disease and a summary measure of exposure is stud ied. An error of re asoning occurs when conclusions are drawn about indi viduals from data that are associated with groups, as relationships observed for groups may not necessarily hold for individuals. Electric field strength (E) : The magnitude of a field vector at a point that represents the force (F) on a charge (q). E is defined as E = F/q and is expressed in units of Volt per meter (V/m). Electroencephalogram (EEG) : Extracellular recording of the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. Electromagnetic field : Electromagnetic phenomena expr essed in vector functions of space and time. Electromagnetic radiation : The propagation of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves through space. EMF: Electromagnetic field. Exposure : Exposure occurs wherever a person is subjected to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields or cont act currents other than those originating from physiological processes in the body. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 231 Extremely low frequency (ELF) : Extremely low frequency fi elds include, in this document, electromagnetic fields from 1 to 300 Hz. Far field : The far field of an antenna or other so urce of an electromagnetic field is the field that is at a distance away which is far exceeding th e wavelength of the field. Frequency modulation (FM) : Frequency Modulation is a type of modulation representing information as variations in th e frequency of a carrier wave. FM is often used at VHF frequencies (30 to 300 MHz) for broadcasting music and speech. Frequency (Hz) : The number of cycles of a re petitive waveform per second. Intermediate frequencies (IF) : Intermediate frequencies ar e, in the frame of this report, defined as frequencie s between 300 Hz and 100 kHz. Ipsilateral : On the same side as another structure. Ipsilateral use of mobile phone : Preferred side of the head during mobile phone use corresponds to the side of the he ad where the tumour is located. Magnetic flux density (B) : The magnitude of a field vector at a point that results in a force (F) on a charge (q) moving with the velocity (v). The force F is defined by F = q*(v x B) and is expressed in units of Tesla (T). Magnetic field strength (H) : The magnitude of a field ve ctor that is equal to the magnetic flux density (B) di vided by the permeability ( ) of the medium. H is defined as H = B/ and is expressed in units of Ampere per metre (A/m). Microwaves : Microwaves are defined in the frame of this expertise as electromagnetic waves with wavelengths of approximately 30 cm (1 GHz) to 1 mm (300 GHz). Milliwatt (mW) : A unit of power equal to 10-3 Watt. Nanowatt (nW) : A unit of power equal to 10-9 Watt. Near field : The near field of an antenna or other source of an electr omagnetic field is the field in the close vicinity of the source, much less than the wavelength of the field. Nocebo: A nocebo effect is an adverse, non-spec ific effect caused by expectation or belief that something is harmful. Non - thermal effects (or athermal effects ): An effect which can only be explained in terms of mechanisms other than increased molecular motion (i .e. heating), or occurs at absorbed power levels so low that a thermal mechanism seems unlikely, or displays such an unexpected dependence upon an experimental variable that it is difficult to see how heating could be the cause. Permeability ( ): A property of a material that indi cates how much polarisation occurs when an electric field is applied. Power density (S): Power per unit area normal to the direction of propagation, usually expressed in watt per square meter (W/m\u00b2). Radio frequency (RF): The frequencies between 100 kHz and 300 GHz of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sham exposure: A control condition used to simulate the environmental conditions of the exposure under study, but in absence of exposure (Similar to Placebo-controlled, which is a term used to de scribe a method of research in which an inactive substance (a placebo) is given to one group of participants, while the treatment (usually a drug or a vaccine) being tested is given to another grou p. The results obtained in the two groups are then compared to see if the investigative treatment is more effective (or has more negative effects) than placebo. Both treatm ents may also be give n in succession to the same subjects, see crossover design.) Specific energy absorption rate (SAR): A measure of the rate of energy absorbed by or dissipated in an incremental mass contai ned in a volume element of dielectric Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 232 materials such as biological tissues. SAR is usually expressed in terms of watts per kilogram (W/kg). Static electric field: Static fields pr oduced by fixed potential differences. Static magnetic fields (SMF) : Static fields established by permanent magnets and by steady currents. VDU: Video display units for computers, vi deos, TV and some measurement devices using cathode ray tubes. Health effects of EMF - 2015 01 20 233 8.
