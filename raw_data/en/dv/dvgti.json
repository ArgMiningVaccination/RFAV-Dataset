Description Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is a man-made chemical commonly used as a preservative in processed foods.

BHT is also a chemical preservative used in animal feeds and drugs; therefore eatomg non-organic meats and dairy products may be another way in which exposure occurs. In addition to its use in food preservation, BHA is also used in the manufacture of rubber, tires and petroleum and is an ingredient in some cosmetics. While BHT is on the Federal Drug Administrations Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list of food additives, it carries with it risk of toxicity. Although not been enough research has been conducted involving humans to establish whether or not BHT is a carcinogen (chemical capable of causing cancer), limited evidence in animals suggests that BHT is carcinogenic. Some of BHT's potential carcinogenicity may come from its ability to cause toxic disruption of cell signaling, a process where chemical information is transferred from one cell to another or between different structures within the same cell. Proper cellular communication is not only important for optimal functioning of the bodys systems, but researchers now believe that poor communication between cells may be one of the causes of overgrowth of cells, a condition which eventually leads to cancer. BHT has been found to have other some adverse effects in animals including inhibiting normal growth patterns and causing reversible liver enlargement. At high levels in animals, BHT has caused significant brain and behavioral changes. Since BHT has been found to inhibit the enzymes that white blood cells (phagocytes) use to destroy bacteria, BHT disrupts the proper functioning of the immune system. Additionally, BHT seems to be capable of uncoupling a critical cellular energy-producing process known as phosphorylation with the result being a diminished supply of cellular energy available to power the cells, and therefore, the body.
