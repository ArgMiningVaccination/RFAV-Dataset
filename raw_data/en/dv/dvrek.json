BOOK A CONSULT Books currently full, reopening October 2023 Naturopath // Herbalist // Nutritionist BIANCA MARKOVIC Currently consulting from her Apothecary & Clinic located at Soul and Grace \"I started seeing Bianca because I was about to stop taking the contraceptive pill and needed to prepare my body as previously I did not have a period for 8 months. With the amazing knowledge and support from Bianca, I have had my period every month so far! She has been so thorough by looking at my diet, ways to reduce stress and overall inflammation.\" CM \"I had a lot of apprehension about seeing a Naturopath as I always thought it was woowoo. But Bianca was amazingly knowledgable about the science of herbs and cured my peri-oral dermatitis within 3 days! She changed my mind about Naturopaths and showed me that they use science and evidence to treat people.\" AT \"Seeing Bianca was the first time I felt like I was properly heard by a health professional. Ive suffered all my life from issues that were seemingly invisible to doctors, blood tests were always \"normal\" but still I was experiencing intense pain, to which the doctors replied \"its all in your head\". It wasn't til I saw Bianca that I felt listened too, genuinely cared for and like I had a health detective on my case who was looking for the root cause. Fast forward to 3 months down the track from beginning treatment with her and my chronic pain is SO much more manageable I'm motivated, inspired and now thanks to Bianca have the knowledge of how best to care for myself. I highly recommend her services.\" SL "}
