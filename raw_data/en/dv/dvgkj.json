Here is a Traditional Chicken Soup Recipe from one of my favorite professors at Pacific College of Oriental Medicine! Jeremy Pulsifer shared this recipe every semester with his Biological Aspects of Physics class because he knows how valuable it is to have strong Qi and blood. Traditionally, herbs have been used in cooking for both their healing properties and for flavor enhancement. The food we eat should clear and energize the body and allow the spirit to flourish. This delicious Chinese herb soup will boost your immune system, support your lungs, and nourish your blood and Qi, your \"life force\". You will feel revitalized. The herbs are tonifying and safe and help prevent common seasonal illnesses, such as colds and the flu. 1 Whole chicken, preferably organic 1 Packet of soup herbs (Astragalus Huang Qi, Ginseng Dang Shen, Reishi Mushroom Ling Zhi, Chinese Yam Shan Yao, Pear, Longan Fruit Long Yan Rou, Goji Berries Gou Qi Zi, & Honey fried Licorice Zhi Gan Cao) Vegetables, your choice After rinsing the chicken, place it in a large pot with the Chinese herbs. Fill the pot with cold water, allowing for two inches of water above the top of the chicken. Bring the water to a boil. Then put a lid on the pot, turn down the heat to allow a slow simmer, and continue cooking for about an hour. When the chicken is done, remove it from the broth and let it cool. (The meat will probably fall easily from the bones.) Add your favorite soup vegetables to the pot and continue cooking until the vegetables are done. Debone the chicken and return it to the soup. Eat it in good health. Dosage: Enjoy one bowl of soup daily, this recipe will last one person about one week. This recipe is traditionally made as a chicken soup but it is still effective when the chicken is eliminated and only vegetables and the herbs are used. The herb that looks like a tongue depressor should be removed as it has a woody texture and would not be pleasant to eat. If any of these herbs are difficult to find, you can omit some of them. Otherwise, you can come in to the office and request them from us. Originally published January 21, 2016. "}
