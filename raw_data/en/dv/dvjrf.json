The TRIPS II Agenda A powerful agenda for adoption of high le vels of intellectua l property protection, including related regulatory protection, is being advanced by the United States (and certain other developed countries) for de veloping countries, in cluding developing and emerging market countries of Asia.1 This agenda essentially reflects a TRIPS II exercise, but is largely being carried out in bilateral and regional negotiations, as well as in WTO accession negotiations. The TRIPS II agenda, as the TRIPS I age nda, is explained by strong mercantile interests seeking to increase technology and expression rents. Circumstances since the launch of the GATT Uruguay Round in 1986 ha ve changed substantially. In 1986, OECD industries were princi pally concerned with preventing weak developing country industries from substituting low-cost and of ten lower quality \"copied\" versions of products on local markets, but were not th reatened with competition in their home markets or with respect to orig inator and high-quality products.2 * Edward Ball Eminent Scholar Professo r of International Law, Florida St ate University College of Law.

This paper focuses on the implications of the TRIPS II agenda for the pharmaceutical sector in the Asian region. Copyright protection has significant im plications for \"access to knowledge\", in addition to entertainment, and this paper acknowledges the public welfare implications of developm ents with respect to copyright.3 However, the applicable legal norms and public welfare an alysis differ substantially as between the copyright-dependent and patent-dependent i ndustry sectors, and this paper will focus on the latter. II. The Problems of Innovation and Access A tremendous amount of attention has b een paid to the problem of \"access to medicines\" by nongovernmental organizations, in academic literature, the popular press, through industry response, and by governme nts, including in intergovernmental negotiations.4 A substantial part of this attenti on is devoted to problems of market failure.5 References to market failure are largel y grounded in differentia l levels of income and wealth in developing and develo ped countries. Among other consequences, differential market demand characteristic s cause the research-based pharmaceutical industry to invest principally in \"diseases of the North\".6 Market structure and regulatory failures cause the Pharma industry to concen trate on developing variations of existing products, rather than seek ing breakthrough innovations.7 Prices in lower income markets are not driven to marginal cost because of threat of export to a higher income markets. A substantial part of policy literature ar gues that problems of inadequate demand-pull may be remedied by Northern-tier subsidy, in some cases coupled with differential pricing.8 Governments and charitable organizations, operating , inter alia , through public- private partnerships may generate innovati on in neglected subject matter areas (i.e., diseases) characterized by insufficient demand- pull. Rules against \"parallel importation\" 3 See generally INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY 393 (Keith Maskus & Jerome H. Reichman eds., 2005). 4 See references in Frederick M. Abbott, Managing the Hydra: The Herculean Task of Ensuring Access to Essential Medicines , in K. Maskus & J. Reichman, id. 5 See, e.g., S AVING LIVES, BUYING TIME: ECONOMICS OF MALARIA DRUGS IN AN AGE OF RESISTANCE (Kenneth J. Arrow, Claire B. Panosian, and Helle n Gelband, eds. 2004), National Academies Press. 6 Report of the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health, Public health Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights, e.g., at 27-32, WHO 2006 and literature of Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), at http://www.dndi.org/. 7 See NIHCM Foundation, Changing Patte rns of Pharmaceutical Innovation (2002) relied on by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in its report on patents and competition ( see U.S. FTC, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy , October 2003, at Chapter 3, Part II). 8 Arrow, et al., note 5, advocating subsidy and noting general trend to differential pricing, but observing particular problem with differential pricing for malaria treatment because of lack of developed country market (at 65); WHO Commission on IPRs, at, e.g., 128-31. 2may be adopted to segregate markets and perm it differential pricing (at least at the inter- regional level).9 Although market failure based on income and wealth differential plays a significant role in the present failure of the international community to provide affordable treatments, and to generate innovation for bot h developed and developing markets, this paper suggests that a significant problem al so lies in the implementation of regulatory structures designed to preserve the existi ng global market dominance of OECD-based pharmaceutical suppliers. Problems of global pharmaceutical supply, including the promotion of innovation, should be understood in the context of a continuing struggle for dominance in which a relatively small number of highly capitalized OECD-based enterprises face increasingly strong competiti on from emerging market, and principally Asian, pharmaceutical enterprises. The extent to which competitive markets in pharmaceutical supply are able to develop ma y have important worldwide public welfare implications. This paper does not suggest that there is a single solution to the pharmaceutical innovation and access problem. Income and wealth differentials will continue to play a significant role in determining levels of access to medicines and other public health necessities, and governmental support measures will be needed to assure at least minimum access. The pharmaceutical sector may be the most complicated of all industry sectors in terms of regulatory issues, ranging from research and development (including the conduct of clinical tria ls), manufacturing practices, distribution, prescription and liability. 10 Bearing in mind the complexity of the issues, this paper argues that a failure to restrain the mercantilist agenda presently be ing implemented by the United States and other OECD countries will exacerbate exis ting problems and raise the economic and social cost of addressing the global problem. III. Industry Structure A. OECD OECD-based companies are the preponde rant developers and owners of pharmaceutical technology as reflected in pa tent holdings and originator regulatory approvals.11 OECD-based companies dominate OECD internal markets in sales of 9 WHO Commission, supra note 6. 10 See, e.g, Abbott, Managing the Hydra , supra , and U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study (2002), http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/07/genericdrugstudy.pdf .

A recent study by the OECD confirms that the overwhelming proportion of patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), and at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), European Patent Office (EPO) and Japan Patent Office were from developed country inventors. OECD, Compendium of Patent Statistics 2004 (OECD 2004). In 2001, for example, the United States, European Union and Japan accounted for 86.3 percent (86.3%) of PCT applica tions, Korea, Canada, Switzerland and Australia 3originator and, to a marginally lesser extent, generic products. Reve nues from originator markets far outweigh revenues from generics markets.12 Japan is counted among the major OECD pharmaceutical powers.13 OECD dominance in the pharmaceutical sector is very heavily subsidized by OECD governments. The US National Institutes of Health budget of $28 billion per year is principally devoted to re search on new therapies,14 the results of which are made available at virtually no cost to US Pharma companies. Moreover, the US federal government through the Medicare Part D progr am is massively underwriting the purchase of prescription drugs,15 which purchases inure largely to the benefit of US-based Pharma companies. The regulatory procedures under which new drugs are evaluated and approved are funded by the government.16 New programs for the development of vaccines are being funded by the US federal government.17 Other OECD governments subsidize pharmaceutical research and developm ent to a lesser degree, and they support the Pharma industry through government drug reimbursement programs. The pharmaceutical sector is not a \"private ma rket economy\". It is heavily government- subsidized and regulated. To the extent th at US and other OECD Pharma companies accounted for nine percent (9%), Ch ina for 0.8%, Russian Federation 0.6% and rest of world 3.3%. Id., at 20, Graph 7. Brazil and China have experienced substantial increases in the number of patents filed locally, but foreign applicants account for the bulk of the increases. Id., at 35-36. 12 New products and markets fuel growth in 2005 , IMS Health.com, May 3, 2006 : \"Despite a growth rate of 7%, down slightly from 2004 and the lowest since 1998, in 2005 total global pharmaceutical sales passed another threshold to reach $602 billion*, ... In the 10 leading international markets combined, which account for 81% of world-wide sales, audited growth was just 5.7%, down from 7.2% in 2004. Emerging markets, however, such as China, South Korea, Braz il, Russia and Turkey a ll experienced double- digit growth - signalling the important shifts currently occurring in the global pharmaceutical market. ... Generics will assume a more central role as patients bear a greater percentage of their healthcare costs and payers seek to restrict the growth of healthcar e expenditures. Price moderation for branded drugs is likely as a result, increasing the importance of, for example, improved product launches and accelerating the growth of existing drugs. In 2005 sales of generics in the top eight markets (the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Japan) exceeded $55 billion, and are expected to experience double-digit growth over the next five years.\" 13 Japan-based enterprises have invested heavily in the Chinese economy, and it is probable that Japanese pharmaceutical companies are significantly involved in the Chinese market. 14 On NIH budget, see Abbott, World Pharmaceutical Trade , supra note 1, at note 58. 15 A February 9, 2005, letter from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to the Chair of the House Committee on Weighs in Means estimates the cost of Part D through 2015 as $798 billion.

B. India Indian producers have acquired a signifi cant share of developi ng country generics markets, but have historically lacked acce ss to high value OECD consumer markets.18 Indian generic producers are increasingly pe netrating OECD markets, focusing on high profit opportunities and shifting from con centration on developi ng country markets.19 They are seeking early market entry and 180-day exclusivity periods under the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act system,20 and they are purchasing stakes in OECD generics producers.21 Capitalization of the Indian pharmaceu tical industry is rapidly growing and is reflected in stock market valuations.22 The Indian government is increasing attention to research and development funding.23 India's primary focus remains on the generics market, but its enterprises and government are pursuing penetration of the global originator market. Developmen t of the clinical trial subi ndustry, coupled with advances in R&D capacity, should make India a successful low-cost developer of new therapies. The internal Indian regulatory structure is undergoing a transformation, largely based on implementation of TRIPS I requirements as the ten-year pharmaceutical transition period ended on December 31, 2004.24 Amendments to the Patents Act included implementation of pharmaceutical product patent protection.25 Nine thousand \"mailbox\" 18 For historical data, see Carsten Fink, Patent Protection, Transnational Corporations, and Market Structure: A Simulation Study of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry , 1 J.

Gaz. India Extraordinary pt. II, sec. 1 (2005), Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, No. 15 , New Delhi, 5 Apr. 2005 (An Act further to amend the Patents Act, 1970). In addition to introducing pharmaceutical product pate nt protection, the 2005 amendments (1) defined \"inventive step\" to require t echnical advance as compared to existing knowledge, or having economic significance; (2) expressly lim ited patentability of different forms of the same substance absent a showing of a significant difference in efficacy; (3) maintained a reasonably strong form of pre-grant opposition; (4) eliminated an unnecessary hurdle to the grant of compul sory licenses under the WTO August 30, 2003 Decision; (5) clarified exports permitted under the general compulsory licensing provision (e.g., expressly authorizing export of the nonpredominant part of production), as well as establishing certain presumptive time frames used in that provision; (6) improved a provision intended to 5applications are under review. The Act reta ined the institution of pre-grant opposition proceedings. The WTO August 30, 2003 waiver for exports under compulsory license was implemented.26 A sui generis form of prior user right was adopted to permit continued production of generic versions of mailbox-patented products, with payment of reasonable royalty. India is taki ng steps to rapidly expand the cap acity of its patent office and to increase regulatory oversight of pharmaceutical producers. The government seeks to ameliorate the public welfare impact of introducing product patents by extending price controls for a prescribed list of drugs.27 OECD-based Pharma companies have f iled large number of mailbox patent applications in India.28 Several are the subject of pre- grant opposition by access-oriented groups,29 as well as by local generics producers.30 Pharma companies have entered into R&D joint ventures with local Indian companies ( see, e.g., Glaxo-Ranbaxy arrangements).31 The extent to which Pharma co mpanies will make \"greenfield\" investments or seek to acquire locally-o wned producers is as yet unclear. Although purchase of local companies is a potential response to emerging competition, at present most local producers rely on a portfolio of generic products which include versions of drugs patented and/or marketed by different OECD enterprises.32 This makes the value of acquisitions problematic. The Pharma compan ies might attempt a strategy of purchasing and shutting down local production to for eclose competition (as employed in South Africa),33 but the Indian government may not tole rate that course of action. Industry permit parallel importation of patented products; and (7) allowed continued production in India of generic versions of medicines already on the market (if now patented by third parties under the mailbox system), with payment of a reasonable royalty - a form of \"prior user right\" - adapted to India's unique situation.

Setting a Research Agenda , Boston University School of Public Health, April 23, 2003 (draft), 6insiders consider that Indian producers wi ll become a more compelling target of acquisition as they become more competitive in the originator market. C. China China possesses a variety of market advant ages which suggest capacity to challenge OECD dominance in the pharmaceutical sector.34 The government is promoting technology-related education. China has signifi cant existing capacity in pharmaceutical production and is a major global supplier of pharmaceutical chemicals. Chinese cultural tradition evidences strong interest in medicinal treatments.35 There is a large domestic population with increasing income and wealth. Chinese enterprises are increasing their sophistication in export mark eting, including through branding. One factor which currently se parates the pharmaceutical sect ors in China and India is transparency. Indian government regulation in th e sector is relatively transparent, and the major locally-based producers are publicly tr aded companies. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Ther e is less public information available about the regulatory structure and th e industry in China, and forei gn industry participants raise concerns about the difficulties of navigating the Chinese regu latory agencies and dealing with producers.36 As China-based pharmaceutical producers seek to penetrate the originator market in the OECD, efforts will be needed to strengthen and make more transparent the internal regulatory structure to enhance the reliability of safety and efficacy data. There is a widely shared presum ption that Chinese enterprises will emerge as formidable competitors in the global pharmaceutical market, including the originator market. The principal question is one of timing. D.

IMS Health, supra note 12: \"China continues to out-perform 'While growth in Japan rebounded, the bright spot in Asia Pacific continues to be China', said Ray Hill, General Manager, IMS Global Consulting. 'The combination of a healthy economy and increasing diagnosis and treatment rates make China extremely attractive to multinational pharmaceutical companies. Many of them are expanding their presence in China now because they recognize the significant long-term business opportunities that market presents.' Pharmaceutical sales in China grew 20.4% to $11.7 billion in 2005, representing the third consecutive year that it has achieved 20%+ growth. IMS estimates that China will be the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical market by 2009.\" 35 The University of Hong Kong is presently engaged in a major research project to identify the active pharmaceutical ingredients of Ch inese traditional medicines. 36 Author's interviews with various industry experts. 7China and India (along with Japan) are not alone in Asian pharmaceutical production capacity. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippine s and Thailand and each house significant generic production capacity.37 South Korea is a leading pr oducer of bulk chemicals, and is investing substantia lly in biotechnology-related R&D and production.38 Singapore is investing heavily in biotechnology research, including through the establishment of the Biopolis research complex.39 Bangladesh has emerged as a significant pharmaceutical production center,40 taking advantage of its status as a least developed country (which allows its producers unique flexibility to bypass potential patent and data protection restrictions otherwise applicab le under the TRIPS Agreement). However, China and India are the leading Asian emerging market producers of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (which are the high-value components of production), and their pharmaceutical industries most fre quently identified as emerging competitors for a significant share of the global originator and generics markets. Outside Asia, a number of developing count ries maintain significant pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, although at different stages of the supply chain. Israel (though perhaps better characterized as a developed country), Argentina, Brazil, Egypt and Russia are notable. E. Market Concentration The global \"originator\" pharmaceutical mark et is significantly concentrated. In 2005, the top 200 revenue-generating medicines worldwide accounted for sales of $278 billion, and approximately $245 billion of those sales involved 174 drugs offered by 20 companies. 41 Data compiled by the OECD in 2000 s howed a substantial concentration of global pharmaceutical sales among about 20 OECD-based companies. The OECD report observed, \"There has been a significant wave of mergers in the pharmaceutical industry in the last few years.\" 42 The trend toward concentration has continued, with the top five pharmaceutical companies in 2003 holding 32.4% of total global market revenue share.43 37 See, e.g., Pacific Bridge Medical, Asia's Emerging Pharmaceutical Markets: A Look at China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia , June 13, 1997. 38 See, e.g., Sandra Fox, Outsourcing Bio-Production to Asia , ContractPharma.com, May 2006. 39 See reports regarding research conducted at the Singapore Biopolis presented at Medecins Sans Frontieres, Neglected Diseases Group Meeting, Penang, Malaysia, Feb. 6-7, 2004, Dr. Alex Matter, Director, Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, Singapore, Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases , and; Dr. Ee Chee Ren, Deputy Director, Genome Institute of Singapore and Principal Investigator, SARS Research Kit, Harnessing Research Capacity for Public Health: A Diagnostic Test for SARS\u2014What lessons for neglected diseases?

Vivas-Eugui, 2006) (Earthscan), pp. 65-78, at 69. 8These figures may understate the level of c oncentration in the global market because a small number of firms tend to domin ate specific ther apeutic classes.44 The originator Pharma industry refreshes its new product pipeline by acquiring rights to promising innovations from smaller scale R& D-based enterprises and/or by acquiring those smaller scale enterprises. It is rare for a new entrant in the pharmaceutical sector to break into the ranks of the ma jor originator-market actors, though it is not unheard of. In the past decade, two biotechnology-oriented new entrants, Amgen and Genentech, each achieved significant global market revenue share,45 although Genentech has been acquired by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, Roche. IV. The TRIPS II Commitments A. The Agreements The TRIPS II agenda is principally mani fest in bilateral and regional trade agreements negotiated by the United States, in force or signed with Jordan, Singapore, Chile, Australia, Morocco, Central America - DR, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, and Colombia, and under negotiation with Thailand, Southe rn Africa Customs Union (SACU), South Korea and others.46 The proposed Free Trade Agreem ent of the Americas, negotiations on which are presently stalled, includes IP commitments.47 The TRIPS II agenda is also carried out in WTO accession negotiations which are charac terized by bilateral demands for concessions, and which in recent year s have witnessed in creasing demands for pharmaceutical related protections.48 Negotiations ongoing between the United States and Russia are awaiting movement on IP issues.49 44 OECD, supra note 11, at 32-33; Rosenberg, id., at 68-71. 45 See Med Ad News, supra note 53, at 32, with $11.8 billion (f rom 5 drugs) and $3.7 billion (from 3 drugs), respectively. 46 Texts available at http://www.ustr.gov. 47 Texts available at http://www.oas.org (http://www.ftaa- alca.org/NGroups/WGroups_e.asp#IntellectualPropertyRights). 48 See, e.g., WTO, Working Party on the Accession of Cambodia, Report of the Working Party on the Accession of Cambodia, WT/ACC/KHM/21, 15 Aug. 2003, at para. 205: \"[The representative of Cambodia] ... further co nfirmed that during the transition period, that Cambodia would protect against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test or other data submitted in support of applications for marketing approval of pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical products which utilize new chemical entities, by providing that no person other than the person who submitted such data may, without the permission of the latter person, rely on such data in support of an application for product approval for a period of at least five years from the date on which Cambodia granted marketing approval to the person that produced the data. Prior to the issuance of marketing approval of any pharmaceutical and agricult ural chemical products, the relevant Ministries in Cambodia will determine the exis tence of a patent covering a product for which an application for marketing approval had been filed by a party other than the patentee, and will not approve such application for marketing approval until the date of the expiration of such patent. He added that Cambodia would seek out all available technical assistance to ensure that its capacity to fully enforce its TRIPS-consistent legal regime upon expiration of the transition pe riods is assured and that Cambodia would 9 Pharmaceutical-related commitments in bilate ral and regional agreements extend well beyond TRIPS I requirements.50 Patents must be granted for new uses of known substances (including second medical indicat ion patents), the sc ope of biotechnology patenting is extended (e.g., by requiring plant and animal vari ety patenting), patents must be extended to compensate for delays based on regulatory review, and the TRIPS I patent regulatory review exception is reformulated in a more restri ctive way. For some countries (i.e., Jordan, Singapore and Australia), the grounds for issuing compulsory licenses are restricted. Parallel importati on of patented products is bloc ked. In a section of the IPRs chapter labeled \"Certain Regulated Products\", marketing exclusivity and data protection is extended for a five-year period based not only on submission of regulatory data in the country where registration is undertake n, but extended to foreign submission of regulatory data, or reliance on foreign marketing approval. Covered products are expanded beyond \"new chemical entities\" to products not previously approved. Three-year extensions of marketing exclusivity are available for ne w clinical studies (including those undertaken abroad). Patents are linke d to the health department medicines registration process, precluding approval of market entry eff ective prior to expiration of the patent term. In the US-Australia FTA, the US secured entry into Australia's pharmaceutical price control system, 51 and the US seeking similar entry into the South Korean price control system. The international intellectual property system prior to the TRIPS II regime relied on private patent holders to enforce rights th rough civil litigation. While an imperfect system, patent holders were required to ove rcome challenges to the validity of their patents. A significant portion of litigated patents are, in OECD jurisdictions, determined to be invalid. 52 The objective of the TRIPS II exercise is to provide grants of marketing exclusivity without the necessi ty of validating the patent, and or even maintaining a patent. This is accomplished through data protection rules and patent-regulatory review linkage. The combined effect is to shift the burden of enforcement from the private patent holder to government authorities. Beca use of the complexity of the rule systems, developing country governments are likely to rely on Pharma industry representations concerning the validity of claims.53 Developing country government authorities are susceptible to inter-governmental pressure, further reinforcing the effect of market exclusivity rules. make available all legislation in draft and promulgated form to WTO Members so that advice on TRIPS-consistency can be obtained.\" 49 See, e.g., Trade Committees to Oppose PNTR for Russia Without IPR, SPS Fixes, I NSIDE US TRADE , May 12, 2006. 50 See references in note 1, supra. 51 Ely Lilly has initiated the first challenge to a determ ination made under Australia's PBS.

The World Health Organization, the World Bank a nd other multilateral organizations caution against acceptance of the obligations.56 Access-oriented NGOs protest against acceptance,57 and public protests accompany approval of the agreements. The United States pays a heavy politic al cost for the pharmaceutical-related obligations incorporated in the FTAs. Ma ny developing and emerging market country governments consider themselves treated as subjects of an imperial power. B. U.S. Policy Objectives The policy objective of the United States in the pharmaceutical sector is apparently to increase US technology rents by foreclosing competition from emerging market pharmaceutical producers in the countries accep ting obligations. This is accomplished by extending the range of products subject to patenting, extending patent duration and preventing local registration of generic versi ons of drugs previously registered in the United States or other OECD countries. B ecause of the TRIPS I most favored nation (MFN) treatment requirement, the \"benefits\" of the obligations must be extended to all WTO Members. 58 This puts European and Japanese pharmaceutical patent holders and originators on the same footing as those from the US. In this sense, Europe and Japan are free riding on the political costs expended by the United States. C. Outcomes Predicting the economic and social impact of reinforcing the protection afforded to market-dominant OECD-based Pharma is an inherently uncertain exercise because of the complexity of the relevant industry, the role that government regulation will play and the fact that new technologies may affect ma rkets in ways that cannot be foreseen. In the absence of other factors, it might reasonably be assumed that the effect of strengthening the control of the market-dominant OECD-based companies with respect to new high-value products would be to reinfo rce their global market -dominating position with respect to newer drugs. Moreover, b ecause global market revenues from sales of newer drugs far exceed revenues from lower-priced generics, dominance in the originator 54 The author of this paper has advised a number of governments involved in these negotiations, and has discussed these negotiations with numerous representatives of governments that were directly involved in the negotiations. He has also advised generic indu stry associations affect ed by the agreements. 55 See Peter Drahos, Thomas Faunce, Martyn Goddard and David Henry, The FTA and the PBS, A submission to the Senate Select Committee (Austr alia) on the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement , May Miguel Ernesto Gamba, Alvaro sobre el Acceso a Medicamentos en Colombia, P AHO and IFARMA, Bogota, Nov. 2004. 56 See WHO Commission Report, supra note 6, at paras. 420-21. 57 See, e.g., MSF Briefing Note, Access to Medicines at Risk Across th e Globe: What to Watch Out for in Free Trade Agreements with the United States , May 2004, available at http://www.accessm ed-msf.org. 58 See discussion in Abbott, Toward a New Era , supra note [], at 97-98.. 11sector is likely to reinforce OECD strength in the generics markets as financial fuel is provided for advertising and promotion, as we ll as for control over distribution channels. In commenting on the draft of this paper pr esented at the June 2006 Stanford meeting, Professor John Barton observed that ther e are various submarkets of the global pharmaceutical market, and that the dynamic im pact of rule changes may depend on the relevant market segment. Whether there is a situation of mo nopoly, oligopoly or competition in a submarket depends, among othe r things, on the distribution of patents and, inter alia, on the size of the relevant market. Professor Barton noted that the United States and Europe continue to be the most important consum er markets, in significant part because of high prices avai lable (at least in the US mark et). He suggested that it is still possible for new firms to enter, at least at the submarket level. He referred, by way of illustration, to Amgen and Genentech, and observe d that in the future Chinese or Indian firms may enter the ranks of the ma jor global originator companies. The author expressed and shares the view that Chinese and Indian pharmaceutical enterprises are emerging as potential competitors in the global originator market. Nonetheless, the barriers to market entry are high, and the TRIPS II agenda seeks to reinforce these barriers. The major global Ph arma companies are very highly capitalized and aggressively pursue downstream distributi on controls. Potential new market entries are routinely acquired before they become threat s to market share. It is in recognition of these barriers to entry, that the author has proposed in the following section that Asian governments take steps to protect the independence of locally-b ased enterprises. While reasonable minds may differ regardi ng the relative strength of barriers to entry in the global originator pharmaceutical market, the question remains whether the TRIPS II drive to reinforce the market position of OECD-based Pharma companies is a wise choice from the standpoint of global public he alth policy. The TRIPS II agenda appears to be premised on the assumption that the Pharma-dominated pharmaceutical supply system in the OECD and developing countri es is properly functioning to supply the public with innovative safe and effective me dicines at reasonable cost. An objective analysis of the present pharmaceutical s upply system is unlikely to reach that conclusion. 59 The present Pharma-dominated supply system invests approximately 15% of revenues in R&D. A significan t portion of that amount is i nvested in \"lifestyle\" drugs which generate modest improvements in publ ic health. The R&D is heavily weighted toward incremental innovation - argued by knowledgeable observers as intended to maintain exclusive position in therapeutic areas rather than reflecting patient benefit. A large portion of Pharma expe nditure is devoted to physic ian and direct-to-consumer marketing. Pharma admittedly under-invests in therapies for diseases predominantly afflicting poor populations. Is it wise global public health policy to impose this system worldwide? 59 See Abbott, World Pharmaceutical Trade , supra note 1, at 324-25 and references therein, and WTO TRIPS Agreement and Its Implications for A ccess to Medicines in Developing Countries , Study Paper 2a, UK Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Feb. 2004. 12The customary answer is that the current Pharma-dominated system is the best among less than ideal alternatives. There is a gl obal competition for accumulation of capital and the Pharma companies succeed in accumu lating capital through the behaviors characterized above. While the extent and dir ection of Pharma research may be less than ideal, at least there is a significant amount of capital is directed to R&D. A system which does not strongly protect against technology di ffusion will result in underinvestment in research and development. In this author's view, the argument in favor of reinforcing a concentrated and poorly functioning innovation and supply system made ou t above is not persuasive. First, the reinforcement of a system which results in market-exclusionary pric ing must take into account the consumer welfare loss that it imposes. There is ample evidence that Pharma pricing of medicines results in substantial hardship for poorer segments of the global population. Second, a system designed to ri gorously defend against technology leakage assumes that such leakage is harmful to public welfare. It assumes that the world community would be less well off with a larger number of potentially smaller enterprises conducting research. Is there a demonstrable ad vantage to placing in the hands of a small number of enterprises the power to make decisions about which roads of scientific inquiry will be pursued and whic h drug candidates will be subject to clinical evaluation? There is no way to objectively determine differences in research output based on alternative models. Yet, is it not possible, or even pr obable, that wider technology diffusion will result in a greater level of gl obal innovation even assuming some decline in the concentration of capital expenditure? The TRIPS II agenda is largely directed to foreclosing the emergence of competition from Asian emerging market pharmaceutical enterp rises. It is part of a mercantile battle for control of the global pharmaceutical mark et. While the emergence of competition may be inevitable, from a financial standpoint there is a material difference whether this emergence takes place over a 5, 10 or 20-year period. The policy question is whether it is preferable from a public welfare standpoint to encourage or discour age the emergence of Asian competition? There is, moreover, a longer-term issue. We can assume that some Indian or Chinese pharmaceutical enterprise will eventually emerge as successful originators even in the face of market-exclusionary rules. We can further assume that Indian and Chinese business executives will behave as their OECD counterparts. That is, once a few Indian and/or Chinese enterprises enter the ranks of the 20 major Pharma companies they will likewise take advantage of rules designed to foreclose the emergence of competitors. Will it make a difference from a global public we lfare standpoint if three or five of the top 20 are from Asian emerging market countries? Or, does the prob lem with the current system lie with the fact of the concentration itself? V. Asia's Response What should the response of Asian devel oping and emerging economy countries be to the demands for highly restrictive pharmaceutic al supply market regulation? Should the capacity to establish domestic manufacturing, di stribution and exports, and to regulate the consumer market, be exchanged for concessi ons offered by the United States in \"free 13trade area\" negotiations? S hould Asian developing countries entering the WTO concede regulatory flexibility in the pharmaceutical sector? All trade negotiations are ba sed on reciprocal concessions . South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and other Asian economies n eed to weigh the potential economic gains from US market access concessions against ec onomic losses from their own concessions. In the pharmaceutical sector, there are purely me rcantile considerations, that is, will the losses from OECD dominance of the pha rmaceutical supply market be offset by economic gains from exports in the automobile sector, the electroni cs sector and other relevant sectors? Analysis in the pharmaceu tical sector fundamentally requires that public health consideration also be taken in to account. Consumer demand for treatment cannot be shifted without significant public we lfare cost. If the pr ice of pharmaceutical supplies increases - and the United States is explicitly bargaining for this with South Korea - the government in principle my shif t budget allocations to the public health sector to protect the interests of marginal consumers. If th is is not done, then mercantile gains to Asian industry will have been accomp lished at the direct expense of the less affluent parts of society. If Asian governments strengthen the position of OECD originators in their markets, they should be prepared to adopt a more a ggressive regulatory pos ture, including scrutiny of anticompetitive marketing arrangements, review of applicati ons for patents and marketing exclusivity, challenging patent-re gulatory review linkages, maintaining vigilance over pricing, and so forth. A second prong of response should be to increase public funding of research with an explicit view toward strengthening local capac ity. The US National Institutes of Health out-license innovation arising from NIH grants to US enterprises. If Asian developing and emerging market countries ultimately intend to compete in the originator market, they will need government support for R&D to be on the same playing field as the OECD originators. Asian governments will need to be vigi lant about protecting successful local companies from being acquired by OECD enterp rises and incorporated into the existing oligopolist supply framework. This may involve review of investment proposals in the pharmaceutical sector for their impact on na tional objectives, or placing limits on the extent of foreign penetration in the phar maceutical sector. While the idea of limiting foreign direct investment may be contrary to prevailing views concer ning advantages of open capital flows, this must be viewed in the context of maintaining competitive local and global markets in a heavily subsidized and regulated sector. A pharmaceutical market \"open\" to foreign capital investment is, in fact, subject to the consequences of heavy foreign subsidization. It is not a \"level playing field\". Specific measures designed to encourage the market entry of generic products should be considered. For example, under the US Hatch-Waxman Act system, a 180-day period of market exclusivity is given to the firs t generic producer that successfully obtains approval to enter the market. Regulatory a pproval systems which encourage generic producers to undertake early market entry may provide the impetus necessary for formulating bioequivalent pr oducts and developing manufac turing processes, without engendering substantial long- term public welfare costs. 14Asian governments should be prepared to make use of the flexibi lities remaining to them under the TRIPS II regime, which includ es exporting under compulsory license to address public health needs. VI. Striking the Right Balance The question raised by this paper is one of striking the proper balance. At the instigation of the Pharma companies the United States is engaged in a campaign to put in place rules which substantially increase barriers to entry in the pharmaceutical supply sector in developing and emergi ng market countries. The rules are designed to increase the flow of rent to OECD-based enterprises, with a consequence of raising prices to developing and emerging market consumers. It is in the self-interest of emerging Asian economies to approach these new rules w ith caution. Asian developing and emerging market countries have self-interests in developing strong domestic pharmaceutical industry capacity. Asian medicines consumers ha ve an interest in affordable access. A cautious approach by Asian governments may yield global public welfare benefits. 15 "}
