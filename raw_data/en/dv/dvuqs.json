There is a saying in traditional Chinese medicine \"Qi follows Yi\" (Energy follows intention). Once we clear the mind and create space within to listen and engage, the energy shifts and a way to healing and well-being opens. Cultivating practices of meditation and mindfulness help deepen your relationship to yourself and find balance and harmony. This is where the magic happens. Sometimes we need to nourish and connect, rejuvenate and rest, sometimes we need to move and release, let go and make space within. Seaside Family Acupuncture incorporates meditation into acupuncture and shiatsu treatments and offers a variety of programs to help you learn to create the space you need in any moment. We also offer a 6 week meditation program: [Calm Mind, Clear Heart ](https://www.seasidefamilyacupuncture.com/calm-mind-clear-heart)to develop a meditation practice even if you are busy and overwhelmed. Throughout the year Zoe leads a few 5-day FREE meditation retreats as well, don't miss the next [Path to Presence](https://www.seasidefamilyacupuncture.com/path-to-presence). For ongoing support in developing, integrating and deepening a consistent meditation practice please join the [Seaside Meditation Circle](https://www.seasidefamilyacupuncture.com/meditation-circle). The circle is all virtual and meets weekly for a live call including some meditation and time for discussion. When you join this monthly membership you'll also get instant access to a library of practices. Check out the entirely virtual and self-paced short meditation program to reduce stress and anxiety [Inner Anchor](https://www.seasidefamilyacupuncture.com/inner-anchor).
