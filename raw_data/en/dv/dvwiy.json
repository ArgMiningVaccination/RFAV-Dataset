For many jobs, homemade cleaners can be just as effective as cleaners that you find in the store. However, depending on how dirty the surface is that you are cleaning, sometimes you may have to scrub a bit more or do a second application. And just like commercial cleaners, not every homemade cleaner is suitable for every surface or purpose, even those labeled \"all-purpose\" cleaners. It's always best to try any cleaner \u2014 homemade or not \u2014 on a hidden spot to see if it's safe for your surface, especially if you are using it for the first time. And make sure you label any bottle or container of homemade cleaner with what it is and the ingredients it contains. If you find that your homemade cleaner is not doing a good job cleaning, it may be time to switch to a commercial cleaner. Always keep all cleaners away from children and pets.
