The virus can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, achy joints, cold chills, and nausea. More severe symptoms may affect the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. To boost your immune system, consider incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet and taking supplements. Chiropractic adjustments can also help by removing nerve stress. Some recommended supplements include Goldenseal and Echinacea, which have immune-building and virus-fighting properties, as well as vitamins A, C, and E. However, it's important to note that the flu shot may not be as effective as it's often portrayed. What the public generally refers to as \"the flu\" is actually an influenza-like syndrome, characterized by symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle or joint pains, headache, runny nose, and general malaise. This disease is not the same as true influenza and cannot be prevented by an influenza vaccination. The vaccine's lack of efficacy is demonstrated in a Dutch study involving a home for elderly people. Despite two-thirds of the population being vaccinated, a severe flu outbreak affected 49% of the residents, resulting in bacterial infections, pneumonia, and a high mortality rate of 10%. Interestingly, 50% of the vaccinated population contracted the disease, compared to 48% of the non-vaccinated group. Safety concerns surrounding influenza vaccines have existed for decades. A 1973 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that nearly all US-made influenza vaccines between 1966 and 1970 were toxic. Some studies have also shown that the vaccine can cause nerve damage. For more information, please contact us. "}
