Located on a breathtaking campus in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, Kripalu offers more than 700 programs a year that deliver life-changing, immersive experiences to nearly 40,000 guests. The campus is also home to the renowned Kripalu Schools of Y oga and Ayurveda, offering certification programs to yoga teachers and Ayurvedic practitioners. The largest yoga-based retreat center in North America, Kripalu is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational organization.OUR MISSION IS TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES TO REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATIVE WISDOM AND PRACTICE OF YOGA.800.741.7353 or kripalu.org | 3 Dear friends, Over the years, many of our guests and students have asked us to consider additional programs that focus on quiet reflection and deep inner listening. There appears to be a growing hunger for activities and experiences that break the cycle of \"doing\" by providing the space and time to simply \"be.\" So the Kripalu staff is thrilled to offer Contemplative Week, December 20-25. During this time, the retreat center settles into the winter season with silent meals and introspective programming to support your personal journey inward. This is an opportunity to truly disconnect from your busy lives and reconnect to your truest selves at a time when the sweetness of retreat tends to infuse the whole campus. For those looking for a more social experience, the community shifts into a different vibration the following week as we celebrate the new year as a collection of kindred spirits, expressing our life and joy through yoga, dancing, singing, and meditation. There are quiet moments and ecstatic moments, moments to reflect on the year completing, and moments to set intentions for what's ahead. Infused throughout is the quintessential Kripalu experience: an invitation to explore your inner world and your outer world and the magnificent interplay between the two, in a safe and sacred place of transformation. Whatever your style and whatever your intention, Kripalu has something for you this winter. I encourage you to find the program that speaks to your heart and then allow yourself the permission to come \"do\" it and come \"be\" it. Through the magical blend of being and doing, we take the tools of yoga into our daily lives and carry Kripalu with us wherever we go.

Mandalas hold special significance within Kripalu culture because they are designed to lead us closer to the center of our being, to the unwavering truth of who we really are. The eight layers of our primary mandala signify the eight-limbed path of yoga. Within those layers are representations of the Ayurvedic elements of earth, fire, air, ether, and water. Mandalas can help us achieve union, which is the aim of yoga.

He is medical director of the T rauma Center in Boston and author of The Body Keeps the Score, which looks at how trauma affects the brain and body. Q How does yoga practice impact people who have experienced trauma? A When people think about trauma, they generally think of it as a historical event that happened some time ago. T rauma is actually the residue from the past as it settles into your body. It's located inside your own skin. When people are traumatized, they become afraid of their physical sensations; their breathing becomes shallow, and they become frightened about what they're feeling. When you slow down your breathing with yoga, you can increase your heart rate variability, and that decreases stress. Y oga opens you up to feeling every aspect of your body's sensations. It's a gentle, safe way for people to befriend their bodies, where the trauma of the past is stored. Q How important is talk therapy in treating trauma? A While being able to articulate what happened to you is an important part of treatment, the most important part is starting to regain ownership of your body and be comfortable in your own skin. T rauma is really a somatic issue. It's in your body and, because of that, yoga has great relevance, because it goes directly to sensing and befriending the body. Q What does the evidence show as far as yoga's efficacy? A Our studies show that yoga has at least as beneficial effects in alleviating traumatic stress symptoms as the best possible medications. In the studies we did involving neuroimaging of the brain before and after regular yoga practice, we were able to show that the areas of the brain involving self-awareness get activated by doing yoga, and those are the areas that get locked out by trauma and that are needed in order to heal it.

When I lost 55 pounds a few years ago, I was angry that I didn't like myself any better. I felt duped and annoyed that, after a grueling nine months of refining what I considered broken, happiness wasn't waiting for me. Instead, I experienced quite the opposite: anxiety, fear, uncertainty, and a growing awareness that maybe this whole \"love myself\" thing was deeper than trying to change how I looked. We are taught that the body is separate from the self and, with the right set of dire ctions paired with iron will, we should be able to carve out a form worthy of approval and praise. This approach left me feeling disjointed and broken, unable to tap into the beauty of my body, of its interconnectedness to my breath, mind, and, most importantly, worth. Rather than live separate from my body, I chose to flip the script and cultivate holistic self-love, no matter my size. In the throes of discovering that weight loss wasn't a prerequisite to my health and happiness, the practice of yoga entered my life. Being the largest woman in class took getting used to. For years, I practiced in the back of class. Instinctively, I began to close my eyes during class, filtering out the bodies of those around me, connecting to the experience within. I felt every motion of my body as it linked with breath, reaching inward toward the core of me\u2014 a peaceful center that was accepting and loving. I soon created More to Love, a social enterprise committed to helping educate and inspire larger women to apply body acceptance into their daily lives. I wove the lessons of yoga into my work, inspiring others with larger bodies to consider reconnecting with themselves through personal growth. As my yoga practice expanded, so did my capacity to teach others the art of self-love through their relationship to the body. This inspired my desire to become a yoga teacher and, with the support of a Kripalu scholarship, I enrolled in Kripalu Yoga Teacher Training this past summer. On the first night, we were asked to create an intention to guide us through our month together. Mine was the same intention that I've held for a few years now: to love and experience my body. During training, I felt viscerally in my body my own strength, grace, and deep connection to life and to spirit. The depth of yoga seems to evaporate years of shame and conditioning around body image. For those who have considered weight to be the great mountain to overcome, yoga offers a compassionate pathway through the mountain, a guide to discover what treasures lie within.

You might also be interested in... Y oga, the Brain, and Mental Health p. 53 We are living in inspired times. While the job market and economy are always changing, there is still a path of deep security. It's your calling. Y ou were born to excel in the work you love. It doesn't mat-ter if you don't know how to find your call-ing or live it. Y ou brain might never know. But your instincts know nothing else. Having walked through my own extraor - dinary career transition from Harvard-trained corporate attorney to author and career catalyst, I've coached thousands to create the work they love, whether that means daring to uncover a new identity or rediscovering their passion in current circumstances. Y our joy is your crystal-clear direction, not your detour. I urge you to commit to expressing your real gifts in your lifetime. Ditch the impris-oning mentality that your work has to be validated or franchised or net a certain amount of money to be worth it. T ruly, you can't even imagine the opportunities and the serotonin boosts of clarity that will come with pursuing what you love. Often our joy takes us by surprise and expands our definition of who we think we are and what we think is possible. At one point in my career, after I'd left my law firm and started writing, I gave a talk on finding your right work, and it felt like slip-ping into my skin at last. \"I will do this,\" I heard myself say in the inner sanctum of my being. \"I will say yes.\" I knew I was saying yes to leading, serving, honoring this small voice within me, wherever it led. It made no sense to my \"practical\" self. I imagined (and I was wrong, by the way!) that there was no money to be had by following this sweetness, no fame or rec-ognition. But, whatever it meant, I knew I wanted aliveness more than I wanted a guarantee. The questions spread through my cells: Will you trust this goodness? Will you follow your guidance and ignore the fears and instructions of the world? I said yes then, and I still do. There are so many gifts that come from doing what you love, from following some-thing infinite, invincible, and alive within you. My students always want to hear the part where I became a best-selling author and did a TEDx talk. But I want to tell them about the increased energy, flow, and unflappable peace of mind. I want to tell them about the ridiculous synchronici-ties and opportunities that come along, the feeling of connectedness and the extra cherries in the cherry bowl. I want to reassure them that they'll shine like never before\u2014and everyone wants to hire someone who glows. Mostly, I want to tell them about the love, the love that makes the axis of the earth tilt in your direction, that makes all things possible. I'm not saying you have to quit your job or move to New Y ork City to dance on Broadway. Start small, because\u2014believe me\u2014there are no small steps. Every step you take to honor your dreams is huge. T ake 10 minutes and sing, write, meditate, or brainstorm about your vision or ideal business. Start the inquiry this very second. Honor your gifts and you will honor your lifetime. T ama Kieves is a sought-after speaker, visionary career coach, and best-selling author of This Time I Dance!

Because we tend to be attracted to people who are in many ways different from ourselves, relationships provide ever-present opportunities to practice stretching\u2014opening ourselves up to and accepting feelings, behaviors, tastes, preferences, and values that may be quite unlike those which are familiar and comfortable. T rue connection requires stretching to the point of distress. The challenge is not to avoid the discomfort, but to stay with it to better understand ourselves as well as our partner. As in yoga, we must hold the stretch to become more adept in staying with the discomfort, but we need to know ourselves well enough to recognize when to ease up so as not to risk injury. Overstretching can be harmful, but if we ease up too soon, we'll never grow stronger. By finding this exquisite bal-ance point, we get the most out of our yoga and our marriage. As our yoga practice grows, we develop the capacity to toler - ate increasing levels of discomfort while remaining still in difficult postures. This stretching allows us to develop tone. It's the same in marriage. We gradually become more acclimated to posi-tions that we had previously found to be highly uncomfortable. This is not a matter of accepting an intolerable situation, such as abuse or disrespect, but rather of increasing our levels of personal strength, openness, flexibility, and acceptance. We stay present with our own feelings of sadness, anger, or fear. When we wel-come and gently embrace these feelings, we can stay connected to our partner with an open, caring heart. We can even move into positions we never imagined we could tolerate, and are pleasantly surprised to discover that we find balance there. Hatha means \"force\"; yoga means \"union.\" The force results from the joining of \"ha,\" which means sun, and \"tha,\" which means moon. In many spiritual traditions, the sun is associated with the masculine, the moon with the feminine. The practice of joining the masculine and feminine in a balanced way results in a powerful force. When we practice the yoga postures, the inner masculine and feminine come into balance, resulting in a supple, graceful body. When we use our marriage as a practice, the inner masculine and feminine come into balance as well. Instead of resisting the masculine, active, initiatory, competitive, penetrating, assertive principles, we learn to honor these energies; instead of denigrating the feminine, receptive, passive, sensitive, yielding, patient prin-ciples, we come to respect and appreciate them. If the sun and the Marriage Is Like Y ogaAs longtime yoga practitioners, we've discovered that the principles of yoga can be applied to marriage. Just as the regular practice of yoga leads to a strong, healthy body, the regular practice of relationship yoga leads to a strong, beautiful marriage. moon within each individual can coexist in harmony, then the energies of two individuals can blend to manifest as a graceful, supple partnership. In yoga, regular practice leads to greater proficiency, and long-term daily practice allows us to excel at the art. So it is with relationship yoga; the consistent practice of handling differences with generosity and goodwill serves to strengthen both the individuals as well as the relationship itself. One of the goals of yoga practice is to be-come physically healthy by stimulating all the body's systems\u2014respira-tory, circulatory, muscu-lar, skeletal, digestive, eliminatory, and reproductive. We practice to enhance our energy, to remain youthful and vital into old age, and to live a long, productive life. These same benefits are available to those who adopt relationship yoga as their practice. As recent scientific evidence shows, those in good marriages suffer fewer diseases and live longer. Through contemplation, devotion, and action, yoga practitioners experience both ecstatic states as well as peace of mind; by being considerate and active in their devotion, marital partners, too, can experience ecstatic states as well as a profound inner peace. by Linda and Charlie Bloom Linda and Charlie Bloom are seminar leaders, authors, psychotherapists, consultants, and experts in the field of human relationships.

It's the topic of a gazillion love songs and dozens of metaphors. Its tempered visage appears on t-shirts, logos, books, and emojis. Our culture talks a lot about the heart\u2014how it hurts or feels so good, how it's broken or healed, how it's beating out of our chest or stuck in our throat. If you go to yoga class, you've probably been told to follow it, listen to it, soften it, protect it, share it, and trust it. That's a whole lot of attention and pressure for an organ that's already busy beating 100,000 times a day. I know my own heart works hard physically to be in this world. It's also constantly metabolizing the raw emotions of being human. It's felt, at times, deeply broken, over - whelmingly full, and serenely peaceful. It's felt as wide as the world and as hard and small as a pebble. Some spiritual traditions teach that the emotional and physical heart is the center of our being. Most teachers of personal growth say that an open heart is the key to a happy, fulfilled life. They also say that ac- cessing the heart is essential to being a compassionate, empathic human. But what does it mean, really, to have an open heart? And how do we know whether we have one or not? For some, it's helpful to start by learning what a closed heart sounds like. In the program Opening the Heart, cotaught by Donna Macomber, an instructor places a clock inside a Tibetan singing bowl and then attempts to play the bowl. What would typically be a sweet, searing sound comes out as a dull whine. He explains that the bowl is the heart and the clock is the gunk\u2014fear, anger, etc.\u2014that can build up in us. The analogy \"demonstrates the quality of the sound of our own instrument when we are blocked with things that are painful,\" says Donna. \"It makes such a different sound when we empty that stuff out.\" If you notice yourself feeling irritable, anxious, or teary, and then pushing past those feelings, take note\u2014your heart is probably not singing its true song. \"It might be time to take a breath and see what's there,\" Donna suggests. The thing about the heart, though, is that you can't just open it and then dance with fairies and unicorns forever. At some point, life tosses at us big feelings, losses, or traumas. Then what? It's a process\u2014one that requires a shift in perspective and regular inner maintenance. \"Our life experiences hurt us most when we don't let them move freely,\" Donna says. \"If we seize up and stop breathing and try and keep things the BRAVE HEART same, that is so painful. But when we let the pain move through our bodies, it's like a thunderstorm\u2014dramatic, loud, alive, electric. And, after that, the air has cleared.\" How do we keep our hearts clear and open in our daily lives? For T oni Bergins, founder of JourneyDance, the answer is, of course, dance and music. For others, she says, it might be yoga, hiking, biking, or meditation. \"Opening the heart is such a 'what does it do for you' practice,\" she says. It's also about building the resilience of the emotional heart. When she teaches, T oni walks people through joy, sadness, an-ger, and grief so that they can \"stretch their bandwidth and come back to center,\" she says. Once that expansion occurs, when we encounter someone who's suffering, \"we can hold that person and be connected instead of running away from pain,\" T oni says. Those who are skeptical about walking around with a wide-open heart in a world with many sharp edges might wonder if it's possible to have a heart that's too open. \"That's bleeding-heart syndrome\u2014where everything is overwhelming and too much and you cry at every single news report (which I do),\" T oni says. \"The healthy, open heart is able to feel, to receive, and to give.\" One way to keep your heart healthy is to maintain clear boundaries that allow you to have a wide-open heart and yet not get depleted. T oni recommends practicing \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"little potent phrases\" like \"I'm not sure\" or \"I'll think about it and let you know.\" They allow us to pause, go at our own pace, and protect our heart as much as we need to. Creating a healthy relationship with our emotional heart can lead us to a richer, more meaningful life. \"The heart is at the center of our being,\" says Rabbi Sigal Brier, who teaches Empower Y our Heart's Purpose: A Sankalpa Retreat at Kripalu. \"T o have an open heart is to know the depths of my being, and know that it's connected to everything.\" The Sanskrit word sankalpa means \"deepest heart's desire and purpose.\" Sigal says we need to \"sit and listen and hear this life's purpose and, from that, create a life that flows.\" It's not a big planning session, but more like a rush of knowing and connection. That level of connection happens only when we approach the heart with kindness and give it the quiet and time to respond, Sigal explains. One method she teaches is to place your hands over your heart and gently and directly ask it to reveal itself. When that sense of safety is created, that's when the magic happens\u2014purpose flows, a sense of presence enters, and calm descends. \" An open heart feels like a trusting, a curiosity, a welcoming,\" Sigal says. \"There's a sense of equanimity and ease, and an underlying joy that is the simple sense of being.\" That's the moment when we know we've come home to our heart.

Find out about programs with Donna Macomber (p. 65), T oni Bergins (p. 75), and Rabbi Sigal Brier (p. 84).Five Practices for Opening the Heart Ask gently. T ry Rabbi Sigal Brier's hands- over-heart practice. Get comfortable and quiet, sit, breathe, and place your hands over the center of your chest. \"I imagine I'm speaking to a very young child,\" she says. \"I am mothering the child's heart to be free to speak, to be authentic and to trust. It's not like, 'Knock, knock! Open up!' It's more like, 'Hey, sweetie, how are you doing? I'm here.'\" Breathe, feel, and gently listen. Practice gratitude. When you wake up, before your feet hit the floor, say to yourself, \"Y ay, I have another day,\" Sigal recom-mends. \"Gratitude goes right to the heart and helps it relax and trust,\" she says. Naming our blessings regularly can help spur a cycle of joy. Move your body. The heart is both an emotion carrier and an organ\u2014getting it pumping can actually help it to open. \"When people inhabit their bodies in a way that's pleasurable and intentional, that's one of the keys,\" says Donna Macomber. \"T reating our bodies like the sacred instru-ments and vessels they are is one of the ac-cess routes into living with an open heart.\" Listen to music. JourneyDance teacher T oni Bergins finds that for many people, \"music is the fastest way into the heart.\" She suggests putting on an evocative song that \"has a little bit of pull on your heart\"\u2014the kind \"you just love so much that you want to listen to it over and over again.\" Let it do its thing. Dance if you want to. Do yoga. Along with hip openers, most yoga classes include some heart openers. Poses such as Bridge, Wheel, and Camel literally expand the chest, pulling on the area around the heart. Don't worry about perfecting the pose. \"T rying to achieve a posture is very different than trying to achieve an open heart,\" T oni says. by Valerie ReissAccessing the heart is essential to being a compassionate, empathic human.

Share this catalog with a friend. Recycle it when you're done.Presenter IndexOff the Mat Why do you practice and teach yoga? I practice to help keep me strong, centered, and open. One of the more subtle gifts I've received from yoga has been finding my center\u2014a place of unshakeable ground inside me, no matter what life brings. My practice has softened my heart toward the world and myself. I teach yoga to share these gifts with others. What inspires and motivates you? Seeing people discover and then express their talents and gifts. I believe that each of us comes bearing a unique gift that we are meant to share with the world. How has Kripalu resonated with you? For me, it starts with the translation of the word Kripalu, which is \"compassion.\" The aspect of compassion and loving-kindness that is inherent to Kripalu is what drew me in and has kept me here. This path of self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-love has left a lasting vibration within me. How do you like to spend your free time? I love to spend time hiking the many trails near my home. When I'm out in nature, my mind gets clear and calm, and in that clarity comes vision. I get my best and most creative ideas when I'm hiking. Dancing is also an essential part of my life\u2014 alone or with others, planned or spontaneously. I also love to knit! I create personal expressions with color, fiber, and patterns. Knitting is a meditation for me. The repetition of the needles and fiber moving in rhythm, coupled with the focus on the individual stitches and the overall pattern, is like saying a mantra. with Kripalu faculty Michelle Dalbec Find programs with Michelle on pages 22 and 91.Michelle Dalbec is a faculty member for the Kripalu School of Y oga and for Kripalu's R&R Retreat and Healthy Living programs.
