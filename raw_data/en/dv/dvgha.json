It helps repair red blood cells and boosts the immune system. Toddlers ages 1 to 3 years old need 15 mg of vitamin C a day and older children ages 4 to 8 years old need 25 mg a day. Many fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C, especially red and orange-colored ones, like strawberries, red bell peppers, and oranges. Vitamin C deficiencies are rare, but if you're concerned your child isn't getting enough, talk with your doctor about whether or not they need a supplement. Was this article helpful?
