Children ages 2 years old and younger are the highest priority for evaluation and testing due to brain development and frequent hand to mouth activity (such as putting toys in their mouth or sucking their thumb that could have picked up lead dust from a source in their immediate living environment). All children ages 6 and under are required to be evaluated for lead exposure risks by their physician and tested if necessary. The Illinois Lead Program recommends all children be evaluated or tested as indicated at ages 12 months and 24 months, and 3, 4,5, and 6 years of age.
