We are looking forgenes that enable some people to delay or escapediseases that so commonly afflict older people.By identifying these genes, we hope to provide a better understanding of diseases such asAlzheimer's disease, certain forms of cancer and heart disease. We are recruiting the following individuals: 1) Individual centenarians (people age 100 and older), who do not have living brothersor sisters aged 90 or older. 2) Individuals aged 98 and older and their living brothers or sisters who are at least 90 years old. We collect health and family history information. We also collect a small blood specimen in orderto look for genes that may be important inunderstanding longevity . People from anywherein the United States and abroad can participateand travel is not necessary . Participation is free of charge and all information is kept strictlyconfidential. If you or someone you know wouldlike to discuss the studies in further detail, please contact Louis Kunkel, PhD, principalinvestigator, and Stephanie Jo Brewster, MS,certified genetic counselor, at 1-877-890-4080.

The Senior Citizens' Secretariat was established in 1980 to facilitate the planning and development of services and programs for seniors by coordinatingplans, policies and programs presented by the departments of the provincial government. The Secretariat serves as aone door entry to government for seniors,seniors' groups and other provincial bodies concerned with aging issues. The Secretariat develops plans, policiesand programs in partnership with otherlevels of government and agencies responsible for seniors. The Secretariat's office is located at 1740 Granville Street, 4th floor , P .O. Box 2065, President: The Federations' First Lady There's been precious little time for Eileen Amirault tocelebrate since her election inMay as the first woman to beelected President of the NovaScotia Federation of SeniorCitizens and Pensioners. That's because of the weighty agenda of tasks and concernsthe Federation is facing thesedays. Firstly , there's the Federation's appeal to members of the Legislature and Parliament asking supportand assistance in securing some relief for hard-pressed seniors against rising home andtransportation fuel costs, and the effect this ishaving on persons of fixed incomes. Secondly , there's the worry about doctor and nursing shortages, reduced hospital budgets, the high costs of medicine and prescriptions, and the role the Federation will play as advisoryto the Minister on Single Entry Access and thePharmacare Program. Thirdly , there's that infamous \"Clawback\" Legislation in the news again, reaching into the pockets of the seniors when extra revenue(even death benefits) pushes a pensioner'sincome into a new tax bracket. A resolutionasking the Federal government to deem deathbenefits as income tax exempt is also underpreparation. The issue of the \"Clawback\", whichdogs all seniors, came home to her personallyrecently when she was advised that her pensionwould be reduced because a Canada PensionPlan Death Benefit she received on the passing of her husband increased her income beyond theallowable limit. That means a drop of $127.72 amonth for one year in her Old Age Pension sheexplained. That, and other similar cases, hasprompted the Federation to restart its campaignfor tax-free death benefits.And, with the National Convention of seniors held in Sydney , the Federation members were busymaking arrangements to play the role of hosts. Mrs. Amirault, of West Pubnico, is a widowed mother of six with a long-standing interest in theplight of seniors. She was only in her fortieswhen in 1978 she accepted a request that shebecome \"temporary secretary\" of the QuinlanSeniors Club in Yarmouth County . The job wasso interesting and challenging she says she heldon to it. When she became a senior she becameinvolved in the Federation, attended theconventions and in the past five years has risenthrough the Vice-Presidency offices, succeedingHeiner Magels as President this year. She says the Federation has been making representation to the MP's and MLA 's about thefuel price calculation and the affect it is havingon the cost of 1iving generally . In addition to being President of the Federation, she is a member of the Group as Nine. Her concern, she says, isthat rising costs of drugs could apply pressure on the premiums paid by seniors. She says shewould argue against an increase in the premiums. Submitted by Harold Shea Seniors' input sought to clinical education One Voice , The Canadian Seniors Network , has written the Association of Canadian MedicalColleges looking to provide seniors' input tomedical school curriculum committees. One Voice says that accreditation criterion for medical schools is being changed to ensurecurricula \"include experience in palliative care,pain management and end of life care.\" It welcomes the apparent change and believesseniors' input would be valuable.

She also suffers from behavioural disturbancesassociated with dementia and could be institution-alized because of it. Behavioural disturbances havebeen described as the key contributor to caregiverburden. But now there's hope. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer disease, which affects one in 20 Canadians overage 65. More often than not, care for those still living in the community is provided by the spouse or by an adult child. Behavioural disturbances,specifically aggression and agitation, are often themain reason families decide to institutionalize theirloved ones. Canada's first medication to treat the behavioural disturbances of dementia has been approved byHealth Canada. RISPERDAL (risperidone),previously approved as an anti-psychotic, hasreceived a new indication for the short-termsymptomatic management of inappropriatebehaviour due to aggression and/or psychosisassociated with severe dementia.

October 26-29, 2000; Edmonton, Programming Essentially , Human Services Advocate suggests a program of Body , Mind and Spirit . At least, thisis the main thrust of it's intent at Mountain LeaLodge, Bridgetown, NS. Of course this conjures up a whole grist of possibilities when you consider what is body , mind or spirit. Advocacy for thewhole person comes to mind. Also a wholeistic (holistic) point of view is suggested. I contend that a person is more than the sum of his/her parts.There is a dimension to all of us that transcendsour elemental nature. However, before this gets alittle too lofty and \"out there\" someplace, let'sleave body , mind and spirit for later . At Mountain Lea Lodge, Home for the aged, in Bridgetown we have in place a school. This is a school arranged for residents of that place. Retired school teachers teach on a volunteer basis thosesubjects generally taught at Junior High schoolseverywhere. We have at our Home about 20regular students (we graduated 23 this past July)who come to the 3/4 hour classes willingly andwith excitement for the sessions. Subjects offeredinclude social history , English, travel/geography ,science, body mind and spirit, and an additionalone this Fall is being negotiated...psychology ofaging. Sometimes taught are other stimulating ideas concerning horticultural therapy , and twoimportant agents for wellness namely , music and art therapy . Let's face it! We are an aging population. It cannot be possible that this is new knowledge to health/wellness professionals. You already areaware of this. And to quote from Year of OlderPersons declaration, 1999: \"In order to age well, we all need to have our physical, economic, educational, cultural,spiritual and social needs met. We have a right to dignity , choice, protection and self fulfilment.\"The residents' minds, spirit and bodies are alltouched by Mountain Lea Lodge school idea.This idea, created and begun by Jim N. Bent,Human Services Advocate, strives to meet aclient's needs on all needs levels. We all are awarethat entry into a senior's home often is fraughtwith fear and anxiety . Anything we can think ofthat will dispel frustration, hopelessness anddepression should be welcomed by staff andclient alike. Returning power to the new residentis of paramount importance in our Lodge's schoolprogram and replacing negative life energy withpositive influence is important to our plans.Learning never ends is one of our main and basicprinciples. Psychologist Abraham Maslow suggested that human needs fall into five categories, each ofwhich must be satisfied before we concernourselves with the following ones. The most basic of these are physical; sufficient air, water and food, and rest. The second ofMaslow's needs involve safety; protection fromthreats to our well being. Beyond physical and safety concerns are the social needs we aspire to. These are affection and inclusion, some control over our lives. Then Maslow contends we have the desire to beworthwhile, valuable people. Then, and onlythen, when we have satisfied all these, we willhave \"actualized\", will have developed ourpotential to the maximum and become the bestperson we can be. All the above are integral to The School Program in place at our Seniors' Complex. Jim Bent, Director, Human Services, Mountain Lea Lodge, Bridgetown, NS.August 16, 20009My Childhood in Southern Alberta As a child I spent most of childhood days on the Southern Alberta prairies in the vicinity of Ogen.Alberta. In 1913 I was just 6 years old. Theprairie there, at that time, was still covered withbuffalo bones and buffalo chips. As there werefew trees these buffalo chips provided fuel for thehousehold cooking. In winter time of course,coal was used in our stoves as the temperaturewas often 20 degrees below zero and we walkedat least a mile to school. It was usual1ychildren, and sometimes along with mothers, who gathered the buffalo chips. There werealways gophers and coyotesaround. The gopher preyedon gardens and the wheatcrops as soon as theysprouted. As youngsterswe children were paid topoison the gophers with amixture of strychnine andwheat. We were taught to be very careful of strychnine\u2014keep it away from our mouthsor food; put it well down into the gopher holes in order to save thebirds. The prevailing birds weremeadowlarks. seldom robins inour area; lots of hawks. They kept after the chickens. Final1y themunicipalities paid we youngstersfor gopher tails! 3 cents a tail. We were always aware of coyotes;used to hear them howling atnight. They can provide quite achorus!, and still do as they arestill around. Picnics were the big events we children looked forward to every summer. All ice cream washome made by the local ladies and did we loveit! 10 cents a cone! At Christmas time nearlyevery house made their own ice cream. Right here today in Shoreham Village, ice cream is afavourite dessert for me!One cannot leave any prairie memories without mentioning the sunsets. They are something theprairie will never lose no matter how the thingschange. When I was a child we had no such thing as baby sitters, as far as I know , (where our parents wentwe went). We drove in a sled to concerts in theone room school houses where there usually was a concert followed by dancing, mainly folks and square dancing. My mother and father provided the music, violin and organ usually . As the homesteaders were nearly all unmarried men, we 8 and 9 year olds became their partners and learned early to dance. I always remember the long ride home in a sled drawn by a team of horses. Our dad used to teach a lot about the stars and planets on these drives; often the nights would be pretty cold. My mother warmed stones in the oven during the day and then put them in the sled amidst the straw there. We always had a warmride home in thestarlight. Those were the days of no radio or TV . An added thought: My initials M.E.S., for Maxine E. Sutherland, often cause me to wonder if anyone thinks howthe addition of one more letter could make me aM.E.S.S. ! However, this causes me little worry . I think it is rather humorous. It's also good toknow that I've actually missed by a miss. Isn't there an old saying, \" A miss is as good as a mile?\" By Maxine SutherlandShoreham Village, Chester, NS10Memorable facts about forgetting Worried about forgetfulness? Forget about it. It happens to all of us. Memory isn't perfect\u2014andit isn't designed to be. In fact, memory expertsadvise us that the less we worry about memorylapses the fewer we'll have. Your long-term memory holds facts, memories and \"how to\" procedures. To lock something in,think of nothing but that one thing for aminimum of eight seconds. Research shows that upsetting situations tend to stick with us because they activate stress hormones \u2014imprinting them in our long-term memory .Short-term memory is your mental blackboard. It holds only a few items\u2014and most \"get erased\"after less than a minute. Women, in general, have better memories than men. Memory experts speculate that the female hormone estrogen might help keep brain processes intact\u2014or that juggling the many details of dailyliving keeps women's minds supple. It is possible to improve your memory . Consciously paying attention is key toremembering things morecompletely\u2014andpermanently . Strategies that may life,writing things connect withthe things you want toremember. Sources: The National Institute of Mental Health; Memory Assessment Clinics; University ofCalifornia researchNurse Practitioners\u2014 New Partners Nurse practitioners (NPs) are registered nurses who have specialized skills and knowledge inhealth assessment and promotion, disease prevention, treatment and management of selected health problems. In other words, they have thecompetencies or abilities to provide a wide rangeof health care services focused on helping and working with you, and people in your community , achieve the best level of health possible. Nurse practitioners blend everything they know and can do as a registered nurse with aspects ofcare from the field of medicine that they have theauthority to perform because of their educational preparation and expertise. NPs blend their nursing expertise with their ability to diagnose and treatcommon illnesses and injuries, prescribe certainmedications, and order certain tests, x-rays andultrasounds. Where do nurse practitioners work? Because Nova Scotia does not yet have legislation to cover the practice (QEII and IWK Grace) andfour pilot project sites in Springhill, Caledonia,Pictou, and Halifax\u2014where they work inpartnership with doctors, other health careprofessionals, individuals, families andcommunities. When nurse practitioner legislation is passed, NPs, in partnership arrangements, would be ableto provide care in a variety of settings, includingcommunity health centres, family practiceenvironments, nursing homes, student healthcentres, and specialized hospital units. How do nurse practitioners improve the delivery of health care services? First of all, as members of the health care team, NPs contribute a unique set of skills andknowledge in assessment, treatment andpreventive health care\u2014complementing thecontributions of the other health careprofessionals. Primary health care nursepractitioners are the first contact for manyindividuals seeking health care services. Specialty nurse practitioners provide health care11to specific client groups (e.g., newborns, seniors, clients with kidney , heart or liver disorders). NPs also provide ongoing care to their clients,which often focuses on health promotion andhelping clients, and their families, understandtheir illnesses and how to improve or maintainthe quality of their lives. Promoting communityhealth and safety is another area in which NPsoften apply their expertise. Secondly , the inclusion of NPs on the health care team means increased access to health careservices. NPs can diagnose and treat commonillnesses, infections and injuries (e.g., colds,bladder infections, and sprains), and monitorstable, chronic conditions such as high bloodpressure and diabetes. They can also order labtests, x-rays, and ultrasounds, and conductcertain screening tests such as Pap smears.Doctors note that working with NPs gives them(doctors) more time with their patients withcomplicated situations. Patients benefit from theblended medical and nursing expertise from thatdoctor-nurse practitioner practice arrangements. What other provinces are considering new ways to meet health care needs? Newfoundland and Ontario are the only two provinces that have nurse practitioner legislation.The regulatory body for registered nurses inNova Scotia, RNANS, has submitted a newRegistered Nurses Act to the government, andthe approval of this act would mean that nursepractitioners would have legislated authority topractise more extensively in Nova Scotia \u2014to be able to expand their partnerships to keep you,your family and community healthy and well.

Senior Friendly Grocery Store Guidelines and Senior Friendly Ideas for Healthy Eating are now available! A joint initiative of the Alberta Council on Aging and Dietitians of Canada, with fundingfrom Health Canada and other stakeholders, the guidelines give both retailers and seniors'advocates the tools to examine any store with afresh perspective, looking at everything fromtransportation, to entryways, to carts, toselection, to cashier stations. As with existingSenior Friendly tools, the guidelines are based in reality-built and tested by a wide-ranging teamthat includes seniors, grocers, packagers anddietitians. Ideally , a retailer using the guidelineswill team with local seniors to participate in on-site \"check-ups\" and report what they findfrom a user's point of view. Included with the guidelines is Senior Friendly Ideas for Healthy Eating, a set of 12 fact sheetsfrom Dietitians for Canada that grocers,nutritionists and others can photocopy and offerto their senior customers. The fact sheets containuseful tips (in easy-to-read language and type)for meal planning, shopping and cooking for one or two. \"Seniors and their caregivers will find these fact sheets especially helpful for planning a balanceddiet on a budget,\"says Jayne Thirsk of Dietitiansof Canada, who worked with dietitian KerriStaden to develop the tips. The tip sheets and areavailable and can be accessed by visiting eitherthe Senior Friendly Websitehttp://seniorfriendly .cjb.net. or the Dietitians ofCanada website (click on resources)http://www.dietitians.ca Already , seniors are enjoying the benefits of stores that put priority on seniors. Just one improvement, product-directed lighting, now allows oneEdmonton senior to shop for herself. A low-vision senior, she cannot read labels in dim light. 12Grocers who helped develop the guidelines, meanwhile, see Senior Friendly approaches askey to attracting and serving a growing wave ofseniors. Edmonton's downtown core contains7,000 seniors, notes T.J. Tarnowski, a storemanager serving that area; his staff are always onalert for ways to help those seniors reach thestore, and to serve them better once they'reinside. And the benefits are obvious. \"Many ofour seniors come in regularly , and they'redeveloping friendly relationships with our staff.\" For your own copy of Senior Friendly Grocery Stores, or to find out more about the entireSenior Friendly family of resources, contact Jan Reimer at (780) 423-7781, e-mail: acaging@compusmart.ab.ca . Be Careful, It's My Heart It's not much of a water garden; but it's an oasisin the huddled muddled heritage houses ofdowntown Truro. The first dragonfly tries itswings in iridescent flight.

What female heart can gold despise? What cat's averse to fish?\" Today the rockery around the pond is in fullbloom, little carpets of white, blue, purpleminiature flowers. I sit on the wooden benchnearby under the trellis, I gaze reverently and a little impatiently at this little paradise, thisminute harbour of the soul. The small fountainsplashes its minute of quiet contentment. It's anideal scene for a water colour or oil, with itsdarks of the water, the interlaced greens as thesun moves overhead. Framed by bull rushes andlily pads, a goldfish comes to wash and splatteron the submerged stones, God is in his heavenand all's right with the world. Well not really , I'll paint when I don't feel \"sopoorly\" as mother used to say . Meanwhile thankyou Margaret for rockery splendour and for myown Heron coated in copper enamel that presidesover this little kingdom. \"Peace and contentment\" not quite my friend. The 18, (I tried to count them) thick metalstaples or clamps, like a zip fastener, embellishfrom just below the collar bone to the lowersternum. The medals of honour shine in proof ofby-pass surgery: comforting to me; grimacinglyin intimidating to the observer\u2014looking at thebloody rip. I'm convalescing as many of us must do in later years: putting our ancient bodies back togetherfor? For what? Another bang at the buck, achance to paint an inspired masterpiece? Timeanyway not to be wasted, after all this trauma,time to see the grandchildren bloom and grow. The nurses at QEII cardiovascular unit, the gorgeous Lisa, the super efficient Sandy , Ann,Judy , Karen and especially in ICU Linda. They zip in and out, bright smiles, knowing theanswer to every question before I ask: so manypatients come and go. Up at 6am: the \"team\" arrives at 6:30am. The boss or senior intern sits in splendor on a chair,smiles knowingly: the team, the others flit about,quoting, temp, pulse, blood pressure, bloodwork. Well the boss says, we're agreed \"home tomorrow\" you've done well\u2014snap of the medical recordsfolder and gone. 13I didn't like the first team who sat in judgement my first day in Intensive Care when a snip of agirl about the age of my grandson, steps over andrips off my first very secure chest dressing.\"Incision okay says she.\" Too tired to gasp I wishour roles reversed. Shouldn't a doctor introduceh/herself and warn about a painful procedurebefore doing it? Or is it supposed to be easierthis way , they take turns at medical practice, this one should end up in pathology . If I can hatethe girl it helps when I sneeze or cough and mychest feels as if the operation is happening allover again, minus the anaesthetic. But whiner that I am, all in all the staff were super: the surgeon even listened silently . Thegood Dr. Wood who is/was a calm amidst thestorm of racing, dancing, shouting figures; whena CODE BLUE erupted in my ICU section.Everyone runs for CODE BLUE, it's awesome. So thank you, all you cardiovascular teams whointerview , examine, assess, support, do it andsmile; as an old friend Dr. Resmik loves to say \"Blessings from Jerusalem\"! Also as Al Chaddock, creator of magical Sable Island pony paintingssaid when he stumped into my hospital room,\"the winds about right, we're all geared up, getout of that bed, we're going sailing tonight\"! This diatribe is not just about my \"open heart\" op but for all of us who must trust our bodies,lives to those young genii who perform miraclesnot possible in our grandparents day . So whenyou go through recovery and it damm well hurts;remember and be comforted, encouraged. Theflowers are wonderful, the peas are up, the beesback at work, \"bid me to live and I shall live\",there are fairies at the bottom of your garden:God is giving us another chance another first dayof the rest of your live. He is saying in my navaljargon, wakey wakey , rise and shine, lash up andstow , cooks to the galley have long gone ago. So get fell in, head up, shoulders back, reportyourself back to duty , to life, and if I ever catchthat Ms. Intern I'll paddle her canoe; ye Gods Imust be feeling better, what the hell Metabell andremember friend it's alright to indulge yourself. Cheers and blessings. Alan Sager, Truro Grieving Ways to deal with the loss of a person or pet thatmeant a lot to you: Take a break from your routine responsibilities. Cancel obligations for atleast a week after a major loss, and don't beafraid to ask family and friends for help. Talk about your feelings with family , friends, clergy or spiritual advisors. Suppressingfeelings may prolong the grieving process. Use creative outlets such as writing, art of music to express your feelings and workthrough grief. Write poetry , a letter to aperson who died, or keep a journal. Gatherphotographs or make a commemorativevideo to honor and preserve memories ofthe one you've lost. Allow yourself to cry . Crying is a natural response to pain and provides an emotionalrelease that helps you heal. Take care of yourself. Studies show grief can depress the immune system, making youmore prone to illness. Make an effort to eathealthfully and sleep well. Be patient with yourself. Intense grieving can last anywhere from three months to ayear. Avoid making any major life decisionsduring this time. Join a bereavement support group or see a counselor. You can get a referral from yourclergy , mental health professionals, hospitalsor hospices. It's okay to make time for diversion and fun when the time feels right. Laughter can be a greatstress-reducer.

You cannot recapture the past and, infacing an unknown future, you may be overcomeby fear. My own experience proved I was so busytrying to be the best caregiver possible for myfather that I didn't take the time to deal properlywith all the fears that were accumulating at theback of my mind. I wasn't admitting to them or talking about them. As a result, these fears became magnified. We can spend too much time facing our fears alone, feeling that there is no one else outthere who could really understand what it's like. It doesn't have to be like this. What are some of those fears we know too well? Fear of financial problems related to caring for a loved one\u2014that the money will run out while athome or that there isn't enough money to evenconsider a long-term care facility , no matter howdesperately needed. Fear that you'll fail as a caregiver\u2014that you won't be able to keep up the pace physically . How many times have you asked yourself: \"How long can I go on doing this\u2014how many more days, or years, before I fall apart?\" For how long have you tried against all odds to smile and say \"we're managing, thank you\"? Fear of the inability to handle the emotional stress. You finally start to understand what thestress is doing to you. And you're afraid you'llnever regain your original self\u2014that person filledwith energy , curiosity and optimism. Fear of having to watch a loved one's pain and suffering. You feel helpless to stop or evencontrol it. Fear of making the wrong care decision\u2014leading to an unexpected outcome and the possiblewrath of other family members. Fear of dealing with a loved one's incontinence. Can I change my father's diapers? How does hefeel when I have to do this? Fear of dementia. Will your loved one no longer be able to recognize you? Fear of aggression caused by illness. How will you deal with a loved one's violence towards you?Fear of being unable to advocate well enough\u2014or of being unavailable the one time it really matters. Fear that your loved one's needs will be sacrificedto those of the system. Fear of seeing your own future in a loved one who is deteriorating. Fear of losing your \"self\"\u2014of becoming so involved in caring for another that your identity is lost,and your needs remain neglected and unfulfilled. Fear of facing the future alone\u2014of losing the comfort of an embrace, the assurance ofunconditional love. Finally , the tremendous fear of admitting to emotions you are \"not supposed to feel\"\u2014frustration, anger, a momentary desire to strikeout or to flee. All caregiver fears are real -for no other reason than that they exist. Are they rational? Each of ushas to decide this for ti ourselves. We may needhelp doing this. If you have trouble talking withthe person you care for, talk to someone who has been there or talk to a professional. Communicate how you are feeling. Learn how someone else hasdealt with their fears. It's not wrong to be afraid; it goes with the territory . It is wrong to suffer alone and in silence. I have felt the blessings of caregiving. I better understand and feel compassion; I appreciate andaccept my strengths and weaknesses; I am abetter personnel manager, accountant, researcherand advocate. I have built up shared memorieswith my father that will stay with me forever. Ihave given back. No one can perform the act of caring without help. Remember that we are, after all, onlyhuman. Caregivers aren't perfect, although wecan kill ourselves trying. Please accept support. Remember the joy you bring to those you love and thank yourselvesevery day that you care. Source: Karen Henderson, The Caregiver The newsletter of Caregiver Network Inc.Fall 199918A family guide to least restraint At one time, the use of restraints in long-term care facilities was common and it was thoughtthat they would protect people from falling orwandering away . In recent years, the routine useof restraints has raised significant concerns. We now know that restraints have negative consequences, including depression, increasedagitation and muscle weakness. Complicationscan include skin problems, incontinence and loss of mobility . On the other hand, being able to move around increases muscle strength, stimulates circulation,uses excess energy , relieves stress and reduces the risk of injury-related fall problems. Mostimportantly , it preserves dignity and permitsresidents to live a more \"normal\" life. Don't restraints keep most people safe? Restraints do not remove the risk of falls. Nearly all people fall at one time or another. In the eventof a fall, however, people who are not restrainedtend to be less seriously injured than those whoare restrained. Consider, for example, a person who falls while trying to get up out of a chair or wheelchair. Ifthe person is tied to the chair, the chair can fallon top of the person when they fall. Do people with dementia know they are restrained? Although you may have lost the ability to express your needs, you still know that you cannot getup out of a chair, move your arm or scratch yournose. These are basic feelings that remain evenafter verbal communication has deteriorated. How can family help? Family members have a very important role to play in keeping residents in a safe and comfortable environment with the least restraint possible. Try to be open minded. If you are apprehensive, discuss your fears with your loved one'scaregiver. Agree to removing the restraint for ashort time, even if it is only one hour a day tobegin with. Finally , celebrate success. Observe how yourfamily member's behaviour or attitude maychange and share your observations with thecaregivers.

One such community is Pictou where this summer they entered a float entitled \"Hats off toSeniors\" (Youth is a gift of nature, but Age is awork of Art) in three local parades. All seniors ofPictou County were entertained and thoseparticipating report as to having a \"ball.\" 19Gentle Teaching One of the most remarkable alternatives to restraints being used today is a technique calledGentle Teaching. This approach requires a deepcommitment by caregivers to change their ownbehaviour. Gentle Teaching is many things. Gentleness toward others, in spite of what anyone does ordoes not do, is the critical factor. It is a paradox. Fists are met with hugs. Cursing is met with words of affection and nurturing.Spiteful eyes are met with warmth . Gentleness recognizes that all change is mutual and interwoven. It starts with caregivers and,hopefully , touches those who are mostmarginalized. Its central focus is to express unconditional love. It is the framework around a psychology ofhuman interdependence. The main idea ofgentleness is not to get rid of someone else'sbehaviors, but to deepen our own inner feelingsof gentleness in the face of violence or disregard. Gentle teaching asks caregivers to look at themselves and their spirit of gentleness to findways to express warmth and unconditional lovetoward those who are the most disenfranchisedfrom family and community life. It views our role as critical and requires a deep commitmentto personal and social change. It starts withourselves, our warmth toward others, ourwillingness to give without any expectation ofreceiving anything in return, and our intensedesire to form feelings of companionship andcommunity with those who are the most pushedto the very edge of society . Gentle teaching focuses on four essential feelings that need to be taught to those who are served\u2014to feel safe, loved, loving and engaged. Caregiversnot only need to ensure that those they serve aresafe, but, more importantly , that they feel safe.Words become tools for uplifting others. Eyesbecome windows to the heart. Caregivers alsoteach human engagement. This is made up ofthree basic feelings: 1) it is good to be with oneanother, 2) it is good to do things with oneanother, and 3) it is good to do things for oneanother. Human engagement is the homelessperson jn the shelter preparing and serving mealsto others. It is the people in a group home doingchores together simply because it is good to be together. It is street children forming a community to protect each other and share the little theyhave gathered. Gentle teaching is not a behavioral or behavior modification approach that uses reward andpunishment to change behaviors. Rather, it isbased on unconditional love. It is not a\"whatever works\" approach, it is one that looksat broadening and deepening a sense ofcompanionship and community as a life-project.Gentle teaching is not a fast and easy approachtoward helping others, but one that calls on deepcommitment and dedication on the part ofcaregivers. It is not just a way to look atchanging someone else's reality , but first askingus to look at our own reality and make it warmerand more loving. Finally , gentle teaching is notsimply a technique, but also a psychology ofhuman interdependence. Who needs a spirit of gentleness? Gentle Teaching and a psychology of inter- dependence are being used to help marginalizedchildren and adults around the world. Its keyfocus is on those who are on the very edge offamily and community life. For example, Gentle Teaching is used with: those who are homeless; individuals in long-termpsychiatric hospitals; institutionalized individualswith mental disabilities who are sometimes putinto warehouse-like settings or in more home- like settings, but who are sensing deep loneliness; individuals being supported in community livingand work settings who are sometimes able toconnect easily with a feeling of companionshipand community , but at other times, are left to livelonely , empty and sad lives; elderly men andwomen confined in nursing homes who are oftenforgotten and left to die alone; children andadolescents in public schools with \"behavior\"problems, children segregated from otherchildren or children suspended from school. Many professionals try to separate people intodistinct categories and apply specialized rules foreach group. People with autism need this\u2014thosewith schizophrenia need that\u2014this syndromedemands that treatment. Words swirl around, Use time-out.\" \"Use token economy .\" \"Punishment is the only way to teachhim/her a lesson.\" Our approach is to be gentle and to teach companionship and community .
