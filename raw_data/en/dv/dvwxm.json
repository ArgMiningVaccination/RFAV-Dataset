Founded in 1947, their mission has always been the same. \"Providing customers with innovative, science-based supplements that support health and well-being. Solgar was there at the beginning of the supplement industry. They saw how the world was changing. They saw changes that were taking place in food choices - changes that alarmed them, and inspired them. Solgar was born of that perceived need to develop products that provided nutritional support so people could live well and feel good throughout their life. We love this quote from the Solgar website: \"This has never been a business to us, although like all things it has become one. We love what we do because we believe in what we do. To help you be the very best version of you throughout your life. Call it our passion. Call it our craft. Something we've been doing for over 70 years now. We live this lifestyle. We take our own supplements.\" All of the raw ingredients in Solgar's products are sourced from the best growers. High quality ingredients crafted in small batches to ensure freshness. They avoid artificial ingredients or unnecessary fillers, binders, or colorings. And their products are produced using filtered water. Did you know that Solgar was committed to non-GMO before most people had even heard of it? Amazing! At The Healthy Place, we strive for accuracy in our product images and information.
