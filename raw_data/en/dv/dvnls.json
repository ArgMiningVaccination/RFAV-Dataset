The Museum is also an exempt charity as listed in Part 3 of the Charities Act 2011. The Trustees have complied with the duty in Section 11 of the Charities Act 2011 to have due regard to guidance published by the Charity Commission. Statutory duties Under Section 3 of the British Museum Act 1963, the Museum is responsible for keeping its collections and making them available for inspection by the public. The Board of Trustees The Museum is governed by a Board of 12 Trustees who are appointed by the Prime Minister (8), the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on recommendation by the Royal Society (1) or co-opted by the Board of Trustees themselves (3). Those appointed by the Prime Minister or co-opted are appointed by open competition. Organisational structure During the year responsibility and delegated authority for the management of the Museum rested with the Executive Board, under the leadership of the Director of the Museum, who is appointed by the Trustees, and, as the Accounting Officer, is responsible to Parliament. The Executive Board reflects the functional operation of the Museum and consists of: Director of the Museum Dr Michael Dixon Director of Public Engagement Dr Justin Morris (from 15 April 2013) Director of Finance and Corporate Services Neil Greenwood Director of Science Professor Ian Owens Sharon Ament resigned as Director of Public Engagement on 31 August 2012 in order to take up the position of Director of the Museum of London.

Relationship with DCMS As a non-departmental public body the Museum is sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This relationship is formalised via the Funding Agreement, a Management Statement and a Financial Memorandum. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport acts as the principal regulator for the Museum as an exempt charity. Group entities The Museum's accounts are a consolidation of the following: The Natural History Museum; The Natural History Museum Trading Company Ltd.; The Natural History Museum Special Funds Trust; The Natural History Museum Benevolent Fund; and The Cockayne Trust. 4 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Objectives and Activities Mission The Natural History Museum's mission is to maintain and develop its collections and use them to promote the discovery, understanding, responsible use and enjoyment of the natural world. Objectives The Natural History Museum is one of the world's great institutions and is the guardian of the national collection of over 80 million natural history specimens. This includes unrivalled collections of biological and geological specimens, the world's finest natural history library and a magnificent collection of natural history art. Many of these treasures are housed in the famous Waterhouse Building in South Kensington. They represent an important part of the nation's heritage, but more importantly, the Museum actively works with its collections to meet the needs of people today and in the future. The Museum uses its collections in scientific research programmes of internationally recognised excellence, thereby generating new knowledge that is both scientifically important and, in many cases, of great practical value. One of the country's leading visitor attractions, the Museum is also dedicated to making natural history as accessible as possible to a wide range of people in this country and worldwide. It does so by means of its educational and enjoyable exhibitions, publications, and its teaching and outreach programmes, including via the web. It supports all of these activities with high quality staff, services and facilities. In addition to the main Museum site in South Kensington, there is the Natural History Museum at Tring, Hertfordshire, which houses the collections bequeathed by Lionel Walter Rothschild and is also home to the world-class collections of the Natural History Museum's Bird Group. The Museum is committed to excellence and in order to contribute fully to the imperatives facing the natural world the Museum has a corporate plan which sets high ambitions to be realised over the period 2011-16. This is enshrined in the Museum's vision. The Natural History Museum Vision: The Museum's vision is that we will be widely acknowledged as the world's leading natural history museum, valued by our stakeholders as a major scientific research institution and a centre for innovative public engagement with science and the natural world through our collections and expertise. Strategic Plan 2011-16: A new five-year strategic plan was introduced during 2011-12 that responds to the changing external environment and focuses on delivery following the opening of the Darwin Centre. The key themes are: Developing knowledge of the natural world Our strategy for supporting innovation and ideas Inspiring a sustained engagement with the natural world Our strategy for engaging with our stakeholders Managing resources; investing in infrastructure Our strategy for the best use of our assets for the long term future of the Museum 5 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Achievements and activities during 2012-2013 Continuing the upward trend since the opening of the Darwin Centre in September 2009, 2012-13 marked another record year for visitor numbers. Supported by the special exhibition programme, permanent galleries and the programme of public events, total visitors to South Kensington and Tring amounted to over 5.1 million which was an increase of 3% compared with 2011-12. This was in spite of a comparative reduction in visitors numbers during the Olympic period. The highlight of the year was the opening of the permanent exhibition, Treasures in the Cadogan Gallery by HRH The Duchess of Cambridge in November. The gallery displays 22 of the Museum's most extraordinary specimens each with a fascinating story to tell and representing an important part of the Museum's scientific, historical, social and cultural worth. The specimens include: Archaeopteryx fossil - the most valuable fossil in the Museum's collection. This 147-million-year-old rock slab contains the remains of the earliest known bird. With its combination of bird and dinosaur characteristics, it is a snapshot of evolution in action; Audubon's The Birds of America - the world's most expensive book and one of the best-known natural history books ever produced. It was first published in double elephant folio size between 1827 and 1838 and is famous for its stunning life-size illustrations of birds; Charles Darwin's pigeons - Darwin's pigeons provided him with the crucial evidence for the theory of evolution by natural selection. He bred them in his garden as an experiment and donated these fancy breeds of rock dove to the Museum in 1867; Wold Cottage meteorite - earliest surviving meteorite seen to land in the UK. The rock formed during the birth of the solar system, 4.6 billion years ago, and was seen to fall near Wold Cottage, Yorkshire, in 1795, confirming the extra-terrestrial origins of meteorites. Subsequently in April 2013 the Museum was delighted to announce that HRH The Duchess of Cambridge had become the Patron of the Natural History Museum. The main special exhibitions at South Kensington were Animal Inside Out featuring plastinated animals and capillary specimens displaying internal anatomy, the Veolia Environment Wildlife Photographer of the Year from the autumn 2012, and from February 2013, Extinction: Not the end of the World? exploring the crucial role extinction can play in the evolution of life. The main exhibitions at the Natural History Museum at Tring which itself had a record number of visitors of 154,000 were Animal Record Breakers which ran until July 2012, Daring Explorers during the summer months and Unfeathered Bird from March 2013, which featured illustrations of skeletons of birds engaged in natural behaviour. Within the total visitors figure were 1,287,000 children (2012: 1,243,000) and, based on site surveys, there were an estimated 327,000 UK visitors aged 16 and over from lower socio-economic groups. The number of children in organised educational programmes both on-site and outreach amounted to 492,000 (2012: 497,000) maintaining the growth in recent years, and reflecting a growth in school bookings and the opportunities for engagement in the Darwin Centre. A key component of the outreach programme is Real World Science within which the Museum coordinates and leads a national partnership with other UK museums to provide out of classroom learning for secondary schools. The website continued to attract a high level of visitors with almost 7.3m unique user visits to the site (2012: 8.0m). This was underpinned by the continuing 6 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 development of Nature Online, an area on the Museum's website where virtual visitors can engage in surveys, forums and blogs with Museum's scientists and science, and explore further with the use of a NaturePlus card containing material saved during their visit to the Museum. Of particular interest and popularity during the year were the Urban Tree Survey, the Human Origins section which was updated, the Wallace100 hub which was launched in preparation for the centenary of the death of Alfred Russel Wallace in 2013, a section on the Piltdown man hoax recognising the 100th anniversary and a relaunch of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition site. In September 2012 the third EU funded event Science Uncovered took place in the Museum. Working with 26 partner organisations, the event attracted over 9,000 public visitors to South Kensington and Tring for an evening of extensive contact and interaction with the Museum's scientific activities and staff, demonstrating the importance of scientific research and collections based study. A Big Nature Day took place at the Museum on 27 May 2012: over 5,000 visitors were able to engage with over 50 nature groups, as well as Museum scientists, sharing their knowledge and expertise on a huge variety of UK biodiversity topics, from beetles and fossils to birds and bats. The event also saw the launch of the new resource pack to support the Cub Scout Naturalist Activity Badge, developed by the Museum with supporting partners the Wildlife Trusts and the National Trust. In Spring 2012, the Museum again participated as a lead partner in the Lyme Regis Fossil Festival on the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Over 17,000 visitors attended, and Museum staff across all disciplines delivered a programme of activities including on marine environments, other local biodiversity and geology, and fossil identification. Launched in January 2012 by the Museum, Stakeholder Forum and the British Council and continuing through to June 2012, four Earth Debates took place in the Attenborough Studio to contribute to discussions surrounding the June 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). On the collections, curation and research side, the Museum continued to produce high quality science, attract funding for collections-based activities and research, and participate in international initiatives, including: The Museum led the consortium of 18 natural history based organisations across Europe in securing a third phase of funding by the European Commission's Infrastructure Programme to continue its SYNTHESYS project for four more years starting from September 2013, building on the success of two previous Museum-led projects focussing on access to collections and collaboration, mobility of researchers, joint research activity and network activity. The project has operated since 2004 with total funding now amounting to \u20ac28 million; A continuing contribution to the Biodiversity Heritage Library which is a global partnership of natural history and botanical libraries that is working to digitise biodiversity literature. The Museum has contributed almost 3 million pages to the almost 41 million pages now digitised; In January the London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research was launched, a joint initiative of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum to facilitate co-ordination of research activities on NTDs including blinding trachoma, project commenced with the aim to digitise the entire collection of British moths and lepidoptera in the next three years; 7 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The Museum continued to lead a multinational EU-funded project to develop a sustainable electronic infrastructure - Scratchpads - that supports users in creating, linking, analysing and publishing taxonomic and biodiversity data on the web, facilitating integration with a network of global biodiversity initiatives; A Museum palaeontologist was co-author of paper in the international journal, Nature, on the top predator of the Cambrian Seas of 500 million years ago, Anomalocaris , showing that it had vision similar to that of living insects and crustaceans; Museum life scientists were authors of a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America investigating the evolution and development of the beak like jaws of pufferfish and the genes involved; Museum scientists were part of the Tomato Genome Consortium which published a paper in Nature on the complete genome of the domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its wild ancestor (Solanum pimpinellifolium ); Museum earth scientists identified the world's smallest mammoth, based on fossils discovered in Crete by Dorothea Bate, an early c20th palaeontologist; Following on from the award of \u00a311.7m from the Big Lottery to a consortium in August 2007, spread over a 5 year period, the Museum continued to play a significant role in Open Air Laboratories Network (OPAL), an England-wide initiative designed to encourage the public to engage with some of the country's leading scientists while becoming involved in environmental projects tailored to their region; The Annual Science Lecture, Big Bang Biospheres and Beyond , was delivered by Britain's distinguished cosmologist and popular science writer, Professor Martin Rees, addressing big questions about space; A team of Museum mineralogists and laboratory staff won a \u20ac100,000 contract from the European Space Agency to study potential biohazard indicators in Mars analogue samples; A grant of \u00a3576,000 was secured for research into megafaunal and macrofaunal molecular genetics, including detailed analysis of connectivity, taxonomy and phylogeny for the annelid worms; A grant of \u00a3294,000 was awarded from BBSRC for research into comparing the variety of venoms of polychaete annelid worms; A grant of \u00a3273,000 was awarded by NERC for a project titled Global and local effects of long-term environmental change: a turtle's eye view; The EU - Cooperation Environment Programme made an award to the Museum of \u00a3192,000 for Building the European Biodiversity Observation Network; The EU - People International Incoming Fellowship made an award of \u00a3166,000 for the study Myanmar freshwater biogeography: understanding a zoogeographical transition zone; BBSRC made an award of \u00a3123,000 for developing an online interactive resource for testing patterns in arthropod evolution and biodiversity; The Arthropod Supertree of Life: The Calleva Foundation continued to support research projects in human origins and the ancient human occupation of Britain; 8 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 In July 2012 the Museum hosted an international expert workshop for the Convention on Biological Diversity to develop a strategic plan for The Global Invasive Species Information Partnership; Significant additions to the collections included an example of the mineral Wurtzite from Tanzania; a specimen of Rhinopteraspis dunensis an exceptionally well preserved fossil fish from Germany; an Ankylosaur dinosaur from the UK; the long-horn beetle collection and a collection of 15,000 beetles from Laos; 668 peer reviewed scientific papers were published; Approximately \u00a32.1m scientific grant funding (excluding value to collaborators) was secured from 15 major awards (2012: \u00a32.0m); Approximately 13,100 scientific visitor days were recorded from over 8,600 scientific visitors, including those visiting under the SYNTHESYS project; Over 11,900 science enquiries and specimen identifications were attended to.

At the Museums and Heritage Awards for 2013 the Museum received the following awards: Best of the Best; Temporary or Touring Exhibition (winner) for Scott's Last Expedition; Marketing campaign for Animal Inside Out (highly commended); and Permanent exhibition for Treasures in the Cadogan Gallery (highly commended). Achievement against performance indicators for 2012-13, including core indicators as set out in the Funding Agreement is shown in Appendix 1 to the Trustees' report. Plans for 2013-2014 The main special exhibitions at South Kensington are Sensational Butterflies an outdoor exhibition on the east lawns, Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado: Genesis featuring extraordinary images of landscapes, wildlife and remote communities by the world-renowned photographer which opened in late 2012-13 and which will 9 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 continue until September, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year from the autumn, and an exhibition on the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain from early 2014. At Tring the main summer exhibition is Blooming Marvellous , which reveals 400 years of botanical art that helped scientists learn about plants. Throughout 2013 the Museum will continue to celebrate the life and scientific legacy of Alfred Russel Wallace, being the centenary of his death, via a series of events, activities and on line features (Wallace100). On the research side, the Museum will consolidate its position as one of the world's leading institutions in systematics and scientific research by continuing the implementation of the new Science Strategy and by seeking to increase the proportion of research that is published in higher impact journal titles as well as competing for and increasing peer reviewed funding. For the collections, the focus will be developing to further plans to improve collections storage and to invest in digitisation to make the collections images and data available via the web to both scientific and public users. There will be continued investment in galleries including in the central hall area, and the completion of collections storage facilities, other core estate infrastructure at both South Kensington and Tring including digital infrastructure. A Visitor Circulation study will be commissioned, focussing on the infrastructure improvements required to manage the ever increasing visitor numbers, and the grounds programme will commence with the development of proposals for the open space in front of the Waterhouse Building at South Kensington. Restructuring will be completed in the Public Engagement areas of activity, alongside new Learning and Public Engagement strategies so that the Museum is best placed to deliver the overall strategic plan. 10 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Financial Review 2012-13 The Natural For the Natural History Museum Accounts which include the grant-in-aid voted History Museum by Parliament and the consolidation with the Natural History Museum Trading Company, the Special Funds Trust, the Cockayne Trust and the Benevolent Fund, the overall level of funds decreased by \u00a326.2m from \u00a3462.3m to \u00a3436.1m. This reflects a decrease arising from the indexation of fixed assets of \u00a318.6m and net outgoing resources of \u00a37.7m which is after taking account of depreciation of \u00a312.5m. The deficit of \u00a37.7m on net resources arose from an overall reduction of \u00a31.3m in incoming resources to \u00a374.4m (2012: \u00a375.7m), primarily a reduction in grant in aid and scientific grant and contract income, and an overall increase in resources expended of \u00a31.7m to \u00a382.2m (2012: \u00a380.5m) from an increase in energy, restructuring and IT costs. However, the net resources for the General Fund which accounts for most of the core funded operational activity, and excludes depreciation, amounted to a surplus of \u00a36.0m (2012: \u00a37.7m). In addition the balance on the General Fund Reserve at the year end amounted to \u00a33.4m (2012: \u00a34.7m) which is in excess of the minimum reserve figure of \u00a32.5m by \u00a30.9m. Of the total incoming resources for the restricted and unrestricted donations (including lottery funding) and sponsorship. In addition income from trading activities amounted to \u00a315.2m (2012: \u00a315.1m), and income from admissions from the special exhibition programme and membership generated \u00a32.5m (2012: \u00a32.8m). Scientific grants and contracts income reduced by \u00a30.7m to \u00a35.5m (2012: \u00a36.2m). Of the total resources expended amounting to \u00a382.2m (2012: \u00a380.5m), the total expenditure on charitable activities was maintained at \u00a360.6m (2012: \u00a360.3m). The expenditure included a capital grant payment of \u00a32.5m to the Natural History Museum Development Trust. Total depreciation amounted to \u00a312.5m (2012: \u00a312.6m) and support costs excluding support costs depreciation amounted to \u00a314.7m (2012: \u00a313.6m) reflecting increased energy costs and IT costs. Within the total fund balance of \u00a3436.1m, unrestricted designated funds which largely represents the non-donated estate (including most of the South Kensington site) and funds which the Museum has invested in capital assets and programmes have decreased by \u00a318.0m from \u00a3383.8m to \u00a3365.8m, reflecting the indexation of fixed assets, capital expenditure and depreciation. The balance on the General Fund has decreased by \u00a31.3m to a surplus of \u00a33.4m (2012: \u00a34.7m), while within the designated fund there is \u00a35.6m (2012: \u00a34.3m) for future, mostly capital projects and \u00a31.3m (2012: \u00a30.9m) for future scientific research projects. The restricted fund balance has decreased from \u00a373.0m to \u00a366.0m reflecting capital expenditure funded by donations and donation funding received for future capital expenditure, offset by the impact of indexation and depreciation. Capital expenditure for the year, funded prominently by the surplus on the General Fund and restricted donations, amounted to \u00a35.1m (2012: \u00a34.9m) which included expenditure on collection storage projects, scientific equipment, security infrastructure and the completion of the Treasures in the Cadogan Gallery. Tangible and heritage fixed assets at 31 March 2013 amounted to \u00a3421.8m (2012: \u00a3447.9m) which predominantly represents land and buildings, and also includes \u00a31.9m of capitalised collections purchases. The net current assets at 31 March 2013 amounted to \u00a314.1m (2012: \u00a314.5m), including a cash balance of \u00a323.8m (2012: \u00a324.0m). This includes restricted and designated fund held for specific projects including redevelopment of the Museum's central hall and balconies, funds to meet other capital expenditure plans and significant amounts received for scientific grants, including for EU-funded projects, which will be dispersed during 2013-14. 11 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The Natural History Museum Trading Company Limited The Natural History Museum Special Funds Trust The Cockayne Trust The Benevolent Fund The Funding Agreement The Museum established a trading company, The Natural History Museum Trading Company Limited, on 1 April 1994. It comprises the activities of retailing, conferencing and banqueting, catering, brand management, the picture library, touring exhibitions, sale of animatronic models, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Competition, and consultancy. The net operating profit for 2012-13 amounted to \u00a33.7m (2012: \u00a34.1m). Profits from the Trading Company are donated to the Museum under gift aid. For 2012-2013 this amounted to \u00a33.7m (2012: \u00a34.1m). The results of the Trading Company are included in the Museum's consolidated accounts and are summarised in Note 10. The registered office of the Trading Company is at The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD. On 15 February 2000 the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales gave approval for the establishment of a scheme for the administration of a number of individual funds previously held within The Natural History Museum Special Funds. The scheme is governed by a charity known as The Natural History Museum Special Funds Trust which was established under a charitable trust deed dated 3 November 1999. The Trust has powers to apply the income of the fund to the furtherance of the work of the Natural History Museum for which provision is not made from public funds, and disbursements are made in accordance with a policy approved by the Science Executive of the Natural History Museum which takes into account the objectives of the original funds. During the year the fund received income amounting to \u00a343.0k (2012: \u00a340.5k) and incurred expenditure of \u00a318.5k (2012: \u00a363.4k). At 31 March 2013 the value of the Fund amounted to \u00a31.387m (2012: \u00a31.212m) including investments valued cash of \u00a30.102m (2012: \u00a30.078m). The Trustees of the Natural History Museum hold a collection of British lepidoptera (known as the Rothschild - Cockayne - Kettlewell collection) which consisted, in part, of a collection donated by Edward Alfred Cockayne. On 27 May 1951 a trust deed was executed, establishing the Cockayne Trust, whereby Cockayne, by means of cash investments and other donated assets, would make financial provision for the purpose of improving the collection. In addition the fund may be used for the promotion, encouragement and study of British lepidoptera and for Cockayne research fellowships. During the year the fund received income amounting to \u00a35.3k (2012 \u00a35.4k) and incurred expenditure of \u00a315.0k (2012: \u00a329.0k). At 31 March 2013 the value of the Fund amounted to \u00a3150k (2012: \u00a3140.8k) including investments valued cash of \u00a310.9k (2012: \u00a320.6k). The Benevolent Fund was established by the British Museum Trustees on 14 March 1936 having been passed to the Trustees by Dr G. E. Herbert Smith. The income from the fund is to be used \"to assist members of staff, in particular those less well paid, who may fall upon misfortune\". Assistance is usually given by way of small grants or interest free loans to members of staff. The balance of funds held at 31 March 2013 was \u00a332.2k (2012: \u00a329.9k). The Museum has a Funding Agreement with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which sets out what the Government expects the Museum to deliver for the grant-in-aid it receives. The current funding agreement was signed in May 2011, though the grant in aid allocation has subsequently been reduced. 12 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The core grant-in-aid which the Museum is to receive over the period 2011-12 to 2014-15 Policy As part of the annual planning and budget setting process the Trustees review and approve the level of readily available reserves (i.e. those funds that are not restricted or tied up as fixed assets), in particular the unrestricted General Reserve, appropriate to the scale, complexity and risk profile of the Museum. This takes into consideration the funding base which consists predominantly of grant-in-aid under the funding agreement with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and also self-generated trading income, scientific grant income and sponsorship, all of which are volatile. The level of reserves is set to provide a comfort level for shortfalls in income and to underpin cash flow and budgetary risks particularly arising from capital expenditure projects. Taking an overall view of the annual operational expenditure and level of comfort required, the Trustees have approved at their Board meeting in November 2012 a minimum level of General Fund of \u00a32.5m. At the 31 March 2013 the General Fund amounted to \u00a33.4m. Trustees also designate funds for specific projects and activities. Designations currently include funds for capital expenditure projects, and funds for scientific research which have been derived over a number of years from income from scientific activities exceeding an annual target. Investment powers The Museum's investment powers are established in its Financial Memorandum and policy with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This states that the Museum may not use grant-in-aid to make any speculative investments without prior written approval of the Department. Equity-based investments are only held by the restricted funds with the aim to achieve an appropriate balance between income generation and capital growth particular to the fund. The Museum invests cash funds identified as surplus to short term working capital requirements on short to medium term facilities in accordance with a policy approved by the Trustees. The policy addresses liquidity, credit, interest rate and procedural risk. Sustainability A sustainability report including performance data, prepared in accordance with the Greening Government commitments and the Government Financial Reporting Manual can be found at http://www.nhm.ac.uk/. Key performance data*: 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 Greenhouse gas 419 *Comparative figures for 2010-11 and 2011-12 were previously calculated based on calendar years. These have now been restated to reflect the Museum's financial year end. 13 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Payment of creditors External Auditors Disclosure of relevant audit information Oliver Stocken Chairman of the Trustees 2 July 2013 The increase in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions reflects the impact of sustained and harsh winter period, and the bringing into operation of new and improved serviced facilities and serviced collections storage areas. Specific activities undertaken and achievements during 2012-13 include: An Environmental Group, responsible for shaping the Sustainability Programme was established; Advice and guidance was received from the European Pathway to Zero Waste and the Resource Efficient Management Schemes to encourage economic and environmental benefits through reducing waste and increasing resource efficiency through procurement practices; ISO 14001 Environmental Management certification was re-awarded based on the on-going audit assessment. The Museum observes the principles of the Better Payment Practice Code in ensuring that creditors are paid within the terms of credit. The Museum policy is that creditors are paid within 30 days of invoice date unless separate arrangements have been contractually agreed. In 2012-13 in excess of 95% of creditors were paid within the agreed period (2012: in excess of 95%). The fees paid to the National Audit Office (NAO) for audit services for the Museum and Consolidated accounts which are included in Note 5 amounted to \u00a345k. The fees paid to Kingston Smith LLP for the provision of audit services for the subsidiary accounts amounted to \u00a322k. At the time of approving the financial statements: so far as the Trustees and Accounting Officer are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the external auditors are unaware; and the Trustees and Accounting Officer have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the external auditors are aware of that information.

The Executive Board is under the leadership of the Director of the Museum, who is appointed by the Board of Trustees, and who, as the Accounting Officer, is responsible to Parliament. The Executive Board reflects the functional operation of the Museum. The Trustees receive no remuneration. Service contracts Senior management appointments are made in accordance with the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code, which requires appointment to be on merit on the basis of fair and open competition but also includes the circumstances when appointments may otherwise be made. The senior management of the Museum hold appointments which are open-ended with a notice period of six months. Termination payments are in accordance with contractual terms. During the year 2012-13 there were no compensation or severance payments to senior management. Remuneration Committee The Board of Trustees has established a Remuneration Committee to support it in undertaking its responsibilities for overseeing the performance and remuneration of the Museum's senior management. In particular it oversees the performance and remuneration of the Museum Director and receives and approves recommendations from the Director with regard to the remuneration of other senior managers. The membership of the Remuneration Committee for 2012-13 comprised: Professor Alex Halliday (Chair) Daniel Alexander Louise Charlton Oliver Stocken The Director and the Director of Human Resources attend any meetings which review senior management remuneration except for discussion concerning their own pay and performance. Policy on the remuneration of senior managers for current and future financial year At the beginning of the year, senior managers are set objectives based on the Museum's strategic plan. At the end of the year they are assessed by the Director on how far they have achieved their objectives and their performance is rated accordingly. The Chairman of Trustees assesses and rates the Director's performance. All ratings are then reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. All components of senior managers' remuneration, including an incentive bonus scheme, are dependent on delivery and performance. When determining salary levels, a number of factors are taken into account: the projected budget for the annual staff settlement; salary levels internally and in the market place (through salary surveys); job size and whether this has changed over the period (through formal evaluation, where applicable); the performance and contribution of the individual over the period, assessed through performance appraisal; and issues of retention. The Director is eligible for a bonus up to a maximum of 15% of gross salary. This determined by an assessment of his performance and achievement of delivery targets carried out by the Chairman of the Trustees which is reviewed and confirmed by the Remuneration Committee. Senior management other than the Director are eligible for a bonus up to a maximum of 7.5% of their gross salary, based upon achievement of their objectives and their performance, as assessed by the Director and reviewed and confirmed by the Remuneration Committee. 16 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Salary and pension entitlements The following sections provide details of the remuneration and pension interests of the senior management of the Museum.

Salary 'Salary' includes gross salary; performance pay or bonuses paid in the year but relating to prior year performance; overtime; and any allowance to the extent that it is subject to UK taxation. This presentation is based on payments made by the Museum and thus recorded in these accounts. Benefits in kind The monetary value of benefits in kind covers any benefits provided by the employer and treated by HM Revenue and Customs as a taxable emolument. Dr Michael Dixon has use of the Lodge on the Museum's South Kensington site for accommodation. The cost of utility services provided to the Lodge are met by Dr Michael Dixon. Pay multiples Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between remuneration of the highest-paid director in their organisation and the median remuneration of the organisation's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest-paid director in the financial year 2012-13 was \u00a3180,000-\u00a3185,000 (2012: \u00a3175,000- \u00a3180,000). This was 6.4 times the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a328,302 (2012: 6.2 times the median of \u00a328,723). In 2012-13, nil employees received remuneration in excess of the highest paid director. Remuneration ranged from \u00a315,217 - \u00a3120,000 (2012: \u00a315,066 - \u00a3120,000). 17 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 T otal remuneration includes salary, non-consolidated performance-related pay, benefits in kind as well as severance payments. It does not include employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions.

For consistency the CETVs at 31/3/12 and 31/3/13 have both been calculated using the new factors. The CETV at 31/3/12 therefore differs from the corresponding figure in last year's report which was calculating using the previous factors. The above information has been subject to audit. Pension benefits are provided through the Civil Service pension arrangements. From 30 July 2007, Museum employees may be in one of four defined benefit schemes; either a 'final salary' scheme (classic, premium or classic plus); or a 'whole career' scheme (nuvos). These statutory arrangements are unfunded with the cost of benefits met by monies voted by Parliament each year. Pensions payable under classic, premium, classic plus and nuvos are increased annually in line with changes in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). Members joining from October 2002 may opt for either the appropriate defined benefit arrangement or a good quality 'money purchase' stakeholder pension with a significant employer contribution (partnership pension account). Employee contributions from 1 April 2012 increased for the majority of PCSPS members. New contributions are based on annual full-time equivalent earnings. For members of the classic scheme, the contribution rates range from 1.5% to 3.9%. For members of the classic plus, premium and nuvos schemes, the contribution rates range from 3.5% to 5.9%. Benefits in classic accrue at the rate of 1/80th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service. In addition, a lump sum equivalent to three years' pension is payable on retirement. For premium, benefits accrue at the rate of 1/60th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service. Unlike classic, there is no automatic lump sum. Classic plus is essentially a hybrid with benefits in respect of service before 1 October 2002 calculated broadly as per classic and benefits for service from October 2002 calculated as in premium. In nuvos a member builds up a pension based on his pensionable earnings during their period of scheme membership. At the end of the scheme year (31 March) the member's earned pension account is credited with 2.3% of their pensionable earnings in that scheme year and the accrued pension is uprated in line with RPI. In all cases members may opt to give up (commute) pension for lump sum up to the limits set by the Finance Act 2004. The partnership pension account is a stakeholder pension arrangement. The employer makes a basic contribution of between 3% and 12.5% (depending on the age of the member) into a stakeholder pension product chosen by the employee from a panel of three providers. The employee does not have to contribute but where they do make contributions, the employer will match these up to a limit of 3% of pensionable salary (in addition to the employer's basic contribution). Employers also contribute a further 0.8% of pensionable salary to cover the cost of centrally-provided risk benefit cover (death in service and ill health retirement). 18 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The accrued pension quoted is the pension the member is entitled to receive when they reach pension age, or immediately on ceasing to be an active member of the scheme if they are already at or over pension age. Pension age is 60 for members of classic, premium and classic plus and 65 for members of nuvos. Further details about the Civil Service pension arrangements can be found at the website www.civilservice-pensions.gov.uk Cash Equivalent Transfer Values A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is the actuarially assessed capitalised value of the pension scheme benefits accrued by a member at a particular point in time. The benefits valued are the member's accrued benefits and any contingent spouse's pension payable from the scheme. A CETV is a payment made by a pension scheme or arrangement to secure pension benefits in another pension scheme or arrangement when the member leaves a scheme and chooses to transfer the benefits accrued in their former scheme. The pension figures shown relate to the benefits that the individual has accrued as a consequence of their total membership of the pension scheme, not just their service in a senior capacity to which disclosure applies. The figures include the value of any pension benefit in another scheme or arrangement which the individual has transferred to the Civil Service pension arrangements. They also include any additional pension benefit accrued to the member as a result of their purchasing additional pension benefits at their own cost. CETVs are calculated within the guidelines and framework prescribed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and do not take account of any actual or potential reduction to benefits resulting from Lifetime Allowance Tax which may be due when pension benefits are drawn. Real increase in CETV This reflects the increase in CETV effectively funded by the employer. It does not include the increase in accrued pension due to inflation, contributions paid by the employee (including the value of any benefits transferred from another pension scheme or arrangement) and uses common market valuation factors for the start and end of the period. Other information None of the Directors held any other positions or have any business interests which represented a conflict of interest in connection with their position at the Museum. The Trustees of the Natural History Museum are not remunerated. Expenses paid are disclosed in Note 6 to the Annual Accounts. 19 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Reporting of Civil Service and other compensation schemes - exit packages 2012-13 2011-12 Total number Number Total number Number of exit Number of of other of exit Number of of other packages Exit package compulsory departures packages by compulsory departures by cost cost band redundancies agreed cost band redundancies agreed band <\u00a310,000 8 - 8 7 1 8 \u00a310,000-\u00a325,000 3 4 7 2 - 2 \u00a325,000-\u00a350,000 - 7 7 - 1 1 \u00a350,000-\u00a3100,000 - 4 4 - - - \u00a3100,000-\u00a3150,000 - 2 2 - - - Total number 11of exit packages 17 28 9 2 11 cost (\u00a3) 776,412 873,985 67,372 33,710 101,082 Oliver Stocken Dr Michael Dixon Chairman of the Trustees Director and Accounting Officer 2 July 2013 20 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Statement of Trustees' and Director's Responsibilities Under Sections 9(4) and (5) of the Museums and Galleries Act 1992, the Trustees of the Natural History Museum are required to prepare a statement of accounts for each financial year in the form and on the basis determined by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport with the consent of the Treasury. The accounts are prepared to show a true and fair view of the Museum's financial activities during the year and of its financial position at the end of the year. In preparing the Museum's accounts the Trustees are required to: comply with the Government Financial Reporting Manual; observe the accounts direction issued by the Secretary of State*, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis; make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis; state whether applicable accounting standards and statements of recommended practice have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements; and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Museum will continue in operation. The Accounting Officer for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has designated the Director as Accounting Officer for the Museum. His relevant responsibilities as Accounting Officer, including his responsibility for the propriety and regularity of the public finances for which he is answerable and for the keeping of proper records, are set out in Managing Public Money, issued by the Treasury. Oliver Stocken Dr. Michael Dixon Chairman of the Trustees Director and Accounting Officer 2 July 2013 * A copy of which is available from the Director of Finance and Corporate Services, The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD. 21 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Governance Statement The Governance Framework The Museum is governed by a Board of twelve Trustees who are appointed by the Prime Minister (8), the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on recommendation by the Royal Society (1) or co-opted by the Board of Trustees themselves (3). Those appointed by the Prime Minister or co-opted are appointed by open competition. The Board meets generally four times a year and did so during 2012-13. In addition strategy days are arranged with at least one taking place annually. The Board receives reports on a regular basis covering key performance indicators, financial performance, Science and Public Engagement activities, Audit and Risk committee, health and safety, and an annual report on security. In addition the Board approves the annual budget and future financial plan and the strategic plan, receives an annual external visiting group report on a major area of activity, usually Science based, and receives and approves major strategies and projects where appropriate. During the year the following served as Trustees: Attendance at Board Meetings 2012-13 (max 4) Oliver Stocken (Chairman) 4/4 Daniel Alexander QC 4/4 Professor Sir Roy Anderson FRS FMedSci 3/4 Louise Charlton 4/4 Professor David Drewry 4/4 Professor Christopher Gilligan 4/4 Professor Alex Halliday FRS 3/4 Ian Henderson CBE FRICS ( retired 2 February 2013 ) 2/3 Professor Sir John Holman 4/4 Dr Derek Langslow CBE 4/4 Professor Georgina Mace CBE FRS ( retired 5 August 2012 ) 1/2 Sir David Omand GCB 4/4 Kim Winser OBE (appointed 18 February 2013 ) 1/1 Trustees are initially appointed for a four year period and can serve a second equal term before standing down. All Trustees attend a one day induction and training course, and are issued with documents relating to the Museum's corporate governance framework. There are four sub-committees of the Board of Trustees as follows: The Audit and Risk Committee generally meets four times a year to receive reports on risk management and internal control issues from the Risk and Assurance unit, and matters arising from external audits, and to review progress on the implementation of recommendations. The Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee reports any matters arising directly to the Board. The Remuneration Committee generally meets once a year to review performance and consider performance related pay for the Museum Director and other members of the Executive Board (see Remuneration Report). The Nominations Committee meets as required to consider and make recommendations for Trustee appointments and met to make two such recommendations during 2012-13. The Estates and Buildings Advisory Committee was established during 2012-13. It will meet four times a year to provide advice on the long term management and development of the Museum's estate. The Board carries out an externally facilitated review of its performance and effectiveness every three years with an internal self-assessment carried out in intervening years. An external review was carried out during 22 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 2012-13 which concluded that the Board operates very effectively, yet made some recommendations in relation to future governance. A response to the recommendations and an action plan is being developed. Scope of responsibility As the Board of Trustees and the Accounting Officer, we have responsibility for ensuring that the Natural History Museum has a sound system of internal control that: supports the achievement of the aims and objectives of the Natural History Museum; and safeguards the assets and public funds for which the Accounting Officer is personally responsible in accordance with the responsibilities assigned in Managing Public Money and specifically in the Management Statement and Financial Memorandum between the Museum and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In practice the Trustees will normally delegate responsibility to the Accounting Officer for the day to day management of all operational activities, which support the system of internal control. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate risks to the achievement of aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on a process designed to identify the principal risks, to evaluate the nature and extent of the risks, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. This process has been in place throughout the year ended 31 March 2013 and up to the date of signature of the accounts. The risk management, risk profile, capacity to handle risk and the risk environment The Museum has a risk management policy which sets out the attitude to risk, and responsibilities including those of the Trustees, the Director, the Head of Risk and Assurance, managers and staff, and the Executive Board which has overall responsibility for risk management during the year. Specifically the Executive Board has responsibility for: developing and monitoring the implementation of the risk management strategy; assessing, reviewing and monitoring the key inherently significant and emerging risks to the achievement of aims and objectives. Additionally, the Executive Board has responsibility for overall strategy development and implementation, and for overall Museum management. A risk profile, highlighting the key risks is prepared annually by the Executive Board, taking account of departmental and project based risk registers as well as museum wide risks and the external environment, and is presented to and endorsed by the Board of Trustees. At the detailed level, responsibility for each key risk is allocated to managers as risk owners, and the risk owners are required to report quarterly to the Executive Board on the progress of action taken to manage these risks. The Director reports progress in managing the risks to the Audit and Risk Committee, and significant changes and developments in the risk profile including new risks are reported to both the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Trustees. The current major risks being managed include the possibility that: Further cuts in grant in aid for 2013-14 and beyond results in the need to make major reductions in programme expenditure; External funding of science is harder to win and reduces our scientific research activity; Suitably skilled web, IT and scientific staff cannot be recruited or retained as a consequence of uncompetitive pay rates; A failure to develop the Museum's digital capacity and presence in the virtual world results in loss of scientific competitiveness, public reputation or commercial opportunity; 23 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The process of implementing the new finance system may impact upon operational activity; In the event of a major incident affecting the Museum the absence of a purposely fitted out offsite facility will delay recovery; Change management and unplanned senior management changes may impact upon the smooth operation of the Museum. In addition the Museum has an assurance framework to manage long term inherent risks, including those relating to security, fire, and health and safety, collections care, fraud, failure of estate infrastructure and long term financial planning. Comprehensive guidance has been produced and widely disseminated on risk awareness and risk management, and a robust risk assessment methodology has been implemented. The Directors and managers are responsible for assessing risk appetite, using a framework of key documents including Financial Regulations, Collections Management guidelines, Procurement Manual, the Staff Handbook and Health and Safety guidelines. Significant internal control improvements during the year A number of specific actions have occurred during the year which have strengthened the internal control framework and helped in the managing of the major and inherent risks: continuing development of the business continuity plan including carrying out a real time crisis management exercise; continuing investment in museum wide security infrastructure and further embedding of physical security systems and processes; OHSAS 18001 certification was re-achieved for the occupational health and safety management; IS0 14001 was re-secured for the environmental management ; refresher training for museum managers and key staff on key museum policies, including fraud awareness and prevention, has taken place; further implementation of the security protocol framework in line with Cabinet Office requirements. Significant internal control matters arising the during year There were no significant control matters which occurred during the year. Risks to data and information Risks to data and information held by the Museum are owned and managed by individuals, responsible as information asset owners, and there is a Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) responsible for the information risk policy and risk assessment, and for ensuring that the Museum complies with the Cabinet Office protocols it has assessed as being appropriate for the management of information risk. There were no sensitive personal data incidents during the year, which required reporting to the Information Commissioner. Review of effectiveness We have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control and this review for 2012-13 has been informed by the work of the Museum's Risk and Assurance Unit including the review of the controls in place for effective management of information risk and: (a) the Health and Safety manager's annual report to Trustees and the minutes of the Health and Safety committee meetings; (b) the Annual Security Report to Trustees, including information risk management and assurance; (c) comments made by the external auditors in their management letter. 24 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 We have been advised on the implications of the result of our review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board of Trustees and the Audit and Risk Committee, and mechanisms to ensure continuous improvement are in place. The Risk and Assurance Unit is responsible for examining and reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management, control and governance processes. It takes a risk based approach to audits and focuses on the major corporate risks to the achievement of the Museum's strategic objectives. The unit works to an audit and risk strategy and annual audit plan approved by the Audit and Risk Committee and operating to the Public Sector Internal Audit Standards. The purpose of the audit and risk strategy is to put in place an approach and annual audit plan that will enable the Head of Risk & Assurance to deliver an overall opinion each year to the Museum Director (Accounting Officer) on the whole of the Museum's risk management, control and governance processes in order to inform and support the preparation of the annual Governance Statement. The annual report on audit activity, which includes the Head of Risk and Assurance's opinion is considered by the Audit and Risk Committee and presented to the Board of Trustees. The effectiveness of the Museum's Risk and Assurance Unit was reviewed during the year by the Audit and Risk Committee. It was concluded that the work of the Unit provided comprehensive annual assurance to the Audit and Risk Committee and that the work of the Unit was of a high standard. Oliver Stocken Dr . Michael Dixon Chairman of the Trustees Director and Accounting Officer 2 July 2013 25 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 THE CERTIFICATE AND REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL TO THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT I certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Natural History Museum for the year ended 31 March 2013 under the Museums and Galleries Act 1992. The financial statements comprise: the Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities, the Consolidated and Museum Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out within them. I have also audited the information in the Remuneration Report that is described in that report as having been audited. Respective responsibilities of the Trustees, the Director and auditor As explained more fully in the Statement of Trustees' and Director's Responsibilities, the Trustees and the Director are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. My responsibility is to examine, certify and report on the financial statements in accordance with the Museums and Galleries Act 1992. I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require me and my staff to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Natural History Museum's and the group's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Natural History Museum; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition I read all the financial and non-financial information in the Trustees' Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If I become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies I consider the implications for my certificate. I am required to obtain evidence sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the expenditure and income recorded in the financial statements have been applied to the purposes intended by Parliament and the financial transactions recorded in the financial statements conform to the authorities which govern them. Opinion on regularity In my opinion, in all material respects the expenditure and income recorded in the financial statements have been applied to the purposes intended by Parliament and the financial transactions recorded in the financial statements conform to the authorities which govern them.

The accounts comply with the requirements of the Government Financial Reporting Manual, the Statement of Recommended Practice 2005 on 'Accounting by Charities' and applicable accounting standards as modified by the Accounts Direction given by the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, with the approval of H.M.Treasury. Consolidated accounts have been prepared for the Museum which include the Grant-in-aid account, trust funds administered by the Museum, and its subsidiary company, The Natural History Museum Trading Company. They do not include accounts for the American Friends of the Natural History Museum which is a fund raising organisation based in the USA, nor do they include The Natural History Museum Development Trust which is based in the UK, both of which are run by separate and independent trustee bodies. Incoming resources All income is accounted for on a receivable basis and is net of Value Added Tax. Grant-in-aid from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is shown in its entirety in the Statement of Financial Activities. Grant-in-aid for specific projects or activities is credited to Restricted Funds and all other Grant-in-aid income is credited to General Funds. However, within the Statement of Funds (Note 17), Grant-in-aid income allocated to capital expenditure other than specific projects is transferred from General Funds to Unrestricted Designated Funds and Grant-in-aid income allocated to acquisitions for the collection is transferred from General Funds to Restricted Funds. Grants and other income that are awarded subject to specific performance conditions, including scientific grants and income from the Heritage Lottery Fund, are recognised when the performance conditions for their receipt have been met and, where appropriate, income is deferred accordingly. Donations in kind, including donated collections are recognised when received and valued at their value to the Museum. Donations of unquoted shares are recognised only when a value can be attributed with reasonable certainty, either on sale or on floatation on a recognised stock market. The contribution of volunteers is excluded from the Statement of Financial Activities as the value of their contribution cannot be reasonably quantified in financial terms. Expenditure All expenditure is accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenditure has been classified according to the main activities of the Museum and aggregates all costs related to each activity. Where costs cannot be directly attributed to particular activities they have been allocated on a basis consistent with the use of resources. Support costs are allocated according to the number of permanent staff directly employed in each activity as an appropriate measure of the use of these resources by activity. Costs of generating voluntary income include all costs associated with the development of the museum's non-scientific income and in particular, support the generation of donations, income from trading activities, admissions, membership and sponsorship. No meaningful allocation of this expenditure across these income sources is possible. Governance costs are the costs associated with the governance arrangements of the charity and are made up of internal audit, external audit and Trustees' costs. 32 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Fund accounting The Museum's accounts are a consolidation of a number of individual funds which divide into distinct categories which are defined as follows: Unrestricted funds general The general funds consist of the accumulated surplus or deficit on the Statement of Financial Activities. They are available for use at the discretion of the Trustees in furtherance of the general objectives of the Museum. Unrestricted funds designated These funds comprise funds which have been set aside at the discretion of the Trustees for specific purposes. They consist mainly of the following: Special Funds - a collection of funds which have arisen from various legacies and donations, largely held as investments, the income from which is used for scientific purposes. Capital Projects - expenditure funded from non restricted sources which has been capitalised. Future Scientific Research - a fund set aside from income derived from the Museum's scientific activities to be used to fund research. Darwin Centre Phase Two - monies set aside from non-restricted sources at the discretion of the trustees to fund the construction of Darwin Centre Phase Two. This includes the proceeds of disposal of land and buildings that are retained by the Museum with the permission of HM Treasury to fund capital projects. Future Projects - monies set aside to fund agreed projects during the next financial year, not funded out of income expected to be generated in that year. Restricted funds These funds are subject to specific restriction imposed by the donor, by the purpose of an appeal or are received for a specific purpose. They consist mainly of the following: Scientific Grants - grant awards for specific scientific projects. Sponsored Assets - buildings and collections which have been funded at least in part by sponsorship or donations. Equipment Reserve - a fund established for replacement of the telephone exchange and the boiler - see Note 1 (shared services) and Note 17. Permanent endowment funds These comprise funds donated on condition that the original funds be held permanently by the Museum, although the constituent assets may change. Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land and collection items, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, les over its expected useful life as follows: s estimated residual value, on a straight line basis for each asset Freehold buildings - between 15 and 100 years depending on the building. Plant and machinery - between 5 and 20 years depending upon the nature of the asset. Permanent Exhibitions - 20 years Equipment IT equipment - between 3 and 20 years depending on the nature of the asset Scientific equipment - 5,10,15 or 20 years Furniture and Fittings - between 4 and 20 years depending on the nature of the asset Vehicles - between 5 and 10 years depending on the nature of the asset Tangible fixed assets are reviewed annually for evidence of impairments of value and, where there is evidence that recoverable value has fallen below carrying value, a calculation of the recoverable value is made. Any 33 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 excess of the carrying value over the recoverable value is written off, either within depreciation in the Statement of Financial Affairs, or to the revaluation reserve to the extent that it relates to a previously revalued asset. Including assets at their value to the business by reference to current costs is achieved as follows: Land and Buildings - by external professional valuation at least every five years and using appropriate indices in the intervening periods. Exhibitions are not revalued but are stated at historic depreciated cost. Equipment/Furniture and Fittings' - indexation by appropriate indices. Equipment/Furniture and Fittings are not revalued but are stated at depreciated indexed value as at 1 April 2011. Tangible fixed assets with an original cost of under \u00a35,000 are written off in the year of acquisition. Capital expenditure on permanent exhibitions includes only the cost of materials and externally contracted services. No allocations are made of related internal labour costs. Heritage assets The Museum's collections which are assets of historical and scientific importance held to advance the Museum's scientific and educational objectives and, through public access, contribute to the nation's culture and education, are recognised as heritage assets in accordance with FRS 30 (Heritage Assets) which requires such assets to be reported in the balance sheet where information is available on cost or value. Prior to the financial year 2001/02 these assets were not capitalised, reliable cost information is not available and conventional valuation approaches lack sufficient reliability, with the cost of providing such information unaffordable and unmanageable, and deemed to outweigh the benefits to the users. Accordingly these assets are not capitalised in the balance sheet. However, since 1 April 2001 collections acquisitions in excess of the capitalisation threshold of \u00a35,000 have been capitalised at acquisition value, and treated as non depreciable heritage assets in the balance sheet. A description of the collections, their management and developments in the year are given in Note 8. Investments Investments are stated at market value. It is the Museum's policy to keep valuations up to date such that when investments are sold there is no accounting gain or loss arising. As a result the Statement of Financial Activities only includes those unrealised gains and losses arising from the revaluation of the investment portfolio throughout the year. Market value is taken to be the middle market price ruling at the balance sheet date. Financial instruments The Museum does not hold any complex financial instruments. The only financial instruments included in the accounts are cash, investments, receivables and payables (Notes 12,13 and 15). Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is made when there is evidence that the Museum will be unable to collect an amount due in accordance with agreed terms. Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost price or net realisable value and consist of goods for resale and work in progress. Leases The Museum has no finance leases. Costs in relation to operating leases are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities over the life of the lease. Forward liabilities are disclosed in Note 16. 34 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate at the time of the transaction. All exchange differences are taken to the Statement of Financial Activities. Taxation The charitable activities of the Museum are exempt from corporation tax. Profits from trading activities within the trading subsidiary are subject to corporation tax to the extent that they are not paid to the Museum by gift aid. The Museum and its subsidiaries are registered for value added tax and have agreed a scheme for recovery of certain proportions of VAT on expenditure. Subscriptions Subscriptions for the purchase of scientific periodicals are treated as expenditure in the period in which the final commitment to a subscription is placed. This may be in advance of the period in which actual delivery occurs. Pension costs The operating costs of providing retirement benefits are recognised in the accounting periods in which the benefits are earned by the employees, and the related costs and changes in value of the assets and liabilities are recognised in the accounting period in which they arise. Staff of the Museum are employed under the same conditions of service as civil servants to whom the conditions of the Superannuation Acts 1965 and 1972 and subsequent amendments apply. Present and past employees are covered by the provisions of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS), which is unfunded, and within which the Natural History Museum is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets/liabilities. Although the scheme is a defined benefit scheme, liability for the payment of future benefits is a charge to the PCSPS. The Museum, and other bodies covered by the PCSPS, meet the cost of the pension cover provided for the staff they employ by payment of charges calculated on an accruing basis. There is a separate scheme statement for the PCSPS as a whole. The Museum is required to meet the cost of benefits beyond the normal PCSPS benefits in respect of employees who retire early. The Museum provides in full for this cost when the early retirement has been announced and is binding on the Museum. Provision for shared services During 2012-13 the Museum supplied electricity and heating to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and telephone services to the Science Museum. The costs of these supplies are recharged on a not-for-profit basis. Each type of supply is accounted for separately and is ring-fenced within the accounts. The funds accumulated for the replacement of the facilities are shown as restricted funds titled Equipment Reserve. Contributions to and releases from the Equipment Reserve are shown in the Statement of Financial Activities, Restricted Funds and Note 17. 2 Grant-in-aid 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Department for Culture, Media Capital 46,480 45,760 46,480 Grant-in-aid income credited to General Funds is available for running costs, capital improvements and collection purchases. 35 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 3 Trading activities income 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Brand Management 115 154 Retail 7,089 6,876 Catering and Functions 3,929 3,470 Exhibitions consultancy 230 441 Touring Exhibitions 1,224 1,369 Robotic model sales 679 1,022 Other 1,973 1,818 15,239 15,150 This reconciles to the Trading Company income in Note 10 as follows: Trading subsidiary turnover 14,892 14,764 Less: Science consultancy (included in Scientific grants and contracts) (1,137) (857) Commercial sponsorship (200) (230) Add: Other trading activities income (Museum income) 1,684 1,473 15,239 15,150 4 Investment income and other income 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Income from UK equities 28 27 Income from other investments 21 19 Bank interest 59 61 108 107 Other income Rentals 207 125 Other 562 410 769 535 Investment income is shown inclusive of tax credits reclaimed in the year. 5 Net outgoing resources before transfers 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 is stated after crediting: Scientific grants from the European Union 1,755 1,645 and after charging: Expenditure in respect of scientific grants from the European Union 1,755 1,645 Auditors' remuneration - Museum auditors Museum audit 45 49 Auditors' remuneration - subsidiaries auditors Trading Company audit 20 21 Special Funds audit 2 2 other services 2 2 Hire of plant and machinery 1,180 452 Travel, subsistence and hospitality 1,448 1,414 Depreciation 12,646 12,553 Incoming resources of the Museum were \u00a359,490,000 (2012: \u00a360,863,000). 36 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 6 Total resources expended Activities Grant undertaken funding of Support Total Total directly activities costs 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Costs of - 5,127 10,105 9,118 Fundraising trading: cost of goods sold and other costs 11,097 - - 11,097 10,595 3,206 11,263 10,560 Capital grant payment - 2,500 - 2,500 3,500 Governance 138 - 244 382 415 Loss on disposal of fixed assets 10 - - 10 11 55,764 2,500 23,915 82,179 80,490 Costs of generating voluntary income include all costs associated with the development of the Museum's non-scientific income and in particular, support the generation of donations, income from trading activities, admissions, membership and sponsorship.

In addition there were early retirement costs of \u00a386,000 written back in 2012-13 against the 2011-12 provision of \u00a31,187,000. Present and past employees are covered by the provisions of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS). The PCSPS is an unfunded multi-employer defined benefit scheme but the Museum is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities. The scheme actuary valued the scheme as at 31 March 2007. Details are available in the resource accounts of the Cabinet Office: Civil Superannuation www.civilservice-pensions.gov.uk The scheme's actuary reviews employer contributions usually every four years following a full scheme valuation. During 2012-13, the rates were in the range 16.7% to 24.3%. The contribution rates are set to meet the cost of the benefits accruing during 2012-13 to be paid when the member retires and not the benefits paid during this period to existing pensioners. Employees joining after 1 October 2002 may opt to open a partnership pension account, a stakeholder pension with an employer contribution. The Chairman and Board of Trustees received no remuneration for their services during the year (2012: nil). Travel and subsistence expenses of \u00a33,685 (2012: \u00a33,435) were reimbursed to seven (2012: five) Trustees. The Remuneration of the senior management of the Museum, including details of bonuses and pensions, are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 16 to 20. The following number of senior employees, including the senior management, received remuneration falling within the ranges below: 2013 2012 \u00a3180,000 - \u00a3190,000 1 - \u00a3170,001 - \u00a3180,000 - 1 \u00a3110,001 - \u00a3120,000 2 2 \u00a390,001 - \u00a3100,000 1 2 \u00a380,001 - \u00a390,000 3 1 \u00a370,001 - \u00a380,000 10 9 \u00a360,001 - \u00a370,000 9 13 The total pensi ons contributions payable for the senior employees included above, all of whom were members of the PCSPS, were \u00a3442,716 (2012: \u00a3474,755).

The freehold interest in the South Kensington site was transferred to the Trustees by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in August 2001. In accordance with Treasury Guidance all land and building assets are revalued at least quiquenially on a depreciated replacement cost basis and indexed using indices from professional sources in the intervening years. The most recent valuation was performed by Gerald Eve, Chartered Surveyors, as at 31 March 2009, in accordance with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual (the red book). 39 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The professional valuations at 31 March 2009 were as follows: Value Property 31 March 2009 Basis of Valuation \u00a3000 The Natural History Museum, Land at market rate for restricted use, South Kensington 395,250 buildings at depreciated replacement cost Natural History Museum Land at market rate for restricted use, at Tring 12,050 buildings at depreciated replacement cost Residential properties, Tring 1,790 Existing use basis Premises at Kimber Road, Existing use basis and depreciated Wandsworth, London 8,300 replacement cost. Freehold purchase 1991. At 31 March 2009 the valuers were of the opinion that the valuation of the premises at Kimber Road, Wandsworth, at market value for general storage and distribution would be significantly lower than the valuation at existing use value, reflecting specialist adaptions for the storage of Museum collections at the property. The specialist adaptions are not likely to have any value for a prospective purchaser. The valuers have stated their opinion that the market value of the main museum site at South Kensington would be significantly lower than the depreciated replacement cost value reported because of the restrictive covenants contained in the Museum's title. For all other properties, the valuers considered that the difference between market value and the stated value would not be significant. No indexation has been applied to Fixture and fittings, equipment assets and permanent exhibitions as management consider that there is no material difference between current cost and actual cost. The life of these assets is reviewed annually to reflect their true value. 40 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 The current cost depreciation shown above is charged in the Statement of financial Activities (page 28) as follows: Historic cost depreciation included in Total resources expended 12,646 12,553 Depreciation arising on indexation of assets included in (losses)/gains on indexation and revaluation of fixed assets for charity's own use (135) 114 12,511 12,667 2013 2012 \u00a3000 \u00a3000 (Losses)/gains on indexation and revaluation of fixed assets shown above is recognised in the Statement of Financial Activities as follows: Revaluation value (20,625) 5,765 Prior year depreciation adjustment arising from revaluation 1,885 (379) Current year depreciation adjustment arising from revaluation 135 (114) (18,605) 5,272 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Museum Assets under Furniture Land & Plant & construc- Permanent & Buildings Machinery tion Exhibitions 155 859 - 4,697 Disposals - - - - - (585) - (585) Revaluation (15,181) (5,444) - - - - - (20,625) Transfers in/(out) Balance 76 116 (329) - - 137 - - 31 March 2013 348,769 73,985 3,405 36,408 11,552 19,873 4 493,996 Charge for year Disposals Revaluation Balance 11,373 3,814 - (890) 12,609 4,094 - - - - - 21,838 1,901 - - 6,870 900 - - 12,200 1,685 (585) - 3 - - - 64,893 12,394 (585) (1,885) 31 March 2013 Net 15,708 - 23,739 7,770 13,300 3 2013 \u00a3000 Group 2012 \u00a3000 Museum 2013 \u00a3000 Museum 2012 \u00a3000 Net book value at 1 April 2012 Additions in year 1,852 95 1,522 330 1,852 95 1,522 330 Net book value at 31 March 2013 1,947 1,852 1,947 1,852 Valuation As stated in Note 1 the Museum has only capitalised expenditure since 1 April 2001 for acquisitions in excess of the capitalisation threshold of \u00a35,000. They have been capitalised at acquisition value, and treated as non depreciable heritage assets in the balance sheet. The total number of collection items which have been capitalised amount to less than 1% of the Museum's total collection. Scope of the collections The life and earth science collections of the Museum are comprised of over 76 million specimens or items. These collections cover virtually all groups of animals, plants, rocks, meteorites, minerals and fossils. They represent the natural variation that exists within and between groups. The foundation collections were those of Sir Hans Sloane, which formed the basis of the British Museum in 1753. These scientific collections are complemented by the collections of the Museum's Library. Brief summary details of the collections of each of the Museum's five science departments and the Library are given below. Botany The botanical collection comprises an estimated 6 million specimens including seed plants, pollens and spores, ferns and lycophytes, bryophytes, diatoms, algae, lichens and slime moulds, and is one of the most comprehensive collections in the world. 41 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013Collections are worldwide in origin with around 10% from the British Isles. The collections span a period from the 16th century to the present and include a number of historically important collections such as those of Sir Hans Sloane, Sir Joseph Banks and Charles Darwin. Most collections are arranged systematically, some alphabetically and important historical collections such as the Sloane Herbarium are kept as separate entities. Entomology The entomological collections comprise an estimated 32 million prepared specimens including insects and other terrestrial and freshwater arthropods including spiders, mites and myriapods. * They include named representatives of about half of the more than one million described species. The collections are worldwide in origin and contain approximately 10% from the British Isles. The oldest specimens were collected in around 1680, but the major part of the material is of 20th century origin. The collections are arranged systematically with the exception of two important historical collections of Sir Hans Sloane and Sir Joseph Banks, which are kept as separate entities. * A prepared specimen is usually an individual, often adult, mounted on a pin, but it can be a microscope slide preparation (of a part, or a whole, or several individuals), or one or a sample of a species in a vial of alcohol, or the work of an insect (such as a leaf mine, a nest or a wood boring). Mineralogy The mineralogical collection comprised approximately half a million specimens and consists of four main elements: minerals, including gems, (about 180,000 specimens), rocks, including building stones and ocean bottom deposits, (about 180,000 specimens), meteorites (about 3,000 specimens) and ores (about 30,000 specimens). The collection contains examples of about two thirds of all known mineral species, is worldwide in coverage and has a particular strength in British and European classical material and in specimens from Commonwealth countries. The collections span a period from 1753 to present day. The mineral and economic collections have been greatly enhanced by the incorporation of the substantial collections of the British Geological Survey in 1985 The minerals collection is arranged systematically with the exception of the Russell Collection of British Minerals and the Ashcroft Swiss collection which have specific terms of bequest to be kept as separate entities. Palaeontology The paleontological collections comprise approximately 9 million specimens including microfossils, macro- invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. The geographical range is worldwide, with British material predominant and well represented, and extensive foreign material, especially from ex-colonial areas, and regions of economic importance. The collections are arranged systematically. Zoology The zoological collections comprise some 29 million specimens, housed at South Kensington, Tring and Wandsworth. They include a remarkable diversity of material from whales to protists, prepared as wet or dry preserved specimens, frozen tissue samples, or mounted on slides. The range of the collections is worldwide. The bulk of the collections were assembled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but they also include some 16th century and much modern material. The collection is arranged where possible in systematic order. 42 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 Library and Information services The Museum's Library houses over 1 million items, the World's largest collection of natural history literature and art, ranging from 1469 to the present day. The collection has a comprehensive coverage of most aspects of natural history and is international in content. Where possible it is arranged in systematic order. In addition more than 4 million documents are preserved in the Archives, providing a unique resource of the institution's \"corporate memory\" containing a record of its activities and interaction with the world of natural history since the late 18th Century to the present day. The archives include manuscripts, typescripts, correspondence, photographs, artwork and printed ephemera. The Museum is recognised by the National Archives as a place of deposit for the records it creates. Preservation of materials and preservation standards In broad terms, the science collections use three main ways of preservation: dry (usually pressed, pinned, boxed, slides, articulated skeletons, disarticulated skeletons, study skins or mounted), in fluid (primarily in alcohol, as Industrial Methylated Spirit), or at extreme low temperatures (for example, in freezers at -80 deg C). The preservation of items in the collections is influenced by practical considerations and contemporary developments. The Museum is always open to new possibilities of exploiting information in specimens and the need to develop and exploit new methods of preservation. For example, cryopreservation, at extremely low temperatures, is increasingly being used for tissue samples and whole specimens, in order to preserve DNA and other bio-molecules. The Museum does not maintain any cultures of live organisms as part of its permanent collections. The Museum, however, does maintain such cultures as part of on-going, long-term research programmes. The Museum aims to preserve its paper-based collections in the best environmental conditions it can achieve, aspiring to BS5454 provisions for its archives and manuscript collections wherever possible. The Museum meets the government-endorsed standard expected of museums in the UK, as it is a Registered Museum under the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) Registration/Accreditation Scheme which following the disbandment of the MLA in 2011 this scheme is now managed by the Arts Council. Collections management policy The Museum has a comprehensive series of policies covering all aspects of the collections and their management. They set the tone and framework for ensuring that the institution acts legally and ethically whilst aspiring to the highest professional standards. These are currently available upon written request whilst we undertake a review in light of regulation and legislation changes related to Access and Benefit sharing. Of particular importance for this report are the Acquisition Policy, Audit Policy and Inventory Control, Deaccession, Disposal and Dispersal Policy, Valuation Control Policy and Loan Policies. Disposal is only permitted within the limits of British Museum Act (1963), Museums & Galleries Act (1992), Human Tissue Act (2004), Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009 and the NHM Deaccession, Disposal and Dispersal Policy and any money raised must be used to purchase items to be added to the collection. Access to the Collections Increasing access to the collections whether physically or virtually is one of the highest priorities for the Museum. The Museum is actively working towards greater access to its collections by providing opportunities to use, enjoy and learn from collections. The opening of the second phase of the Darwin Centre in September 2009 enabled increased public engagement with both the Museums science and collections. Over 27,000 specimens are on public display and the Museum welcomed over 5.1 million visitors to its public galleries during 2012-13. 43 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 On average more than 7,000 scientific researchers spend 15-20,000 research days per year in the Museum's facilities. Many collections are now available via searchable on-line databases accessed via the NHM website http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/collections/search/index.jsp?mode=collections. Significant developments during 2012-13 During the year approximately \u00a343,000 was spent on collections purchases, below the capitalisation threshold, including a collection of insects from Central America; a variety of rare and new mineral species and a slab of Dikelocephalina trilobites. Additionally \u00a394,500 was spent on acquisitions that have been added to the assets register, these include an example of the mineral Wurtzite from Tanzania; a specimen of Rhinopteraspis dunensis an exceptionally well preserved fossil fish from Germany; an Ankylosaur dinosaur from the UK; the Voriek long-horn beetle collection and a collection of 15,000 beetles from Laos. Progress was made with Collections Storage Infrastructure Programme (CSIP) with completion of the quarantine facilities at South Kensington. The new Archives store was completed and brought into use in April 2013. Further design has been completed on the Quarantine and Large Vertebrate Preparation Facility at Wandsworth and a revised budget approved. Build is due to start in May/June 2013 with completion by November 2013. Feasibility studies for a new Earth Science Centre and reviewing options for storage of collections across the museum have commenced. During 2012-13 the Museum committed to return the human remains of 148 individuals to Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawai'i Nei on behalf of the Hawaiian people. This return is undertaken through provisions in the Human Tissue Act 2004. The date of the formal handover of the remains is still being agreed with the community but is likely to be during 2013-2014.

Interest was achieved generally on investments to within 0.25% of UK base rate or to within 0.6% of the European Central Bank refinancing rate at the time of deposit. Cash may only be invested with financial institutions which have adequate credit ratings in accordance with the Museum's Investment Policy, and the maximum aggregate deposit with any counterparty other than the Government Banking Service is limited to the lower of 25% of total funds available for investment or \u00a35 million. In the event of financial failure at a financial institution at which the Museum holds term deposits, the Museum would be exposed to the risk of losing the investments. 14 Cash held for third parties Included in the cash balances (Note 13) are funds which the Museum holds on behalf of third parties. These funds arise where the Museum acts as lead manager on grants, receiving funds from the grantor and distributing them to participants over the life of the funded projects. The funds are held separately from Museum assets where specified by the grantor and invested in money market deposits in accordance with the Museum's investment policy (see Note 13).

The transfer from General Funds - Restricted Funds: Sponsored assets reflects the decision to fund past expenditure on the development of the Learning Centre from the Museum's own resources. The transfer from General Funds - Restricted Funds: Equipment reserve reflects the energy savings made as part of the Museum's Total Gas Limited contract (note 23). The transfers to and from General Funds - Designated: Projects/Other Activities represents departmental budgets carried forward for future projects and activities. The transfer from General Funds - Designated: Future Scientific Research reflects the decision of the Trustees to fund future scientific research from the Museum's own resources. 48 Natural History Museum Annual Report and Accounts 2012-2013 The transfer from General Funds - Designated: Future projects reflects monies set aside to fund projects approved by the Trustees for the financial year 2013-14, not funded by revenues expected to be generated in that year.

Under this scheme the Museum bears the costs of these benefits until the normal retiring age. Provision is made for these costs in the year of retirement of the employee and released annually to cover payments made until the employee reaches normal retiring age. The provision covers a period to 2021. The Museum employs a number of staff on fixed term appointments, the end date of which is usually determined by a funding agreement for the post. Under employment legislation, the Museum is liable to pay redundancy costs on the termination of these appointments unless the appointment is extended or alternative employment is offered. Provision is made for these costs when the contract is within 3 months of its termination and there is no reasonable certainty that the contract will be extended or replaced. The equipment reserve provision relates to an excess energy savings pool which is derived from the energy services contracts. The provision is available to be released to the Museum to underpin any shortfall in the energy savings which the contractor is required to deliver each year over the life of the contract.
