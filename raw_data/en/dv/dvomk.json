Neely Traditional Academy was founded in 1999, leading the way in Traditional Academy education in the Valley. In 2018 Gilbert Public Schools added two more K-6 Traditional programs to improve access to Traditional education for our families living in the eastern and southern areas of our District. Spectrum and Canyon Rim families can now choose between a Traditional curriculum and classroom structure or the existing conventional curriculum and classroom structure offered at Canyon Rim, Spectrum, and our other elementary schools in Gilbert Public Schools. What is Traditional? In the Traditional classroom, the desks all face the front of the room, and the curriculum is delivered primarily through whole group instruction led by qualified teachers. The ELA curriculum in Traditional is Spalding K-6. Spalding focuses on precise speech, legible handwriting, spelling and fluency in reading. Teachers model, coach and provide support when needed. The curriculum is structured, sequential and cumulative. The Math curriculum emphasizes concept mastery. Students learn mathematical concepts at an increasingly deep level, and it results in their ability to apply mathematics with mastery and confidence. In this program, Math is taught one grade level above. Traditional homework will meet or exceed our usual GPS homework requirements, and there will be additional reading time of 15-30 minutes related to an Accelerated Reading program. - Student learning is reported through achievement grades.
