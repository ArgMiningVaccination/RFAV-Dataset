Our body usually protects itself from invading organisms with a set of proteins, blood cells and other defenses which work together to form the immune system. Whenever we encounter something which our immune system perceives as foreign, it goes into its defensive action by producing antibodies and other proteins to help fight the invaders off. This \"immunologic response\" is fairly constant and no matter what triggers it, once it is turned on the consequences are very predictable. When we get a common cold, our immune system recognizes the invading virus and steps up its efforts to kill the virus infecting us. The infection typically lasts a few days and as our body clears the virus, the immune system cools down and the cold's symptoms gradually disappear.Sometimes, these same symptoms appear, but drag on and on for weeks or even months. We think we have a cold, but it just won't go away. This happens when our immune system gets tricked. It thinks it's fighting a foreign invader; but instead of a virus, it's reacting to something harmless - like pollen, dust or mold.The term allergy is used to describe the situation in which something which is harmless to most people causes a different reaction in the affected person.You would benefit from seeing an allergist - a doctor qualified to treat and specializing in taking care of patients with allergy, asthma and other related medical conditions.Allergy Testing, Diagnosis and Treatment If you think you might have an allergy because of symptoms such as hay fever, asthma, headaches, or skin rashes, you would benefit from seeing an allergist.An allergist is a doctor with special medical qualification and training in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies. When you see an allergist , the first step in your allergy evaluation will be to gather as much information as possible about your medical condition. Next, a physical exam will be performed and when allergies are suspected, specific tests can be done to find out exactly what kind of allergies you have.Testing can be done rapidly and efficiently and for many patients the results of the testing can be obtained on that first visit. Using the information from the allergy testing, you and your doctor can immediately start working on a treatment plan to help bring your allergy symptoms under control.Most treatment plans include techniques for avoiding exposure to the allergy causing substances and learning to use medication to prevent symptoms from occurring in the first place or to give quick relief of symptoms when they do occur. In some patients a program of immunization through allergy vaccinations can also be very helpful.Asthma Evaluation and Treatment Asthma occurs when the bronchial tubes which carry air into our lungs become swollen, inflamed and go into spasm.People with asthma often experience tightness in the chest, difficulty taking a deep breath, wheezing or coughing. Asthma is frequently caused by an allergy to some substance such as pollen, animals, dust, or eating certain foods. Sometimes infections can set off an asthma attack; as can tobacco smoke, strong odors, air pollution or even changes in the weather.Asthma is very common and is responsible for many days of missed school and missed work. Asthma symptoms can usually be brought under control so that you can live a normal life with very little interference from your asthma. The three basic ways to treat asthma include avoiding what causes it, using medicine to prevent asthma flare-ups and using other medications to give quick relief when asthma symptoms occur.
