In 2021, AdventHealth had a record level of proactive and reactive media engagement with national and local media. At a time when our communities needed reliable health information and COVID -19 dominated headlines, AdventHealth's experts across the system were featured in top -tier national media such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, Forbes, Newsweek and The Associated Press, to name a few. AdventHealth also had a consistent cadence of coverage in health care trade publications like Modern Healthcare, Becker's Healthcare, Healthcare Innovation and STAT News, along with consumer health publications like The Healthy, INSIDER, Verywell Health and more. Strong placements in Seventh -day Adventist publications positioned AdventHealth as a leader in COVID -19 information for the church audience while also showcasing the organization's mission enduring through a historic health crisis. President/CEO Terry Shaw's thought leadership platform also saw substantial traction and growth that attracted features by LinkedIn News editors and placed Terry as #1 in LinkedIn content engagement among CEOs of the nation's top 20 health systems as well as health system CEOs included in Modern Healthcare's 100 Most Influential People in Healthcare for 2020, according to an analysis performed in Q1 and Q2 2021 . Through this pandemic year, hospitals and health systems have held a critical leadership role in providing accurate information to their communities. They were a trusted source of truth at a time when health advice had become widely politicized and distorted in news media and on social media. Hospital operations also became the focal point of the nation as topics like health care supply chain, clinical processes, clinician staffing and hospital capacity saw significant disruption due to the multiple coronavirus variants that surged through communities in 2021. For AdventHealth, structures like the COVID -19 System Command Center and Story Bureau helped maintain aligned messaging and storytelling amid the pandemic's constant flow of new and sometimes conflicting information. This made it possible to pursue a wide range of media opportunities through a process of media trend identification, interview preparation, execution, tracking and continuous learning. Edelman's media strategy counsel and interview training were also leveraged to help best position our experts for key media opportunities . This full -year snapshot contains some of the highlights of this storytelling from across the organization in 2021, ranging from top -tier national media to key local market and owned media.
