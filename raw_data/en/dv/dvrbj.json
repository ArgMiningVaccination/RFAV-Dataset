You'll also work with an online counselor to achieve your mental health goals. Cerebral offers medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorders. Medication-assisted treatment involves taking a medication called Suboxone. This medication binds with opioid receptors in your brain, helping reduce cravings. The less you crave opioids, the more likely you are to recover from your opioid use disorder. You can't get Suboxone from a mail-order pharmacy, so if your Cerebral prescriber thinks you're a good candidate for the drug, they'll send a prescription to a pharmacy in your area. Things to Know About Cerebral Online Therapy If you want to sign up for online therapy services, medication management, or medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, you'll need to fill out a free emotional assessment. It takes up to 7 days for Cerebral to match a new client with one of its licensed prescribers. Once you're enrolled, your therapist may use cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, dialectical behavior therapy, or other therapeutic approaches to help you have more good days.
