The joints of hands and wrists are commonly involved but it may affect other body parts also. It can affect hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, toes. What Is Our immune system comprises a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs, which together work to fight against germs and keeps the body safe from their attacks. The immune system keeps the pathogens out or finds and destroys them. When your immune system cannot do all this and cannot protect the body, it means that you are suffering from an immune disorder. Immune system disorders cause the immune system to be either overactive or underactive. Immune disorders include: Asthma and allergy: These are immune responses to some substances which are not very dangerous. Immune deficiency diseases: These are disorders where one or more parts of the immune system are missing. These decrease the ability of your body to fight pathogens and make the body susceptible to infections. Autoimmune diseases: Here the immune system is overactive and the body attacks and damages its own cells and tissues. The immune zandu satavarex side effects produces antibodies in response to some unknown trigger and instead of fighting the infection, the antibodies start attacking the tissues of your body. Proper functioning is necessary for us to maintain ideal health. The state in which the immune system is functioning sub-optimally is called immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiency states can have serious consequences e. Overfunctioning of the immune system is also common. Conditions in which the immune system over functions are hypersensitivity reactions or allergies, as well as autoimmune diseases when the immune system recognises the body's cells as foreign and starts to attack them. The immune system is intricately and very detailed in its design. The system is divided into innate and adaptive immunity. These include physical defence mechanisms such as skin, mucosa and cell walls, as well as scavenger immune molecules that catch foreign particles in the blood and lymphatic streams. It is an immediate defence mechanism and non-specific. Once the innate immune system recognises a threat to the body, these cells activate a system called the complement cascade which leads to further activation of more of the immune system's cells. The adaptive immune system is more focused and contains antibodies that are formed after exposure to specific foreign substances called antigens. Antibodies are called immunoglobulins, and lymphocytes are the cells responsible for activation of the innate immune system. Poor diet, fatigue, stress as well as certain substances or medications can all lead to over- or underperformance of the immune system. What Is Constipation is a condition in which there is difficulty in emptying the bowels, usually associated with hardened faeces. Consuming healthy foods and regular physical activities can help prevent or reduce obesity.

When people infected with active tuberculosis sneeze, spit, cough, or speak, they spread the infection. People suffering from latent tuberculosis cannot be contagious. Latent tuberculosis is diagnosed with the help of a blood test, or the tuberculin skin test.

The solution is to brush teeth regularly and floss the mouth. Avoid eating sticky sugary food. Gingivitis: This is a gum disease and occurs in the mild alkaline to the mild acidic environment in the mouth. The cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene and lack of the certain type of enzymes which can digest food substances. Gingivitis is a reversible condition with proper dental treatment. Periodontal disease: If gingivitis is left untreated, it progresses into periodontal disease. In this disease, the plaque bacteria form crystals, which attach to the teeth, and these crystals destroy the ligaments, which attach teeth to the bone. As a result, pockets are formed, in which more food particles can be trapped and lodged. This causes the disease to progress, and eventually, it may lead to the removal of the tooth. The damage to the tooth and gum caused by periodontal disease is permanent and irreversible. Mouth odor: Also called bad breath or halitosis, mouth odor is due to remnants of food particles in the mouth. Enteric bacteria feed on these food particles and release an odor.

The tubes get further divided into many branches like tree branches inside the lungs. The smaller tubes called as bronchioles and they end in a collection of tiny air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli have a thin wall made up of small blood vessels called capillaries. The oxygen passes through the capillaries and reaches the bloodstream during the inhaling process. Simultaneously, the carbon dioxide comes out during the exhaling process. The natural flexibility of the air sacs and bronchial tubes pushes air out of the body. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease makes the air sacs and tubes lose their flexibility. This leads to some air getting trapped in the lungs while exhaling. Lack Of Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Protein Close to one percent of the population gets affected by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease may result due to the inherited disorder. The lowering level of alpha-1-antitrypsin protein happens due to a genetic disorder. Liver prepares the Alpha-1-antitrypsin and secretes into the bloodstream. Lack of Alpha-1-antitrypsin protein will affect not only the liver but also the lungs. Such damage affects both children and adults due to passive smoking. For adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease due to lack of Alpha-1-antitrypsin protein can be treated the same way others get treatment for the disease. Along with that replacing Alpha-1-antitrypsin protein can protect lungs from further damage. Persistent indigestion not related to any of the above factors is called non-ulcer or functional dyspepsia. What Are The Causes Of Skin problems are mostly symptoms of the problem within the body.
