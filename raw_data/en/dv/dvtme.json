What to expect... During your home detox from crystal meth you can expect to go through 3 phases. Each phase has varying symptoms, and severities. Not everyone experiences it the same. Although there is no treatment or drug maintenance programs for Crystal Meth, there are prescribed medications that have shown to manage/decrease certain symptoms. For further information on those medications, please speak to your health care provider. Phase 1 Phase 1, sometimes referred to as the crash, occurs during the first couple of days after your last use. Symptoms are similar to what you'd experience from a hangover after binge drinking , and are said to be most intense during this phase. Symptoms can include : \u00b7Excessive amounts of sleep \u00b7Large appetite \u00b7Irritability \u00b7Anxiousness \u00b7Dysphoria (unease or dissatisfaction with life) Your chances of success increase when you enlist the help of someone .Find a safe, sober friend or family member to help support you through this process. If you've tried to quit before, make notes of what worked and what didn't work. Know what to expect. Our biggest barrier can be fear of the unknown, so lessen that fear and take control . Eat, and drink plenty of fluids. Your body and brain are healing themselves and need the proper nutrients to do so. Dehydration can become dangerous so make sure you stay hydrated. Get lots of rest and limit visitors. This can help with the irritability too. Pre-plan for cravings . You may experience memory and concentration issues, so write out your plan. Monitor your symptoms, or have someone monitor them for you. Watch for depression, self harm, and/or suicidal thoughts. If you experience suicidal thoughts or self harm, call your Local on Call, 306-XXX-XXXX , 9-1-1or go to your nearest emergency room What to expect continued... Phase 2 Phase 2, known as acute withdrawal, occurs 2-3 days after your last use and typically lasts around 7 -10 days. Symptoms include: \u00b7Aches and \u00b7Paranoia/hallucinations/psychosis Phase 3 During this stage most of your symptoms should be starting to fade, although mood swings, agitation, cravings, and trouble sleeping could last a couple more weeks. If these symptoms persist longer than that, please talk to your healthcare provider. It's important to note in this phase, that the urge to relapse will be strongest, and that depression can last weeks, months, and even years as your brain tries to heals itself, and dopamine levels stabilize. Remember to be patient, and kind with yourself, and the process. Just like the other symptoms passed, this will too . If you are struggling with depression please call your Community Health Centre or your Local On Call at 306-XXX-XXX. If you are having thoughts of suicide call 9-1-1 or head to your nearest emergency room. "}
