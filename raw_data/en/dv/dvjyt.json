In 1956, while on a trip to South Africa for his specialty chemical business, Gussman was invited to visit the hospital that Dr. Albert Schweitzer (1875\u00c21965), the Nobel Prize-winning medical missionary, had established in Lambarene, Gabon, in 1913. For more than 30 years following his initial trip to Gabon in 1957, Gussman returned to Lambarene in the summers to volunteer at Dr. Schweitzer's hospital. He was often accompanied by his wife Kaye, a nurse.", "sitename": null, "date": null, "cleaned_text": "| | Pictured above (from top to bottom) Figure (nkisi) Bembe peoples, Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo Late 19th-early 20th century Wood, feathers, hide, textile, fiber, mirror, ceramic, hair H. 73 cm (16 15/16 in.)

Empowering substances or \"medicines\" were placed in the mirror-covered boxes attached to these figures. Carved bells were part of the public invocations of spiritual forces by the nganga.
