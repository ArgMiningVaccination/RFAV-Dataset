USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 9 Chapter 2 STANDING MANUALS 2.1. Introduction: This chapter explains the basic movements which must be mastered before attempting to accomplish drill and ceremonies with a saber or during presentation of colors. Stand ing M anuals will be performed at the cadence of slow time (60 bpm) unless executing a movement that is or contains a facing movement, in which case the manual will be performed at the cadence of quick time (100 -120 bpm). Further clarification is provided when necessary for manuals that deviate from this rule . 2.2. Position of Attention: The command of execution is ATTENTION and will be preceded by a preparatory command (i.e. Colors). To come to Attention, bring the feet together smartly, the heels and ball s of feet are together and touching. Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the knees. The body is erect with hips level, chest lifted, and shoulders square and even. Arms hang straight down alongside the body and wrists are not bent, and knuckles are parallel to the ground. Place middle finger along the seams of the trousers. Hands are cupped with palms facing the leg. Head is erect, neck is vertical with the body, and eyes are facing forward with the line of sight parallel to the ground. The weight of the body rests equally on the heels and balls of both feet, and silence and immobility are required . FIGURE 2.1. Position of Attention (front and side view) USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 10 2.3. Facing Movements : The command for the movement is Left (Right), FACE. This is a two-count m ovement . The move will be executed on the execution command of FACE . To complete count one of the movement, from the position of Attention, lift the left (right) foot and place it down 90 degrees to the right (left) foot forming an \"L\". The corner of the heel of the left (right) foot should be against the corner of the heel of the right (left) foot. The head is perpendicular to the shoulders throughout the movement (head and shoulders will follow the foot that is turning). The rest of the body remains at the position of ATTENTION at a 45 -degree angle. To complete count two of the movement, distribute the weight of the body to the left (right) foot. Lift the right (left) foot and, with snap, bring it alongside the left (right) foot. Simultaneously the body will finish 90 degrees from the original position. The rest of the body remains at the position of ATTENTION . FIGURE 2.2. Facing movement is a two count movement (left and right view) 2.4. Halt: To halt, the command is Colors, HALT. Colors is called on the left foot and HALT on the following left foot. Upon the command of execution HALT, take one more step with the right foo t and close with the left. USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 11 FIGURE 2.3. Position following of Colors, HALT . USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 12 Chapter 3 MARCHING 3.1. Introduction: Marching is the foundation of the performance. There are several ways to march the Colors, depending on the set up of the room. One option is a single file down the middle aisle or down the side aisle. Another option is four or five officers shoulder to shoulder down the middle aisle. Regardless of the formation, the National Ensign will be the leading flag upon arrival and departure of the opening ceremonies. 3.2. General Commands: The general commands for ceremonies are listed below: 3.2.1. Colors, ATTENTION 3.2.2. Mark Time, MARCH 3.2.3. Forward, MARCH 3.2.4. Colors, HALT 3.2.5. Left About, MARCH 3.2.6. Colors, HALT 3.2.7. Left (Right), FACE 3.2.8. Present, ARMS 3.2.9. Order, ARMS 3.2.10. Forward, MARCH (after USPHS March) 3.2.11. Colors, HALT 3.3. Mark Time, MARCH: The purpose of this movement is to march in place . The command for this movement is Mark, Time, MARCH. Upon the command of execution, lift the left leg and begin marching in place, lifting each foot letting the toes dangle. Lift the feet so the dangling to es are approximately 4 -6 inches off the ground. Keep the arms suspended at the side. The rest of the body remains at the position of Attention. From a march, the command is Mark, TIME. Upon the command of execution, take one more 24-inch step and then m ark time ensuring to suspend the arms to the side . USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 13 FIGURE 3.1. Mark Time, MARCH, (forward and left view) 3.4. Forward, MARCH: The command is Forward, MARCH. Upon the command of execution MARCH, step off with the left foot sliding your heel for t he first step. March with 24- inch steps as measured between the heels. When marching, place one foot in front of the other, in a straight line versus toes pointing inward or outward. Regarding the use of cadence while marching; the USPHS SGHG does not c all cadence while conducting the ceremonial march. However, under special circumstances when noise levels negatively impact formation and cohesion, the OIC in charge of the detail may elect to maintain good order and discipline by calling cadence. Note: Forward, March can be given in incremental steps by using the command Two Paces ( thereby specifying the number of steps to take) Forward, MARCH. Upon the command of execution MARCH, step off with the left foot and march forward the number of steps commanded. On the last step, simply bring the feet together and resume the position of Attention. This movement is executed when there is not enough room to execute a Colors, HALT . 3.5. Colors, HALT : To halt, the command is Colors, HALT. Colors is called on t he left foot and HALT on the following left foot. Upon the command of execution HALT, take one more step with the right foot and close with the lef t. The final closed position is depicted at the top of FIGURE 3.2. USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 14 FIGURE 3.2. Steps required to com plete the command Colors HALT . 3.6. Left About, MARCH : The command \"Left about, MARCH\" is used to turn the Honor Guard 180 degrees to face the audience. On the command of \"MARCH\" the turn is executed by marking time for four steps and pivoting on the fift h step. The first four steps are to coordinate timing and adjust spacing as needed among the officers. The fifth step is an automatic cue to start pivoting . The pivot point will be determined by the number of flag bearers. When there are four flag bear ers, the pivot point is between the two flags. The National Ensign Flag bearer and Front/Right Saber will march forward while the organizational flag bearer and Back/Left Saber will march backwards. When there are five flag bearers, the pivot point is the middle flag. The middle flag will pivot, essentially turning 180 degrees in place. The National Ensign bearer and Front/Right Saber will march forward while the organizational flag and Back/Left Saber will march backwards . 3.7. Present, ARMS : The command is Present, ARMS. Upon the command of execution ARMS, from the position of Attention, raise the right hand up the centerline of the body, start un -cupping the hand and extending the fingers and thumb at approximately waist level. Continue to raise the right hand until the bicep is parallel with the ground and slightly forward of the body. The line between the middle finger and elbow should be USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 15 straight (do not bend your wrist or cup your hand) and the palm is slightly tilted toward the face. Touch the middle finger to the right front corner of the brim of the hat, the outer right point of the eyebrow, or the right outer point on the eyeglasses, depending on what is worn. Fingers are extended and joined, thumb along the forefinger (do not tuck thumb). 3.8. Order, ARMS: To return to the position of Attention, the command is Order, ARMS. Upon the command of execution ARMS, simply retrace your steps backward from Present Arms re -cupping your hand at approximately waist level. During Present Arms, silence and immobility are required. When performing this movement Present Arms and Order Arms are completed as three- count movements. 3.9. Parades: For a parade formation, the officers will be positioned shoulder -to-shoulder with the flags placed in the harness. When the reviewing officer of a parade is entitled to a salute by the organizational colors, the salute is executed by the command \"Eyes, RIGHT (LEFT)\" depending on the location of the reviewing stand. The purpose for taking this action is to render honors to the dignitaries stationed on or within the reviewing stand. As such all eyes, with exception of the National color bearer will execute a cohesive turn upon command and face/honor the reviewing stand. 3.9.1. Eyes, RIGHT (LEFT) : The command is \"Eyes, RIG HT (LEFT). \" The preparatory command \"Eyes\" is given as the left heel touches the ground. As the right heel touches the ground, the sword bearers will raise the right hand to the level of 6 inches in front of the neck, forming a 45 degree angle by slightl y bending the wrist, and inner foreman against the body. The command of execution \"RIGHT\" or \"LEFT\" is called on the next left step . On the command \"RIGHT,\" all members of the color guard with exception of the National color bearer will execute a cohes ive head -turn resulting in a 45 degree turn to the right. On the command \"LEFT,\" all members of the color guard with exception of the National color bearer will execute a cohesive head -turn resulting in a 45 degree turn to the left . 3.9.2. Sword and Flag Bearer, Honors Rendered while on parade: As the left heel strikes the ground, the sword bearers will bring their sword point s down ( without whipping ) to a position 3 inches above the ground. The organizational flag bearer (s) will dip the ir flag(s) with a 45 de gree angle while performing the cohesive head -turn articulated above . 3.9.3. Ready, FRONT : The command is \" Ready , FRONT .\" When marching at parade, at the command \"Ready,\" if the organizational colors saluted, it resumes to the vertical upright position. At the command \"FRONT,\" all members of the color guard who executed Eyes, RIGHT (LEFT ) will return their head and eyes smartly to the front. USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 16 Chapter 4 PRESENTING COLORS 4.1. Background : Throughout history, the Colors, otherwise known as flags, standards, banners, and pennants, were used to represent countries, distinguished governmental subdivisions, agencies, military units, officials, and functioned as forms of signaling devices. In times of battle, the position of flagbearer was awarded to those who poss essed supreme levels of bravery, confidence, and loyalty. The flagbearer's mission was to carry the Colors, rally the forces, lead the charge, and protect the flags with their lives, if necessary. Armed guardsmen were often assigned a position flanking the flagbearer to ensure the defense of the flag, forming a color guard. Today, these color teams serve a significant ceremonial purpose and forever hold a place in America's history, traditions, and protocol . 4.2. Protocol: Title 36, United States Code Chapter 10, governs flag etiquette and protocol. This law is intended to always maintain the U.S. National Flag in the position of honor, whenever exhibited. Military tradition has added its own customs in addition to that outlined in the U.S. Code. The pr esentation of Colors is performed in a variety of ceremonies such as promotions, retirements, awards, and change s of command. Regardless of the ceremony or venue, the Colors will be in the order of precedence/establishment. Admiral's Flag will be pre -posted on the stage, not presented. The Order of Precedence for DHHS and USPHS ceremonies is listed as follows: (1) National Ensign, (2) State flags are displayed in order of admittance to the Union (if applicable), (3) DHHS, (4) USPHS , (5) Agency (if applica ble), and (6) Admiral flag and/or SES flag for each member of official party. FIGURE 4.1. Order of Precedence (left to right) : National Ensign, DHHS, and USPHS. If the ceremony is a joint service ceremony where the Reserve and National Guard is n ot present , the Order of Precedence of the United States uniformed services formation is listed as follows: (1) United States Army, (2) United States Marine Corps, (3) United USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 17 States Navy, (4) United States Air Force, (5) United States Coast Guard, (6) USP HS, and (7) NOAA. FIGURE 4.2. Example of a Joint Services Ceremony depicting the following flags: National Ensign, US Army, US Marine Corps, US Navy, US Air Force, US Coast Guard, US Public Health Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administr ation, and Tricare. 4.3. Requirements : It is the duty of all color team members to ensure the safety and security of the colors they are carrying. Every precaution feasible should be taken to ensure this . Never dip the National flag . Only dip non- national flags at the appropriate times ( i.e. during the playing of national anthems ). Never allow a flag to touch the ground. Take care when handling flags/flag staffs around doors, ceilings, people and other obstacles . The height of the team members should be as closely matched as possible. If there is a noticeable difference in members' height, the team should be arranged in an aesthetically pleasing manner (depending on the rank and experience level) . 4.4. At -Ease : The position of \"A t-Ease\" is used prior to the presentation of Colors. While at-ease, the flag is in the harness and the feet are shoulder width apart. The right hand will be on the upper flag staff and the left hand will be on the lower flag staff near the harness cup . 4.5. Position of Attenti on: On the command of \"Colors, ATTENION,\" the Colors will come to attention. At the position of attention, the flag is in the harness with the right hand on the upper flag staff and left hand on the lower flag staff. The staff is vertical with the flat side of the spearhead facing front . USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 18 FIGURE 4.3. Position of Attention 4.6. Present, ARMS : Upon the command \"Present, ARMS\" the organizational colors will salute on the execution command of \"ARMS\" with a three second dip to form a 45 degree angle. Th e National Ensign does not salute. Upon the last note of the National Anthem, the organizational colors will be returned to the vertical position on the command Order, ARMS .

Present/Order ARMS: Complete Sequence (side view) 4.7. Order, ARMS : Upon the command of \"Order, ARMS\", the organizational colors will be returned to the vertical position ( reference FIGURE 4.6.) . 4.8. Musical Honors : When musical honors are played, the organizational colors will salute on the command Present, ARMS with a three second dip to form a 45 degree angle, ensuring the flag does not touch the ground. The National Ensign does not dip. Following the last note of the National Anthem, the command Order, ARMS (Reference FIGURE 4.6.) will be given at which point, the organizational colors will be returned to the vertical position . 4.9. Performances in Locations with Low Ceilings (Trail, ARMS) : When performing indoor ceremonies in a l ocation with low ceilings, the C olors will be carried with both hands and without harnesses (at Trail, ARMS) as pictured in FIGURE 4.7. The flag staff will be held in the right hand, with the right palm placed on the front of the flag staff with the right index finger extended down the flag staff.

On the command ARMS, the right arm is extended with the saber at a 45 degree upward angle, forming a straight line. To bring the arch back to the position of attention, on the command \"Order\" the saber will come back to t he chin level with the blade flat. On the command ARMS, the officer wi ll come back to the position of attention. USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 27 Chapter 6 BOATSWAIN (B OS'N ), SIDE BOYS, & PIPING THE SIDE 6.1. Introduction: Piping the Side is a long -standing Nav al tradition conducted to honor the arrival and departure of dignitaries . As a sea service, th e USPHS Commissioned Corps will continue this tradition at ceremonies. Piping the side includes a Bos'n, Side Boys, and bell. FIGURE 6.1. US Navy and Marine Corps combine to render honors: \"Shipmate going Ashore\" FIGURE 6.2. US Navy Vice Admi ral John Totushek passes through the Side Boys at his Retirement and Change of Command ceremony. USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 28 6.2. Uniforms: Uniformity for the Side Boys is critically important. Side Boy uniforms will include white gloves in Full Dress Blues or Whites and will ad here to CCI 421.01 and CCI 421.02. In keeping with strict order and discipline rendering appropriate honor and dignity to the uniform and uniformity , the Bos'n and Side Boys will not be authorized use or wear of the following : moustaches, skirts, berets, earrings, and heels. 6.3. Boatswain (Bos'n) : The Bos'n (phonetic ally pronounced as BOH -sun) is the key leadership position that oversees the Navy tradition of Piping the Side . 6.4. Bos'n Pipe : The B os'n Pipe (originally termed a call) dates back to the day s of sail when only the shrill sound of the pipe could be heard over the roar of battle and during gale force winds . It had definite practical uses in those days, many of which have now ceased to exist. Sailors high on the royal and top gallant yards could hear the pipe under weather conditions that would cause the human voice to be inaudible or unintelligible. Although those days are gone, the Bos'n P ipe is still ve ry much part of the Sea Services and carries with it a tradition that continues across the Continental United States on shore installations today be they Naval or USPHS . FIGURE 6.3. Bos'n Pipe (side view) 6.5. H onors Rendered: U.S. Navy Regulations, Chapter 10, Article 1003 wherein the Relative rank of grades of officers in the Army, Navy , Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, whether on the active or retired lists and of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Public Health Service is indicated in TABLE 6. 1. Additionally, OPNAVINST 1710.7A articulates that the Surgeon General's grade correspondence to that of Surgeon General of the Army. As depicted within TABLE 6. 1, the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service is equivalent to a Rear Admiral (Navy, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) or Major General (Marine Corps, Army, Air Force). As such, the honors rendered (i.e. Side Boys, Bells, etc.) is equivalent to a Rear Admiral (Navy, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) or Major General (Marine Corps, Army, Air Force) . Traditionally, the United States Public Health Service has chosen to sound 8 bells for the USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 29 USPHS Surgeon General thereby rendering honors equivalent to a Vice Admiral (Navy, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) as depicted withi n TABLE 6. 2. and as seen within Attachment 3c and Attachment 4. TABLE 6.1. Relative Rank and Precedence of Officers of Different Services U.S. Navy Regulations (Article 1003) OPNAVINST 1710.71 (Table 1) 6.6. Arrival of the Official Party : The Offic ial Party arrives at the beginning of the ceremony. As each member of the Official Party parades through the Side Boys, the Bos'n and Side Boys render honors to each dignitary by perform ance of a Hand SALUTE during the call of the Pipe. The arriving orde r of the Official Party begins with the lowest in rank and continues until the last member of the Official Party has arrived thereby completing the sequence of the traditional \"boarding of the ship\" prior to the commencement of the ceremony and the present ation of colors. TABLE 6.2 depicts the USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 30 requisite number of Side Boys to be present and the appropriate number of Bells to be sounded for each dignitary listed.

Dignitaries with corresponding Side Boys and Bells 6.7. Ruffles and Flourishes: The rank of the senior officer rates the number of Ruffle s and Flourishes played following the arrival of the dignitary. The playing of Ruffles and Flourishes in honor of the arrival of the dignitary begins only after the dignitary passes through the Side Boys and positions himself/herself on stage facing the audience at the stance of Attention . At the first sounding of Ruffles and Flourishes, all uniformed service members on stage and in attendance including the senior officer and/or dignitary being honored will salute. It is preferred that all service member s bring their covers to each ceremony so that they might be prepared to return salute while covered . However, should service members forget to bring covers , they would not be remiss in returning the salute while uncovered. Stars Ruffles and Flourishes 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 TABLE 6.3. Ruffles and Flourishes due based upon rank of the Flag Officer arriving 6.8. Bos'n Hand Positions: The four correct positions of the hand for using the boatswain's pip are open, curved, closed, and clinched as shown in t he figure/picture below. The lung force or blowing pressure varies with each position. As a rule the open hand requires the least pressure for a clear note, and the clinched position demands the greatest pressure in USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 31 making the note shrill and clear. Low notes are made with the open hand position, and high notes, with the clinched position. FIGURE 6.3. Bos'n Pipe: Hand Positions 6.9. Piping the Side: While the Bos'n \"Pipes the Side\" all Side B oys and B os'n stand at attention, perform a Hand SALUTE . The Bos'n utilizes the open and clinched hand positions for this call . FIGURE 6.4. Piping the Side USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 32 Chapter 7 FUNERAL HONORS & 2-PERSON FLAG FOLD 7.1. Introduction: Funeral H onors C eremony shall be provided to eligible beneficiaries, upon request whenever the U.S. Public Health Service SGHG is available to serve in this capacity . Commanders at all levels must support paying a final tribute on behalf of a grateful Nation to comrades in arms, and must respond expeditiously and sensitively to requests for funeral support. Rendering funeral honors reflects the high regard and respect accorded to Active Duty Service and demonstrates Public Health professionalism to the Nation and the world. Personnel selected for military funeral honors details shall be ap propriately trained and equipped for this duty. Funeral Honors will provide at a minimum a 2- person flag fold , presentation of the folded flag to the next of kin (NOK), and playing of Taps. FIGURE 7.1. Presentation of the Folded Flag 7.2. Flag Fold : A properly folded flag does not have any red corners . To properly fold the flag, begin by holding it waist- high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground and forms a \" table top \" as shown below in the sequence of steps : 7.2.1. Step 1: Drawn Flag (Table Top) held parallel to the deck. FIGURE 7.2. Step 1: Drawn f lag (Table Top) USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 33 FIGURE 7.3. 2- Person flag fold : Initiating the first fold (Step 2) 7.2.2.

Step 3: Bring the hand not securing the established border back to opposite corner . USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 34 FIGURE 7. 6. Step 3: Flag halved again (second time) FIGURE 7.7 . Bring the two open ends of the flag together to the halfway mark of the top stripe. FIGURE 7.8. Flair the fingers of the bottom hand and slowly guide down the edge of the flag thereby bringing the two open ends of the flag together . 7.2.4. Step 4: The folder begins by making a triangular fold bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to the open edge. Ensure the outside edge of the fold forms a 90-degree angle . FIGURE 7.9. Step 4: Flag fold (first fold) USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 35 FIGURE 7.10. The folder begins by making a triangular fold bringing the left corner to the inner edge. Ensure the outside edge of the fold forms a 90-degree angl e. 7.2.5. Step 5: Fold the outer point inward, parallel with the open edge, to form second triangle . FIGURE 7.1 1. Step 5: Flag fold (second fold) FIGURE 7.12. Fold the outer point inward, parallel with the open edge, to form th e second triangle and then c ontinue folding . 7.2.6. Step 6: Continue folding the flag until reaching the blue field of stars . FIGURE 7. 13. Step 6: Flag fold ( continued) USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 36 FIGURE 7.14. Arriving at the first la ndmark (triangular fold tip nears blue field) . FIGURE 7.15. Wrap red tip with blue field . 7.2.7. Step 7: The f older reaches underneath the f lag with the right hand, lifts up the flap, and cradles it with the left arm. The folder mus t also pinch the right corner of the flag to ensure the flag is taut . The flag assistant makes a 90 -degree fold with the right side of the flag, ensuring the thumb is placed in between the fold USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 37 and the flag. Crease the excess portion of the flag and neat ly tuck it in the pocket formed by the folded flag. FIGURE 7.16. Step 7: Preparing to tuck in the final fold. FIGURE 7.17. Step 8: Tucking in the final fold and \"hiding the red.\" USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 38 7.3. Presentation of th e Flag: The ceremonial folding and presentation of the flag is a moving tribute of lasting importance to the veteran's family . After Taps is played, the flag is carefully folded into the symbolic tri- cornered shape. A properly proportioned flag will fold 13 times on the triangles, representing the 13 original colonies. The folded flag is emblematic of the tri- cornered hat worn by the Patriots of the American Revolution. When folded, no red or white stripe is to be evident, leaving only the blue field w ith stars. When presenting the flag, white gloves will be worn. The Honor Guard member selected to perform the presentation will take possession of the flag and stand facing the flag recipient and hold the folded flag waist high with the straight edge fa cing the recipient. The flag bearer will then lean toward the flag recipient and solemnly present the flag to the recipient. The flag is then presented as a keepsake to the NOK or the designated family member. FIGURE 7.18. Pro per presentation: Straight edge facing the recipient . 7.4. Sample Message of Condolence : Effective April 17, 2012, the Department of Defense standardized the flag presentation verbiage for military funeral honors ceremonies. The following verbiage will b e used when presenting the American flag during a funeral service for a USPHS active duty or retired member : \"On behalf of the President of the United States, the U nited States Public Health Service, and a grateful Nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one's honorable and faithful service .\" 7.5. Active Duty and Retired Funeral Honors : The following honors will be rendered for those U.S. Public Health Service officers who pass while on active duty status or for those who pass from the retired roster. 7.5.1. March on Sequence: Once the Surgeon General's Honor Guard (SGHG) ensures the entire team is prepared, they wi ll fall into column formation . The SGHG will USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 39 then command Forward, M ARCH and the right Saber G uard will lea d the team to the predetermined position (previously decided during gravesite check, one hour prior to the ceremony start time). As soon as the team becomes centered on the foot of the casket, the SGHG will call MARK, TIME. The SGHG will pick up a Mark T ime and adjust positioning and distance. Once the SGHG is ready, they will call for a Colors T URN . Once halted, the SGHG will command Order, ARMS then Colors, Ready C UT. Automatically the SGHG will then command Colors, Stand At, EASE . 7.5.2. Gravesite Service: Colors are positioned approximately 10 to 15 paces (depending on any obstructions) away from the foot of the casket. The Surgeon General's Honor Guard always take their cues from the O fficer in Charge (OIC) . 7.5.2.1. Upon arrival of the hearse, the SGHG comma nds Stand by, Colors, ATTENTION. Once the hearse has stopped, the OIC will step off to dress the casket, then immediately return to their position and go to Stand At, EASE. SGHG will then command Colors, Stand At, EASE. 7.5.2.2. Once the funeral director has g iven the \"go ahead\" or \"head nod\" to the OIC they will then go to ATTENTION and the SGHG will command Stand by, Colors, ATTENTION. The Pallbearers will then conduct the \"Behind the Hearse Sequence\" and begin to pull the remains out of the vehicle. Once th e remains are in motion, the OIC will salute. Upon the salute of the OIC, the SGHG commands Present, ARMS. 7.5.2.3. Colors remain at that position until the OIC drops the salute at the gravesite. At this time the SGHG will command Order, ARMS then Colors, Ready , CUT . 7.5.2.4. The team will wait at Attention until the flag is at table top or the OIC goes to Stand At, EASE. Once this is complete, the SGHG will then command Colors, Stand At, EASE (all are in a normal, conversational tone) . 7.5.2.5. After the committal s ervice is complete, the OIC of the ceremony assumes the position of ATTENTION and Presents ARMS ; the funeral director asks the family to rise for the rendering of military honors. This is the cue for the Colors to Present ARMS . The SGHG commands: Stand- by Colo rs, ATTENTION; Present, ARMS (in a loud enough voice to get the attention of the family) . 7.5.2.6. After Taps is complete, the SGHG commands Order, ARMS; Colors Ready, CUT (two -count Ready Cut) and remains at the position of ATTENTION waiting for the flag to be folded and handed off to the NOK . 7.5.2.7. After the flag has been presented to the NOK, the Pallbearers start their departure sequence, which is when the Pallbearer team faces toward the USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 40 predetermined direction of travel and then steps off. This is the cue for the Colors to leave the gravesite. The SGHG commands Port, ARMS; Colors, Colors Turn, MARCH, or the team departs using Every Other Left, proceeding directly to the transportation site . 7.5.2.8. Upon arrival at the transportation site, the SGHG commands Colors, Fallout, MARCH. This command is called on every heel strike. For example, the command, \"Colors\" will be called on the left foot, \"Fallout\" will be called on the right and \" MARCH \" is called on the left foot. The Colors team will take one more step and c lose. The Saber Guard s and ONLY the Saber Guards will execute an automatic two -count About FACE . Note: The SGHG will not call the About FACE command for the team . 7.6. Active Duty and Retired Funeral (Pallbearers): Pallbearers carry the remains of the deceased service members and/or their dependents whenever they are moved, except during the funeral procession, when remains are placed in a hearse. Pallbearers will not hand carry remains during procession under any circumstances. Pallbearers may be utiliz ed but are not required for use following the demise of an active duty and/or retired officer who was serving or retired from service in the United States Public Health Service. Should the use of Pallbearers be requested, the SGHG will work with those requesting the service to ensure appropriate protocol is followed. 7.6.1. Pallbearers should preposition themselves approximately 10 paces from where the hearse is to be stopped (adjacent to the Officer in Charge (OIC) ), facing gravesite. The Pallbearers will condu ct, \"warm -ups\" by executing Stand At, EASE and ATTENTION , then the \"Behind the Hearse Sequence\", and form up at the position of Stand At, EASE no later than five (5) minutes prior to the ceremony start time . 7.6.2. When the Chaplain's vehicle approaches (if one is requested by family) , Pallbearer Officer in Charge (P BOIC) will command \"Bearers, ATTENTION\". Whichever Pallbearer is closest to the approaching vehicle will render a salute to the Chaplain (only if the Chaplain is a military officer). Once the vehicle has passed the team, PBOIC will give the command \"Stand At, EASE\". 7.6.3. When a member within the team notices that the funeral procession is arriving, they will notify the rest of team using the subdued command, \"FAMILY\". 7.6.4. When the hearse is app. 10 paces awa y, the PBOIC commands \"Bearers, ATTENTION\". 7.6.5. As the hearse passes in front of the team, Carry or Hand -Off (whoever is closest to the route of the hearse) will render a three -second hand salute. Note: In case the funeral representative/director does not st op the funeral procession, Hand- Off or Carry (whoever is on the corner of the team closest to the approaching USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 41 vehicles) will use their outside hand to signal the vehicles to stop before they impede the Pallbearers route . 7.6.6. Once the procession has stopped and the hearse is in park, the PBOIC will command \"STEP\". This initiates the \"Hang Step\" to reposition the team behind the hearse. 7.6.7. Once the team has repositioned and taken three hang steps towards the hearse and halted (no heel clicks), the PBOIC will command \"Stand At, EASE\". Note: \"Stand At, EASE\" may not be called if the OIC is at th e position of Attention. If the OIC is at the position of \"Stand At, EASE\" then the PBOIC will call the team to \"Stand At, EASE\". 7.6.8. The PBOIC waits for the OIC to snap to the position of Attention and command, \"SECURE\". This indicates the remains are ready to be transferred to gravesite. 7.6.9. The POIC commands, \"Bearers, ATTENTION\" then \"STEP\". The team marches towards the back of the hearse with 24 inch steps and coordinated a rm swing. 7.6.10. Next the Pallbearer team will perform the \"Behind the Hearse Sequence\", and carry the casket to gravesite. Upon arrival to gravesite, the PBOIC will give the command of \"HALT\", to stop the Pallbearers when they are less than one pace away from the lowering device. Then the PBOIC will give the command \"CENTER\", to get the team ready to carry the casket onto the lowering device. Then the PBOIC will give the command \"STEP\", to side step the casket onto the lowering device. 7.6.11. When the entire team is on the lowering device and the casket is centered on the lowering device, PBOIC commands, \"HALT\". After the team has halted, POIC and Hand- Off take hold of the corner of the flag with their right hand and hold it away from the casket. Simultaneously, Fold and Carry will secure the flag with their left hands an d hold it away from the casket. This is done to prevent the flag from touching the ground and/or being pinned under the casket . 7.6.12. At this point, Mark and Cross Mark extend their arms to compensa te for the other team members' weight. PBOIC commands in a subdued tone \"DOWN\". The team extends their arms down, then squat and slowly lower the casket down onto the lowering device. Note: PBOIC will allow enough time for team members to grab hold of t he corners of the flag before calling \"Down\". Ensure the Pallbearers bend at the knees and not at the waist when lowering the casket onto the lowering device. 7.6.13. Next, the Pallbearers will start the \" 2-Person Flag Fold\" and Fold the flag to \"table top\". O nce the committal service, Firing Party sequence, and the playing of Taps are complete and the OIC has ordered arms; Pallbearers finish the six - person flag folding and appropriate Dressing sequences. Note: Reference section USPHSCC SGHG- DCM 01.01 42 6.7.4. for the six -person flag folding sequence and Chapter 9 for OIC Responsibilities and Active Duty Funeral sequence . 7.6.14. The OIC presents the flag to the Next of Kin ( NOK) , recites the message of condolence and salutes the flag. An example of the message of condolence is: \"On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Public Health Service, and a Grateful Nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one's honorable and faithful service \". 7.6.15. After the OIC or Chaplain has presente d the flag to the NOK, and has returned to their position, OIC will command in a normal conversational tone, \"Bearers, and the Pallbearers march off of the lowering device. As soon as the last person ( PBOIC or Hand- Off) clears the lowering device, they will call \"STEP\" on the left heel strike in a subdued tone. The Pallbearers will take one more step then step off in a normal marching cadence with coordinated arm swing. 7.6.17. Once the team reaches the transportation site, PBOIC will command, \"Bearers, Fallout, MARCH\". This command is called on every heel strike. For example, the command, \"Bearers\" will be called on the left foot, \"Fallout\" will be called on the right and \"March\" is called on the left foot . The Pallbearer team will take one more step and close. When the team performs the automatic two -count About, Face and an OIC was present, the entire Pallbearer team will render a hand salute to the OIC. If no OIC is present, a two -count About, Face wi ll still be executed, but with no hand salute.

The ceremony will begin in approximately 2 minutes.\" 1:00 - MC: \"Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to the PHS Commissioned Corps Retirement Ceremony of CAPT ________________. I am ________________ and I am honored and pleased to serve as today's Mistress of Ceremony. Beside me is CDR ________________ who is serving as the Master of Ceremony, as well. The PHS Commissioned Corps traces its origins to the earliest days of the Republic and we have always cherished our maritime roots in the Marine Hospital Service. Early in our history, we provided medical care to the U.S. Navy and we continue to provide healthcare services to the U.S. Coast Guard to this day. I mention this by way of background to explain some portions of the ceremony and traditions the Commissioned Corps has adopted. Bef ore the Navy and Coast Guard adopted fitness standards, 4 Attachment 2a officers tended to increase their displacement as they increased in rank. Better food, less activity = more displacement. Thus, the more senior an officer, the less able to c______________ b a rope ladder from a pitching boat and clamber over the ship's side without assistance. Senior officers were seated in a Bos'n chair and hauled up and over the side. The more senior the officer, the greater the expected displacement and the more seamen required to haul away on the lines lifting the chair. Over time, this practice evolved into traditional arrival honors for visiting dignitaries. The more seamen tending the side, the more important the visitor. For the record, we note that the visitor's displacement is no long er a factor. When a visitor's gig or barge approached the ship, the watch would hail \"Boat Ahoy\" and the boat coxswain would signal the rank of his passenger. Officers in command would be identified by the name of their command. The Secretary, for example , would be hailed as \"Department of Health and Human Services.\" This would alert the ship to the number of side boys required to haul him or her up and the ship's bell was used to summon the requisite number. Four strikes of the boat gong for a Captain, six strikes of the gong for a Rear Admiral. Sailing ships were noisy places. Underway, the wind whistling through the rigging, sails slapping, and the roar of the sea combined to make communicating orders a challenge. Ship's bos'n, who was charged with passing the word and relaying orders developed the bo s'n pipe - a shrill whistle whose call pierced the sound of wind and wave and called the crew to attention. To a landlubber, the bos'n piping all sounds the same - mostly annoying. But to a seaman, each call is distinct in sound and meaning. One such call was \"Over the Side\" used to alert captain and crew that a dignitary was arriving or departing - being hauled over the side by those hearty seamen side boys. We will use these arrival and departure honors today both to show respect for the principals in this morning's event, but also to remind our Commissioned Corps officers of their proud history and heritage as we reflect on our legacy to better prepare for our future. Now that concludes our history lesson for today.

Ultimately, the most -senior officer in the line presents the flag to the retiring officer as a symbol of gratitude for his or her dedicated and selfless service to the Department, to the Commissioned Corps, and to the Nation.

I proudly lead them forward to triumph. CDR ______________ - I served with our Commissioned Corps officers through 9-11, through Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma and Sandy.

I am going to p rovide you with a brief history of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. The Commissioned Corps of the Marine Hospital Service was formalized in 1889. At first, the service was open only to physicians, but over the course of the twentieth century expanded to include dentists, dieticians, engineers, envir onmental health officers, health service officers, nurses, pharmacists, scientists, therapists, and veterinarians, 11 categories . And in 1912, Congress change d the name to what we know today, the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps . Attachment 3a 6 The legacy of our Commissioned Corps began with the treatment of sick and injured seamen, including the screening of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. On its busiest day, Ellis Island official processed 11,747 immigrants. We oversaw the eradication of contagious di seases suc h as smallpox and yellow fever. Today we provide health care to underserved populations and continue to respond to medical and public health crisis in this nation and around the world. This legacy has solidified the Commissioned Corps as a corner stone of public health for this Nation. The PHS flag consists of a blue PHS seal on a yellow background. This evolved out of the yellow quarantine flag used by the Service to quarantine vessels which we evaluated for contagious diseases. The blue and ye llow colors of the PHS flag represent our service's roots. We have four Core values: Leadership, Service, Integrity and Excellence.

RADM _____________ : Before we bring in the official party, I would like to briefly describe one of the events you will be witnessing in the ceremony today. Attachment 3b 4 For more than 200 years, men and women have served on the front lines of our nation's public health in what is today called the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. The Commissioned Corps traces its beginnings back to the U.S. Marine Hospital Service protecting against the spread of disease from sailors returning from foreign ports and maintaining the health of immigrants entering the country. Being that we are traditionally a sea service, we use sea service traditions in our ceremonies. An important tradition on board ships has been the ship's bell. This was historically used to mark the passage of time on board a vessel. They were also employed as warning devices to inform the ship's personnel that senior officials were boarding the vessel. Today when we introduce the official party (our senior officials) , we will \"ring the bell\" upon their arrival. Another important tradition is that of p iping officials aboard the ship. The Boatswain's pipe or whistle was originally used to give orders on ships when shouted orders could not have been heard. The piping was done by the ship's boatswain and therefore the instrument is known as the boatswain's Pipe or boatswain's call. It is also used in a ceremonial way, i.e., to \"pipe\" someone aboard the ship \u2014 usually captains, including the ship's captain, and more Attachment 3b 5 senior officers. Today we will be piping our official party on board. \"Ladies and Gentlemen p lease rise for the arrival of the official party . Remain standin g for the Presentation of the Colors by the IHS Color Guard and, the performing of the National Anthem by the USPHS Ensemble.

The Public Health Service has a proud history; our origins may be traced to the passage of an act in 1798 that provided for the care and relief of sick and injured merchant seamen. If you look on the your program 's cover , you will see in the Public Health Service Seal, a crossed fouled anchor and a winged caduceus, the mariner connection. The caduceus is not, as is commonly believed, the traditional symbol of medicine, but rather the attribute of Mercury, the Roman messenger of the gods and the Attachment 3b 10 god of com merce. The caduceus refers to the importance of the Public Health Service's mission to the conduct of maritime trade. As for the anchor, it not only represents the maritime nature of the service's original mission, but also, in being fouled, in having the chain wrapped around the stock and flukes, indicates a ship on which there is a mariner ill or in distress. And the PHS flag, consisting of a blue PHS seal on a yellow background, evolved out of the yellow quarantine flag used by the Service on quarantine vessels and stations. The blue and yellow colors of the PHS represent the service's roots in maritime and quarantine activities. From this proud history, we have continued to evolve and grow, expanding programs in research and applied public health, in mental and behavioral health and prevention, and we have grown from a small collection of hospitals supporting the merchant mariners to the largest public health program in the world.

Please hold all applause until all dignitaries are recognized - Our Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, ________________ - Acting Administrator for the Health Resources and Services Administration, Mr. _________________, - Active duty and retired Flag Officers and Chief Professional Officers from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps - Flag Officers from our sister services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard) RADM __________________ (MC) - Thank you for joining with us on this important day where we recognize an outstanding, dedicated public health professional as s he begins a new role in her service to the Nation. This is a day of celebration and we are so glad that you could be here with us to partake in this event. I am going to provide you with a brief overview of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps history. The Commissioned Corps of the Marine Hospital Service was Attachment 3c 7 formalized in 1889. At first, the service was open only to physicians, but over the cour se of the twentieth century expanded to include dentists, dieticians, engineers, environmental health officers, health service officers, nurses, pharmacists, scientists, therapists, and veterinarians. And, just as the number of professions comprising the service grew, the scope and breadth of activities of the Marine Hospital Service also increased, which led Congress to change the name to the Public Health Service in 1912. The legacy of our Commissioned Corps began with the treatment of sick and injured s eamen, including the screening of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. We oversaw the eradication of contagious diseases such as smallpox and yellow fever, led the way in providing health care to underserved groups, and responded with medical and public health assistance in the aftermath of natural and manmade disasters. This legacy has solidified the Commissioned Corps as a corner stone of public health in this Nation. The PHS flag consists of a blue PHS seal on a yellow background. This evolved out of the yellow quarantine flag used by the Service on quarantine vessels and stations. The blue and yellow colors of the PHS flag Attachment 3c 8 represent the service's roots in maritime and quarantine activities. Our Corps is represented by four Core values Leadership, Ser vice, Integrity and Excellence. RADM __________________ (MC) - \" It is now my pleasure to introduce our first distinguished speaker.

Families and friends of CAPT _________________ and RADM _________________ (DSG, USPHS) History of Public Health Service The Public Health Service has a proud history that traces to the passage of an act in 1798 that provided for the care an d relief of sick and injured merchant seamen. Attachment 4 14 | Page The Public Health Service Seal contains a crossed fouled anchor and a winged caduceus which is the mariner connection. Th e caduceus is not the traditional symbol of medicine; rather it is the attribute of Mer cury, the Roman messenger of the gods and the god of commerce. The caduceus refers to the importance of the Public Health Service's mission to the conduct of maritime trade. The anchor represents the maritime nature of the service's original mission. Moreover, the anchor is fouled which means it has a chain wrapped around the stock and flukes which indicates a ship on which there is a mariner ill or in distress. The PHS flag consists of a blue PHS seal on a yellow background. This evolved out of the yellow quarantine flag used by the Service on quarantine vessels and stations. The blue and yellow colors of the PHS flag represent the service's roots in maritime and quarantine activities. From this proud history, we have continued to evolve and grow, expa nding programs in research and applied public health and in mental and behavioral health. We have grown from a small collection of hospitals supporting the merchant mariners to the largest public health program in the world. Our Corps is represented by four Core values: Leadership, Service, Integrity and Excellence. Since the inception of the Public Health Service, nurses have been a key component to the provision of health care to the American people. Nurses make up the largest category of the PHS with over 1650 officers and over 3500 civilian and tribal nurses. Nurses play an important role in the overall Attachment 4 15 | Page mission of the Corps to protect, promote and advance the health and safety of our nation. The Chief Nurse Officer (CNO) position was created in 194 9 as a Rear Admiral in the Office of the Surgeon General (OSG) with the goal of representing all nurses. Every four years, a new CNO is selected to represent the Nurses of the United States and the Public Health Service (USPHS). The CNO is responsible f or providing leadership and coordination of nursing professional affairs for the Department of Health and Human Services and the OSG. Today, we are here to acknowledge the accomplishments of RADM _________________ (DSG, USPHS) as our tenth Chief Nurse and congratulate CAPT _________________ on the career achievement of becoming our eleventh Chief Nurse Officer.

Because of her selfless duty, Nightingale became known as the \"lady with the lamp.\" [LT ___________ [needs gloves] walks slowly carries the lamp to the stage] She walked in the silence and darkness of the night with her lamp, to relieve human suffer ing, and bring the light of knowledge and caring to the injured victims of war. She lay the foundations for the profession of nursing. She understood the consequences of social, political, and economic factors on public health and she shaped policy. Her legacy challenges all nurses to be the proac tive conscience for the health of humanity. The lamp is the ancient symbol of knowledge and learning. It represents the light of HOPE that nurses bring to the darkness of ignorance, illness and disease. Where there is HOPE, there is the fire of life. Florence Nightingale lit her beacon of light to comfort the wounded. The light of her lamp has blazed a path of service and knowledge across a century to nurses today. Nurses inherit her social responsibility to transform the health of individuals, familie s, communities, environments and nations. The Chief Nurse Officer of the US Public Health Service serves as a voice and leader for all nursing.
