First of all I hate to give any book a bad review. I would sincerely recommend not listening to it on Audible but instead purchasing the book if you are interested in getting every single fact and detail. The first section regarding Ayurveda was like someone reading a dictionary to me with an accent that changed some of the words and made it very hard to understand such as Vitamin was pronounced veetamin. the section on rieke was much easier to understand but still more like getting a massive overflow of reference material. the thought was there of giving the reader all kinds of information which is great but if I wanted to actually learn on the subject matter I would need a book in front of me or to hear the material in the way that something is relatable to me instead of just a bombardment of fact after fact after fact after fact. 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Pamela Sherer](/listener/amzn1.account.AEI5O7GFSPAOTFY5WHKTV33TKBKQ?ref=a_pd_Spirit_c15_rvlsnl_1&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=FVCKZS13NZKG4TQQ4N9G&pageLoadId=S2wD7RtGW5jFAuHO&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 07-26-19 very informative This audio book was awesome; it's packed with such amazing information.
