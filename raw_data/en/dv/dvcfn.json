Yet uptake of COVID-19 vaccines remains highly variable, particularly among marginalized communities. This article shares lessons learned from four UNICEF interventions that supported Governments to generate acceptance and demand for COVID-19 vaccines in Zambia, Iraq, Ghana, and India. In Zambia, community rapid assessment provided invaluable real-time insights around COVID-19 vaccination and allowed the identification of population segments that share beliefs and motivations regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Findings were subsequently used to develop recommendations tailored to the different personas. In Iraq, a new outreach approach (3iS: Intensification of Integrated Immunization) utilized direct community engagement to deliver health messages and encourage service uptake, resulting in over 4.4 million doses of COVID-19 and routine immunization vaccines delivered in just 8 months. In Ghana, a human-centered design initiative was applied to co-develop community-informed strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccination rates. In India, a risk communication and community engagement initiative reached half a million people over six months, translating into a 25% increase in vaccination rates. These shared approaches can be leveraged to improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage and close gaps in routine immunization across diverse and marginalized communities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-30", "cleaned_text": "Vaccine Uptake and Demand: Lessons Learned from Four UNICEF-Supported Interventions [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11071180](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11071180) [Challenges and Future Trends of COVID-19 Vaccination]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/covid_vaccination )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-01180)]. These settings, comprising marginalized communities, have been disproportionately affected by inequities around COVID-19 vaccination. There are additional challenges in reaching priority groups who remain the most vulnerable (e.g., children, immunocompromized individuals and those who are at high-risk of infection, and historically marginalized communities) and inadequate data to inform targeted interventions to reach them. [2](#B2-vaccines-11-01180)]. Between 2019 and 2021, 67 million children have missed out either entirely or partially on routine childhood immunizations, leaving them at risk of preventable illness and death [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-01180)]. The pandemic has also driven a rise in misinformation around vaccines, in general, and in some situations, reduced trust in health services [ [4](#B4-vaccines-11-01180), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-01180)]. Other emergencies, such as civil unrest and natural disasters linked to climate change, have caused further disruptions to health service delivery, creating competing priorities. [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01180)]. UNICEF and its partners work to develop evidence-based approaches that support Governments to strengthen immunization programs and drive demand for and uptake of vaccines across diverse settings. 2. Community Interventions to Generate Acceptance and Demand for COVID-19 Vaccines 2.1. Zambia Case Study: Utilizing Community Rapid Assessment for Real-Time Insights into COVID-19 Knowledge, Behavior, and Demand for Vaccines 2.1.1. Background [6](#B6-vaccines-11-01180)]. UNICEF employs social and behavioral evidence and inclusive, participatory approaches to work with communities to understand what drives decision-making, and design interventions that create meaningful, sustainable change in the health sector. Central to this approach is recognizing that populations are heterogeneous, and people have different attitudes, motivations and practices around topics such as vaccination. For example, some people may not trust in the efficacy of the vaccines or are worried about long-term side effects, while others may largely trust vaccines but face difficulties in accessing vaccination services. Consequently, SBC interventions are most effective when they are tailored to different segments of society and address the specific needs of different groups. Real-time insights into individual knowledge, perceptions, motivations, and practices around the prevention of COVID-19, as well as the environmental or contextual factors that affect uptake, are therefore important to better understand the drivers of vaccine acceptance and demand. In this context, community rapid assessment provides a way to gather key data from the community and design tailored community-informed solutions. 2.1.2. Approach [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01180)]. This measures four domains influencing vaccine uptake: what people think and feel about vaccines; social processes that drive or inhibit vaccination; individual motivations (or hesitancy) to seek vaccination; and practical factors involved in seeking and receiving vaccination [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-01180)]. The findings were subsequently used to identify population-wide personas that similarly represent the vaccination-related constructs [Figure majority of female and male respondents reported 'very easy' trust in the vaccine (31% and 34%), belief in the vaccination-related benefits for health (40% and 43%), and ease of access to vaccination (57% and 56%). However, there was a far larger percentage of respondents sharing 'very easy' access to vaccination as compared with 'very easy' trust in the vaccine ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01180-f001)a). There were only small differences in findings between female and male respondents, suggesting little impact of gender on drivers of vaccination. A similar trend was seen across rural and urban participants, with few differences between respondents in urban and rural locations ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-01180-f001)b). Together, the findings suggest that decision-making cuts across demographics. [Table 1](#vaccines-11-01180-t001)). Converters made up the majority of the Zambian population (57%, Round 2), while one-fifth of respondents were categorized as Outsiders. A minority of respondents shared Dissenter personas. [Table 2](#vaccines-11-01180-t002). 2.1.4. Key Lessons Learned 2.2. Iraq Case Study: 3iS Outreach to Improve COVID-19 Vaccination and Routine Immunization 2.2.1. Background [8](#B8-vaccines-11-01180)]. COVID-19 vaccination coverage remains suboptimal in the country, with coverage of eligible populations (aged 12+ years) at ~38% for one dose and 27% for two doses as of December 2022 [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01180)]. Less than 1% have received a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-01180)]. Additionally, childhood routine immunization rates have been lagging due to hesitancy, fear of attending primary healthcare centers amidst a pandemic, exacerbation of traditional reluctance among some conservative communities, and poor access to services for other populations. 2.2.2. Approach [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-01180-f002)for a visual representation of the approach). 2.2.3. Results [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-01180-f003)). 2.2.4. Key Lessons Learned 2.3. Ghana Case Study: Applying Human-Centered Design to Improve COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake 2.3.1. Background [10](#B10-vaccines-11-01180)]. However, actual rates of COVID-19 vaccination have been low. 2.3.2. Approach [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01180)]. HCD is central to UNICEF's work to find inclusive and person-centered solutions. To address vaccine-related issues in Ghana, UNICEF partnered with Common Thread Communications to develop a HCD initiative to improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake. [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-01180-f004)). 2.3.3. Results [Table 3](#vaccines-11-01180-t003)outlines the critical issues addressed with communities and frontline health workers through the process, and [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-01180-f005)shows an example of the messaging developed as part of the initiative. 2.3.4. Key Lessons Learned 2.4. India Case Study: Facilitating Community-Led Appropriate COVID-19 Behavior and Vaccination Linkages for Marginalized Communities across India through Risk Communication & Community Engagement 2.4.1. Background [12](#B12-vaccines-11-01180), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-01180)]. In public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, RCCE is a key participatory approach to meaningfully engage communities facing a particular health-related threat to ensure that they have accurate, timely information, advice, and solutions [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-01180), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-01180)] delivered through trusted sources and channels. RCCE has been one of the key pillars of UNICEF's COVID-19 response [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01180)]. 2.4.2. Approach [17](#B17-vaccines-11-01180)]) and Nomadic Tribes, and minority communities who have been further marginalized by the pandemic. [Figure 6](#vaccines-11-01180-f006)shows examples of the types of posters and information shared as part of the project. [Supplementary Materials (S1-S4)](#app1-vaccines-11-01180). 2.4.3. Results [Table 4](#vaccines-11-01180-t004). [Figure 7](#vaccines-11-01180-f007). While the results at aggregate level are uniform for both men and women, considering the socially disadvantaged position of women, the findings indicate that the program was effective in increasing vaccination rates among women. Other vulnerable groups such as persons with disabilities (PWD), pregnant women, and the transgender/non-binary population have reported increases in vaccination of 30%, 43% and 30%, respectively. 2.4.4. Key Lessons Learned 3. Discussion [18](#B18-vaccines-11-01180), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-01180)]. UNICEF in collaboration with partners of the RCCE Collective Service have developed global open-access toolkits and resources to support RCCE efforts that will support countries in future pandemic preparedness [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-01180), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-01180)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-01180)]. In recent years, the approach has been increasingly applied to co-design solutions that go beyond immunization to address other public health issues like maternal and child health interventions by centering the person and community experiencing the barrier or problem [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-01180), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-01180), [23](#B23-vaccines-11-01180)]. UNICEF has supported countries to institutionalize the use of HCD including integrating it into training curriculums of national health institutes, paving way for some Governments to establish behavioral science centers anchored on the HCD approach. UNICEF shares publicly available resources around how to use HCD to address challenges related to community demand for basic health services such as immunization [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-01180), [25](#B25-vaccines-11-01180)]. 4.
