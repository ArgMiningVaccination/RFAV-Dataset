Marma knowledge is the basis of knowledge in acupuncture within Chinese Medicine. Marmas are 107 vital points in the body where the life force energy is concentrated and are considered to be where the subtle body meets the physical body and consciousness - such as where the flesh, veins, arteries, tendons, bones and joints meet.

For further relaxation, soft music is played and essential oils or herbal transdermal creams maybe used. The practitioner conducts a \"reading\" of the akras. The practitioner tests and senses which akras are flowing well and those that may be too open, too closed, or possibly holding specific qualities within the akra itself. Vedic Chants or Sound Healing may be added by Tibetan Bowls, Bells or Chimes as well as Native American Hand-drum or Vibrational Tank Drum. Tuning Forks may be added. As all life around us can be influenced by intention, so too can the energetic body be influenced.
