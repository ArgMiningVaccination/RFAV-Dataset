Qi Gong or meditative practices were used for healing purposes; later, when society became more agrarian and people lived in villages, additional therapies were incorporated -- [herbal medicine](MoreaboutHerbology.html), then [acupuncture](MoreaboutAcupuncture.html). Integrative Chinese Medicine (ICM) uses other healing methods in addition to Chinese Medicine. Chinese medicine includes the use of acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping, moxibustion (also known as moxa), breathwork, Qi Gong/Tai Chi, dietary recommendations, and self-care techniques, to name a few. By working with the body gradually and with few side effects, the concurrent use of several Chinese healing methods provide a synergistic effect and improves overall health and well-being. Traditional Chinese Medicine not only treats the physical body, but also treats the mind and spirit, helping to bring the whole body to a higher level of function and improved state of balance - what Western medicine calls improved metabolism, stronger immune system and organ function, and homeostasis. ICM can treat a wide variety of conditions, such as anxiety, stress, irritable bowel syndrome or other digestive symptoms, acne, headache and pain. For a more complete list of conditions, please see [Conditions Treated](conditions.html).
