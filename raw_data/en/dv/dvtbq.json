Now, it seems hard to keep them straight. In less than a year, we have gone from learning about the virus [to administering shots to more than 4 million people](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)\u2014and we still don't know everything, especially in light of the [new variants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html) that keep popping up. Currently we have two\u2014by Pfizer and Moderna\u2014authorized for use in the US. A third being administered with Johnson & Johnson, who just [announced interim Phase 3 trial results](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial), is likely to be submitted in a request for emergency use authorization (EUA) in early February. Another, by AstraZeneca, is currently undergoing late-stage trials in the U.S., and has earned EUA in the UK. With so many different vaccines in the news\u2014and the fact that [60%, up from 51%, of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/) are on board with getting one\u2014it can be hard to keep track of how they stack up. Here's how the vaccines compare at a glance. The [Pfizer](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/index.html) Vaccine Type of vaccine: Messenger RNA ( [mRNA](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a34909218/mrna-covid-vaccine-safety/)) Who it's for: Recommended for people 16 years and older. Who should not get the vaccine: The [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) that those who have experienced a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction, whether severe or not, to any ingredient in this vaccine. Efficacy: 95%. Number of shots: 2 Time between doses: 21 days Potential side effects: Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, chills, tiredness, headache. Worth noting: According to the CDC, immunocompromised individuals may still receive the Pfizer vaccine, but it is advised that they are counseled about \"unknown vaccine safety profile and effectiveness in immunocompromised populations\" and \"potential for reduced immune responses.\" It has also been reported that this vaccine is [slightly less effective](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.427998v1) against the South African variant. Last, if the second dose is not available to you at the 21-day mark, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html) you do have a grace period up to 42 days after the first dose to receive your second dose. But it's not optimal. The [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/eua-fact-sheet-recipients.pdf) Vaccine Type of vaccine: Messenger RNA Who it's for: Recommended for people 18 years and older. Who should not get the vaccine: Those with a known history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Moderna COVID19 vaccine. Efficacy: 94.1 % Number of shots:2 Time between doses:28 days Side effects: Pain, swelling or redness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (body aches), arthralgia (joint pain), chills, nausea/vomiting, tenderness at the armpit, fever. There have also [been reports](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a35060342/covid-vaccine-side-effects/) of a few people who've had dermal fillers having swelling at the filler site after receiving the vaccine. Worth noting: According to the CDC, \"immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished response to the Moderna COVID19 Vaccine.\" It is also reported that this vaccine is [not as effective against the variants](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.427948v1) in the United Kingdom and the Republic of South Africa. Last, if the second dose is not available to you at the 28-day mark you do have a grace period up to 42 days after the first dose to receive your second dose, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html). The [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/covid-19-phase-3-study-clinical-protocol) Vaccine Type of vaccine: [Vector vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html) Who it's for: Recommended for people 18 years and older. Who should not get the vaccine: Information not yet available. Efficacy: Studies have not been published yet, but [reports suggest](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial) it was 66% effective against moderate and severe disease overall (the efficacy varied by country); 85% effective against severe disease. Number of shots: 1 Time between doses: N/A Side effects: Pain at the injection site, fatigue, chills, fever, rash, nausea/vomiting, headache, myalgia (muscle aches), arthralgia (joint pain), dizziness, general itching. Worth noting: It is reported that the company is said to be looking to seek an EUA early next month; rollouts would begin after that is granted. The [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html) Vaccine Type of vaccine: Vector vaccine Who it's for: Recommended for people 18 years and older. Who should not get the vaccine: Information not yet available. Efficacy: Roughly 70% Number of shots: 2 Time between doses: 28 days Side effects: Pain and tenderness at the injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, feverishness, malaise and muscle aches. Worth noting: The trials of this vaccine have met with hiccups. In early September 2020, it was reported that clinical trials were paused for a [safety review](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/) after an adverse reaction was noted in a trial participant; the trial resumed. In November, [information was released](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca-oxford.html#:~:text=British%20researchers%20running%20the%20trial,a%20more%20promising%20dosing%20regimen.) that the trial included an error: One subset of participants\u2014all under age 55\u2014accidentally received a half dose of the first shot (but a full-strength second one). The data showed they were more protected from the virus than groups that received the full strength of both shots. This vaccine has EUA in the UK, but not yet in the U.S. [Some reports suggest](https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-be-approved-in-us-2021-1) that AstraZeneca may wait for results of a larger trial before submitting information to the FDA to request EUA.
