She's not afraid to share her story with the world, and she does it in a way that makes all women feel like they can be strong and powerful, too. This week she shared an update on her weight loss journey, which is helping even more people feel inspired by her example! She Shared Her Story Amy Robach is a journalist, author and television personality who has been sharing her weight loss journey with the world. She recently published a book titled The Big Life: Embracing the New Normal After Breast Cancer in which she talks about how she lost over 100 pounds after having breast cancer surgery. In addition to writing this book, Amy Robach also shared her story on Good Morning America where she talked about how she went from being overweight (and miserable) at 250 pounds down to 155 pounds by following a healthy diet plan and working out regularly at home with resistance bands--something that anyone can do! She Acknowledged Her Fears Robach, like so many other people, had to acknowledge her fears before she could move on with her weight loss journey. She was afraid of how others would judge her and what they might say about her body and appearance. She also feared that she would judge herself for being overweight in the first place--and this is a universal fear that many people have to overcome. She Made a Self-Care Plan If you're looking to make a lifestyle change and lose weight, the first step is creating a self-care plan that includes nutrition, sleep and exercise. A personal trainer or coach will help you structure your workouts so they are effective and efficient. They can also teach you how to use weights and machines properly so that they don't hurt yourself while exercising. A therapist or counselor is another great resource if you struggle with emotional eating (which many people do). They can help get to the root cause of why one might turn towards food in times of stress or anxiety--it could be related back to childhood trauma or something else entirely! She Maintained a Positive Attitude If you're struggling to lose weight and keep it off, don't be afraid to ask for help. It is okay to admit that you need a little extra support along the way. The good news? There are so many resources available now (including this article) that can help you stay on track and reach your goals. If life gets in the way of your healthy eating habits, don't let it get you down! Sometimes we all have bad days where nothing seems to go right--but if we let these setbacks derail us from our goals, then we'll never achieve them in the long run. Remember: one day does not make or break your entire journey; so pick yourself up and get back at it! When making decisions about what foods are best suited for our bodies or how much activity we should engage in each day, remember that there are no hard-and-fast rules when it comes down to individualized nutrition plans based on lifestyle factors such as age/gender/height/weight etcetera... She Took Control of Her Health Robach took control of her health by making a plan and sticking to it. She says that she \"made a choice to take care of [her]self\" and that she knew if she wanted to get healthier, she had to make changes in her diet and exercise routine. In addition, Robach also credits having a supportive husband who helped her stay on track as well as hiring a personal trainer who helped set realistic goals for her weight loss journey. The Takeaway: You Can Do This, Too! Amy Robach's journey is an inspiration to all women. She's a role model for other women and she's helping them achieve their goals by sharing her story. If you want to be able to share your story as well, then take action today! If you're ready to start losing weight and feeling better about yourself, check out our How To Lose Weight section for some great tips on how to get started on your own weight loss journey! It can be hard to accept help, but it's important to do so. Amy Robach may be known as Extra, but she's also a personal trainer and wellness expert. The actress recently shared how she lost weight \u2014 and how women can do the same. The 46-year-old host of CBS This Morning on Thursday shared a photo of herself on Instagram, dressed in workout clothes and smiling. She captioned the photo: \"It's hard to accept help, but it's important to do so.\" Robach said that her weight loss journey was not easy and that she had been struggling with her weight for years. But after she finished Weight Watchers, she started to lose weight more quickly. \"I started working out five days a week,\" Robach told PEOPLE in an interview published Wednesday. \"I did cardio like dance or step aerobics, and then I would do weights two days a week.\" Realize that anyone can change, no matter where they are in their weight loss journey. I was at a birthday party in the middle of a park, when I saw two women who were walking their dogs. I asked them how they were doing, and they both smiled and answered that they were fine. They then looked at me and said, \"You're not fat.\" I was taken aback. How could these women say something so mean? I knew that what they meant by this statement was that I wasn't fat enough to be considered a problem to society and health professionals. But at the time, I was still struggling with my weight loss journey. My body was an area that I hadn't yet figured out how to manage. After hearing this comment from strangers, I realized that there are many people out there who think that it's okay for people like me to be treated as less than human simply because of our size or shape. And perhaps even more shocking is the fact that some people don't even realize this is happening until they hear it from someone else! The truth is that anyone can change their body shape, no matter where they are in their weight loss journey \u2014 whether you're just starting out or have been at it for years! Don't beat yourself up for every slip-up or relapse. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Amy Robach admitted that her weight loss has been a struggle. It's not just the fact that she's lost the weight, but also she's struggled with how to maintain it. Robach has been on a journey to find her way back to health and happiness ever since she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2010. It's been a long road \u2014 and one that has taken her through many setbacks and frustrations. But as she told The New York Times: \"It's not about being perfect.\" Robach said that she doesn't want to feel guilty for every slip-up or relapse. She wants to be happy with where she is and where she is going \u2014 which means learning from her mistakes along the way. Here are some tips from Robach on how we can all avoid falling into self-destructive patterns: Don't beat yourself up for every slip-up or relapse. Once you get over that hump, it's time to move forward, not continue beating yourself up over something small like eating an extra cookie at lunch or skipping breakfast before work. Realizing that we all have the power to change and make our own lives better is empowering The truth is, the best way to lose weight is the same way you've always lost weight \u2014 with hard work. But when it comes to losing weight and keeping it off, there's one thing that can make all the difference: motivation. \"Motivation is what drives us,\" says Amy Robach, who lost 40 pounds after having her son Gabriel and went on to become a host and correspondent for ABC News' \"Good Morning America.\" \"If you're not motivated, nothing else matters.\" Robach has transformed her body and her life through a combination of fitness, self-confidence and support from family, friends and coworkers. And now she wants to help other women do the same by sharing her story with them in hopes of inspiring them to take control of their health. Conclusion We hope Amy Robach's weight loss story has inspired you to take control of your health. She is an amazing example of what can happen when we put our minds to it and take action. We all have unique challenges, but the most important thing is that we don't let them stop us from achieving our goals!
