They can take place in groups or individually. The person being guided is usually in a quiet comfortable place when receiving the meditation. A lot of people find meditation very difficult on their own especially if they are just starting out. A good guided spiritual meditation can guide people on breathing correctly, make sure they are properly grounded and protected from negative energies and then take that person on a journey. Most guided spiritual meditations have a theme such as clearing chakras, meeting spirit guides, bringing abundance into your life, finding your life purpose, making a decision, dealing with stress, depression or illness. The range is vast. There is no hard and fast rule. The majority do have gentle background music on them as this aids the relaxation of the meditator and blocks out outside noise and enables a more complete submersion into the meditative state but this is not essential and a lot of people find music distracting and would prefer to focus on the voice of the guide. A lot depends on the comfort and stamina of the person meditating. A person new to meditating might think that 10 minutes would be their limit but a lot last as long as 30 minutes or longer. The concentration can waiver after a long period of time and interruptions might become more likely if a meditation lasted longer than 30 minutes. Having said that, there are no hard and fast rules on this. When communicating at spirit level, one should always fix your intention prior to meditation that you will be protected at all times and only communicate with the highest and purest of spirits. A lot of guided spiritual meditations do not involve communicating at spirit level and are more about mindfulness and relaxation so protection would not be necessary in these cases. If you spend a lot of time meditating at the spiritual level, it can result in a loss of grounding which can leave one exposed to negative experiences sometimes referred to as Kundalini syndrome which can cause psychological problems or mental issues. So grounding involves making sure that your feet are firmly on the ground and you feel connected with the earth (or Mother Earth or Gaia as some people like to imagine). This ensures that you are not left too much in the spirit world. "}
