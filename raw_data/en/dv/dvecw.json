Belitsky, a popular and respected professor as well as a skilled clinician and administrator, is \"a teacher's teacher and a doctor's doctor,\" Dean and Ensign Professor of Medicine Robert J. Alpern, m.d., said in announcing the appointment. \"He is an out- standing educator who has received many of the top teaching awards from Y ale \u2014one of them twice \u2014and from his colleagues in psychiatry nationally,\" Alpern said. \"He is also a highly effective administrator, adept at framing issues and working through them with col- leagues in many departments, at con- ceiving and launching new programs, and at sorting and extracting the data needed for good decision making.\" A native of Philadelphia, Belitsky received his bachelor's and medical degrees from the University of Florida. He came to Y ale as a resident in 1979 and continued on as a fellow in foren- sic psychiatry until 1983.Richard Belitsky Belitsky , p a g e 8 A faster pipeline speeds new treatments from lab to patient Gifts, page 8A love of Y ale, a vision forits future Unprecedented giftsprovide funds for ve professorships Having had a remarkably wide-ranging career during which he headed companies involved in everything from small aircraft to shipbuilding to cement, Greenwich, Conn., businessman and philanthro- pist David W. Wallace has some dif- culty arriving at a term that neatly sums up his profession. But when pressed, he nally settles on \"lucky.\" In a stroke of good fortune for the School of Medicine, Wallace and his wife, Jean McLean Wallace, have donated $6 million to endow two new professorships, adding to three professorships they have previously funded since 2000: the Jean McLean Wallace Professorship, held by Margaret K. Hostetter, m.d. , profes- sor and chair of the Department of Pediatrics; the Anita O'Keefe Y oung Professorship of Women's Health, held by Charles J. Lockwood, m.d. , professor and chair of the Depart- ment of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences; and the Robert R. Y oung Professorship, which is currently un lled but has been designated for a faculty mem-ber involved in research in ophthal- mology and visual science. Largely unrestricted bequests to Y ale from John William Sterling in 1920 and Eugene Higgins in 1975 have endowed 10 Sterling Profes- sorships and four Higgins Profes-sorships at the medical school. But the Wallaces' combined gifts, $13.5 million speci cally earmarked to support ve professorships, are unprecedented at the School of Medicine. \"The funding of ve professor- ships by a single donor is excep-tional in magnitude and places the Wallaces in a small and select group of supporters of Y ale School of Medicine,\" says Dean and Ensign Professor Robert J. Alpern, m.d. \"Their gifts have allowed us to at- tract key faculty to Y ale and will be instrumental in those faculty mem-bers' success.\" Wallace has also been an im- portant donor to his alma mater. Just prior to his 50th reunion, he and Jean gave a $9 million gift for the renovation of Branford College, whose Gothic-style Y ork Street wing is now called Wallace Hall. In all, the Wallaces have donated over $30 million to Y ale.Small biotechswith big ambitionshasten drug testing The fl ow of discoveries from the medi- cal school's labs to patients in need is proceeding at a blistering pace \u2014in the last four years, no fewer than ve new therapies invented by School of Medicine researchers have advanced into human clinical trials. Y ale's Of- ce of Cooperative Research (ocr ), which takes the lead in licensing the fruits of faculty labors to biotechnol- ogy and pharmaceutical companies, currently lists a dozen additional potential therapies under license and poised to start early stage clinical trials (see graphic, p. 6). This unprecedented success in pushing investigators' nds out of the lab comes from ocr 's strategy of partnering with up-and-coming biotech companies, and in some cases catalyzing the creation of brand-new companies tailored to the needs of particular therapies. The result has been a signi cant contraction of the time it takes to move new treatments from licensing to rst trials in humans. For example, Proteolix, founded in 2003 to com- mercialize compounds discovered by Craig M. Crews, ph.d. , associate pro- fessor of molecular, cellular and devel- opmental biology and pharmacology, took just 18 months from its founding to obtain Food and Drug Administra- tion (fda ) approval to test one of Crews's cancer drugs in people. Likewise, Achillion Pharmaceu- ticals, a start-up company whose rst by Yung-Chi \"T ommy\" Cheng, ph.d. , the Henry Bronson Professor of Pharmacology, began a Phase I trial of the drug to treat hivaids only a year and half after the company's inception.

Surgeons prize decisiveness and independence of mind, but Moss is out to trans- form the way his colleagues choose the procedures they use to treat sick children. Instead of relying largely on personal experience or custom, Moss wants pediatric surgeons to base clinical decisions on sound sci-entific studies of what works best. This seems like common sense in an age when medical journals routinely publish clinical guidelines derived from large, rigorous drug trials. But according to Moss, surgery journals mostly report experience, not science. \" At surgical meetings, some very experienced surgeon whom every-one reveres will talk about his last 100 cases of some procedure, and say, 'I think you should do it this way, because that's how I do it, and I get good results.' And everyone will go home and do it that way,\" says Moss, who came to Yale from Stanford Uni-versity School of Medicine four years ago. \"Experience is a very important component of judgment, but you can't confuse experience, and its limitations, with real science.\" Rebel with a cause To Moss's dismay, \"real science\" is scarce in his field. When he and colleagues reviewed over 80,000 studies in pediatric surgery pub-lished from 1966 to 1999, they found only 134 randomized con-trolled trials. As reported in 2001 in the Journal of Pediat- ric Surgery , only 16 of these trials compared two procedures, and most were poorly designed. Moss's campaign for evidence- based surgery arose from his own uncertainty about treating perforat- ing necrotizing enterocolitis ( nec), an inflammation of the gastroin-testinal tract that affects roughly one in 20 premature babies. If the disease progresses to the point that intestinal tissue dies and perforates, between a quarter and a half of these children die from overwhelm-ing bacterial infections. For 30 years, surgeons debated the relative merits of two treatments \u2014remov- ing infected and dead tissue versus inserting a drain to clear stool and pus\u2014but no researcher had ever done a controlled study to find out which approach saves more lives. \"I read everything published on the subject and realized that there was no scientific evidence to tell us what to do, and if there was going to be any, I'd better generate it,\" Moss says. So six years ago, while still at Stanford, Moss launched a 15-center study comparing the two options. The May 25 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine reported the results: the two proce- dures have virtually the same sur-vival rate, about 65 percent. The research shows that invest- ing time and resources to develop better operations for perforated nec is probably not worthwhile, says Moss. \"Once the illness has reached perforation, the die is cast. We need to redirect our energies into identi- fying which infants will develop perforation and target this group with new therapies.\" With a $1 million grant from the Glaser Pediatric Research Network funded by the Gerber Foundation, Moss has begun a six-center study to do just that. But as the first randomized and controlled multi-center trial compar-ing pediatric surgical procedures, the new study established the more fundamental point that surgeons, like other physicians, can and should test their strategies in clinical trials, Moss says. Moss surmises that his noncon- formist streak stems from his study of literature as a Stanford under-graduate. \"If you're immersed in the culture of surgery, it can be difficult to stick your head out of the sand and say, 'Wait a minute, this whole field is looking at things the wrong way,'\" he says. \"Literature helps you look at what you do in your daily life in a broader perspective.\"Lifelines Larry MossWhen weighing treatment options, surgeons should look to trials, not tradition, says Yale's Larry Moss.Students weren't the only ones cel-ebrating when the School of Medicine held its Commencement ceremonies on Harkness Lawn last May. Many of their mentors were also given recogni- tion as great educators. Professor of Medicine Herbert S. Chase Jr., m.d., who left the School of Medicine at the end of June after shaping the medical school's cur-riculum for six years as deputy dean for education, received an especially tting tribute when he was awarded the Bohmfalk Prize for basic sci-ence education. Andre N. Sofair, m.d., m.p.h., assistant professor of medicine, won the Bohmfalk Prize for clinical teaching. Mark D. Siegel, m.d., associ- ate professor of medicine, won the Leonard T ow Humanism in Medicine Award. Two people won the Leah M. Low- enstein Award for promoting humane and egalitarian medical education: Nancy R. Angoff, m.p.h., m.d. , as- sociate dean for student affairs, and, for the second year, Catherine Chiles, m.d. , associate clinical professor of psychiatry. The Francis Gilman Blake Award for outstanding teaching of the medi- cal sciences went to Interim Chair of Internal Medicine David L. Cole- man, m.d., and the Betsy Winters House Staff Award went to Robert W. Chang, m.d. , chief surgical resident. Professor of Internal Medicine Fred S. Gorelick, m.d. , received the Alvan R. Feinstein Award for an outstanding teacher of clinical skills.Superb teaching is rewarded at graduation winner of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978 and a merit award from the National Institutes of Health in 1991. Founded in England in 1660 by Christopher Wren, Robert Boyle and other luminaries, the Royal Society is the world's oldest scienti c academy in continuous existence. More than 60 Nobel laureates are among the 1,400 fellows and foreign members on the Society's roster, which through its history has included Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Darwin, Ernest Rutherford, Albert Einstein, Dorothy Hodgkin, Francis Crick, James Watson and Stephen Hawking.Nigel D.F. Grindley, ph.d. , professor and former chair of molecular bio- physics and biochemistry at Y ale, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in May. In naming Grindley one of its 44 new fellows for 2006, the Society called his studies on site-speci c re- combination a \"landmark in the eld [that] have paved the way for further fundamental discoveries.\" Grindley does research on en- zymes that break apart and stitch to- gether strands of dna when genes are rearranged. In collaboration with his wife, senior research scientist Cath- erine M. Joyce, d.phil. , he has also carried out studies of dna polymerase, an enzyme involved in dna replication. Grindley received his under-graduate degree at Cambridge Univer-sity and his ph.d. at the University of London. He was a nato Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie-Mellon Univer- sity in 1974 and at Y ale from 1975 to 1978. He returned to Y ale in 1980 after serving as an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.

But just how far would people go to avoid being fat? Marlene B. Schwartz, ph.d., director of research and school programs at Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, and colleagues polled nearly 4,300 individuals across the weight spectrum \u2014from underweight to extremely obese \u2014and asked what they would sacri ce to not be fat. As reported in the March is- sue of Obesity, 46 percent of the respondents said they would give up a year of life, 30 percent would divorce their spouse, and 25 percent would forego bearing children. Some went further: 5 percent reported that they would prefer to lose a limb and 4 percent said they would rather be blind than obese. The researchers found anti-fat bias in all respondents, even those who are obese. \"The fact that even obese individuals exhibited a sig-ni cant implicit anti-fat bias sug- gests that they have internalized negative stereotypes, such as be- lieving they are lazy,\" says Schwartz, who adds that such stereotypes may undermine people's motivation to make healthy behavior changes. How immunity is MIFfed by malaria Half of the 2 million deaths from malaria each year result from se- vere anemia caused by the duplici- tous Plasmodium parasite, which not only destroys healthy red blood cells, but also blocks the production of new cells to replace them. New research shows Plasmodium adds insult to injury in accomplishing this latter task by turning the im-mune system against itself. Richard Bucala, m.d., ph.d. , pro- fessor of medicine and pathology, and collaborators discovered that the macrophage migration inhibi-tory factor ( mif), a key immune sys- tem protein that is often expressed at high levels during malarial infection, suppresses red blood cell production. Mice lacking the mif gene were better at regenerating red blood cells after malarial infec-tion, thereby curbing the severity of anemia and boosting their chance for survival. Bucala's group identi ed subtle variants of the human mif gene that lead to low or high mif levels during Plasmodium infection. The research, published in the May issue of the Journal of Experimental Medi- cine, points the way to a genetic test that could identify individuals prone to severe malarial anemia.Fred R. Volkmar, m.d. , a longtime Y ale faculty member and world authority in the diagnosis and treatment of au- tism, has been named director of the medical school's Child Study Center ( csc) and chief of the Department of Child Psychiatry at Y ale-New Haven Hospital for a three-year term. The csc is an internationally known research and treatment facility for children's mental health with ac- claimed programs in early childhood development, trauma, T ourette syn- drome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, mental retardation, autism and other developmental disorders. Volkmar, the Irving B. Harris Professor in the Child Study Center and professor of psychiatry, pediat-rics and psychology, came to Y ale as a fellow in 1980 and joined the medical school faculty two years later. At the csc, Volkmar directs an autism clinic that attracts patients from all over the world and conducts cutting-edge re-search on the basic biology of autism and its diagnosis and treatment. An editor of the Handbook of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders , Volkmar was the primary author of the autism section in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the standard guide to psychiatric diagnosis. In 2007, he will become editor of the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders , the eld's oldest academic journal. As a member of the National Research Council's Committee on Educational Interventions for Children With Autism, Volkmar made major contributions to the U.S. Department of Education's 2001 report Educating Children with Autism, which documented the effectiveness of early intervention programs. Volkmar succeeds Alan E. Kazdin, ph.d ., who has served as csc director since 2002. Kazdin has returned to teaching and research as a professor in the Department of Psychology at Y ale.Expert on autism is named new director of Child Study CenterA rapid, reliable test to make preterm birthssafer for mother and child Preterm birth is the leading cause of death and disease in newborns world-wide, but it is dif cult to prevent or to manage because premature labor can result from several causes, including infection and intrauterine infl am- mation. It is well known that infl am- mation is damaging to babies, but infl ammation itself has many causes. Sometimes infection leads to infl am- mation, but as often as not, other biological processes are at work. Because of this complexity, obstetricians treating mothers at risk for preterm birth must decide within a brief time window whether to prescribe anti-infl ammatory agents, antibiotics or both, while they simul- taneously weigh whether aiming for a quick delivery or slowing down labor with drugs will be better for the baby. Physicians nd their way through this clinical thicket by counting white blood cells ( wbc s) in a sample of amniotic fl uid or culturing a sample. However, these tests take time, and they provide a crude and unreliable measure of infl ammation. But new work using cutting- edge protein-chip technology by the husband-and-wife research team of S. Buhimschi, m.d. , and Irina Buhimschi, m.d. , both assistant professors in the Department of Ob- stetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, may soon make doctors' decisions surrounding preterm birth faster, easier and healthier for both mother and child. Irina Buhimschi says that relying on wbc counts or cultures to manage premature labor allows for \"educated guesses\" at best, and in 2000 she began exploring the newly emerging eld of proteomics \u2014the study of the struc- ture and function of proteins \u2014to nd a better way. She settled on a technique known as seldi (surface- enhanced laser desorption ionization), in which a biological sample, such as amniotic fl uid, is placed on a small aluminum strip coated with chemicals that bind proteins (see photo). The strip is then inserted into equipment that determines which proteins in the sample are most abundant and rapidly generates a protein pro le, a graph in which the most plentiful proteins are represented as peaks. The Buhimschis put seldi technology to use in a study reported in the February 2005 issue of bjog , a British journal of obstetrics and gynecology, in which they analyzed samples of amniotic fl uid that had been obtained during the 1990s from 77 women with symptoms of preterm labor and placed in cold storage. Seventeen of these patients, called the \"normal group\" in the study, had low wbc counts and normal cul- ture results when the samples were drawn, and these women eventually had normal deliveries. Sixty other women had preterm deliveries, but in a vivid illustration of the complexity of premature labor, only 21 (the \"dis- ease group\") had high wbc counts and cultures indicating infection; the remainder had low levels of wbc s and negative cultures, or had inconclusive test results \u2014negative on one and positive on the other. When the Buhimschis applied a statistical technique known as mass restricted (MR) analysis to the disease group's seldi -derived protein pro les, four peaks emerged that were not present in the normal group. T o test whether these proteins, all of which are involved in infl amma- tory pathways, could serve as reliable biomarkers to manage preterm labor, the researchers devised an \"MR score,\" assigning one point for the presence of any of the peaks in a sample. They then scored 24 additional amniotic samples, this time without knowing what the patient's outcome had been, and found that the MR score predict-ed with great accuracy which women had preterm births, and what the nature of their test results had been. In a more recent study, presented at the February meeting of the Soci- ety for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the Buhimschis tested fresh samples of amniotic fl uid taken from women with symptoms of preterm labor and found that their MR scores not only predicted preterm births but when those births would occur. \"An MR score of 2 indicates the median time for delivery is four days,\" says Catalin Buhimschi. \"If all four biomarkers for infl ammation are present, delivery occurs within hours. Our test has more clinical value because we can obtain results in half an hour.\" The Buhimschis hope this latest work, which won the 2006 March of Dimes Award for Best Research in Prematurity, will add momentum to their efforts to move their technique into clinical practice, and they are now exploring the use of seldi for the diagnosis and management of other prenatal conditions, such as preeclampsia. In a scienti c bonus, one of the proteins the Buhimschis identi ed with seldi Catalin Buhimschi says, \"seldi also opens the window for new studies to understand the biology of the process of infl ammation.\"New protein chips are a window on the womb Catalin and Irina Buhimschi have designed a protein chip that is providing new insights into preterm labor and other complications of pregnancy.

But autism is a so- called spectrum disorder\u2014symp-toms vary widely across individuals in both degree and kind. Early diagnosis is therefore challenging, yet critical for initiating specialized intervention programs, which have the greatest impact if begun as soon as possible. A new study by Harvey J. Kli- man, m.d., ph.d., research scientist in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, may make it possible to diagnose autism at birth. The research, conducted with research scientist George M. Anderson, ph.d., and colleagues at the Yale Child Study Center and published in the June 22 issue of Biological Psychiatry , shows that abnormal foldings known as trophoblast inclusions (dark purple area, center left; dark oval, lower right) appear three times more frequently in placentas of autistic children than in placentas of normal individuals. Further studies based on these ndings will seek to understand the relationship between placental abnormalities, brain development and the incidence of autism. Curbing the scourge of deadly diarrhea The human body favors balance. Too much of one thing or too little of another often tips the scales toward ill effects. So it is with the devastating diarrhea seen in V. cholera and E. coli infection. Toxins produced by these bacteria force cells in the intestine to secrete water and salts at rates faster than the cells can reabsorb them, lead- ing to severe dehydration that kills millions of children each year. In the June 20 issue of Proceed- ings of the National Academy of Sciences , John P . Geibel, m.d., professor of surgery, Steven C. Hebert, m.d., c.n.h . Long Professor and chair of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, and colleagues report that switch- ing on a speci c calcium-sensing receptor protein on the surface of intestinal cells with a jolt of cal- cium or with agents that modulate the receptor blocks fl uid loss and enhances absorption. According to Geibel and He- bert, stimulating the receptor de- stroys cellular signaling molecules triggered by bacterial toxins, and \"development of speci c agents to target this intestinal receptor could provide a new approach for treating life-threatening diarrhea.\"Program will infusegraduate trainingwith medical import Biology and medicine have been tightly intertwined since antiquity, but the bond between the two has loosened over the past few decades. With the rise of molecular biology and the more recent advent of the post-genomic era, the life sciences have become increasingly complex and specialized. It can be daunting for biologists to stay abreast of develop- ments in their own specialized realms, let alone keep track of trends in medicine. At the same time, increas- ing clinical demands and the need to master ever-changing medical tech-nology have placed limits on doctors' ability to keep up with the rapid pace of advances in basic biology. Nonetheless, many students entering graduate programs in basic biological disciplines are primarily motivated by a deep desire to improve human health. T o help bridge the gap between biological and medical train-ing, Y ale's Combined Program in Bio- logical and Biomedical Sciences ( bbs) has launched the Medical Research Scholars Program ( mrsp ), a new initiative aimed at helping graduate students in the life sciences embark on careers devoted to medically relevant research. \"As training in biology has be- come more specialized, it has gotten further away from clinical applica- tions,\" says bbs Director Lynn Cooley, ph.d. , professor of genetics, cell biology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology, who will act as mrsp co-director along with Michael J. Caplan, m.d., ph.d. , professor of cellular and molecular physiology and cell biology, and Joseph E. Craft, m.d., professor of medicine and immunobi- ology. \"The goal of this new program is to bring medical training to gradu- ate students learning basic science, including exposure to patients who are dealing with diseases or disease treatments. The hope is that this will inspire the students to direct their basic research projects toward the goal of helping those people,\" Cooley says. The mrsp has been given a head start with an $800,000 grant from the \"Med Into Grad\" initiative of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( hhmi ), an effort to increase under- standing of medical issues among researchers working toward the ph.d. degree in biological science. The mrsp program will enroll eight to 10 students per year \u2014half rst-year and half second-year students \u2014in clinically oriented coursework and \"mentored clinical experiences,\" during which they will interact with patients under the guidance of physician-scientist faculty members who actively treat patients while carrying out basic research on the biology of human disease. OrLando Y arborough, a graduate student in genetics with a research interest in hypertension, says that he has carefully chosen courses, mentors and laboratory rotations to comple- ment his clinical interest. But Y arborough, who is begin- ning his fourth year at Y ale, worries that his and other graduate students' experience with patients and medi-cally relevant courses is often a matter of \"happenstance,\" and he welcomes the new program's more formal route to medical enrichment of the cur- riculum. \"Even though I'm as close as I possibly can get to clinical relevance, the exposure is not directed,\" Y arbor- ough says. \"The strength of this pro- gram is the intention from the outset to strategically expose and train ph.d. students in clinical pathology and patient interaction.\" One possible bene t of programs like the mrsp will be a quicker trans- lation of discoveries in basic biology labs to useful treatments for patients, says John D. Alvaro, ph.d. , lecturer in psychiatry and administrative direc- tor of bbs. \"Scientists are not trained to know all the rami cations of their own discoveries, or to be able to move them forward,\" Alvaro says. \"Bridging basic science and medicine is one way to change this.\" Students have greeted the mrsp initiative with enthusiasm. Out of 102 new students entering the BBS program in the fall, 27 applied for the mrsp ; in the current rst-year class of 78, 13 applied. \"This response is a great indication that the program is hitting a chord and providing an op-portunity that is quite timely, \" says Cooley. When the mrsp 's rst 10 students enter the program this fall, they will face some familiar challenges as they tackle courses in physiology and cell biology. But they will also have the unusual opportunity to meet patients who may one day bene t from their discoveries. \"Students may be inspired by this kind of experience in terms of what kinds of projects they choose to work on,\" says Cooley, \"based on knowledge not just of disease mecha- nisms, but of people who have those diseases.\" Khalid Fakhro, a second-year student who works alongside Y arborough in the laboratory of Richard P . Lifton, m.d., ph.d., chair and Sterling Professor of Genetics, is in the rst cadre of mrsp students. \"Now more than ever, it is imperative to be trained both in the clinical eld and the rigor of scienti c research,\" says Fakrho. \"I'm very proud and happy to be part of the group of students who will receive this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"John Alvaro and Lynn Cooley are launching a new program to give graduate students in biology a broad exposure to medicine. Brian R. Smith, m.d. , a physician- scientist who joined the Y ale faculty in 1989, has been named chair of the Department of Laboratory Medicine and chief of laboratory medicine at Y ale-New Haven Hospital for a three-year term that began on July 1. Members of the Department of Laboratory Medicine study the molecular and cellular constituents of blood and other body fl uids to improve the diagnosis and treat- ment of disease, and to gain further insights into the causes of disease. The department also oversees the School of Medicine's clinical laboratories, in which nearly ve million tests are performed each year for Y ale-New Haven Hospital and other national and regional health care centers. The faculty also teach the core courses in Blood cell researcher is named new chair of Laboratory Medicine laboratory medicine and microbiol-ogy taught to medical students. Smith, professor of laboratory medicine, medicine and pediatrics, received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School and com-pleted his internship and residency in internal medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. He completed fel- lowships in hematology, oncology and research pathology at the Brigham, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital in Boston. He has served as vice chair of the Department of Laboratory Medicine since 1997. Smith's research has focused on how blood platelets and white blood cells, which adhere to one another during infl ammation and blood coag- ulation, interact in health and disease. In approximately 150 journal articles he has explored how the combined actions of these cells may contribute to disorders of the blood and cardio-vascular system, metastatic cancer, and complications of blood transfusion and circulatory bypass during cardiac surgery. Smith succeeds Peter I. Jatlow, m.d. , professor of laboratory medi- cine and psychiatry, who has headed the department since 1984. During Jatlow's tenure, the department's research funding increased almost 20-fold. Jatlow, an expert on drugs of abuse, will continue to direct the department's clinical chemistry laboratory.Brian SmithBiology, medicine unite in new grad M@Y_July_Aug06_BG_gr1.indd 5 8/14/06 Applied Spine T ech- nologies, another young company, is poised to begin human trials of the M-Brace, an implantable device invented by professor of orthopaedics and rehabilitation. The M-Brace stabilizes the spine to relieve chronic low-back pain. Because start-ups can garner ven- ture capital based on a few promis- ing clinical candidates or an exciting technology, small biotechs are driving the most focused and aggressive de-velopment of new treatments, says Jon Soderstrom, ph.d. , managing direc- tor of ocr . \"We know that the most important thing we can be doing in medicine right now is developing new therapies,\" Soderstrom says. \"What we're seeing is that the time frame that a biotech takes to do that is run- ning about half of what we see in the traditional pharmaceutical industry.\" The intense focus of small biotechs on just a few compounds bene ts academic researchers looking to quickly translate their work to new medicines, says John W. Puziss, ph.d. , ocr 's director of technology licens- ing. \"When we license a compound or technology to a start-up, that com- pany raises tens of millions of dollars committed to taking that compound to market,\" says Puziss. \"Where big pharma might take 5 years to get an invention into the clinic, investors in doing business in Connecticut have their roots in Y ale research. Y ale's success story starts with the impressive research of its faculty, ocr 's Puziss is quick to point out. And their efforts have been reward- ed\u2014royalties from the hiv/aids drug Zerit, the brainchild of William H. Prusoff, ph.d. , professor emeritus and senior research scientist in the Department of Pharmacology (see re-lated story, p. 8), provided the bulk of the funds to build the Anlyan Center, the medical school's main research facility, completed in 2003. But money isn't the main point of ocr 's efforts, Puziss emphasizes. \"There are a number of examples in our pipeline now entering the clinic that could very well reach the marketplace \u2014and save lives,\" he says. \"That's what we're all about.\"small companies want to see results in 2 years.\" If a biotech's drug is promising in early-stage clinical trials, rights to the drug \u2014and sometimes the entire bio- tech company \u2014may be acquired by a traditional \"big pharma\" rm. Such acquisitions ll out big companies' research and development pipelines, but the bigger rms' greater expertise in manufacturing, marketing and dis- tribution also ensure that useful drugs will reach the doctors and patients who need them. Y ale picked up on this drug- development trend early on, says Paul R. Pescatello, j.d., ph.d., president and ceo of New Haven-based biosci- ence advocacy group cure (Connecti- cut United for Research Excellence). \"Historically, Y ale worked well with big pharma, and ocr understood pretty quickly that the more little compa- nies they could seed, the more they'd increase the odds of the research being picked up by big pharma to be devel- oped and ultimately marketed.\" A bonus for New Haven is the fact that most of the new companies licensing Y ale discoveries are local, a big plus for the area's economy. By bringing together scientists with entrepreneurs and venture capital-ists, ocr has helped launch 30 or so companies that form the core of New Haven's biotech cluster, and most of the 49 biotechnology companies now Pipeline continued from page 1 John Puziss (left) and Jon Soderstrom (right) of Yale's Of ce of Cooperative Research say that a new paradigm of drug develop-ment is moving treat- ments faster from labs to patients.

He has been deputy chair of the psychiatry department since 2001, where he has been deeply involved in teaching both medical students and residents.He has served on numerous committees including the Medical School Admissions Committee, the Educational Policy and Curriculum Committee, the Graduate Medical Education Committee and the Physi- cian Associate Program Curriculum Committee. He also chairs the Committee on Physician Health at Y ale-New Haven Hospital. His teaching awards include the Charles W. Bohmfalk T eaching Prize in 2002, the Francis Gilman Blake Award in 1998 and again in 2000, induction into the medical school's Society of Distinguished T eachers in 2002 and the Irma Bland Award for Excellence in T eaching Residents from the American Psychiatric Association in 2005. The School of Medicine's Class of 2000 chose Be- litsky as its Commencement speaker. Belitsky, who took of ce on July 1, succeeds Professor of Medicine Herbert S. Chase Jr., m.d., who an- nounced last December that he would be stepping down at the end of the academic year. According to David Wallace, a 1948 graduate of Y ale's Faculty of Engineering, the couple's gifts to the medical school are driven by gratitude for the medical progress they have witnessed in their lifetimes coupled with a recognition that continuing such advances will require substantial funding. \"T o have medical progress, you have to feed it money. It's the nature of the beast. Running labs, doing surveys, it's all expensive,\" Wallace says. \"But I think we're at a point in medicine where we're making leaps and bounds. In 1900 the life expec- tancy was about 50 years, but I had a friend die recently at 115! The quality of life has been improved by progress in medicine, and the length of life has been extended.\" Wallace resided in Branford Col- lege during his undergraduate career at Y ale, which was interrupted by World War II. He served as an of cer in the 1st Infantry Division and was awarded the Purple Heart. After the German surrender, Wal- lace remained in Germany, where his division oversaw the infrastructure and security for the Nuremberg war crimes trials. He returned to Y ale to complete an engineering degree, but soon decided to strike out in another direction. \"The one thing I learned in engineering school is that I was not going to be a good engineer, so I went to Harvard Law School,\" Wallace says. Myron Genel , m.d., profes- sor emeritus of pediatrics, has been appointed by Mike Leavitt, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections. The commit- tee provides recommendations for the responsible conduct of research involving human subjects. Genel served for 19 years as associate dean and director of the School of Medicine's office of government and community affairs. He is a former chair of the Association of American Medical Colleges' Council of Aca- demic Societies and the Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association. Aaron W. McGee , ph.d. , postdoc- toral fellow in the Department of Neurology, has received a Career Award in the Bio-medical Sciences from the Bur- roughs Wellcome Fund for his work on neural plasticity in the laboratory of Stephen M. Strittmatter, m.d., ph.d. , the Vincent Coates Professor of Neurology. The awards, estab- lished in honor of Gertrude B. provide $500,000 in \"bridging support,\" dis- tributed over five years, to sustain the research projects of senior postdoc- toral fellows as they move into Spollett , m.s.n., a.n.p., Section of Endo- crinology and Metabolism, was named Diabetes Educator of the Y ear at the 2006 annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association ( ada ). Spollett has conducted research on type 2 diabetes in black women, and has lectured nationally and internationally on diabetes man-agement from a nurse practitioner perspective. She is on the board of directors of the ada , and of the American Association of Diabetes Educators, where she served as chair of the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators. Hongyu Zhao , ph.d. , Ira V . Hiscock Associ-ate Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, has been elected a fellow of the Ameri- can Statistical Association ( asa ), a scientific and educational society established to promote excellence in the application of statistics. Each year, no more than one third of 1 percent of asa 's members are named fellows. Zhao's research interests are developing mathematical, statistical and numerical methods to address scientific questions raised in molecu-lar biology and genetics.Taking a job in New Y ork at the rm of White & Case after graduation \"for the magni cent sum of $3,600 a year,\" Wallace so impressed his client Robert R. Y oung, the chairman of Allegheny Corporation, that Y oung asked him to join his company as general counsel. From there, Wallace went on to work as a corporate manager at a succession of companies, including United Brands (now Chiquita Ba-nana), Piper Aircraft, Bangor-Punta and T odd Shipyards. But when he surveys a lifetime of memories, Wallace says that board- rooms never compete with Branford. \"Y ale was the greatest thing I ever did,\" Wallace says. \"I loved Y ale.\"Gifts continued from page 1Anti- HIV/AIDS compound discovered by awardee hasimproved lives worldwide The Peter Parker Medal, the School of Medicine's premier award, is named for an intrepid alumnus and gradu-ate of the Y ale Divinity School who traveled to China in 1834 as a medical missionary. By founding the Ophthal- mic Hospital at Canton, the Reverend Peter Parker, m.d., set the stage for the extraordinarily close and wide-ranging ties between Y ale and China that endure to the present day. The 2006 recipient of the Peter Parker Medal, William H. Prusoff, ph.d. , spent his working life at the lab bench instead of the bedside, but his contributions, like Parker's, have had a lasting global impact. In the 1950s, Prusoff, now profes- sor emeritus and senior research sci- entist in the Department of Pharma- cology, synthesized the rst antiviral compound approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration ( fda ). But he is best known for research conducted during the 1980s with his late colleague Tai-Shun Lin, ph.d., on d4T, a potent treatment for hivaids . Under the trade name Zerit, d4T forms part of the three-drug \"cock- tail\" that has extended the lives of tens of thousands of people with hiv aids worldwide. In a landmark decision in 2001, Bristol Myers Squibb, which devel- oped and markets Zerit, agreed to distribute the drug at no pro t to hivaids patients in the hard-hit countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Royalties to Y ale from sales of Zerit in developed countries provided the lion's share of funding for the construction of the Anlyan Center for Medical Research and Education, which houses state-of-the-art labora-tories and classrooms at the School of Medicine. Prusoff joined the medical school faculty in 1953. He received his under- graduate degree in chemistry from the University of Miami, his doctorate from Columbia University and an honorary doctorate from the Univer- sity of Cagliari in Italy in 1989. In 2000 the School of Medicine established the William H. Prusoff Professorship in Pharmacology in Prusoff's honor, a post now held by the Chair of the Department of Phar- macology, Joseph Schlessinger, ph.d. Prusoff \"exempli es the Y researcher,\" said Dean and Ensign Professor Robert J. Alpern, m.d., at an April ceremony and celebration at New Haven's Union League Caf\u00e9 marking the award of the Parker Medal. \"I am proud and thankful for Dr. Prusoff's ambassadorship on behalf of this institution.\"Pioneer of antiviral therapies is awarded the Parker Medal, school's highest honor William Prusoff (left), a trailblazer in pharmacology, receives the Peter Parker Medal from Dean Alpern.
