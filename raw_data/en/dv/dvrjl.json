True wellness arises when we re-align ourselves with the rhythms and elements of nature. In an increasingly chaotic and over-stimulating world, Rock & Rose Rituals bathing kits inspire you to create space to slow down, tune in and reconnect. Combining ancient wisdom with modern intuitive alchemy, Rock & Rose Rituals curates and creates earth integrated, light-infused botanical bathing blends and hand-poured natural candles in our studio situated in Pitlochry in the Heart of Scotland, on the Spine of Albion which to those who know will know it is a most beautiful and powerful ley line (earth energy line). Simple and natural, our products contain no synthetic chemicals or preservatives \u2014 because those don't belong on our skin. The ethos of the modern bathing renaissance is to move beyond bathing as simply cleansing ourselves, and toward bathing as an opportunity to drink in through our skin the varied benefits of plant medicine. As you open up your bathing ceremony ritual, you will not only be working with the physical attributes contained in your Rock & Rose Rituals kit, but the plant and Elemental devas will work with you to bring you precisely what is needed for you in the moment you make the connection and so each recipient will receive a healing entirely unique to them.
