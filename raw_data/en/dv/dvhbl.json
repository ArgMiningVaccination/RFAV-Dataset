Your muscles and your bones work in unison with one another, so if there is an issue with one bone or muscle, it can cause problems throughout the rest of your body. That is why here at Lighthouse Family Chiropractic in Hilliard, we use massage therapy to reduce pain and bring balance to the body. Massage therapy alleviates muscle pain and stiffness, promotes blood flow, and eliminates cramps and spasms. Massage therapy also helps those with chronic illnesses, injuries, training for sports, and overall wellness. How We Can Help A chiropractic massage can be beneficial for adults and even children. It improves circulation in the veins and arteries and often lowers blood pressure. It relieves pain, stress, and strengthens the immune system. Our team will recommend the right massage therapy for your condition. There are different types of massage therapy treatments that are used depending on the patient's condition. Types of Massage Therapy Swedish massage is a popular massage used to relax muscles and promote blood flow. It reduces joint and muscle stiffness and helps those recovering from pain to heal more quickly. Swedish massage is often used with patients that suffer from arthritis and joint pain, or for athletes recovering from sports injuries. This is one of the most popular therapies used at our chiropractic offices. Deep tissue massage is used to heal injuries from accidents, chronic pain, limited mobility, accidents, muscle strain, carpal tunnel, and chronic illnesses. It focuses on treating deep tissue layers and muscles. Our team will apply heat or ice packs to relieve the pain after a massage. Often, deep tissue massage is combined with exercise therapy that can be done at home to increase movement and reduce pain. This massage therapy is used to manage pain and increase mobility in more serious chronic illnesses and injuries. Sports massage is a regular massage with special stretching exercises designed to do at our office or home. Often, it is used to treat athletes and patients who work out. It can help the healing process of sports injuries and relieve muscle pain. Our chiropractors can design special exercises unique to the patients to help strengthen their arms, legs, back, and muscles. Trigger point therapy is a form of massage therapy used by our chiropractors to treat muscle tension, mobility, and pain. They rub or massage trigger points that cause pain in the body.
