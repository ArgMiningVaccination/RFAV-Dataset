The goal of the program is to arm you with the right tools to halt the development of heart disease and stroke. The chemicals from smoking damage the lining of your arteries, causing inflammation and narrowing, explains Dr. Morad. These chemicals cause the blood to thicken, which increases the likelihood of clots forming inside the veins and arteries. Smoking also raises your heart rate and blood pressure. All of this additional stress on the heart can lead to heart attack or stroke. \"The more you smoke, the higher your risk, \" says Dr. Morad. \"A person who smokes two packs a day increases his or her risk for heart attack or stroke by 900 percent. But the fact is, no number of cigarettes is good for your heart. Less than five cigarettes a day can increase your risk for heart attack or stroke by 40 percent. Even secondhand smoke is estimated to be responsible for 35,000 deaths from heart disease each year. \" Using forms of tobacco other than cigarettes can be equally as harmful. \"While cigar or pipe smoking is perceived as safer, they both contain the same carcinogens as cigarettes, \" says Dr. Morad. \"Smoking four cigars is equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes. Marijuana smoking increases heart rate and blood pressure. The rate of heart attack right after smoking marijuana is increased by up to five times. If you have a history of heart attack, smoking marijuana increases your risk for death by up to threefold. \" Electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes or vaping, have been promoted as a safe alternative to smoking. While e-cigarettes don't burn tobacco or tar, they still include nicotine and other potentially harmful chemicals that can increase blood pressure and your risk for heart attack and cancer. There is a silver lining. \"It's never too late to quit, \" says Dr. Morad. \"Your risk for heart attack and stroke declines 15 to 30 percent as soon as you quit. \"While quitting smoking can be very difficult, the good news is that we have lots of ways to help you quit.

Developed by StayWell.For many years, people from Omaha, the surrounding region and even across the world have counted on Nebraska Medicine to provide what we promise: \"Serious Medicine. Extraordinary Care. \" We love hearing and sharing success stories from our patients. When we can measure what we do against other academic medical centers, it provides additional reassurance that we are on the right track. And we are. For the last two years, we've earned the prestigious Bernard A. Birnbaum, MD, Quality Leadership Award, which recognizes safety and quality in patient care. People like to talk about the amount of growth and changes that have happened on our medical center campus in Midtown Omaha over the years. That's true, but I'd like to focus on the growth we've enjoyed throughout the metro area. In 2016, we opened a new location for our Brentwood Village clinic in La Vista. A few months later, we opened our Chalco clinic at 168th and Giles. Just about a month ago, we opened a brand-new clinic in Elkhorn, right next to Elkhorn South High School. Under construction right now is a new home for our Fonentelle clinic at 50th and Ames. The need for this access to our medical experts was apparent during this past winter's flu season. It was a bad one, but because we were able to use some of our new clinic space to treat flu patients, we helped hundreds of people get help quickly without having to go to the Emergency Department. Between regular appointments, scheduled illnesses and injuries that require a drop-in visit at one of our Immediate Care Clinics, we're working hard to make it easier and more convenient for people to see a Nebraska Medicine provider. That means more clinics closer to home, easier access to appointments and living up to our promise of \"Serious Medicine. Extraordinary Care. \" whether in a clinic, in the community or at the hospital.

Call our 800.922.0000 | NebraskaMed.com 3Advancing Medicine Through Research: How Y ou Can Get Involved Research is critical to the advancement of medicine. Without it, new therapies, treatments and even cures would not be possible. \"Research is an integral part of the Nebraska Medicine Health Network and its partner, the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), \" says Christopher Kratochvil, MD, vice president of research at Nebraska Medicine and associate vice chancellor for clinical research at UNMC. \"This partnership allows our clinicians to offer experimental and cutting-edge treatments that otherwise would not be available to our patients. \"It is part of our infrastructure, \" adds Dr. Kratochvil. \"With our new Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, our clinicians and researchers work in close proximity, which allows them to collaborate on studies to a greater degree and ultimately benefits the patient. Because many of our doctors are also involved in research, they have significant expertise and knowledge regarding the diseases they study. They may be the ones caring for patients as well as developing new therapies and protocols associated with treatment. \" Medical research must undergo several rigorous stages of study before a new discovery can make it to the bedside. Our clinicians and scientists are involved at each critical stage, beginning with basic science research. This involves research done in labs, such as the study of cells and microorganisms and their effect on the human body. Translational research, also commonly referred to as bench-to-bedside research, involves applying the discoveries found in the laboratory to the development of clinical trials that can be used in humans to determine the effectiveness of a medical strategy, treatment or device. Clinical trials involve multiple phases of study to determine the effectiveness and safety of a discovery. Each phase attempts to answer scientific questions and tries to find better ways to prevent, screen for, diagnose or treat a disease. Once a treatment has adequate safety and efficacy data, it can be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for review and potential approval. Patients of the Nebraska Medicine Health Network can participate in research in a number of ways, says Dr. Kratochvil. First, when you sign your consent form for treatment, you can give permission for any leftover blood samples from routine blood tests to be used for research. You can also agree to be contacted to learn more about clinical trials you might qualify for based on your history. \"Research, education and extraordinary patient care are all part of our core mission at Nebraska Medicine and UNMC, and each plays an integral role in allowing us to be a leading academic medical center and a significant resource to our community, both locally and on a global scale, \" says Dr. Kratochvil.

Recent research found that 9 in 10 strokes could be prevented by modifying these 10 controllable risk factors. 1. Blood pressure. Stroke risk is four to six times higher in those with high blood pressure. 2. Exercise. Working out keeps your blood flowing and your heart strong. Aim for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. 3. Cholesterol. High levels of LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol, and low levels of HDL, or \"good\" cholesterol, cause plaque buildup, which can clog arteries and lead to heart disease and stroke. 4. Diet. A Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fish and fruits, can help lower your stroke risk. 5. Smoking. All forms of tobacco can cause blockages in the artery leading to the brain. 6. Atrial fibrillation. Unmanaged atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat, can cause clots, leading to a stroke. 7. Diabetes. People with diabetes have 1.5 times the risk for stroke compared to those without the disease. 8. Obesity. Losing as little as 10 pounds can reduce stroke risk. 9. Drinking alcohol. Binge drinking increases bleeding risk. Limit alcohol to one drink per day for women and two drinks for men. 10. Stress. Mental stress can damage artery walls. Did Y ou Know? The Nebraska Medical Center is the only Nebraska hospital certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center by The Joint Commission. This means we can care for the most complex stroke cases 24/7 with a highly trained staff that specializes in comprehensive stroke care. For more information, go to NebraskaMed.com/Stroke.Sinus Pain: When to Seek Medical Help Sinus problems are one of the most common reasons people go to a doctor. Symptoms of a sinus infection include persistent nasal drainage that has turned a gray-yellow or green hue, a loss of smell, facial pain or pressure, a productive cough or fever and an inability to breathe through your nose. \"If your symptoms continue past 10 days, you should see your doctor or an ENT specialist, \" says Christie Barnes, MD, Nebraska Medicine ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist. \"Most cases of chronic sinus problems can be managed medically. However, in about a quarter of cases, people will need surgery to resolve their issues. \" The most common types of sinus surgery include two minimally invasive procedures called endoscopic sinus surgery and balloon sinuplasty. Neither requires incisions. Endoscopic sinus surgery involves opening the blocked sinuses with small instruments that go through the nostrils. The instruments can be used to remove tissue, shave away a polyp that's causing nasal blockage, or enlarge a narrow sinus opening to promote drainage. If the blockage is less severe, you may be a candidate for balloon sinuplasty, which involves using a balloon to dilate the sinus openings, notes Dr. Barnes. With both procedures, you can usually go home the same day and back to work in a week. news briefs Need an ENT? To schedule an appointment with one of our ENT specialists, call 800.922.0000.

While most hospitals care for many types of injuries, ranging from minor to severe, only the Nebraska Medical Center is designated as a Level I T rauma Center.Unmatched Trauma Care The Nebraska Medical Center has received national verification by the American College of Surgeons as a Level I Trauma Center, the only hospital in the state, recognizing the Trauma Center's dedication to providing optimal care for injured patients. It therefore provides not only the hospital resources necessary for trauma care, but also the entire spectrum of care to address the needs of all injured patients. Nebraska Medicine has 10 trauma surgeons who are double board certified in general trauma and surgical critical care. A Level I Trauma Center has an attending trauma surgeon in the building 24/7 who sees patients within 15 minutes of arrival. The Trauma Center is supported by more than 50 specialty physicians who are surgical experts in trauma, neurosurgery, reconstructive, (ear, nose and throat), and ophthalmology. The hospital also has a dozen physicians certified in pediatric critical care and pediatric surgery. \"Trauma affects nearly everyone, \" says P .J. Schenarts, MD, Nebraska Medicine trauma surgeon and trauma medical director. \"It's the leading killer of Nebraskans under the age of 44 and the third leading cause of death in our older citizens. But research shows that treatment at a Level I Trauma Center reduces the risk of death by 25 percent. \" 6 Advancing Health | Summer 2018 features CARDIOLOGYfeature CANCER CARE Blood Cancer Patients Given New Hope for a Cure After beating cancer last year, Nick Howe and his wife, Rachel, look forward to a long and healthy life with their new baby. Find a location near you. | NebraskaMed.com/Locations 7Nick Howe was running out of options. Diagnosed with lymphoma at age 31, he soon found out he was in for the battle of his life. \"When I saw the CAT scan, I couldn't believe it, \" says Howe. \"It was everywhere. It looked like I had run through a field of lymphoma. \" Howe began treatment at the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, where he underwent a five-month regimen of chemotherapy. This was followed by immunotherapy and then an autologous (using his own cells) stem cell transplant. Still, traces of the cancer continued to show up in scans. His last chance was an allogenic transplant, which meant he needed to find a donor match. But before they could proceed, Howe's doctor, Philip Bierman, MD, Nebraska Medicine hematologist and medical oncologist, presented another option that had just become available. A promising new therapy for people with certain recurring blood cancers had been doing so well in clinical trials that it had been fast- tracked by the Food and Drug Administration for rapid submission and early approval. The Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, which has a nationally recognized lymphoma program that specializes in research and clinical trials, was one of a handful of centers in the country providing this new option through clinical trials. Called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell therapy, it works by harnessing the body's own immune system to attack a tumor. Howe completed the therapy last November and remembers the first call he received from Dr. Bierman several weeks later. \"He was ecstatic, \" recalls Howe. \"He said, 'Your scan looks marvelous. There is no sign of cancer.'\" One hundred days later, there was more good news from new scan results: still no signs of cancer. The CAR T -cell therapy is now available here for all approved non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric/young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. \"We are really excited about offering this new therapy to our patients, \" says Matthew Lunning, DO, Nebraska Medicine hematologist and medical oncologist. \"Nationwide, patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who have received this therapy have had a complete remission rate of nearly 40 percent after six months. This is significant, as these are patients who have failed other available therapies. \" The therapy works by using the body's own T cells, which are white blood cells that help our bodies fight infection and cancer. In some patients with lymphomas and leukemias, their T cells don't recognize the cancer as being abnormal, which allows the cancers to grow. \"This new therapy allows us to take the patient's own T cells outside the body and restimulate them to fight their own cancer, \" explains Julie M. Vose, MD, Nebraska Medicine hematologist and medical oncologist, chief of the Division of Hematology/ Oncology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). During the first phase, the patient's T cells are collected in an outpatient procedure and sent to a lab where they are genetically modified and grown until there are millions of them. During this time, the patient also receives chemotherapy. The modified CAR T cells are then infused into the patient, where they multiply, attack and kill the cancerous cells. The CAR T cells, which remain in the body long after the infusion has been completed, help prevent the lymphoma or leukemia from relapsing. \"The potential for this new therapy is very promising, \" says Dr. Lunning. \"We hope to be able to expand it to the treatment of other cancers, like multiple myeloma and solid tumors. \" Today, Howe is cancer-free and feeling excited and hopeful about the future. \"This is such an emotional time, \" he says. \"First, we didn't know if we'd be able to have children. And until recently, I didn't even know if I'd still be here today. I'm so excited to be a new father and to experience this new stage of my life with my wife, Rachel. I have Dr. Bierman and his staff to thank. I trusted him wholeheartedly throughout this process. \" \"This new therapy allows us to take the patient's own T cells and restimulate them to fight their own cancer.\" Julie M.

Blood Cancer Patients Given New Hope for a Cure 8 Advancing Health | Summer 2018 features CARDIOLOGY After suffering five strokes in a matter of months, Tom Keeling and his wife, Sandy, began to wonder whether life would ever be normal again. The 65-year-old Keeling suffered from a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of dangerous clots that increase the risk for a stroke. Keeling's condition was doubly serious because doctors were also having difficulty regulating his blood thinners, which are critical to helping reduce clot formation. Keeling recently became one of the first handful of people at the Nebraska feature NEURO CARE Breakthrough Treatment for Stroke Patients Medical Center to receive an implant device called the WATCHMAN, an alternative to long-term blood thinners for people with atrial fibrillation. Since the device was implanted several months ago, Keeling's strokes have come to a halt. The Nebraska Medical Center is the first hospital in Omaha to offer patients the WATCHMAN implant. The device reduces the risk of stroke by closing off an area of the heart called the left atrial appendage. This helps keep harmful blood clots from forming in the appendage, entering the bloodstream and potentially causing a stroke. Over time, patients should also be able to stop taking blood thinners. \"This new device provides doctors with a breakthrough stroke risk reduction option for patients, \" says Andrew Goldsweig, MD, Nebraska T om Keeling and his wife, Sandy, celebrate after a successful surgery reduced T om's stroke risk.People with atrial fibrillation are five times more likely to have a stroke than the general population.

We also have cardiologists throughout the Omaha area and Denison, Iowa, who who specialize in heart disease prevention to help keep your wheart healthy. Breakthrough Treatment for Stroke Patients Medicine interventional cardiologist. \"Blood thinners are one of the biggest challenges for managing people with atrial fibrillation. Although patients need blood thinners to help prevent clot formation, blood thinners can cause bleeding as well as other adverse reactions or interactions with other medications. Forty-five days after the WATCHMAN is implanted, patients should be able to stop taking blood thinners while receiving stroke protection from the device that is equivalent to a full-dose blood thinner. \" Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia. It increases with age and occurs in as many as 1 in 10 people older than age 80. As the disease progresses, it can significantly increase your risk for a stroke and congestive heart failure. In fact, people with atrial fibrillation are five times more likely to have a stroke than the general population. To implant the device, the doctor inserts a small needle in the upper leg, followed by a narrow tube, similar to a standard stent procedure. The doctor then guides the device into the left atrial appendage of the heart. Patients commonly stay in the hospital overnight and leave the next day.Nebraska Medicine has a specialized clinic to evaluate people with atrial fibrillation to determine whether the WATCHMAN device is the right course of treatment. \"This gives us another tool to elevate our already high level of cardiac care, \" says Jessica Delaney, MD, Nebraska Medicine cardiac electrophysiologist. \"We are both looking forward to getting back to a life of normalcy, \" says Sandy. Since Tom's surgery, Sandy says planning a cruise is back on the bucket list. \"We are so grateful for all of the care we've received at the Nebraska Medical Center. It was a scary time for us, but everyone was so nice and put us at ease. The care was wonderful. \" Do Y ou Have Arrhythmia?

Their stories continue to linger. One of those stories involves a family that came to the Nebraska Medical Center nearly 25 years ago. Their daughter needed a bone marrow transplant. Although she didn't survive, her parents were so grateful for the care she received that every year since her death, they have asked people not to give them any gifts for birthdays or anniversaries, but instead to donate to the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Division of Oncology and Hematology. And people do. Over the years, gifts have arrived in small amounts \u2014 $25 or $50 at a time. Together, they combine in a big way to help other people, like clinicians, researchers, students, educators or other families. \"Walking down the hallways, it probably does speak to me differently because I know the people who made certain things happen, \" says Volk. \"I get to experience the fruition of donors exploring their interests and then making a gift. And then I get to see the intense pride those donors have when their gift makes an impact. \"I describe my job as making others' dreams come true. It's making the dream come true of the donor as well as the leadership on campus, who have great vision and know what needs to be done and how private support can make a difference. So it's helping bring these two things together. \"in the community This spring, the University of Nebraska Foundation began managing fundraising for Nebraska Medicine. Volk leads this effort, in addition to leading fundraising for the University of Nebraska Medical Center. She joined the foundation in 1993, after serving as the director of UNMC Alumni Affairs for five years. She shares some insight into her job and how your donations, big or small, can make a difference. What part of your job makes you most proud? It is the integrity of doing what we tell our donors we will do. That takes a strong partnership with the campus leaders and their commitment to make the donor's dreams come true. I'm really proud to be a part of the important work that's impacting lives every day and working alongside passionate people who are committed to exceeding expectations every day. How do private funds make a difference? Private funds make a difference at every level. They help construct buildings like the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center; they help buy state-of-the-art equipment that allows us to develop new protocols or gets us enrolled in new clinical trials; and they help with new basic needs for patients who arrive and might be in crisis by providing housing, food transportation or personal items. What kinds of gifts do you need most? A donor can make a difference in any area they care about. Some options include: the Patient Assistance Fund, our Child Life program, which helps families understand the health care environment and develop age-appropriate ways to cope, or gifts to advance research and innovation to improve clinical care.

Melissa Teply, MD, internist and palliative care specialist Chronic illness often involves facing many difficult issues and decisions for you and your family. At Nebraska Medicine, we have a palliative care team whose goal is to support you and your family as you make decisions about the kind of care that is best for you during this difficult time. We also provide medical expertise in managing your symptoms from a holistic viewpoint \u2014 meaning that we address your physical, emotional, psychological, social and quality-of-life issues. Palliative care is for anyone with one or more chronic, potentially life-limiting illnesses who has questions about his or her symptoms and care plan. Palliative care is different from hospice, as it is offered based on need, regardless of how long you may have to live, whereas hospice care is targeted to people with a prognosis that's limited to six months or less. The palliative care team works with the other doctors who are providing you care to ensure that your wishes are being carried out and that your symptoms are addressed. Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance cover the care you receive by the palliative care team, just like any other insurance. Do most men eventually need treatment for low testosterone levels? Christopher Deibert, MD, urologist If you listen to the radio, you might think that all men suffer from low testosterone (low T). While it's true that most men will experience a small drop in testosterone production each year after 40, the facts are only about 14 percent of men suffer from low T that is clinically significant. And of that group, only about 5 percent have symptoms severe enough to warrant treatment. The challenge in diagnosing low T is that it can cause symptoms that are very similar to other serious health problems, like sleep apnea or depression. These include symptoms like low motivation, decreased stamina and energy, low sex drive, depression, hot flashes, loss of muscle mass and mood swings. In the Men's Health Program, we specialize in helping men with low T and other health problems, such as erectile dysfunction and testosterone issues. We'll make sure your screening for low T involves a thorough physical exam and medical history to rule out other explanations for your symptoms. If it is determined that you may benefit from testosterone therapy, we take this seriously. In men who have severe symptoms, getting treatment can be life-changing. If you have been feeling fatigued, moody or depressed lately, come in for an evaluation. It could be your testosterone, or it could be something more serious. Maternity Care Designed Around Y ou When Maggie Baumann became pregnant with her second child, she knew exactly the type of birth experience she wanted: a natural childbirth in which she would be able to watch her new baby enter the world for the first time. She also felt strongly about breastfeeding and sharing some special skin-to-skin time after the delivery to connect with her newborn. But baby Henry had a different plan. An ultrasound performed at 36 weeks revealed he was breech. Nebraska Medicine obstetrician/gynecologist Katherine Finney, MD, discussed Maggie's options. In the end, she had a C-section with a clear surgical drape over her so she could watch the birth. She was also able to have skin-to- skin time and breastfeed immediately after. \"Dr. Finney kept me apprised of everything so that I felt like I was a part of the decision-making process, \" says Maggie. \"She was very conscientious and made sure I could have all of the things that were important to me. \" \"Everyone on our care team is invested in making childbirth a special experience for mom and baby, \" says Dr. Finney. \"We treat the expectant mother as an integral part of the team. \" Nebraska Medicine has all of the medical expertise and resources necessary to handle any type of pregnancy or complication that may arise, including maternal fetal and neonatal intensive care (NICU) specialists, as well as the most advanced technology to manage high-risk pregnancies and deliveries on site.
