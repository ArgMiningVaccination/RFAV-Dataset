If you completed study abroad courses at a U.S. sponsored program abroad, you must send transcripts. If you completed st udy abroad courses at a foreign institution, it is strongly recommended that you send a copy of your transcript via an official credential evaluation service. Course prerequisites: Course prerequisites vary by program . Typical prerequisites include biology (1001/ 1002 ), a separate course (BIOL Course s for majors (e.g. Chemistry 1014 for Majors) will be accepted. Some schools will require additional upper level biology or biomedical science courses . Courses such as psychology , sociology , and genetics may not be required by all schools but may be beneficial for MCAT preparation. Observation hours/experience: Medical schools like to see well -rounded applications and look for quality and depth of experiences rather than requiring a specific number of ho urs. Direct exposure to medicine , either volunteer or paid, shadowing, leadership, service to others and research are all recommended experiences . Minimum requirements to apply: The average GPA for acceptance to allopathic medical schools is a 3.68 . At Marquette, we find that students with about a 3.5 GPA or higher are academically competitive. MCAT scores are also important, as well as activities, experiences and other factors. Please keep in mind that grades earned in all college level courses must be reported, including repeated attempts of the same cou rse. All grades for repeated attempts are typically used in GPA calculations, so the GPA calculated for your application may not match your Marquette GPA . Letters of Reference (LOR) : Letters of recommendation packets can be sent through t he service pro vided in the pre- health advising office s. Requirements vary by school, but in general, we recommend obtaining letters from two science professors and one non-science professor whom you have had in class es, and one to two non-academic letters that speak to your experiences, character, interest in health care, etc . Check with each school to which you are applying for information on additional letters required . Personal Statement: A personal statement is a written reflect ion on why you want to be a physician and why you think you would be a good one. Character limits can be found on the AMCAS website, but t he limit is typically one page single -spaced. Interview: Competitive applicants may be invited to participate in an interview process. Interviews may include faculty members, current students of the program , and/or physicians . Interviews may be used to assess oral communication skills ; professional behaviors ; attitude ; knowledge of the profession and/or of health care overall; problem -solving skills ; passion for pursuing medicine, etc. Go to your interviews with prepared questions about the school/program that show your interest in the school (other than being close to home or low tuition). Deadlines: Timing is crit ical with medical school admissions. Most medical schools accept students on a rolling basis. Rolling admission means a program reviews applications as they arrive, so the earlier an application is submitted, the better the chance for acceptance. Students should complete their AMCAS application in early to mid -June. Keep in mind that the centralized application system may take four to six weeks for processing your application . Once the primary AMCAS application is completed and processed, students will be gin to receive secondary applications from medical schools. Secondary applications should be completed by mid to late August. Early Decision: Early decision is a binding option for applicants who have decided that a specific program is their first choice and that they will enroll if accepted. If a student decides to apply early decision, he/she is not able to apply to any other schools until an admission decision is made. This is not available for all programs. Data for Accepted Students (2012 Application Cycle): Average UG GPA : overall 3.68 ; science courses 3.63 (on a 4.0 scale) Average MCAT Scores: 9.8 in Verbal Reasoning, 10.5 in Physical Sciences, and 10.9 in Biological Sciences "}
