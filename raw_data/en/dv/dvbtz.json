The kidneys, liver, digestive system, skin, lungs, and lymphatic system all play the role of ridding the body of wastes and harmful toxins. However, we tend to expose ourselves to numerous toxicants and harmful substances, like alcohol, drugs, food additives, preservatives, and caffeine. etc. Excesses of these substances can overwhelm the body's natural detox system, consequently, the need to support it. This article provides seven practical tips on how to detox your body; let's get right into them. How To Detox Your Body Naturally? Below are seven practical ways by which you can detox your body naturally. - Limit alcohol and caffeine intake. - Sleep more; get up to 8 hours of night sleep daily. - Hydrate with water often. - Reduced your intake of processed foods and sugars. - Practice routine exercising. - Eat foods rich in antioxidants. - Include probiotics into your dietary plan. How To Detox Your Body As mentioned earlier, a body detox helps rid your body of these toxins and wastes. Below are effective tips to assist in your body's detox. Limit Alcohol And Caffeine Intake The liver, the primary body detoxifier, is responsible for ridding your body of the alcohol you consume. When you drink alcohol, the liver first metabolizes it into acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Then, the liver metabolizes it further into something safer, before the body excretes it. Many people take caffeine to stay active during the day, but this can pose as much health risks as benefits. It disrupts sleep patterns, diminishes energy levels, and stresses the liver, especially upon excessive consumption. Moderate consumption of alcohol and caffeine may benefit certain body functions. However, excessive intake overworks the liver and poses the potential for severe health issues. Sleep More Adequate sleep is crucial for optimizing the body's natural detoxification mechanisms. Sleep is essential and benefits various body organs, especially the brain and heart. Also, getting adequate night sleep allows the body to revitalize and eliminate toxins accumulated throughout the day. When you fail to get quality sleep, you prevent your body from recharging. This may cause the build-up of stress levels, which may increase your [risk of various diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0074774220300027#:~:text=Chronic%20stress%20produces%20an%20alteration,and%20type%202%20diabetes%2C%20associated)[1] especially heart disease, Alzheimer's, and anxiety. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html)[2] recommends that all adults get at least seven hours of sleep daily. Hydrate With Water Beyond satisfying thirst, water replenishes, helps flush toxins, aids digestion and nutrient absorption, promotes kidney health and functions, and lubricates joints. Hydrating with warm water or mixing with freshly cut limes or herbal tea can also help. Other fluids, like juices and soft drinks, contain other additives, added sugar, and preservatives that are parts of the toxins we are trying to detoxify. Moreover, the body undergoes different biochemical processes daily. Each yields waste that water helps flush out as sweat and urine. Failure to stay hydrated can cause the accumulation of these metabolic wastes, posing health risks. The recommended [water intake](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20356431/#:~:text=The%20recommended%20total%20daily%20fluid,preventing%20(recurrent)%20kidney%20stones.)[3] is 3000 ml for men and about 2000 ml for women.

These free radicals are the usual suspect in [oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204759/),[6] which is implicated in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases.
