Providing integrative wound care involves addressing physical, psychosocial, and spiri - tual components of the whole person. Several care models, including the Seven Balance Point Model, include holistic con - siderations, as well as promotion of physical health recommendations involving nutrition, sleep, exercise, and emotional, social, and spiritual well-being. The quality of life of patients with chronic wounds may be negatively affected by chronic and procedural pain, sleep disturbance, social, and emotional concerns. Although research into the role of integrative medicine in wound care is limited, experiences from other disciplines suggest wound pain may be addressed using acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback, guided imagery, massage, healing touch and therapeutic touch, aromatherapy, and topical medical- grade honey. In addition, patients who are incontinent or have incontinence-related skin damage or peristomal complica - tions may benefit from biofeedback to better control incontinence. Research to increase understanding about the role of holistic care for patients with wound, stoma, and continence-related problems in general, and its effect on the quality of life of palliative care patients in particular, will help clinicians provide evidence-based and patient-centered care.

Approaches to care may incorporate complemen - tary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices. Several terms are used interchangeably in the literature to represent the breadth of CAM practices 1 and include holistic, complementary and alter - native, nontraditional, and integrative medicine. These terms are similar but not necessarily interchangeable. Holistic medicine encompasses whole person care (eg, body, mind, spirit). Comple - mentary and alternative and nontraditional medicine incorporate various diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to enhance tradi - tional Western medicine. Nontraditional medicine includes, but is not limited to, acupuncture, massage, and healing touch. Some nontraditional practices are based on results of well-designed clinical studies, are reproducible from practitioner to practitioner, and have a place in traditional medicine therapy. Aspects of alternative medicine \u2014 eg, electrodermal testing, iridology, and hair analysis \u2014 are not reproducible from practi-tioner to practitioner and may not be evidence-based. 2 As such, alternative diagnostic testing should not replace a patient's medi - cal history and physical exam. Some US integrative naturopathic medical schools teach acupuncture. Patients with chronic pain may be prescribed (narcotic) medications by a Western physician; CAM can be used to enhance prescription medication pain con - trol through use of acupuncture depending on the patient's pain severity and type. 3 Integrative medicine combines traditional and nontraditional practices for an enhanced patient-centered model of healing, and this term will be used throughout the rest of this review. Mind, body, and spiritual healing require a personalized, inte- grative team approach to adequately care for these aspects of the human journey. Integrative medicine has a role in palliative care. When healing is not the objective, as in palliative care, the clini - cian may turn to integrative medicine's focus on overall patient comfort and peace. More than 200 integrative medicine interventions/therapies are available in the US, most of which are not covered by third party insurance or Medicare. 4 In the author's experience, palliative care patients suffering with chronic wounds are among a growing number of consumers interested in learning more about healing benefits of evidence-based integrative medicine services. The purpose of this review is to describe the principles of, and various approaches to, integrative care that may help patients with chronic wounds. Rosenbaum_0512.indd 44 5/3/12 10:53 AM DO MANAGEMENT\u00ae www.o-wm.com INTEGRATIVE CAREIntegrative Approaches to Wound Care Post debridement wound pain, wound odor, muscle tension secondary to stress and anxiety, wound infection secondary to fecal incontinence, headache, and energy loss secondary to de - pression are known to be associated with the presence of chronic wounds. 5 Integrative therapies such as acupuncture, guided im - agery, hypnosis,6 yoga, deep breathing, biofeedback, massage, healing touch, dietary supplements, aromatherapy essential oils, topical honey, prayer, and relaxation techniques 7 can play a role in assessing, addressing, and managing many of these issues. Popoola8 describes a holistic caring praxis (practice) model used in the assessment of chronic wound patients. This model contains physiological, emotional, social, cultural, economic, and spiritual components of general health and well-being. Based on the results of a wound specialist panel that was as- sembled to create a wound bed paradigm for people with chronic wounds, Laforet et al 9 recommend an integrative medicine para - digm to treat the cause of the wound (ie, naturopathy), provide lo - cal wound care (ie, topical therapy), and address patient-centered concerns (ie, acupuncture, aromatherapy, energy work, massage, and inhalational essential oils). Another integrative health model, the Seven Balance Point Model, which incorporates and expands upon the Popoola ap-proach, focuses on various healing techniques including physi - cal care of the chronic wound as well as interventions promoting physical health, healthy nutrition/dietary supplements, restorative sleep, exercise, and emotional, social, and spiritual health. Devel - oped by this author, this model has not been tested in chronic wound care patients, but in her experience provides a comfort-centered algorithm for sustainable healing. Acupuncture. Acupuncture is the practice of piercing specific areas of the body along vital energy tracts with small needles with or without electrodes. The principles of acupuncture include a belief that energy tracts or meridians flow throughout the body and may be affected at specific trigger points. 3 Two reviews of the literature10,11 conclude acupuncture may be effective for soft tissue pain, neuropathic pain, and musculoskeletal pain. Trigger-point manipulation causes central nervous system modulation and temporarily breaks the pain cycle depending on the cause and nature of the pain. A cluster-randomized, open-label trial 12 has shown that acupuncture also causes peripheral vasodilation in muscle and skin, which, in turn, may improve oxygenation to a wound. 12 Acupuncture risks described in the literature include pneumothroax and skin or internal puncture-related infections.13 Anecdotal benefits from acupuncture therapy for pain control in patients with wounds have been reported. Acupuncture can be employed as a component of more comprehensive TCM diagnos-tics (eg, pulse, tongue inspection, smelling, inquiry) and interven - tion 2 or as a stand-alone approach. TCM also may include assess - ing and balancing the five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water and the eight principles of yin/yang, heat/cold, deficiency/excess, and external/internal aspects of healing. Two different forms of acupuncture are recognized by the Na - tional Institutes of Health: one incorporates TCM principles and diagnostics along with needling, and the other involves needling of acupuncture meridians. In 1971, acupuncture became more well recognized in the US after a New York Times reporter travel - ing with the Nixon administration in Peking, China wrote how integrative Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, was used to reduce his postoperative appendectomy pain. Soon thereafter, licensed allopathic physicians in the US were allowed to perform acupuncture without advanced acupuncture training. Nevada be - came the first state to license nonphysicians as acupuncturists in 1973. Acupuncture delivered without traditional TCM diagnos - tics has become the more popular option in the US. 14 Yo g a . Y oga integrates exercise, deep breathing, mental control, and an aspect of spirituality and may be indicated for relaxation in the chronic wound patient experiencing pain. Many forms of yoga are practiced today, including anusara, ashtanga, hatha, kriya, kundalini, sivananda, hot yoga, and laughter yoga, to name a few. The most common form, hatha yoga, involves a discipline of pos - tures and breathing exercises designed to improve overall health and prepare the mind for meditation, 15 which can be helpful for the ambulatory chronic wound patient for emotional relaxation. It is important to vet wound patients with yoga masters before commencing the class to alleviate concerns about yoga positions harming the actual wound. Posadzki et al 16 conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials involving yoga for any type of pain management, not necessarily related to patients with chronic wounds (ie, labor pain, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain). Y oga interventions included ha - tha, viniyoga, iyengar yoga, and integrated yoga, and concluded that yoga may alleviate some types of pain better than others. More well-designed studies are needed to assess yoga's place in therapy for all types of pain described in this review. One component of yoga \u2014 deep breathing (or belly breath - ing) \u2014 for relaxation and the reduction of postoperative pain helps calm and focus the person on the present through a medita - tive state. The technique involves slow inhalation, filling up the lower lungs over 10 seconds or longer, and slow exhalation over the same amount of time. Deep breathing quiets the mind and is influenced by a person's hypnotic susceptibility. 17 Miller18 conducted a small pilot study among 15 patients un- dergoing coronary artery bypass surgery to examine pain man - agement involving deep breathing on the second postoperative Key Points Although research remains limited, existing evidence and patient interest in and experience with holistic approaches to care are increasing. The author reviews the most commonly used holistic/ alternative care options that may help patients with wound, stoma, and continence-related problems. Ostomy Wound Management DUPLICATE46 OSTOMY WOUND MANAGEMENT\u00ae MAY 2012 www.o-wm.com FEATURE day. Outcome measures included changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, facial tension, crying, pain score via linear pain scale, and the patient's self-report of pain. Miller reported positive improvements in five objective parameters (including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and pain score scale 0-10) after deep breathing. The author does not disclose the num - ber of breaths or time period of the procedure over which most of the objective improvements were realized for each patient or on average. Biofeedback. Biofeedback has been studied in combina - tion with relaxation techniques to assist healing in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. In a prospective, randomized study of 32 pa-tients, Rice 19 found that when combined with standard medical care, biofeedback improved foot ulcer healing rate, defined as the change in wound area over time (days). Results showed a higher healing rate in patients who used biofeedback-assisted relaxation techniques than in persons who did not (87.5% versus 43.8%, P <0.002) over 4 to 12 weeks; 21 patients were reported to be clini-cally positive healers and 11 patients were reported as nonhealers. Guided imagery. Guided imagery is a type of meditation. A guided imagery practitioner leads two to three sessions where the student is taught to relax and use her/his imagination to visualize a peaceful place and time to reduce stress, elevate mood, slow heart rate, and relieve pain. Training for guided imagery practitioners takes place through the Academy of Guided Imagery. 20 Guided imagery might allow patients to better cope with emotional is - sues regarding chronic wound care and/or end-of-life decisions. Holden-Lund 21 studied the effects of guided imagery on relax - ation and wound healing in 24 surgical patients who underwent cholecystectomy. Patients utilizing guided imagery reported less anxiety, lower cortisol levels on postoperative day 1, and less surgi - cal wound erythema than patients who did not use this approach. Massage. Massage is the systematic manual manipulation by a licensed massage practitioner of muscles, ligaments, tendons, and fascia in the body. 22 Massage may offer positive benefits of relax - ation, stress management, increased blood flow through muscles, and increased lymph flow. 23 Patients with chronic wounds seek - ing massage for relaxation should only do so upon the advice and consent of the healthcare professional treating the wound to en - sure safety and appropriateness of care, including placement on the table to protect the wound and any surrounding injured tis-sue. The chronic wound patient must communicate critical infor - mation about the location of the wound in question to the thera - pist so the massage therapist will not cause harm to the patient or wait until the wound is farther along in the healing process. Open communication between the massage therapist and chronic wound patient is essential to a positive outcome for the patient. An individual massage type must be customized for specific pa - tient needs, and safety should be a priority. Massage may be provided in numerous forms, many of which may be considered too aggressive for palliative care patients with chronic wounds. Deep tissue massage uses techniques that affect the muscles and fascia. Lymphatic massage is a gentler, whole body massage that stimulates lymphatic drainage to carry away excess fluid in connective tissue. Patients experiencing obstructive lymphedema may benefit from the use of intermittent massage of the involved limb with sequential pneumatic compression de-vices in an attempt to improve lymph flow to nonswollen tissues while not harming any associated wound. 24 Contraindications in wound healing may include, but are not limited to, lymphorrhea, infection, localized immunodeficiency, tissue fibrosis, impaired vascular flow, and swelling (compression bandages are required to prevent more limb swelling). Swedish massage involves strokes moving toward the heart to stimulate blood circulation through soft tissues. Neuromuscular massage is diagnostic for muscle knots and involves deep tissue therapy in areas beyond the wound. Rolfing, which works by un - locking the myofascia, a web-like connective tissue that encom - passes muscle, regulates muscle position and function. Mars et al 25 studied patients with diabetes randomized to two groups, both of which received standard medical and surgical care. Additionally, group one received 20 minutes of compressed air massage at 1 bar pressure daily, 5 days per week, to the affected foot. Ulcer healing time was defined as the time from admission to the hospital to the time of wound re-epithelialization. Com - pressed air massage was shown to significantly reduce healing time for diabetic foot ulcers compared to control ( P = 0.001). No side effects to the massage were reported by the study authors. T ouch. The calming power of touch, especially for patients with chronic fungating wounds, can be significant when adminis - tered by palliative nurses at the patient's end of life. 26 In a case re - port26 of a palliative care patient with inflammatory breast cancer, lymphedema in her left arm, and a fungating chest wound, touch was used as a significant tool for patient relaxation and comfort at end of life. Healing T ouch, developed by Mentgen 27 in the 1980s, is endorsed for patient care by the American Holistic Nurses' As - sociation (www.ahna.org). Healing T ouch represents a variety of energy-based techniques to assess and align the human energy field. The spectrum of certified practice includes no touch to light touch by the practitioner. The intent is for the patient and practi-tioner to exchange energy with each other. Healing T ouch works with the client's natural ability to heal and is claimed to reduce acute and chronic pain, enhance the immune system, reduce anxi-ety, and assist in healing dermal lacerations. 28 There is a paucity of published research involving wound patients on this topic. Therapeutic T ouch (TT), a subset of techniques used in Healing T ouch, was studied in 24 healthy volunteers with punch biopsy wounds in the deltoid muscle. Participants were randomly assigned to TT every day for 5 minutes for a total of 10 days or to the control group (no TT). Wounds were examined for healing at days 5 and 10 by one physician, and photographs of the wounds on day 5 and 10 were examined by three other physicians for an evidence of infection, re epitheli - alization, scar formation, scar pigmentation, wound closure, and cosmetic appearance. By the fifth day, 58% of wounds in the TT group were fully healed compared to 0% of wounds in the control group. On day 10, 83% of TT treated wounds and 33% of control group wounds were healed. 29 Daley30 reviewed five randomized, Rosenbaum_0512.indd 46 5/3/12 10:53 www.o-wm.com INTEGRATIVE CAREdouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies examining the effect of therapeutic touch/noncontact therapeutic touch on the healing of surgical dermal wounds. Results were inconsistent. More well-de - signed large trials are needed to confirm wound healing outcomes related to touch. Aromatherapy. Aromatherapy employs plant-based, properly diluted essential oils. Individuals inhale the oil scents that may be placed in a potpourri bowl, manually massaged on the skin by a licensed massage therapist, or occasionally placed on top of a wound by a registered nurse or other trained healthcare profes - sional with the advice and consent of a physician. 31,32 Inhaled pep - permint oil ( Mentha x piperita ) is used for wound odor control, and lavender ( Lavandula officinalis) essential oil may be helpful for relaxation. Kane et al33 recommend the use of adjunctive analgesia involv - ing aromatherapy (along with music) when changing wound dressings. In a pilot, within-subject, cross-over study, eight patients with a variety of wounds (eg, lower leg and foot ulcers, amputa - tion stump, pilonidal sinus) were exposed to lavender and lemon essential oils diffused by an aroma-stream diffuser (Tisserand Aromatherapy, Hove East Sussex, UK) during the entire dressing procedure for odor control. In addition, two different music ther - apies (eg, \"relaxing\" with Carnelian and \"preferred\" preselected by the patient) were provided during the procedures when aro - matherapy was/was not used (control group). Results indicated that none of the therapies reduced pain intensity during dressing changes, but when patients received lavender therapy and relaxing music they reported less pain after dressing change was complet - ed. Larger well-designed trials are warranted to better understand the potential role of aromatherapy and music therapy combined during dressing changes for patients with chronic wounds. Honey. As seen in vitro studies, 34 topical therapeutic (medical grade) honey may inhibit bacterial growth due to its high sug - ar content, acid pH, hydrogen peroxide production within the wound to aid in debridement, and moisture. Subrahmanyam 35 described a prospective, randomized, clinical, histological study of burn wound healing in two groups of 25 patients assigned to ei - ther topical therapeutic honey or topical silver sulfadiazine. In the honey-treated group, 84% of patients demonstrated epithelializa - tion by day 7, and all patients demonstrated satisfactory wound healing by day 21. In the silver sulfadiazine treated group, epithe - lialization was present by day 7 for 72% of patients and by day 21 for 84% of patients. Regarding histological evidence of wound healing, 80% of patients treated with honey showed wound im - provement by day 7 compared to 52% of silver sulfadiazine treat - ed patients by day 7. These outcomes continued to improve for both groups up to 21 days of treatment. Medical grade honey should be applied only with the advice and consent of a physician. Bacterial susceptibility varies based on length of topical exposure to therapeutic honey. Burkholderia Rosenbaum_0512.indd 47 5/3/12 10:53 AM DO MANAGEMENT\u00ae MAY 2012 www.o-wm.com FEATURE cepacia has been shown via Kirby-Bauer Disc diffusion technique to be susceptible to therapeutic honey when applied to wounds in cystic fibrosis patients.36 It is prudent to closely monitor the use of therapeutic honey in all patients' wounds, especially diabetic ulcers, due to risk of infection. Before therapeutic honey is used on an open wound, the wound should be swabbed for bacteria culture and sensitivity to honey determined before treatment when necessary. 37 Not all food-grade honey is sterile, and Clostridium botulinum can sur - vive in honey, thereby causing a risk of wound botulism when applied to the wound. 38 Food-grade honey should not be used for wound healing. Clinicians should consult the honey manufac - turer to find out more about the product before applying honey to an open wound. T opical therapeutic honey is contraindicated in those allergic to pollens in the honey. Integrative Approaches to Confounding Issues Incontinence. In addition to a general negative effect on pa - tient quality of life, fecal incontinence \u2014 ie, involuntary loss of stool \u2014 in patients with wounds in the pelvic region can lead to wound infections and impaired healing. 39 Perineal moisture- associated skin damage or incontinence-associated skin damage (MASD or IASD) can be caused by moisture and pH changes sec - ondary to the wearing of a containment brief holding urine and feces next to the skin for prolonged times in incontinent patients. When urinary and fecal incontinence combine, the skin pH be - comes alkaline and the skin barrier is compromised. 39 The use of appropriate skin cleansers and the application of a barrier cream such as 3M Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream (3M Health Care, St. Paul, MN) or barrier film may help protect skin against the ef - fects of incontinence.39 Different types of biofeedback therapy for fecal incontinence have been reviewed in the literature. Randomized, controlled tri - als40 involving anorectal instrumentation to encourage patient awareness and subsequent modification of voluntary functions have been conducted in medical and surgical patients. Results from these trials ranged from no significant difference between the biofeedback groups and control groups to significant differ - ence between the two. In a randomized, controlled, prospective trial, Aksac et al 41 studied pelvic floor muscle exercises or bio - feedback in 50 patients who had urinary stress incontinence. Patients were randomized to three groups. Persons in group one were taught pelvic floor muscle exercises by way of digital palpa - tion and then taught to perform this palpation at home. Group two was taught pelvic floor muscle exercises through biofeedback three times weekly for two months. Group three did not have any exercises. The first two groups significantly improved their uri - nary stress incontinence versus control ( P <0.001). Biofeedback may be applicable to some patients with chronic wounds and is certainly worth a try. Urinary incontinence (eg, urge incontinence, stress inconti - nence, and overflow incontinence) in the elderly may be mini - mized in frequency or prevented using biofeedback and pelvic floor exercises. 41 As with fecal incontinence, urinary incontinence may lead to skin breakdown and poor wound healing in pa - tients with chronic pelvic wounds wearing containment briefs for prolonged periods of time, which needs to be minimized. In an uncontrolled pilot study, Vaughn et al42 studied the effect of biofeedback and pelvic floor muscle exercises in 20 patients with Parkinson disease who had at least four episodes of urinary incon - tinence per week. The authors concluded that, in this study popu - lation, biofeedback- assisted pelvic floor muscle exercises reduced the frequency of urinary incontinence, and improved the patients' quality of life. Other controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials 43,44 in the el - derly and in urogynecological patient populations comparing pelvic floor exercises with and without biofeedback, acupunc - ture, hypnosis, and herbal therapies have been published. Of the interventions cited, authors concluded biofeedback has the most promise for success in reducing urinary incontinence frequency. Peristomal skin regarding ostomy and stoma) can have an impact on the chronic wound patient's quality of life and risk of wound infection. The Paula Erwin T oth (PET) model 45 for ostomy care involves assessing the patient's intrinsic environment, extrinsic en - vironment, and topical wound care to develop a comprehensive nursing care plan for the patient and helps in the development of the ostomy nursing care plan. Nutrition/dietary supplements. Chronic wound patients are at risk for nutritional deficiencies. The best integrative nutritional plan for general health, including wound healing, starts with the Mediterranean Diet because it details a diet rich in protein, antiox - idants, and anti-inflammatory foods that assist the body's natural immune system in healing. 46 Colorful antioxidant foods recom - mended in this diet include, but are not limited to, blueberries, cherries, tomatoes, green tea, red grapes, and red wine. 47 Resvera- trol is an antioxidant found in the skin and seeds of red grapes.48 Anti-inflammatory foods are canola oil, extra virgin cold pressed olive oil (MUFA), walnuts, oily fish, and avocados. In addition to featuring antioxidants and anti-inflammatory foods, the Mediter - ranean Diet encourages the intake of protein through such foods as kidney beans, pinto beans, fish, low fat dairy, Quinoa, and nuts; oily fish containing omega-3 fatty acids and protein include sardines, herring, wild pacific salmon, and light canned tuna. A healthy nutritional regimen with enough protein, probiotic (eg, kefir), and antioxidant (eg, vitamin C, vitamin A, zinc) intake pro - motes a healthy immune system for better wound healing. 49 Re- sults of a pilot study in which investigators performed tests for se - rum albumin, prealbumin, and amino acid profiles on 18 hospital patients with chronic wounds and seven patients without wounds suggest that protein or amino acids, tryptophan, and histidine may be low in elderly people with chronic wounds. 50 Protein in - take must be closely monitored for adequate wound healing. In addition to good nutrition with whole foods, many people seek dietary supplement strategies for general health, immune enhancement, and wound healing. 51-53 Nearly 60,000 herbs and other dietary supplements are available on the international mar - ket and include American, Chinese, Kampo (Japanese), Ayurveda Rosenbaum_0512.indd 48 5/3/12 10:53 AM INTEGRATIVE CARE(Indian), other nutraceutical remedies. In an observational study, Brewer54 assessed use of 9 g of a commercial powdered arginine supplement daily to shorten healing time of pressure ulcers in 18 spinal cord injured patients. These healing rates were compared to historical controls in different patients and found to be shorter in the active treatment group. Even though re - sults in this study were positive, no general recommendation has been conferred on arginine or any other dietary supplements to promote healing in persons with pressure ulcers. Herbs and other dietary supplements. Plant-based herbs typ - ically contain multiple active constituents, not all of which have been categorized regarding potential indication for use, quality standardization/production, or long-term side effects. Chronic wound patients should work with a pharmacist who understands interactions and side effects among prescription and over-the-counter medications, herbals, other dietary supplements; nutri - tional products help keep chronic wound patients safe and maxi - mize health outcomes. Sleep. Patients with chronic wound pain and discomfort may have profound sleep deficits. Integrative practices for addressing sleep disorders in the general population include acupuncture, yoga breathing, and Tai Chi, although research about the effec - tiveness of these interventions remains limited. 55 The most important first step may be seeking a sleep assess - ment with a physician sleep specialist or a holistic dentist trained to recognize and rule out airway changes that may impact night-time breathing in the patient, at the same time addressing pain in the chronic wound patient. From the author's general observa - tions, several interventions worth trying include: Taking a hot sho wer b efore b edtime t o al low the b ody t o gradually cool down for sleep Sticking to a regular sleep schedule Drinking a g lass o f c ow's milk, so y milk, o r almo nd milk before bedtime.

Exercise is important for the chronic wound pa - tient. For wheelchair-bound or immobile patients, in-place stretching, leg lifts, and passive exercises are options for general health, range of motion, and increased circulation for wound healing. Bone-stressing exercise to maintain wrist, hip, and spine bone density is also important. Ambulation/exercise of the calf muscle pump may be contraindicated in persons with venous ulcers. The advice and consent of the physician must be sought by the patient before commencing exercise to protect the involved body part with the wound. Social health. Relationships frequently suffer when a patient is dealing with a chronic illness. 57 Good relationships and social interactions are universally healing. Intuitively, the wound care patient may be too embarrassed to socialize for fear of upsetting those around him/her who do not understand or are affected by the physical appearance of the wound. Maintaining a social net - work is important for wound care patients even if only by email or telephone for emotional support. Gallagher 58 details the impact of patients' cultural beliefs on health and healing and that both should be addressed by healthcare professionals in patients with chronic illness. Emotional health/stress management. Dealing with emo- tions from living with a chronic wound is stressful and challenging at best. From a physical perspective, stress-reduction techniques, such as deep breathing, may improve surgical wound healing and general health. Broadbent 59 conducted a controlled study of pa - tients scheduled for an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Par - ticipants were randomized to standard care or standard care and guided imagery with take home CDs to listen to for relaxation 3 days before and 7 days after surgery. Both groups had abdominal tubes inserted during surgery and removed 7 days after surgery. These tubes were analyzed for hydroxyproline as a measure of col - lagen deposition and wound healing. Participants in the guided imagery group had higher amounts of hydroxyproline deposition in the wound than persons in the control group (P = 0.03). Unhealthy emotions regarding living with a chronic wound can sometimes be difficult to overcome without professional in - tervention. Integrative practices used by the author to improve emotional well-being and promote peace and positive patient self-image include: Talking out stressful emotions with a trusted friend. Repeating affir ming stat ements (ie, I' m g oing t o g et w ell, I'm loved, I'm blessed, I'm thankful for.....) Seeking ou t sour ces that p romote laug hter (ie, p eople, movies, books) Employing the fiv e se nses (ie, tast e, t ouch, sme ll, sig ht, hearing) in appreciating nature Spiritual health. Spiritual approaches to general healing have been described in the literature.60 As much as the chronic wound care patient is able, worship at the church, synagogue, mosque, or via radio/television services may assist in staying connected to a higher power and in spiritual healing. Alternatively, a relationship with one's higher power through prayer is another healing option. End-of-life concerns expressed by patients with chronic wounds need to be acknowledged and addressed by a professional spiritual leader in the community. The Integrative Health and Medicine Team The best way for the chronic wound patient to ensure he/she is under the care of the right integrative health and medicine team is with a discussion with her/his primary care physician. Wound patients may partner with their primary care physicians and con - sider preparing a list of questions to ask the integrative medicine practitioners once selected, including: How man y pat ients ha ve y ou se en w ith m y w ound t ype o r health condition? What is your success rate with either? Are there any side effects from the regimen you propose? How man y sessio ns ar e r equired and w hat is the est imated time and cost involved? Will y ou w ork w ith m y p rimary car e p hysician as a team member? The traditional medicine primary care physician, in turn, can serve as the coordinator of this healthcare team and is the pre - scriber of routine maintenance and diagnostic laboratory tests and medications when necessary. In the ideal scenario, the tradi - tional primary care physician is the chronic wound patient's ad - vocate, coach, and encourager on this integrative medicine team. Choosing a credible integrative health and medicine practi - tioner requires some homework on the part of the patient and includes gathering information on training, credentials, and years of experience in the practice. Chronic wound patients or their caregivers may contact professional organizations for more in - formation. If integrative practice is not covered by insurance, the expected fees should be discussed. Patients should bring a list of questions for the integrative medicine practitioner at the first visit. Patients should ask for a written report or dictation summary of the integrative medicine session and share the report with the tra - ditional medicine physician at the next office visit. Research The National Institute of Health National Center for Comple - mentary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) and Bravewell or - ganizations are on the forefront of integrative medicine research. Ongoing NCCAM-sponsored research includes the areas of acu - puncture for insomnia and pain, massage, and yoga for insomnia and caregiver stress. The reader is referred to www.clinicaltrials.gov for more information on these studies. The Bravewell network includes the Scripps Center for In- tegrative Medicine in California, The Continuum Center for Health and Healing in New Y ork, Duke Center for Integrative Medicine in North Carolina, Jefferson-Myrna Brind Center for Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson Medical College in Pennsylvania, the Center for Integrative Medicine at the Univer - sity of Maryland School of Medicine, Osher Center for Integra - tive Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, The Alliance Institute for Integrative Medicine in Cincinnati, Ohio, Rosenbaum_0512.indd 50 5/3/12 10:53 AM MANAGEMENT\u00ae 51 www.o-wm.com INTEGRATIVE CAREand the Institute of Health and Healing at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minnesota. For more information, the reader is re - ferred to www.bravewell.org. When reviewing studies on acupuncture or any nontraditional medicine-related studies, the clinician and patient should be aware of how the research model is designed and conducted, including study limitations, when interpreting results. For example, results may be biased due to the placebo effect for pain management. 60,61 Conclusion Numerous integrative healthcare options are available to pal - liative care patients with chronic wounds, including those for whom symptom relief, not healing, is the goal of care. The first step for chronic wound patients entering the world of integra - tive medicine is a visit to the traditional medicine physician for a conversation about her/his comfort in developing an integrative team approach to healing. Next comes researching the credibility of individual practitioners and practices as well as the fit with the patient's health goals. Many integrative health and medicine prac - tices may have value in promoting wound healing, reducing pain, and promoting general health and peace for chronic wound pa - tients. Nontraditional medicine research, including areas of nutri-tion and wound healing, 62 will continue to evolve to help caregiv - ers better understand how to optimize patient-centered, complex care that often requires multiple interventions to achieve the goals of therapy. n References 1.
