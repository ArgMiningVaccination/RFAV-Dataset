Licensure is not specific to a specialty area of naturopathic medical practice. Below are answers to frequently asked questions about the licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) in the USA. A Note Regarding Patient Safety A naturopathic physician (naturopath) who only has a license, but states it is board-certified, is making a false claim about its credentials. There is no such credential as a \"board-certified naturopathic physician,\" just as there are no such credentials of \"board-certified allopathic physician\" and \"board-certified osteopathic physician.\" A board certification is granted when a naturopathic physician (naturopath) has proved that it has achieved expertise in a specialty area of naturopathic medical practice. The only [board certifications currently available to naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)]are in naturopathic oncology, pediatrics, and homeopathy. A board-certified naturopathic oncologist is recognized by the credential \"FABNO\" (\"Fellow of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology\"), a board-certified naturopathic pediatrician is recognized by the credential \"FABNP\" (\"Fellow to the American Board of Naturopathic Pediatrics\"), and a board-certified naturopathic homeopath is recognized by the credential \"DHANP\" (\"Diplomate of the Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians\"). What licensing examination do naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) take?1 Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths, NMDs/NDs) take the [Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX)](https://www.nabne.org/home/exam-overview/), which consists of two parts - Part I and Part II. NPLEX Part I is the Biomedical Science Examination (BSE) and is administered after the second year of naturopathic medical school. NPLEX Part II is the Core Clinical Science Examination (CCSE) and is administered after the fourth year of naturopathic medical school. Allopathic physicians (allopaths, MDs) take the [United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)](http://www.usmle.org/), which consists of three steps - Step 1, Step 2 (CK & CS), and Step 3. [USMLE Step 1](http://www.usmle.org/step-1/) is administered at the end of the second year of allopathic medical school. [USMLE Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge)](http://www.usmle.org/step-2-ck/) and [USMLE Step 2 CS (Clinical Skills)](http://www.usmle.org/step-2-cs/) are administered during either the third or fourth year of allopathic medical school. [USMLE Step 3](http://www.usmle.org/step-3/) is administered during residency. Osteopathic physicians (osteopaths, DOs) take the [Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX-USA)](http://www.nbome.org/exams-comlex.asp?m=serv), which consists of three levels - Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. COMLEX Level 1 is administered at the end of the second year of osteopathic medical school. COMLEX Level 2-CE (Cognitive Evaluation) and [COMLEX Level 2-PE (Performance Evaluation)](http://www.nbome.org/comlex-pe.asp?m=can) are administered during either the third or fourth year of osteopathic medical school. COMLEX Level 3 is administered during residency. Osteopathic physicians are eligible to take the [USMLE](http://www.usmle.org/). Who administers the licensing examination?2 The [North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE)](https://www.nabne.org/home/) administers the [Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX)](https://www.nabne.org/home/exam-overview/) to each naturopathic medical student (NMS) and naturopathic physician (NMD/ND). The [National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME)](http://www.nbme.org/) and the [Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB)](https://www.fsmb.org/) co-sponsor administration of the [United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)](http://www.usmle.org/) to each allopathic medical student (MS) and allopathic physician (MD). The [National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME)](http://www.nbome.org/) administers the [Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX-USA)](http://www.nbome.org/exams-comlex.asp?m=serv) to each osteopathic medical student (OMS) and osteopathic physician (DO). Who is eligible to take the licensing examination?3 Naturopathic medical students who successfully complete their biomedical science coursework during their first two years are [eligible to take the NPLEX Part I BSE](https://www.nabne.org/home/nplex-part-i-biomedical-science-examination/). Naturopathic medical students who successfully complete their clinical science coursework and clinical rotations during their second two years and who passed the NPLEX Part I BSE are [eligible to take the NPLEX Part II CCSE](https://www.nabne.org/home/nplex-part-ii-core-clinical-science-examination/). In every state and territory of the USA, is there licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)?4 No, in every state and territory of the USA, there is not currently licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths). Currently, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are licensed in 18 USA states; Washington, DC; and the USA territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In 3 USA states, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are registered, instead of licensed. [States & Territories with Licensure of Naturopathic Physicians (Naturopaths)](https://www.naturopathicmedicine.website/regulation-statutes/) - Alaska - Arizona - California - Connecticut - Florida - Hawaii - Kansas - Maine - Maryland - Massachusetts - Montana - New Hampshire - North Dakota - Oregon - Rhode Island - Utah - Vermont - Washington - District of Columbia - Puerto Rico - US Virgin Islands [States & Territories with Registration of Naturopathic Physicians (Naturopaths)](https://www.naturopathicmedicine.website/regulation-statutes/) - Colorado - Minnesota - Pennsylvania Are licensure requirements currently standardized in all USA states and territories?5 No, licensure requirements are not currently standardized in all USA states and territories. In addition to the NPLEX, some states and territories have jurisprudence examinations that must be passed in order for licensure to be granted. [Utah is currently the only state that requires completion of at least 1 year of a naturopathic residency program](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title58/Chapter71/58-71-S302.html?v=C58-71-S302_1800010118000101) in order to be eligible for licensure. Is completion of a residency program required for licensure?6 At this time, completion of a naturopathic residency program is not required for naturopathic licensure, except [in the state of Utah, where completion of at least 1 year of a residency program is required](http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title58/Chapter71/58-71-S302.html?v=C58-71-S302_1800010118000101). Completion of a residency program is generally required for allopathic licensure and osteopathic licensure, except in the state of Missouri, where an allopathic medical doctor (allopath) or osteopathic medical doctor (osteopath) can work as an [assistant physician](http://pr.mo.gov/healingarts.asp). Why is completion of a residency program not required for licensure?7 Completion of a residency program is not currently required for licensure, other than in Utah, because of how the legislation has been written and passed in states that license or register naturopathic physicians (naturopaths). A current barrier to requirement of completion of a residency program, other than in Utah, is that naturopathic residencies are privately funded and there are more graduating naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) each year than there are available naturopathic residencies. Allopathic and osteopathic residency programs are currently federally- and state-funded, mostly through Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Administration (VA), which is why there are more programs and completion of a residency is able to be required for licensure. What is the importance of licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy) in every state?8 Public safety is the most important aspect of licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy) in every state. Not understanding the difference between naturopathic physicians (naturopaths, NMDs/NDs), who have attended CNME-accredited or provisionally-accredited four-year naturopathic medical schools to specialize in naturopathic medicine (naturopathy) and earned a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD) or Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) doctoral-level professional degree to become licensed naturopathic physicians, as compared to laypersons, who have earned a diploma, distance-learning diploma, or distance-learning degree in \"naturopathy\" from a non-accredited institution, can be very confusing to the public. It is critical to the safety of the public that the public is educated on the difference between a naturopathic physician (naturopath) versus a layperson claiming to practice naturopathic medicine (naturopathy). Laypersons claiming to be naturopaths (naturopathic physicians) are not able to be licensed in any USA state or territory to practice naturopathic medicine (naturopathy), as it is not a part of their in-person or online diploma, distance-learning diploma, or distance-learning degree in naturopathy from a non-accredited institution program, however, they have founded their own organizations of which the titles imply that they are trained to do so, which is misleading and dangerous to the public. The [American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA)](http://www.anma.org/), the [American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board (ANMAB)](http://www.anmab.org/), the [American Naturopathic Medical Certification Board (ANMCB)](http://www.anmcb.org/), [American Naturopathic Certification Board (ANCB)](http://ancb.net/), and the [National Registry of Naturopathic Practitioners (NRNP)](http://www.naturopathicregistration.org/) are all organizations for laypersons claiming to be naturopaths (naturopathic physicians) who do not have training in naturopathic medicine (naturopathy). This is very important for the public to understand, as it can be confusing to patients who do not have the education and resources available to them to distinguish between a naturopathic physician (naturopath) and a layperson claiming to be a naturopath, but want to see (within permissible capacity of state laws) an individual qualified to be naturopathic physician (naturopath) in a state that does not yet have licensure for naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy). In states without licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy), there are no protected professional titles of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths). This means that, in those states, a naturopathic physician (naturopath), who earned a \"Doctor of Naturopathy\" (\"ND\") doctoral degree from a CNME-accredited naturopathic medical school, and a layperson claiming to practice naturopathy, who earned a \"Doctor of Naturopathy\" online diploma from a non-accredited institution, which includes no medical training, can both use \"ND\" as initials after their name, since there is no professional title protection of those initials in those states. In many states with licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy), using \"NMD\" or \"ND\" after a person's name to signify their professional title (naturopathic physician) is restricted to naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) who have earned an NMD or ND degree from a CNME-accredited naturopathic medical school, as those states only recognize a naturopathic medical degree from CNME-accredited naturopathic medical schools. Due to lack of available information, education, and resources, many people do not understand the difference between an academic (educational) degree title and a protected professional title. Without licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and without regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy), a patient may see a layperson claiming to be a naturopath and using the initials \"ND\", instead of an actual naturopathic physician (naturopath), and not understand the difference in level of education and training of the person who the patient is seeing for naturopathic medical care. Additionally, to those who have taken and passed the \"ANMCB Board Certification Naturopathic Examination\", the [ANMCB](http://www.anmcb.org/) issues \"certification\" titles to laypersons claiming to practice naturopathy (naturopathic medicine), including, \"Board Certified Naturopathic Physician\" (\"BCNP\") and \"Board Certified Naturopathic Doctor (\"BCND\"), which are then used, in states without licensure for naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy), by the laypersons claiming to practice naturopathy who do not have training in naturopathic medicine (naturopathy). This is confusing, misleading, and dangerous to patients, as they may think they are seeing a naturopathic physician (naturopath), but may be actually seeing a layperson claiming to practice naturopathy (naturopathic medicine). It is important to know that, currently, the only two [board certifications available to naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)](https://www.naturopathicmedicine.website/licensure-specialties/board-specialties-certifications/) who have graduated from a CNME-accredited naturopathic medical school are in naturopathic oncology (FABNO) and homeopathy (DHANP). If a person is using the title \"Board Certified Naturopathic Physician\" or \"Board Certified Naturopathic Doctor,\" that person is a layperson claiming to practice naturopathy (naturopathic medicine), without any medical training, not a naturopathic physician (naturopath) with training in naturopathic medicine (naturopathy). It is crucial that education and resources are made available to the public to help patients understand the educational background and difference between [naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)](https://www.naturopathicmedicine.website/naturopathic-physicians/), with training in [naturopathic medicine (naturopathy)](https://www.naturopathicmedicine.website/naturopathic-medicine/), and laypersons claiming to practice naturopathy (naturopathic medicine). What is the importance of consistent scope of practice in each state and territory that accurately reflects the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)?9 Public safety and health are the most important aspects of consistent scope of practice in each state that accurately reflects the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths). Like all health care providers, having proper scope of practice that accurately reflects scope of training allows for safe and effective medical care to be delivered. If proper scope of practice is not in place, for example, if in a state naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) do not have pharmaceutical prescribing rights that accurately reflect their scope of training, since patients may choose to see a naturopathic physician (naturopath) for any symptom or complaint, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) may be unable to prescribe antibiotics for conditions such as strep throat, vaccines for vaccine-preventable diseases, epinephrine injectors for patients with risk of anaphylaxis due to allergic reaction, hormonal contraception, or emergency oxygen for life-threatening hypoxic (low oxygen) situations. In emergency situations, deliverance of epinephrine or oxygen may be crucial to saving the life of a patient while emergency medical services (EMS) are on their way. It is important that the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) is understood so that the scope of practice of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) in each state is consistent and accurately reflects the scope of training. Do naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) have the same public health duties as allopathic physicians (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths)?10 Yes, like (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths), naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are held liable for reporting diseases and conditions to a state department of health that are considered to be mandatory reportable diseases. Can naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) lose their licenses to practice naturopathic medicine (naturopathy)?11 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) can lose their licenses to practice naturopathic medicine (naturopathy), just like allopathic physicians (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths) can lose their licenses to practice medicine.
