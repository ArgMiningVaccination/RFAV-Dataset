Its purpose, objective and tasks are, in detail: To represent anthroposophic pharmacists in the anthroposophic-medical movement and in public life on an international level: Anthroposophic pharmacy is understood as an extension of conventional phar-macy. To establish standards regarding education, further training and practice in anthroposophic pharmacy (including but not limited to retail pharmacists). To promote research in anthroposophic pharmacy. To achieve international recognition by specialised publications as well as training material for anthro-posophic pharmacists. To establish a cooperative network between anthro- posophic pharmacists to exchange information and best practice throughout the world. To initiate / coordinate international activities. It is in respect of this last aim that the Board is pleased to publish the 3 rd edition 2013 of the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (APC). Several de/f_initions have been harmonised with the de/f_initions in the Swiss and German Law, as well as in the monograph on anthroposophic preparations \" Anthropo- sophische Zubereitungen\" in the Swiss Pharmacopoeia. Several manufacturing procedures have been worded more precisely and new manufacturing methods have been included. Where appropriate, the European Pharmacopoeia has been referred to. Also the lists of starting materials used have been updated to include new substances, nomenclature, references to ocial pharmacopoeias as well as a literature reference which demonstrates that the substance is generally known in anthroposophic pharmacy / medicine. /T_he most relevant change however is the inclusion of /f_ive monographs: Cydonia oblonga, extract with heat treatment 1:2.1 Cydonia oblonga, fruit, mother tincture obtained by rhythmic application and updated by an anthropo-sophic pharmaceutical committee responsible to the IAAP board. /T_he with heat treat-ment 1:2.1 Cydonia oblonga, fruit, mother tincture obtained by rhythmic heat and cold: Cydonia Klahre Parker , pharmacist, United Kingdom, Chairperson of the British Association, BAAP , (British Association of Anthroposophic Pharmacists) Andrea K\u00fchn , pharmacist, Germany Jakob Maier , pharmacist, Switzerland, Board Member of V AEPS and Member of the Committee on Comple- mentary Medicinal of the Swiss Pharmaco-poeia M\u00f3nica Mennet-von Ei , pharmacist, Switzerland, Presi- dent of the Swiss association V AEPS, Board Member of the IAAP; Member of the Working Group HOM on Homoeopathic Raw Materials and Stocks of the Euro-pean Pharmacopoeia 2ANTHROPOSOPHIC PHARMACEUTICAL CODEX pharmacist, Germany, Chairman of the APC committee, Board Member of the IAAP; Member of the Committee on Manufacturing Methods of the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Peter Pedersen , pharmacist, Denmark; Member of the Committee on Manufacturing associations: the French Association AFERPA de recherche sur la pharmacie anthroposo- phique - French Association for Studies and Research on Anthroposophic Pharmacy);the British Association, BAAP (British Association of Anthroposophic Pharmacists) and its Associate, New Zealand ; the Belgian/Dutch Association posophischer Deutschland Austrian Association \u00d6GAPh (\u00d6sterreichische Ge- sellscha/f_t anthroposophischer Pharmazeuten SOFAI (Societ\u00e0 di farmacisti antroposo/f_i for Anthroposophically Extended Pharmacy in Switzerland).

Anthroposophic Medicine is an integrative system of medicine involving conventional medicine and a set of dierentiated thera-peutic tools. A very important tool is its array of medicinal products. Anthroposophic Medicine claims a substance related eect as well as a dynamic or process related eect for its medicines, both of which are meant to activate self healing processes. /T_he task of the APC is to develop appropriate quality principles as well as quality standards in line with the characteristics and requirements of anthroposophic medicines. Substance related standards are well documented as well as manufacturing methods, which relate to the process characteristics of anthroposophic medicinal products. Prof. Peter HeusserEndorsement IVAA /T_he International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations (IV AA) is the international umbrella organisation representing 31 anthroposophic medical associa-tions worldwide in political and legal matters. As well as services provided to member organisations, the IV AA provides similar assistance to doctors in more than 30 ad-ditional countries throughout the world. /T_he IV AA\u00b4s mission includes political eorts to ensure legal and regulatory safeguards for the availability of Anthroposophic Medicinal Products (AMPs) in any country in the world where doctors practise the anthroposophic medical approach. /T_he Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (APC) is an indispensable document for de/f_ining the anthroposophic medical system, and provides detailed insight into the dierent types of medicinal products used in Anthroposophic Medicine, including source materials, pharmaceutical processes and standards. /T_he APC makes it possible to relate knowledge of substances and pharmaceutical pro- cesses to insight into human health and illness. From a pharmaceutical point of view it oers a full description of Anthroposophic Medicine as a complex medical system founded on the interrelationship between these processes and insights. On behalf of the IV AA I wish to acknowledge and endorse this achievement by the community of anthroposophic pharmacists aliated within the IAAP . Successful compilation of the codex now gives Anthroposophic Pharmacy a /f_irm position within general medical culture. Peter Zimmermann MD, PhD President IVAA Introductory Note 5 IVAA International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical du Escamp With pleasure I have taken notice of the recently /f_inalised new version of the APC. /T_he development of the APC is very important for ESCAMP . /T_he aim of ESCAMP is to develop the scienti/f_ic basis for a permanent regulatory framework for Anthroposophic Medicinal Products (AMPs) in Europe. /T_he ESCAMP strategy includes a description of Anthroposophic Medicine as a whole system and an evaluation of single AMP's and AMP groups (see www.escamp.org). For this work the APC provides essential pharma-ceutical source material, including de/f_initions of AMPs as well as descriptions of their starting materials, manufacturing processes and dosage forms. On behalf of ESCAMP I herewith endorse the relevant steps that have been under-taken to revise and expand the APC, in particular the inclusion of speci/f_ic substance monographs with relevant quality standards. Dr. Harald Johan Hamre Freiburg im Breisgau Introductory Note 6 Harald Johan HamreScienti/f_ic Director and President of the European Scienti/f_ic Cooperative of Anthroposophic Medicinal Products (ESCAMP)ANTHROPOSOPHIC PHARMACEUTICAL CODEX APC 3.0Dear Sir or Madam, /T_he Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex, APC is now available in its revised 3rd edition. ECHAMP is the international industrial association that has given itself a number of tasks with regard to the further development of anthroposophic and homoeopathic medicinal products. Article 2 of the Articles of Association quotes as follows: \" Active promotion of the harmonisation, legalisation, research and the respective in- tegration of homeopathic and anthroposophic medicinal products into ocial phar - macopoeias , primarily in the European Union, with the purpose of further enabling eective access by representatives of the professional groups and the general public to these medicinal products. \" (Italics by the author) /T_he APC is an important document from this perspective, since it provides the pool of pharmaceutical information in pharmacopoiea language which makes such an objec-tive possible for the stakeholders active in the area. We wish to express our congratulations to the International Association of Anthropo- sophic Pharmacists, IAAP , for this new step. As an association also representing the anthroposophic medicinal product industries, we fully endorse the APC and wish that it will provide guidance in any concerned regulation process. Nand de Herdt, President of ECHAMP Introductory Note 7 European Coalition on Homeopathic and Anthroposophic Medicinal Products E.E.I.G.Rue Gray International Association of Anthroposophic Pharmacists, IAAP , is publishing the 3rd edition of the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex, APC. For me as an aca-demic in the /f_ield of Anthroposophic Medicine it is of paramount importance to rely on the eorts of the joint disciplines making Anthroposophic Medicine a constantly developing reality, in this case the precious work of my colleague pharmacists. With enthusiasm therefore I have taken notice of the further developments, in particular of the inclusion of monographs of starting materials and preparations. /T_he APC gives the framework of what belongs to the pharmaceutical identity of Anthroposophic Medi-cine. With this edition this identity is further validated and applied to single important preparations. With anthroposophic preparations derived from the quince, Cydonia oblongata, now monographed in the APC I have had the pleasure to carry out clinical research 1. I wish the IAAP further successful steps in further developing the APC.

Usually the required quality is defined by the relevant phar-macopeias and the proper drug quality is guaranteed by respective analytical procedures. However, the quality of an anthroposophic medicinal product represents usually much more than the sum of its analytical characteristics. Its unique quality is strictly related to the entire process chain involved, including the source material, pharmaceutical processes and standards. In this context, I am very pleased to hold in my hand the 3rd Edition of the Anthroposo-phic Pharmaceutical Codex. It looks and defines quality in its entirety and represents thus a huge step forward for anthroposophic medicinal products in the direction of an up to date quality understanding. The APC successfully helps to close the gap which exists between those medicinal products described in official pharmacopeias, e.g. the European Pharma-copeia and the German Homeopathic Pharmacopeia, and the traditional anthroposophic codices. It was a real challenge to develop the quality related tools in line with the special needs of anthroposophic medicinal products. Congratulations to the IAAP for showing the courage to venture to do this and congratula- tions for having done it so successfully. Prof. Rolf Daniels Chair of Pharmaceutical Technology, Pharmaceutical Institute Eberhard Karls University, T\u00fcbingen ANTHROPOSOPHIC PHARMACEUTICAL CODEX APC 3.0 Endorsement Faculty of Pharmacy, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg Anthroposophic medicinal products do have a long tradition in Germany and its neigh- bouring countries. /T_he pharmaceutical pro/f_ile of these products is comparable to that of homoeopathic medicinal products and their quality is usually de/f_ined by the quality of the starting materials as well as the manufacturing processes, as required by regula-tion. Consequently, the quality and testing procedures of raw materials and stocks - like for example mother tinctures - used for the production of anthroposophic medicinal products should be de/f_ined by monographs in the relating pharmacopeias (e.g., German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia and also more and more the European Pharmacopoeia). /T_herefore, I am very pleased that the 3rd Edition of the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex now includes four monographs on starting materials and the relating preparations. /T_his represents a huge step towards a state of the art quality understanding of anthro-posophic medicinal products. /T_he APC successfully helps to close the gap, which exists between those medicinal products and starting materials described in ocial phar-macopeias as mentioned above, and those which have not been covered by any ocial monograph so far. It is a real challenge to develop the quality related tools in line with the special needs of anthroposophic medicinal products. Congratulations to the IAAP for eectively closing this quality gap for anthroposophic starting materials. Prof. Michael Keusgen Dean of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg, Germany Introductory Note 10ANTHROPOSOPHIC PHARMACEUTICAL CODEX APC 3.0 Foreword 11Foreword Pharmacy extended by the principles of anthroposophy began to be developed at the beginning of the 20th century by Rudolf Steiner (founder of anthroposophy, 1861 - 1925) and Oskar Schmiedel (Austrian chemist, 1887 - 1959), in collaboration with a number of physi- cians. /T_heir aim was to reinterpret and complement the results of pharmaceutical and medical research with insights gained from anthroposophic research of the human being and nature./T_he basis of the anthroposophic approach to pharmacy is the \"holistic\" knowledge of mankind and nature, which recognizes the notion that human beings and the kingdoms of nature are related through a common evolution 1. /T_his perception leads to a comprehensive view of substances in their relationship to health, illness and to a speci/f_ic approach to pharmacy. /T_herefore anthroposophic pharmacy uses substances from the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms 2,3. Anthroposophic medicinal products have been on the market world-wide and prescribed by quali/f_ied medical practitioners since 1921. /T_he range of anthroposophic medicinal products is partially determined by the physical characteristics of substances, whereby allopathic, phytotherapeutic and homoeopathic criteria are taken into considera-tion. Most particularly, anthroposophic medicinal products are characterised by their manufacturing processes involving speci/f_ic anthroposophic and typi-cal homoeopathic pharmaceutical procedures. /T_he range of anthroposophic medicinal products includes potentised medicinal products, manufactured by using the methods of the ocial homoeopathic pharma-copoeias, as well as concentrated mineral, herbal or animal substances or preparations and compounded medicinal products. Considering this diversity, anthroposophic medicinal products, cannot be de/f_ined under a single substance classi/f_ication. 1 (/T_he /f_irst-born), English: Extending Practical Medicine - Fundamental Prin-ciples based on the Science of the Spirit\".

Anthroposophic Press, Hudson, NY , USA, 1999./T_he Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex APC gives an overview of substances and methods used in the manufacture of anthroposophic medicinal products as well as of the related quality parameters. Legal Situation Today the European Union Directive 2001/83/EEC and amendments contain the main legislation concerning medicinal products. /T_he legal status of anthroposophic medicinal products in the EU is closely related to that of homoeopathic medicinal products (see below). Preamble of Directive 2001/83/EEC n\u00b0 (22) refers to anthroposophic medicinal products as follows:\" Anthroposophic medicinal products, which are described in an ocial pharmacopoeia and prepared by a homoeo-pathic method are to be considered, as regards to regis-tration and marketing authorization, as homeopathic medicinal products. \" From a regulatory point of view anthroposophic medicinal products can be devided into two categories: anthroposophic medicinal products manufactured according to a homoeopathic manufacturing method within the meaning of Directive 2001/83/EEC, article 1, 5.: \" Any medicinal product prepared from substances called homoeopathic stocks in accordance with a homoeopathic manufacturing procedure described by the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, by the pharmacopoeias currently used ocially in the Member States. (...)\" anthroposophic medicinal products other than those manufactured by a homoeopathic manufacturing method . /T_hese are equally important and have never been included in any pharmacopoeia. /T_he de/f_initions of anthroposophic medicinal products given in the Swiss and German Drug Laws take both cat-egories into account (translations by APC Committee): Switzerland: Regulation of Swissmedic concerning the simpli/f_ied Authorisation and Herbal \u00fcber die 4, 2 f: Anthroposophic medicinal product: Medicinal product, whose active substances are manu-factured by a homoeopathic manufacturing procedure, or according to an anthroposophic manufacturing procedure described in the German Homoeopathic ForewordPharmacopoeia or in the British Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia or according to a special anthroposophic manufacturing procedure and that is formulated and developed according to the anthroposophic knowledge of man, animal, substance and nature and is meant to be used according to these principles. Germany: Medicinal Products Act (Gesetz \u00fcber den Verkehr mit Arzneimitteln) Art. 4, (33) An anthroposophic medicinal product is a medicinal product that has been developed according to the anthroposophic knowledge of man and nature and that is manufactured according to a homoeopathic manufacturing procedure described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in absence thereof in a pharma- copoeia ocially used in the Member States or according to a special anthroposophic manufacturing procedure and that is meant to be used according to the anthro-posophic principles concerning man and nature. In many EU countries, and also world-wide, medicinal products used for the anthroposophic therapeutics are thus partially integrated in legislation. In Brazil as well as in Australia the APC has been of- /f_icially recognised as quality standard and reference for anthroposophic medicinal products (RESOLU\u00c7\u00c3O RDC No - 26, DE 30 DE MAR\u00c7O DE 2007; amend- ments to the Australian /T_herapeutic Goods Act, 2009). In summary anthroposophic medicinal products as a whole are step by step gaining legal recognition in the EU as well as world-wide, and among other things this requires comprehensive publication of their pharma-ceutical quality. /T_he publication of the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex is to provide transparency of anthroposophic pharmaceutical quality for pharmacists and bodies requiring an appreciation of anthroposophic medicinal products and pharmacy. Furthermore it provides a basis for the maintenance of existing and development of new anthroposophic medicinal products. /T_he relationship of the APC to the European Pharmacopoeia, to existing ocial Pharma-copoeias and non APC is published by the IAAP , an independent association of professional pharmacists, within the context of ocial existing pharmacopoeias. It is the intention of the APC to refer where possible to existing pharmacopoeias. In fact anthroposophic medicinal products are o/f_ten manufactured and controlled 12according to existing speci/f_ications and standards.A part of the reference pharmacopoeias for the APC are published by ocial Authorities, in particular/T_he European Pharmacopoeia/T_he French Pharmacopoeia/T_he German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (which is a part of the German Pharmacopoeia);/T_he Swiss Pharmacopoiea has implemented two texts concerning anthroposophic pharmacy in the last four years: in 2009 (Suppl. 10.1) with the /f_irst time that anthroposophic preparations appeared as a monograph in an ocial pharmacopeia. /T_his monograph includes the paragraphs de/f_initions, starting materials, methods of preparation and dosa- ge forms, by analogy with the Ph.Eur.-monograph Homoeopathic preparations Ph.Eur. 1038. in September 2013 (Suppl. 11.1) new Ph.Helv.- chapter \"17.7 Manufacturing methods for anthropo-sophic preparations\" came into force. /T_his chapter gives an overview on the general manufacturing processes and describes in more detail some manu-facturing methods which are more frequently used in anthroposophic pharmacy and had not been described in an ocial pharmacopoeia before. /T_he APC served as important basis to establish both of these Ph.Helv.-texts. /T_herefore it can be concluded, that the continuing work of the APC supports the establish-ment of the pharmaceutical quality standards and the regulation of anthroposophic medicinal products in Switzerland. Further ocial pharmacopoeias of reference: /T_he Austrian Pharmacopoeia/T_he British Pharmacopoeia In particular the European Pharmacopoeia today represents and for the future will represent a reference of paramount importance for the APC. /T_herefore in part IV of the APC containing the lists of the various substances used in anthroposophic phar-macy reference is made where possible to the European Pharmacopoeia and other ocial pharmacopoeias. Particularly important Ph.Eur. drugs preparations (2045)Homoeopathic of preparation of homoeopathic stocks and potentisation (2371)Minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products CODEX APC 3.0 Foreword 13ANTHROPOSOPHIC Tinctures (chapter in 0765 Extracts)Viral safety (50107)Other referred to in the APC are not ocially recognised. Nevertheless they provide reliable standards accepted e.g. by regulatory authorities, in particular the British Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia. /T_he IAAP understands its task to sustain anthro- posophic pharmaceutical activities at any level (e.g. manufacturing, quality control, regulatory aairs), worldwide , that is, beyond the countries of the European Pharmacopoeia Convention. /T_herefore during the evolution of the APC other ocial pharmacopoeias (or reliable private pharmacopoeias) will possibly be referred to, e.g. the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia.

Minerals, rocks, including natural waters Minerals are solid, crystalline components of natural origin belonging to the earth's crust and other celestial bodies. A mineral has a de/f_ined crystal system and crystal class. Minerals are chemically and physically homogeneous to a signi/f_icant extent. In reality, how-ever, there are always deviations from the theoretical mineral formula. Many minerals may show dierences in their colours. Form and habitus may be signi/f_icantly dierent within the same type. Rocks are composed of one or more minerals having a geological de/f_inition and distribution in their natural deposit with a certain statistical homogeneity. Pieces that will be used for production should be big enough to allow mineralogical identi/f_ication. If a powdered mineral is used, adequate documentation should ensure the quality and natural origin. In fact pieces used for production must be free from visible foreign matter. /T_hey have not undergone any unwanted mechanical or chemical treatment: in particular any chemical reaction, colouring, varnishing, heating and arti/f_icial radiation must be excluded. /T_he amount of foreign matter accepted a/f_ter chemical analysis is speci/f_ied in the respective monograph. Natural waters can come from a natural source (e.g. Levico), from the sea (e.g. aqua maris) or from mineral cavities (e.g. agate water). List of minerals, rocks, including natural waters: see part IV , appendix 2.1. 2.2. Starting materials of botanical origin Starting materials of botanical origin are: Dried or fresh plants or parts of plants, including algae, fungi and lichens; Plant secretions, juices, extracts, oleoresins, essential oils or distillation products. Fresh plants should be used shortly a/f_ter harvest. If this is not possible, the quality is guaranteed by appropriate measures, e.g. freezing. If material from cultivated plants is used preference should be given to materials from plants cultivated by biodynamic cultivation (\"Demeter\" certi/f_ied) or by other certi/f_ied organic cultivation methods in accord-ance to the relevant European regulations ruling organic agricultural products (see also Council Directive (EEC) n\u00b0 2092/91).If wild plants are harvested protection of species according to relevant regulations is granted and special care is taken of the eco-system concerned.Plants or parts of plants are, as far as possible, free from impurities such as soil, dust, dirt and other contami-nants such as fungal, insect and other animal contami- nations. /T_hey are not decayed. Harvested plants or the mother tinctures made thereof are analysed for content of heavy metals and pesticides./T_he range and frequency of this testing can occur ac-cording to a monitoring plan based on risk assessment. Unless otherwise stated, the collecting or harvesting times are generally: Whole plants with underground partsand plants without underground partsat /f_lowering time Leaves and shoots when fully developed Flowers shortly a/f_ter opening Bark throughout the year Underground parts of annual plantsat seed ripening time Underground parts of biennial and perennial plantsin spring Fruits and seeds at the time of ripening Fungi when the fruiting bod- ies are fully developed Starting materials of botanical origin see part IV , appendix 2.2. 2.3. Starting materials of zoological origin Starting materials of zoological origin are: Whole animals, organs, parts of organs dried or fresh; Animal secretions, extracts, blood products, calcareous products. Lower animals as well as warm-blooded animals are used. Animal husbandry and keeping must be adequate for the animal species (see also Council Directive (EEC) n\u00b0 2092/91). In particular in the case of warm-blooded APC Part I species animals from well-monitored \"Demeter\" or biodynamic herds are preferentially used. /T_he starting materials of zoological origin must meet the requirements of the European and/ or relevant national pharmacopoeias regarding the preparation of medicinal products from materials of animal origin and with EU directives and/or national guidelines of the appropriate regulatory authorities.In particular the Ph.Eur. monographs on TSE safety (Ph.Eur. 50208), and viral safety (Ph.Eur. 50107) apply. Animals must be healthy and in good hygienic condition. /T_he intervals given in legislation a/f_ter the administration of drugs to animals must be observed before the animals are used. Health requirements, animal keeping, protection of species and processing of animals must comply with the relevant guidelines of responsible national authorities and those of the European Union, where applicable. List of starting materials of zoological origin see part IV , appendix 2.3. 2.4. Starting materials that can be described chemicallyStarting materials that can be described chemically are inorganic and organic substances.Organic substances are generally of natural origin, e.g. puri/f_ied fractions. Preference should be given to clearly traceable sub- stances, that comply with the quality standards in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. List of starting materials that can be described chemically see part IV , appendix 2.4. 2.5. Starting materials that have undergone special treatmentStarting materials that have undergone a special treatment are: e.g. plants, parts of plants cultivated by special treatment (see part IIa, chapter 1.1. Vegetabilisation methods of substances used for mother tinctures). List of starting materials that have undergone special treatment see part IV appendix 2.5. 222.6. CompositionsDierent starting materials described in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 undergo one or more pharmaceutical processes that will lead to a substance that cannot be described as an addition of its ingredients. /T_he rationale for the synthesis is an anthroposophic formula, in accordance with the anthroposophic understanding of man and nature 1. List of compositions see part IV , appendix 2.6. 3. Vehicles and excipients Vehicles are auxiliary substances, which may be used for the production of active substances (e.g. ethanol to obtain an extract or lactose monohydrate to obtain a potentised preparation). Vehicles are also used in the production of mixtures (see part IIa, chapter 9). Excipients are auxiliary substances, which may be used for the production of the pharmaceutical dosage forms (e.g. NaCl to obtain an isotonic solution for parenteral preparations). Excipients are also used in the production of mixtures (see part IIa, chapter 9). Vehicles and excipients used in the manufacture of anthroposophic medicinal products comply with the relevant requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia or of the national pharmacopoeias used in the EU Member States. 4. Active substances 4.1. Starting materialsActive substances can be starting materials themselves or preparations.Starting material used directly as active substances may be the /f_inal dosage form, e.g. a herbal tea. 4.2.

In anthroposophic pharmacy the treatment of the raw or starting materials can already be part of the pharma-ceutical processing, e.g. a plant can be cultivated under treatment with a metal or mineral preparation.Metals can either be used as a concentrated starting material or undergo a pharmaceutical process depending on the rationale of the anthroposophic therapeutics. Preparations can be dierentiated according to the thermal condition or treatment in the pharmaceutical process. Hereby follows a scheme concerning the related pharmaceutical processes applied to plant material and the main sphere of action. Preparations may be the /f_inal dosage form, be incor- porated into the /f_inal dosage form or be processed further, e.g. by potentisation.

During this process the surface of the vehicle and the substance to be potentised are expanded and the mixing is thorough. /T_he potentising time diers for solid and liquid potentised preparations. Astrono-mical aspects may be considered (e.g. solar or lunar eclipse). Anthroposophic pharmacy mainly uses decimal attenuations. For co-potentised preparations the ratio between active substances to vehicle may vary, diering from 1:10 for homoeopathic co-potentising methods Preparations\").

APC Method 2.1.2. Metal mirrors obtained by Chemical Vapour Decomposition, CVDMetal mirrors prepared by chemical vapour decompo-sition are obtained from a volatile metal compound. A volatile metal compound is distilled under vacuum in appropriate equipment. /T_he temperature and the vacuum are to be chosen in such a way, that the metal compound is distilled. /T_he vapour is further heated until decomposition of the metal compound. As a result, the pure metal condenses onto the surface of the distillation equipment, producing a metal mirror. A/f_ter cooling the metal mirror is removed from the surface. APC Method 2.1.3. Metal mirrors obtained by reductionMetal mirrors prepared by reduction are obtained from an appropriate metal salt.To a solution of a metal salt an appropriate reducing agent and reagents are added. /T_he pure metal precipi-tates onto the surface of the reaction vessel producing the metal mirror. /T_he metal mirror is removed from the surface, /f_iltered from the solution, washed with puri/f_ied water and ethanol (the concentration of ethanol depending of the nature of the used reagents), until foreign matters are no longer detectable in the rinsing water and then dried. APC Method 2.1.4. Metal mirror foil Metal mirror foils are prepared by a process which transforms the processed metal into a plasma aggre-gation and /f_inally condenses as an approximate 55 - 65 nm thick metal mirror on to the substrate. To produce a metal mirror foil a process known as sputtering is used. In this vapour phase technique there is no melting of the metal. /T_he sputtering process is most commonly used for thin-/f_ilm deposition of many dierent metals. High energy ions impacting on the target can liberate sputtered atoms of the metal as well as positive ions and electrons. A metal target is put under the eect of a magnetrom. A magnetrom is comprised of a cathode (electron source) an anode (electron collector) and a combined electric and magnetic /f_ield. Vacuum conditions (0.5 - 5 x 10 -3 mbar) are generated and an inert gas (e.g. Argon Ph.Eur.) is used as medium. /T_he process begins as a result of a collision and momentum transfer from an incoming particle which impacts the inert gas ANTHROPOSOPHIC PHARMACEUTICAL CODEX APC 3.0 APC Part IIa 31from light for an appropriate time.
