Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, Jr. and his co-defendants at the Plastic Surgery Institute of Utah have allegedly given falsified vaccine cards to people in exchange for their donating $50 to an unnamed organization, one which exists to \"liberate the medical profession from government and industry conflicts of interest.\" As part of the scheme, Moore and his co-defendants are accused of giving children saline injections so that they would believe they were really being vaccinated. The co-defendants are Kari Dee Burgoyne, an office manager at the Plastic Surgery Institute of Utah; Sandra Flores, the office's receptionist; and, strangest of all, a woman named Kristin Jackson Andersen, who according to the indictment is Moore's neighbor. Andersen has posted copious and increasingly conspiratorial anti-vaccine content on Facebook and Instagram; Dr. Moore himself was a signatory on a letter [expressing support for a group of COVID-skeptical doctors](http://drelef.org/2022-open-letter-fsmb-abms/pmc-support-letter-final.pdf) whose certification was under review by their respective medical boards. The letter expresses support for ivermectin, [a bogus treatment ](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxda8q/the-ivermectin-guys-whole-thing-has-really-fallen-apart)for COVID. [According to the indictment](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.137139/gov.uscourts.utd.137139.1.0.pdf), the Plastic Surgery Center of Utah was certified as a real vaccine provider and signed a standard agreement with the CDC, which among other things requires doctor's offices not to \"sell or seek reimbursement\" for vaccines. Prosecutors allege that, when people seeking falsified vaccine cards contacted the office, Burgoyne, the office manager, referred them to Andersen, Dr. Moore's neighbor. Andersen, according to the indictment, would ask for the name of someone who'd referred them\u2014it had to be someone who'd previously received a fraudulent vaccine card, per the indictment\u2014then direct people to make a $50 donation to a charitable organization, referred to in the indictment only as \"Organization 1.\" Each vaccine card seeker was required to put an orange emoji in the memo line of their donation. After making a donation to the unnamed charitable organization, prosecutors allege, Andersen would send a link to vaccine card seekers to enable them to make an appointment at the Plastic Surgery Institute. With adult patients, Moore would allegedly use a real COVID vaccine dose in a syringe, but squirt it down the drain. Flores, the office's receptionist, gave an undercover agent a note, reading \"with 18 & younger, we do a saline shot,\" meaning that kids were injected with saline instead of a vaccine. Prosecutors allege the team thus disposed of at least 1,937 doses of COVID vaccines. All four people are charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to convert, sell, convey, and dispose of government property; and conversion, sale, conveyance, and disposal of government property and aiding and abetting. [Throughout the scheme](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/plastic-surgeon-accused-of-giving-391-fake-covid-shots-to-kids-in-125k-fraud-scheme/), the group reported the names of all the vaccine seekers to the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System, indicating that the practice had administered 1,937 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, which included 391 pediatric doses. The value of all the doses totaled roughly $28,000. With the money from the $50 vaccination cards totaling nearly $97,000, the scheme was valued at nearly $125,000, federal prosecutors calculated. \"By allegedly falsifying vaccine cards and administering saline shots to children instead of COVID-19 vaccines, not only did this provider endanger the health and well-being of a vulnerable population, but also undermined public trust and the integrity of federal health care programs,\" Curt Muller, special agent in charge with the Department of Health and Human Services for the Office of the Inspector General, said in [a statement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ut/pr/utah-doctor-and-co-defendants-charged-running-covid-19-vaccine-scheme-defraud-government). _________________________________ I am already baffled by anti-vax attitudes when they originate from practitioners of so-called alternative medicine (SCAM). When they come from real physicians and are followed by real actions, I am just speechless. As I stated many times before: studying medicine does unfortunately not protect you from recklessness, greed, or stupidity. "}
