There is, however, an uncertainty of the efficacy of these methods. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review is to assess the evidence for clinical efficacy of 24 CAVM therapies used in cats, dogs, and horses. A bibliographic search, restricted to studies in cats, dogs, and horses, was performed on Web of Science Core Collection, CABI, and PubMed. Relevant articles were assessed for scientific quality, and information was extracted on study characteristics, species, type of treatment, indication, and treatment effects. Of 982 unique publications screened, 42 were eligible for inclusion, representing nine different CAVM therapies, which were aromatherapy, gold therapy, homeopathy, leeches (hirudotherapy), mesotherapy, mud, neural therapy, sound (music) therapy, and vibration therapy. For 15 predefined therapies, no study was identified. The risk of bias was assessed as high in 17 studies, moderate to high in 10, moderate in 10, low to moderate in four, and low in one study. In those studies where the risk of bias was low to moderate, there was considerable heterogeneity in reported treatment effects. Therefore, the scientific evidence is not strong enough to define the clinical efficacy of the 24 CAVM therapies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-11-24", "cleaned_text": "A Systematic Review of Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: \"Miscellaneous A study conducted in New Zealand investigated the use of and attitudes towards allied health therapy via interviews with 110 horseback riders and trainers. It showed that 62% used physiotherapy, chiropractic, or massage on their horses. The most commonly used treatment was chiropractic, and the most common indication was equine back pain. Only 7% of respondents chose the relevant method on the recommendation of their veterinarian, and as many as 72% stated that the veterinarian and the therapist did not cooperate during the treatment [ [2](#B2-animals-11-03356)]. In addition, Bergenstrahle and Nielsen (2016) report that a minority of equine veterinarians, answering a survey, had taken CAVM classes during college [ [5](#B5-animals-11-03356)]. Further, the supply of services offered at veterinary clinics has historically been driven by demand from animal owners [ [6](#B6-animals-11-03356)]. Due to the demand from animal owners, veterinarians and other animal health personnel should be well prepared for questions regarding CAVM. There is therefore a need for unbiased information about the possible effects and consequences of the use of CAVM. The aim of the present article is to make a systematic literature review of CAVM therapies that are either rare or do not belong to a specific group of therapies (such as electrotherapies) and are therefore called \"miscellaneous therapies\". To the best of the authors' knowledge, only a limited number of previous systematic reviews match the scope of this article. The exceptions are one meta-analysis, one systematic veterinary medicine literature review of RCTs of homeopathy trials, and a systematic literature review of RCTs in gold therapy [ [7](#B7-animals-11-03356), [8](#B8-animals-11-03356), [9](#B9-animals-11-03356)]. 2.

The assessment was based on the following items: study design, statistical power, deviation from planned therapy, lost to follow-up, type of outcome assessment, and relevance. In the assessment of observational studies, risk of confounding was also included. The manual used for assessment of risk of bias and relevance is available as a [Supplementary File](#app1-animals-11-03356).

Discussion [54](#B54-animals-11-03356)] stated that the level of public interest makes it necessary for veterinary students to be prepared for questions about CAVM, but that the inclusion of CAVM courses in veterinary medicine must be based on evidence. Regardless of the veterinarian\u00b4s private opinion on CAVM, knowledge about the scientific basis for information on the advantages and disadvantages of using CAVM is essential in situations where the animal owner addresses the matter. Otherwise, owners may choose to use CAVM without telling their veterinarian, as human patients tend to do with regards to their doctor [ [55](#B55-animals-11-03356)]. Thus, there is a need for unbiased information regarding the scientific evidence for CAVM therapies. [7](#B7-animals-11-03356), [31](#B31-animals-11-03356)]. [56](#B56-animals-11-03356)], which may make veterinarians more likely to try CAVM as a complement to conventional medicine [ [5](#B5-animals-11-03356)]. Thus, therapies such as acupuncture and chiropractic can be offered for back pain and if horse owners have an interest in CAVM [ [57](#B57-animals-11-03356)]. Further, the range of services offered at veterinary clinics has historically been driven by demand from pet owners [ [6](#B6-animals-11-03356), [57](#B57-animals-11-03356)]. [9](#B9-animals-11-03356)], concluding that the case and retrospective studies, with a higher risk of bias, showed therapeutic success. However, the studies with a lower risk of bias showed no differences, and the single included RCT study with objective evaluation of the treatment effect showed no differences between treatment and placebo groups. [7](#B7-animals-11-03356)]. The authors excluded generalized conclusions about the effect of certain homeopathic remedies or the effect of individualized homeopathic intervention on a given medical condition in animals. In addition, the meta-analysis of nine homeopathy trials with a high risk of bias, and two studies with a lower risk of bias, conclude that there is very limited evidence that clinical intervention in animals using homeopathic remedies can be distinguished from similar placebo interventions [ [8](#B8-animals-11-03356)]. [58](#B58-animals-11-03356)]. The scope and quality of the scientific documentation for other therapies was such that no conclusions can be drawn regarding the methods' effectiveness in treating current animal species and indications. [10](#B10-animals-11-03356)] and SBU [ [11](#B11-animals-11-03356)]. The grading criteria included study design, study population, type of control, confounding factors, classification/selection, deviation from planned therapy, lost to follow-up, type of outcome assessment, and relevance. It is unlikely that, with another type of grading, a different result would have been reached. Thus, it is most unlikely that the overall conclusion would have been different. Limitations 5.
