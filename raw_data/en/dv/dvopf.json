Mind and body interventions focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior, with the intent to use the mind to affect physical functioning and promote health. Other examples of mind and body practices include deep-breathing exercises, [guided imagery], hypnotherapy, progressive relaxation, [qi gong], and tai chi. Historical note: The concept that the mind is important in the treatment of illness is integral to the healing approaches of traditional Chinese medicine and [Ayurvedic medicine], dating back more than 2,000 years. Hippocrates also noted the moral and spiritual aspects of healing and believed that treatment could occur only with consideration of attitude, environmental influences, and natural remedies. Current use: Several mind and body approaches ranked among the top 10 CAM practices reported by adults in the 2007 NHIS. The survey found that 12.7 percent of adults had used deep-breathing exercises, 9.4 percent had practiced meditation, and 6.1 percent had practiced yoga.
