Human deeds now and in the near future will have enormous consequences. How can we become more effective in life, personal and public? By changing our selves - SELF DEVELOPMENT - by honing and refining our human capacities over time we can achieve great goals for the good. The Anthroposophical Rosicrucian path of Self Development is a particular inner meditative path. Penelope Baring will be offering a one-day workshop to explore this. The workshop will include presentations, practice, artistic experience and conversation. The level will be guided by those who come and their questions. We shall begin the evening before with an informal presentation about Anthroposophical meditation of about half an hour, followed by conversation and questions. This will form the basis of Saturday's workshop. Penelope Baring has been a member of the Anthroposophical Society in America for more than 50 years and Class Reader since 1988. She has been a member of the Eastern Regional Council and subsequently by a member of the National Council of the Society.
