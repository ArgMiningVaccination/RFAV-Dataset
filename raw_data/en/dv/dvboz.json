Medical & Supporting staff were professional, friendly and know what they did. Nature is the essential element, and tranquility of the place with energy of water , trees, and sunshine, is healing experience in itself. Havan and morning meditation as New Year's sun rose on the horizon along with Guruma's words filled with nectar was an EMPOWERING experience. Highly recommend Nirvana to one and all, Wishing you a HAPPINESS! PranitaMore - Free Wifi - Free parking "}
