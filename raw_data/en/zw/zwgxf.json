Supplements have also been known to assist in restoring the delicate hormonal balance of your body and improving your overall well-being. What Supplements Can Balance Hormones? The following hormone balance supplements can help maintain harmony and improve hormonal health in your body: Magnesium Magnesium is a key mineral that helps support the production of steroid hormones such as testosterone, DHEA, progesterone, and estrogen. It also helps to convert tryptophan into serotonin, a hormone that helps regulate mood [1] and sleep. B vitamins (B12, B6, B3) Vitamins B12, B6, and B3 are essential in helping to regulate hormones. Vitamin B12 helps to create the adrenal hormones adrenaline and cortisol, while Vitamin B6 is essential in regulating estrogen levels. Vitamin B3 helps to detoxify excess amounts of steroid hormones, reducing the risk of hormone imbalances. Vitamin D 3 Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin produced in our body when exposed to sunlight, offers us numerous positive effects - from improving bone health and strength to elevating mood. Vitamin D [2] is an important hormone that helps regulate estrogen levels in the body. It works by controlling the calcium concentration in the blood, which is essential for the proper development and functioning of the reproductive system.

Zinc supplementation can be beneficial, as studies have revealed that it can lower triglycerides, insulin resistance [3], and excess hair growth while stabilizing blood sugar levels.

Furthermore, when taken daily in a supplement form, ashwagandha can play an integral role in male reproductive health and fertility by balancing hormones and boosting testosterone levels. An 8-week randomized controlled trial shows that men taking ashwagandha experienced significantly improved sexual health compared to those who received a placebo [5].

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help improve digestion, boost immunity, and reduce inflammation, positively affecting hormone levels. Fish oil Fish oil supplements are a natural way to rebalance hormones due to the omega-3 fatty acids they contain [6]. Though most brands are of poor quality and often rancid, you must get your hands on a superior product if you want optimal results from your supplement. Selenium Selenium is an essential mineral critical in keeping hormones regulated and maintaining equilibrium. It helps generate thyroid hormones, estrogen, and progesterone, boost fertility and strengthen the immune system. Fenugreek Fenugreek has been documented to have libido-boosting characteristics and anti-diabetic properties [7]. Supplementation of this plant could improve your sex life and blood sugar levels. In addition, studies have shown that Fenugreek can help reduce symptoms of PCOS, vaginal dryness, irritability, and mood swings. Maca Numerous studies suggest Maca has powerful properties for boosting libido and alleviating menopausal symptoms. This is likely due to its ability to stimulate the endocrine system, thereby releasing hormones that signal the pituitary gland to produce just enough of them. Black cohosh Black cohosh is an herbal remedy used for centuries to help balance key hormones and relieve menopause symptoms, PMS, period cramping, and irregular periods. Chaste tree Chaste tree, also known as chaste berry or Vitex, is a powerful herb that can help balance hormones.
