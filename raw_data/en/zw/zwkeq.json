It involves the insertion of ultra-fine, single-use, sterile needles at carefully selected points along the body's energetic pathways to remove blockages, rectify the flow of qi and blood, and stimulate the body's natural pain control and healing mechanisms. From a Western medicine perspective, acupuncture points are located at the sites of bundles of sensory neurons that, when stimulated, send signals to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) to release endorphins (the body's natural pain killers), anti-inflammatory agents, hormones, increase blood flow and boost immunity. Acupuncture treats a wide variety of conditions, including: Allergies/Asthma, Anxiety/Depression, Arthritis/Joint Disorders, Headache/Migraine, Heart Problems/Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Immune System Deficiency, Knee Pain, Menopausal Discomfort, Musculoskeletal Injuries, Pre-Menstrual Syndrome, Paralysis/Numbness, Rhinitis, Sciatica, Sexual Dysfunction, Side Effects of Chemotherapy, Sinusitis, Skin Problems, Stress/Tension, Stroke Rehabilitation, Tendonitis. Chinese Medicine [Read More](2-description) Chinese Medicine is a complete, holistic healing system used to diagnose, treat, and prevent illness for thousands of years. It views the human being as a microcosm of the larger natural world and health as a relative harmony of the energies (qi) that animate it. Rooted in the wisdom of ancient Daoist and Buddhist practices, Chinese Medicine recognizes that all the body's functions are interconnected and considers our entire being. When qi flows naturally through the body's energetic pathways, we are energized, nourished, and balanced. When this natural flow is disrupted or blocked, stagnation, pain, and illness arise. Traditional Chinese Medicine offers a wide range of health interventions and complementary healing modalities that treat illness's root (cause) and branch (symptoms). It provides a means of diagnosing patterns of disharmony to address mental, physical, and spiritual imbalances before they become diseases and offers us guidance into living well.
