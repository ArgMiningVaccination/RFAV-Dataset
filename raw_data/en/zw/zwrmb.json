Acu-Therapy is a treatment modality that I began using when I started practicing acupuncture. The technique incorporates Traditional Chinese Medicine, psychology, meditation, and the \"8 Non Somatic Extraordinary Vessels (NSEV)\". What are Non-Somatic Extraordinary Vessels (NSEV)? NSEV is a modern adaptation of an ancient Chinese medicine healing practice. As suggested by the name, the method is geared towards focusing on the mind's negative physical manifestation over matter (the body). Its primary objective is to address emotional distress, such as depression, anxiety, addictions, etc. that has, over time, manifested into physical pain or general disruption in the enjoyment of daily living. For example, a patient states he has indigestion along with a feeling as if he had a tight knot in his gut. During intake, I find that his boss makes him \"sick to his stomach\". I'll treat the primary complaints but we will ultimately have to get to the root of the problem to resolve the symptoms. The patient feels \"stuck\". He needs the job but cannot deal with the stress. Where to go? Amongst other methods, one of the 8 NSEV protocols that I will likely use with him, based on the information received, is the Dai Mai. The English translation is \"the belt or girdle\". The protocol \"loosens the belt\" enabling him to move forward allowing him to see other possible options. What are the 8 Non-Somatic Extraordinary Vessels? The 8 Non Somatic Extraordinary Vessels are: Yang Wei Yin Wei Yin Qiao Yang Qiao Dai Mai Chong Du Mai Ren Mai These are points that lie outside of the traditional 14 channels (meridians) of Chinese Medicine. Psychology and Meditation in Conjunction of Acupuncture Therapy Psychology and meditation are also important aspects of Acu-Therapy. It is vital to help the patient become more aware of their thoughts, emotions, and actions. Moreover, in the mind-body therapies of Chinese medicine it is believed that the mind controls the body. If the mind is in a state of disharmony, the body will follow suit. It is only through the acknowledgment and understanding of one's thoughts and emotions that change can occur. What is [Acupuncture ](https://www.eacuwell.com/acupuncture)Therapy or Acu-Therapy? Acu-Therapy treatment addresses a person's negative core patterns. The goal is to create a healthy balance among these internal core patterns, as well as overall harmony in the way a person interacts with the world around them. Walt Disney once said, \"If you want your life to change you must change your thoughts. Thoughts influence your feelings, feelings create actions and your physical actions achieve your results.\" Our thoughts are often the cause of emotional and physical diseases. Through Acu-Therapy, you will become aware of your thought patterns. Awareness of an imbalance in thinking is always a good first step to healing. With acupuncture techniques, specifically by implementing meditation and the Non-somatic Extraordinary Vessels (NSEV model), you will begin to access the root of the disease which has become stuck in your psyche and ultimately in your physical being. Once you are aware of where this lies, you will be able to release it and in time, experience the joy of balance and well-being. What is acupuncture therapy? Acupuncture therapy is the use of acupuncture in the treatment of psychological disorders. The belief is based on the idea that imbalances in the flow of energy in the body cause mental disorders. Moreover, we use it to restore balance to the flow of energy, which then relieves mental disorders' symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) We have been using [Traditional Chinese Medicine](https://www.eacuwell.com/chinese-medicine) (TCM) as a system of healthcare for over 2000 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes TCM as an effective form of medicine. Furthermore, TCM is based on the belief that the human body has a natural ability to heal itself. The goal of TCM is to help the body maintain this natural ability by restoring balance. TCM is a holistic approach to medicine that looks at the entire person, not just the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, TCM practitioners use a variety of techniques to treat their patients. These include [acupuncture](https://www.eacuwell.com/acupuncture), [herbs](https://www.eacuwell.com/herbal-medicine), [diet, and lifestyle changes](https://www.eacuwell.com/nutritional-therapy). [Acupuncture](https://www.acumantras.com/community-acupuncture) Acupuncture is one of the most well-known aspects of Traditional Chinese Medicine. We have used it as a form of therapy for over 3000 years. Acupuncture is based on the belief that there is a life force energy, known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), that flows through the body. This Qi is responsible for our overall health and well-being. The goal of acupuncture is to restore balance to the body by correcting any imbalances in the flow of Qi. Acupuncture is done by inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. These points are located along what is known as meridians. The 14 main meridians in the body correspond to different organs and systems. Acupuncture is a safe and effective form of therapy. Furthermore, it is proven to help in the treatment of a wide variety of conditions, such as pain, headaches, nausea, anxiety, and depression. Acupuncture vs. Dry Needling Acupuncture and dry needling are often confused with each other. Both procedures involve the insertion of needles into the skin. However, there are some important differences between these two procedures. Dry needling is a relatively new procedure that has only been used for the past few decades. It is based on the Western medical model of anatomy and physiology. The goal of dry needling is to release muscle tension and trigger points. There are some similarities between acupuncture and dry needling. However, there are also some important differences. Acupuncture is a holistic approach to medicine that looks at the whole person, not just the symptoms of the disease. Dry needling is a more targeted approach that focuses on specific muscle groups. Conclusion Acutherapy is a holistic approach to medicine that looks at the entire person, not just the symptoms of the disease. Acupuncture therapy is a great way to restore balance in your body's energy system, which will relieve symptoms of mental disorders. It is helpful in the treatment of a wide variety of conditions, including pain, headaches, nausea, anxiety, and depression. If you are considering acupuncture to treat a mental disorder, it is important to consult with a qualified practitioner.
