To Request an Action Plan to Address Hormone Imbalances [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) The Symptoms of Hormone Imbalance may be caused by a multitude of reasons, ALL of which stem from Digestive Problems, Dietary Deficiencies and Liver stagnation. The bottom line is that there is an incorrect relationship between estrogen and progesterone levels in the woman's body, the Thyroid is suppressed and the Adrenal Glands are depleted. In order to truly be healthy, ALL of these must coexist peacefully in a perfect balance. Any variations and changes in this perfect balance will start to have a dramatic effect on the woman's health. Symptoms of Hormonal Imbalance in Women Some of the symptoms of hormonal imbalances are Unfortunately, if the symptoms are ignored in the initial stages, then they can grow worse as time goes by. What Influences Female Hormones? The amount of these hormones produced in a woman's body can vary from one month to the next because they are dependent on factors such as stress, nutrition (or lack of it), too much exercise, being overweight, ovulation time or the use of birth control using artificial hormones. Ovulation As a Decisive Factor in Hormonal Balance Normal ovulation occurs every month from the beginning of puberty (age 9 to 15) through menopause when it stops. Menopause onset differs for women and may begin in as early as the late 30's all the way through the early '50s. The wide variation of time is a strong indicator of what has happened to women related to their hormone balance and the artificial regulation of it through birth control. When there is no ovulation, the production of progesterone from the ovaries does not happen, and as a direct result, the healthy accepted levels of progesterone start to decline. Making sure your [Adrenal Glands are strong and healthy](healthyadrenalsagirlsbestfriend.asp) allows for a smooth transition when moving into menopause. When your [adrenal glands are depleted](adrenalfatigue.asp) due to chronic stress, symptoms of menopause will begin to occur. These include [hot flashes](hot-flashes.asp), vaginal dryness, and decreased libido. Several young women today, some in their early thirties and some even younger, have started to experience the early onset of hormone imbalance symptoms and their associated disorders. This should not be happening and there are various reasons for this new \"medical\" condition. There are several contributors to Hormonal Imbalances in both Women and Men. Although the majority of pharmaceuticals are focused on it only being a problem women have, pharmaceutical \"remedies\" for men are becoming more common. Why Do We Develop Hormone Problems? Before we can identify a problem, let's look at the Hormonal System and the glands involved in their regulation. Endocrine glands are glands of the Endocrine System that secrete their products, hormones, directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the Endocrine System include: The Major Hormones produced most are aware of are by the following 4 Glands: I think we can all appreciate that if you do not have proper fuel, the system does not go very far or function properly. This is especially true for the Hormonal System. Therefore, we need to go back to the place the body derives its fuel from, the Digestive System and then the Hepatic System, specifically the Liver which regulates hormonal production based on having the required inventory for manufacturing the hormones. The Digestive System Connection Eating quality food is becoming more of a challenge in our country as we consume entirely too much Completely Refined And Processed (CRAP) foods and suffer from Dysbiosis as a result of the [Digestive System Disruptors](digestivesystemdisruptors.asp). As a result, we create [Leaky Gut Syndrome](leakygutsyndrome.asp) leading to a circulatory overload of undigested proteins, an appropriate Immune Response is known as an [allergy](allergies.asp), creating an increase in inflammation heading to the Liver. The Liver, which acts as a filter, must now sift through and sort out what the body needs and what the body can let go of and excrete as waste. The result of this downward spiraling is an overwhelmed Liver leading to What Sorts of Health Consequences are We Talking About? Health conditions of: Can you begin to see the importance of addressing this Hormonal Problem at the Source? Do not fall for masking symptoms with artificial hormones creating glandular deficiencies and eventual failure. Your Hormonal System is entirely too important to your overall health to allow your Medical Doctor to ruin yours. The Medical Perspective Hormonal Imbalances vary from person to person and there is no one size fits all as explained above. Unfortunately, evaluating the specific hormonal imbalance may be challenging. Your medical doctor should run a hormonal panel specific to your Reproductive System, your Adrenal System Many Endocrinologists and/or Gynecologists do not choose to order whole panels if they figure they will just put you on artificial hormones anyway. It would be important for you to ask for the complete hormonal work-up to understand what your hormones are doing so appropriate medications can be prescribed. Quickly reaching for the \"standard\" hormone prescription without a proper work-up simply because you are in the age of these concerns, should be a red flag. And you may choose to find a different practitioner who will listen and work with you to understand your problem. What About Bio-Identical Hormones? Are \"bioidentical\" or \"natural\" hormones safer and more effective than hormones used in traditional hormone therapy for menopause symptoms? Answers from Shannon K. Laughlin-Tommaso, M.D. No, they aren't. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several medical specialty groups, the hormones marketed as \"bioidentical\" and \"natural\" aren't safer than hormones used in traditional hormone therapy, and there's no evidence they're any more effective. The term \"bioidentical\" means the hormones in the product are chemically identical to those your body produces. In fact, the hormones in bioidentical medications may not be any different from those in traditional hormone therapy. Several hormone therapy products approved by the FDA and prescribed by health care providers contain bioidentical hormones. \"Natural\" means the hormones in the product come from plant or animal sources; they're not synthesized in a lab. However, many of these products still need to be commercially processed to become bioidentical. Traditional hormone therapies don't necessarily exclude natural hormones. Some FDA-approved products \u2014 such as Estrace, Climara Marketers of compounded bioidentical hormones say their products have certain advantages over traditional hormone therapy: Some women may benefit from nonstandard doses and forms of hormones in compounded bioidentical hormone preparations, but there's currently no scientific support for an advantage of these compounds over common commercially produced preparations. The Controversy with Bio-identical Hormones There are plenty of doctors that say otherwise, which begs the question. If these bio-identical hormones are processed by pharmaceutical companies for the medical profession, then why the division within the medical community? [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Dr. Huntoon understands the Functional Endocrinology of the Understanding that hormones are made from the building-blocks we obtain from our food, we need to eat real food and make sure our digestive system is properly balanced. Which mean we have to address the [Digestive System Disruptors](digestivesystemdisruptors.asp) and help heal the [Leaky Gut Syndrome](leakygutsyndrome.asp). Once this is properly functioning, we can help a person make better food choices to provide the body with the necessary hormone precursors required to make your own hormones the way nature/GOD intended. In many cases, the hormonal imbalance treatment is a lot simpler than women think. There are several methods which are becoming popular simply because they do not involve taking artificial, unnatural hormones or medication based approach, so make sure you check them out if you are suffering from female hormonal imbalance. Working with a [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp) can help you develop a plan for restoring balance to your hormones when taking HRT or other synthetic solutions is not your choice. Be sure to discuss your options with your Medical Doctor or your Pharmacist to understand the potential for side-effects and or other complications before starting any medication that involves your hormones. Many times by beginning to take artificial hormones, proper regulation of your hormonal system is now lost and the medication becomes a permanent treatment. Restoring balance after artificial hormonal treatment becomes a more difficult road back to health. Lifestyle Changes As Hormonal Imbalance Treatment Diet changes and a different approach to everyday life can help with hormonal imbalance. Make sure you drink enough fluids, consume food that is organic or as natural as possible, and eliminate [caffeine](caffeine.asp) and alcohol from your life. Completely Refined And Processed (CRAP) food with all its artificial additives and ingredients is what will be sure to create a hormonal imbalance. You may think that this hormonal imbalance treatment looks very similar to a detoxifying routine and you would not be wrong to think so. Still, if you associate these lifestyle changes with restoring balance to your emotional world, keeping your eye on your goal and how your life will improve is important. Intake of oils rich in Omega 3 and 6 will help create the basis for developing hormones in a balanced way. Stress relief while supporting your [adrenal glands ](healthyadrenalsagirlsbestfriend.asp)through whole food supplementation will go a long way towards that end. Studies have shown that women suffering from hormonal imbalance had very good results post vitamin B, C, and D treatment especially when this treatment was associated with positive dietary changes and exercising. Working with your [Holistic Chiropractor](WhatIsAHolisticChiropractor.asp) to develop a well-rounded, multifaceted approach to balancing your nutrition and hormone production will enable you to achieve this. Random Causes for Female Hormonal Imbalance They really are not \"random\" when you read the above section on CAUSE. The 1960's Pill was made out of synthetic estrogen, and although it was declared as safe by the FDA, the fact that several women died while taking it was not taken into account. In addition to several other symptoms, the Pill caused lower progesterone levels, causing hormone imbalance in these unfortunate women. Using Hormone Replacement Therapy or HRT means using a combination of synthetic progestin and estrogen, and the usage of these pills causes a hormonal imbalance in women. As with any medication, becoming aware of all the potential side-effects and complications is important. Discussing this fully with your medical doctor or pharmacist is prudent. Stress, drastic diets, extreme workout or important changes in the everyday routine can become reasons for hormonal balance in women. You have to remember that your body needs time to adjust to any change you assume for yourself and it must do that on a hormonal level too. Dr. Huntoon understands the Functional Endocrinology of the problem and based on understanding the CAUSE of yours, can help you develop a fully comprehensive solution to addressing your specific needs. He has been doing this for 27 years with great success.
