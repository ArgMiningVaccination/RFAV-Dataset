This protocol was also developed to help Dr. Chappy balance his own life with family, work and fitness. We are bombarded with information these days and it is hard to know what to do and who to trust. We think it is important to draw our information from sources that are in line with our core value system. In this office, we practice discernment with all aspects of our health routines. We think that healthy habits and behaviors are the key to longevity and a quality life. We are passionate about our health and we associate with similar health influencers. The ENRMASS Protocol is a framework or template to be used as a guide when it comes to your health routines. The acronym was created to be easily remembered. The first letter of each word is critical part of our approach towards optimal health. Here's how it works...if you have any issue, then you work each of these steps. For example, if you have low back pain, then we work this chart. Good health requires hard work and organization. This chart is a basic outline of how we work this program for you.
