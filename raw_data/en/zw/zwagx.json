Facts and the latest updates about COVID-19 vaccination See the CDC's [resource page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/about-covid-19.html) for extensive information and the latest recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Why get vaccinated? Immunization helps save millions of lives every year. Whereas most medicines treat or cure diseases, vaccines can help prevent them by working with your body's natural defenses to build protection. When you receive a vaccine, your immune system responds. Vaccines prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, and help people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally, immunization currently prevents between 2 and 3 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles. COVID-19 vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least six feet away from others, may help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following [CDC's recommendations to protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) will offer the best protection from COVID-19.
