While there are many things you can do to improve your overall health and boost your immune system, eating certain foods can make a big difference. Here are four of the best foods we recommend for boosting your immune system at Valley Community Healthcare. Garlic Garlic is a great food for boosting your immune system because it contains quercetin, an antioxidant that helps to reduce inflammation in the body. This is especially important during cold and flu season when it's common to experience inflamed sinuses. Luckily, garlic also has antibacterial properties that help fight off germs before you get sick or if you currently have a mild cold or flu. Elderberry Elderberry is a great food to help boost your immune system because it contains antioxidants and flavonoids, which fight free radicals in the body and stop them from causing damage to the cells. It also contains anthocyanins, which help strengthen blood vessels and reduce inflammation in the body. There is even some research that suggests elderberries are effective for treating respiratory infections \u2014 including the flu \u2014 and shortening their length. Tomatoes Tomatoes contain high levels of lycopene, which has been linked to lower rates of cancer and heart disease because it reduces inflammation in the body. The antioxidant also helps increase your immune system's ability to fight off cold and flu germs. Tomatoes are one of the best sources for lycopene \u2014 especially cooked versions of them \u2014 so include them often in your diet! Oats Oats are a great food to boost your immune system due to their high level of antioxidants and zinc. These antioxidants work together to help fight off free radicals that cause oxidative stress, which contributes to inflammation and the development of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. Additionally, oats contain a type of fiber called beta-glucan, which helps to boost the immune system by increasing the number of white blood cells in your body. Zinc is also beneficial for boosting your immune system as it helps to fight off infection. Boost your immune system and eat healthy every day by including these four foods in your diet!
