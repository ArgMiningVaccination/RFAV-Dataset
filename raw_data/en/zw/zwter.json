[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) - Key is the unit of measurement for energy? Can energy be created? energy, in [physics](https://www.britannica.com/science/physics-science), the capacity for doing [work](https://www.britannica.com/science/work-physics). It may exist in [potential](https://www.britannica.com/science/potential-energy), [kinetic](https://www.britannica.com/science/kinetic-energy), [thermal](https://www.britannica.com/science/thermal-energy), electrical, [chemical](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemical-energy), [nuclear](https://www.britannica.com/science/nuclear-energy), or other various forms. There are, moreover, [heat](https://www.britannica.com/science/heat) and work\u2014i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another. After it has been transferred, energy is always designated according to its nature. Hence, heat transferred may become thermal energy, while work done may [manifest](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manifest) itself in the form of [mechanical energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/mechanical-energy). All forms of energy are associated with [motion](https://www.britannica.com/science/motion-mechanics). For example, any given body has [kinetic energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/kinetic-energy) if it is in motion. A tensioned device such as a [bow](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bow-and-arrow) or [spring](https://www.britannica.com/technology/spring-machine-component), though at rest, has the potential for creating motion; it contains [potential energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/potential-energy) because of its configuration. Similarly, nuclear [energy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/energy-conversion) is potential energy because it results from the configuration of [subatomic particles](https://www.britannica.com/science/subatomic-particle) in the nucleus of an [atom](https://www.britannica.com/science/atom). [ Britannica Quiz Energy & Fossil Fuels ](/quiz/energy-fossil-fuels) Energy can be neither created nor destroyed but only changed from one form to another. This principle is known as the conservation of energy or the [first law of thermodynamics](https://www.britannica.com/science/thermodynamics/The-first-law-of-thermodynamics#ref258541). For example, when a box slides down a hill, the potential energy that the box has from being located high up on the slope is [converted](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/converted) to kinetic energy, energy of motion. As the box slows to a stop through [friction](https://www.britannica.com/science/friction), the kinetic energy from the box's motion is converted to thermal energy that heats the box and the slope. Energy can be converted from one form to another in various other ways. Usable mechanical or electrical energy is, for instance, produced by many kinds of devices, including fuel-burning heat engines, generators, [batteries](https://www.britannica.com/technology/battery-electronics), [fuel cells](https://www.britannica.com/technology/fuel-cell), and [magnetohydrodynamic](https://www.britannica.com/technology/magnetohydrodynamic-power-generator) systems. In the [International System of Units](https://www.britannica.com/science/International-System-of-Units) (SI), energy is measured in [joules](https://www.britannica.com/science/joule). One [joule](https://www.britannica.com/science/joule) is equal to the work done by a one- [newton](https://www.britannica.com/science/newton-unit-of-measurement) [force](https://www.britannica.com/science/force-physics) acting over a one- [metre](https://www.britannica.com/science/metre-measurement) distance. Energy is treated in a number of articles. For the development of the [concept](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/concept) of energy and the principle of energy conservation, see [principles of physical science](https://www.britannica.com/science/principles-of-physical-science); [mechanics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mechanics); [thermodynamics](https://www.britannica.com/science/thermodynamics); and [conservation of energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-of-energy).
