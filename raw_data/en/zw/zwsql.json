The second compressor acts as a backup, and energy usage is dramatically reduced. Standard ultra-low freezers rely on a cascade refrigeration system. If this system fails, the freezer and your samples have to be removed in a couple of hours. LN2 or CO2 backups only sustain temperatures for approximately 7 hours, and require routine re-filling, maintenance & supervision. Hz||30| The Smartest, Safest ULT Freezer Delivering Peace of Mind with Total Sample Security PERFECT for COVID-19 Vaccines, critical material storage in biorepositories, medical research facilities, BSL4 labs, hospitals, anywhere valuable samples need to be stored safely SAFEST TWINCORE BASED TECHNOLOGY employs 2 Core, 2 refrigeration system, 2 control commands for Compressors, enabling one to maintain temperature if the other is disabled, unparalleled safety! FAST Dual Cooling system enables the fastest pull down (4.5hr) & door opening recovery times (80min) after 2min door opening. TIGHTEST UNIFORMITY industry best +/-2.5C uniformity ensures your samples are being stored within the proper temperature range to maintain integrity GREATLY reduced frost development on the inner compartment doors due to interlocking gasket design and heated door seal MORE ULT Sample Storage on your Floor Space, 50-90% more samples in the same space UNIQUE revolutionary dual core refrigeration system NEW HANDLE Lockable Door Handle for easy access EASIEST to use, color 7'' touchscreen panel allows full user control HANDIEST USB PORT makes transferring logged data to a PC simple and convenient. Important information such as freezer temperature, door opening times and alarm history is logged for monitoring in GLP applications. BEST INSULATION Combining vacuum insulation panels with high efficiency dual layered insulated inner doors ensures longest cold retention and pull-up times. Ensures optimum temperature uniformity, while reduced wall thickness maximizes storage capacity and reduces energy usage by 40%. Compact, reliable, energy-efficient storage for cold-chain management, short-term or long-term ultra-low storage and transport of biological specimens.
