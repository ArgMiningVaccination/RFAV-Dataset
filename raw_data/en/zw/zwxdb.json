I hereby appoint the Honorable Carlos Curbelo to act as Speaker pro tempore on this day. John A. Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives. ____________________ MORNING-HOUR DEBATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of January 6, 2015, the Chair will now recognize Members from lists submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning-hour debate. The Chair will alternate recognition between the parties, with each party limited to 1 hour and each Member other than the majority and minority leaders and the minority whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 p.m. ____________________ GEORGE W. BUSH SPEAKER'S FEE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, July 9, I saw a report on ABC News that former President George W. Bush charged $100,000 to speak at a charity fundraiser for military veterans wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was disappointed to learn that a President who sent thousands of Americans to die in an unnecessary war justified by manipulated intelligence would charge a fee to speak at a fundraiser for wounded veterans. ABC also reported that, in addition to charging $100,000 to speak at the charity: ``The former President was also provided with a private jet to travel to Houston at a cost of $20,000.'' Further, ABC News reported: ``One of the wounded vets who served on the charity board told ABC News he was outraged that his former commander in chief would charge any fee to speak on behalf of men and women he ordered into harm's way. ```For him to be paid to raise money for veterans that were wounded in combat under his orders, I don't think that's right,' said former Marine Eddie Wright.'' Eddie Wright, Mr. Speaker, lost both hands in a rocket attack in Fallujah in Iraq in the year 2004. This is so disappointing and outrageous. These veterans have been severely wounded, and the President that led us into an unjustified war charges $100,000 to be in their presence. That is wrong, Mr. Speaker. That is really, really wrong. Many of these wounded veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan live in the Third District in North Carolina, which I have the privilege to represent. For years, I have felt deep regret over my vote to go into Iraq; and to atone for that, I have publicly and privately apologized and signed over 11,000 letters to families who lost loved ones in Afghanistan and Iraq because of my mistake. President Bush and Vice President Cheney have never publicly apologized to the families for the unnecessary war they began. Mr. Speaker, I think my friend Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, was right about the Iraq war. On MSNBC a couple of months ago, Colonel Wilkerson stated: ``The intelligence was fixed, and everyone should know that by now. It was a failure of the intelligence agencies, but it was also a failure of the political people who manipulated the intelligence failure to their own benefit.'' He further stated: ``It destroyed the balance of power in the Gulf and produced what we have today, the chaos we have today: al Qaeda in Iraq--never there until we invaded; ISIS--never there until we invaded; the mess we have in Yemen. Everything that's happening in the Middle East today can be attributed to our having destroyed the balance of power that we had carefully maintained for a half a century with the invasion in 2003. It was a disaster.'' I have a lot of respect for Colonel Wilkerson because he is telling the truth when he made this statement to MSNBC. Let me repeat the words of Marine Eddie Wright, who lost both hands in Iraq: ``For him,'' President Bush, ``to be paid to raise money for veterans that were wounded . . . under his orders, I don't think that's right.'' Mr. Speaker, it is not right; and I will add my own thoughts and use the word ``shameful,'' that the former President and his administration, who created an unnecessary war and sent our troops over there to die and also to be wounded, should not charge one dime to go help them out now. So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask God to bless America. ____________________ THE CHATTANOOGA 5 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a gunman with a heart fatally bent on mischief and with malice aforethought unleashed hell in Chattanooga last Thursday. The killer shot up an Armed Forces recruiting center and then drove to a Navy Reserve center and continued his shooting spree. Five warriors were caught in the gunman's furious rampage and were killed. The killer, who once followed an al Qaeda cleric online, wounded three others. To kill the very people who devote their lives to keeping our country safe is ironically and tragically sad. They were fathers, boyfriends, sons, brothers, and friends whose lives were robbed. The fallen were: Gunnery Sergeant Thomas J. Sullivan, United States Marine Corps. He was from Massachusetts. Tommy, as [[Page 11796]] his buddies and family called him, was deployed twice during the Iraq war and received two Purple Hearts. He had been enlisted for almost 18 years. The Sullivan family owns a local bar and restaurant in Springfield, Massachusetts, and pictures of red, white, and blue ribbons memorialize the veteran on the restaurants's Facebook page. He was an avid Boston sports fan who loved Boston-based bands and musicians. A friend said: ``He was a short guy, but his personality was a lot bigger than his height. You couldn't just not like Tom.'' He was 41. Lance Corporal Squire ``Skip'' Wells, United States Marine Corps. He was from Cobb County, Georgia, and the service was in his blood. He was a student attending Georgia Southern University when he decided to follow in the footsteps of his family and enlist. God and country flowed deep in his veins. On Thursday, Skip had been texting with his girlfriend of 2\\1/2\\ years about her upcoming visit to Chattanooga. The last text he sent her was two words in capitalized letters that read, ``active shooter.'' She tried desperately to reach him, but she did not learn about the murders until the next day. He was in his early twenties. Sergeant Carson A. Holmquist, United States Marine Corps. A patriotic outdoorsman from a small town in Grantsburg, Wisconsin, he joined the Marines right out of high school and was taken to the battlefields in a foreign land. He was deployed to Afghanistan twice as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. It was reported that he was so proud of being a marine that, when he finished boot camp, he went right back to the small town of Grantsburg to visit his high school, dressed in his Marine uniform. He and his wife had a young son and were expecting another. He was 25. Staff Sergeant David A. Wyatt, United States Marine Corps. He was a native of Russellville, Arkansas. He was a husband and a father. He served one tour of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was described as a leader, a mentor, quick to help, and was easy to approach. Wyatt was a father who was overjoyed about the upcoming birth of his second child. He also planned to serve at least 20 years in the military. He was 35. Petty Officer Second Class Randall Smith, United States Navy. He was a former high school baseball star from Paulding, Ohio, joined the Navy in 2010. He was a pitcher for the Paulding High School Panthers, and he accepted a scholarship to play baseball at Defiance College in Ohio. After a shoulder injury, Smith decided to forego sports and serve his Nation. He was a father and a husband. He had three little girls. According to his Facebook page, he was a passionate sports fan. He was passionate about the United States Women's Soccer team and their World Cup win. He had even a love for the Houston Astros. He was 26. Good men, good warriors, good Americans--all died before their time. This was a senseless and callous act of hate. Even though these military facilities in Chattanooga are riddled with bullet holes, they are still a steadfast symbol of the patriotism of our military. There are not enough tears or words to convey the sorrow that has engulfed this Nation. These volunteers that serve our country are the best that this Nation has, and we continue to mourn their loss and pray for their families and friends. Ronald Reagan said it best: ``We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.'' The Chattanooga 5. And that is just the way it is. ____________________ CARING FOR OUR VETERANS HERE AT HOME The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize John Enstrom of Elk River and the Disabled Veterans of America organization for all the incredible work they have done and continue to do for our Nation's veterans. On August 5, John is hosting a charity fishing event in Ramsey, Minnesota. He is hosting the event for disabled American veterans. Along with friends and volunteers, John plans to bring 150 wounded veterans to a private lake for a great day of fishing, games, and simply enjoying the great Minnesota outdoors. Our veterans have stood for our country's freedom and individual liberty, all the while putting their lives on the line. Disabled veterans have sacrificed in order to protect and serve our great Nation. It is an extraordinary kind of person who cares for others so deeply. I would like to thank John and the Disabled Veterans of America not only for all the work they have done for this event, but for also recognizing that veterans need and deserve to be cared for once they return home. Small Community Banks Harmed by Dodd-Frank Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the fifth anniversary of Dodd-Frank to share a story from a small community bank that has three locations in my district. This bank is struggling due to the additional regulation that Dodd-Frank has imposed on them. They were forced to hire a full-time compliance director in addition to retaining two outside compliance firms. This has cost the bank nearly $100,000 more a year. In addition, numerous other staff members now have to take time away from revenue-generating activities to satisfy the compliance regulations of Dodd-Frank. They told me: ``Compliance has always been a cost that is just a part of our business. However, since Dodd-Frank, this cost has expanded greatly. Unfortunately, since there is no offsetting revenue for the expanding cost, we are forced to consider passing on costs to our customers with additional fees.'' Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say this is an isolated occurrence, but a recent study shows that Dodd-Frank has added 61 million hours of paperwork and more than $24 billion in final rule costs for the financial industry in this country. Nationwide, we have lost approximately 1500 community banks already. The 5 years since Dodd-Frank was signed into law have been marked with 5 years of failure. Undefeated Season Ends with State Championship Title Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate the Anoka-Hennepin Mustangs for being named the 2015 Minnesota State champions in physically impaired adapted softball. Comprised of students from Andover, Anoka, Blaine, Champlin Park, and Coon Rapids, these players were a force to be reckoned with at this year's State championship tournament. Having earned the number one seed, the Mustangs went into the tournament boasting 11 wins, with more than 167 runs scored during this season. With the momentum of an undefeated season, the Mustangs cruised to victory at the recent State championship. After scoring nearly a dozen runs and completing a few notable double plays, the Mustangs won the championship game with an 11-8 victory over the Rochester Raiders. Even more impressive, the Mustang championship win ended a 6-year winning streak for the previous defending champions. I ask that this body join me in congratulating these tremendous athletes. Well done. Siding with American Farmers Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the House Agriculture and the Energy and Commerce Committees' actions on the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015, of which I am a cosponsor. Biotechnology is nothing new. Norman Borlaug, a researcher and legend in my home State, was the ``father of the Green Revolution'' while at the University of Minnesota due to his groundbreaking work on high- yield crops that have fed billions of people around the globe. American farmers already deal with heavy compliance regulations to ensure that our food is safe to eat. Families must know that Borlaug's incredible accomplishment and the hard work of the American farmer is not in vain. [[Page 11797]] It is no surprise that I am not a fan of the Federal bureaucracy, but on this issue we must stand with American farmers on the health and safety of our food. We should move in the right direction, and the House should pass this bipartisan legislation that will create a voluntary label that supports farmers and American families. ____________________ {time} 1215 41ST ANNIVERSARY OF TURKEY'S INVASION OF CYPRUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) for 5 minutes. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark an anniversary that has pained the Cypriot and Hellenic communities for 41 years. On July 20, 1974, 41 years ago yesterday, in blatant violation of international law, Turkey invaded Cyprus and captured much of the northern part of the island. Since the invasion, Turkey has occupied nearly 40 percent of Cyprus. They inhabit homes previously owned by Greek Cypriots, forcibly relocating 160,000 Greek Cypriots and infusing the island with hundreds of thousands of Turkish settlers. Another 1,500 Cypriots remain missing since the 1974 invasion, including four Americans whose remains have not been located. Religious artifacts and cultural relics have been destroyed in the wake of the Turkish Army's invasion and, after 41 years of displacement, are now lost to time. Hundreds of churches and monasteries have been shamefully desecrated, losing all sense of their historic and religious significance. Cyprus has been a steadfast ally, and Cypriots deserve an end to this senseless division. With negotiations underway again for reunification, let's hope this time next year we will be celebrating the end of this illegal occupation. As it builds, Turkey cannot be allowed to stonewall this democratic process any longer. Today the United States stands in a unique role as a friend of both Cyprus and Turkey. As an honest broker to both sides, we can help them to see that a unified future for Cyprus is far more promising than the present. The United States' relationship with all its allies--Turkey included--must be based on shared values and mutual respect. At the core, the rule of law must be respected above all else. Forty-one years of illegal occupation is 41 years too long. Cyprus has long been a strong and faithful ally of the United States, and we owe our support for both peace and the end of this illegal occupation. I encourage the Cypriot leaders to keep up the hard work of unifying a people divided for over a generation. Many hard issues remain, but, hopefully, this will be the last year we acknowledge this illegal occupation. ____________________ ELDRIDGE WILLIAMS, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Emmer of Minnesota). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of one of my constituents, Lieutenant Colonel Eldridge Williams, a Tuskegee Airman who passed away this month at the age of 97. Born in Texas in 1917, Lieutenant Colonel Williams graduated from Xavier University in 1942 and immediately applied for the Army flight program. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in Miami Beach in 1942. Lieutenant Colonel Williams trained Tuskegee Airmen who flew overseas to escort bomber planes across Europe. Though he didn't make it overseas, he flew at the Tuskegee Institute and trained other pilots until the end of World War II. He continued to serve during the 1948 Berlin Airlift and the Korean war. In 1949, Mr. Williams moved to Richmond Heights, a community in South Miami-Dade established for Black servicemen returning from the war. Mr. Williams taught physical education at Richmond Heights Middle School and was soon after promoted to administrator, serving as director of desegregation for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. He retired from the school system in 1985, but remained committed to overseeing programs aimed at assisting kids that had dropped out of school. President George W. Bush presented Mr. Williams and the other living Tuskegee Airmen with a Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. This was an honor long overdue to these trailblazing heroes. On behalf of a grateful Nation, I send my deepest condolences to Mr. Williams' loved ones and the many lives touched by his positive influence. May they take solemn pride in a life well lived. FIU Veterans and Small Farmers Outreach Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Florida International University and their outreach to those in our agriculture community. I recently learned of a new program created by FIU to give veterans, along with minority and women farmers, the opportunity to expand their knowledge of the agriculture business. The Veterans and Small Farmers Outreach program will provide direct benefits to not only our brave men and women returning from harm's way, but also to the countless small farms in Homestead, an agriculture- focused community in south Florida. The students currently enrolled in the Veterans and Small Farmers Outreach program at FIU have the opportunity to learn more about tending crops and raising livestock through apprenticeships throughout Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. I am confident these students will soon enter our workforce and be productive members of the agriculture community. We will all truly benefit from the fruits of their labor. I thank FIU for their continued innovation in bettering the south Florida community and wish only the best of luck to the hard-working students of this newly created program. Iran Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my serious concerns over the Iran deal that was recently announced. So far, it appears that this agreement is bad for the United States and bad for our allies in the region. As I have said before, a weak deal that gives Iran any possibility of achieving a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Key components of the nuclear program are still in place. Iran will still be allowed to have centrifuges and continue research and development on them. The Natanz and Fordow facilities will remain in place to purportedly continue their nuclear activities for peaceful purposes. In addition to these troubling facts, the Iranian regime is going to receive an exorbitant amount of money that they will undoubtedly use, at least in part, to fund Hamas and Hezbollah. Mr. Speaker, from what I can tell, this deal does not prevent Iran from having the parts needed to reach the nuclear threshold capability down the road and it will boost the regime's ability to support terror in the region. I strongly urge my colleagues to continue to carefully monitor this situation and consider the security interests of the United States and our allies as we continue analyzing this deal. Eagle Scout Rank Congratulations Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two students from my district, Daniel Auster and Sebastian Torra, who have both achieved the rank of Eagle Scout with Troop 69 of Homestead, Florida. This prestigious accomplishment has only been achieved by 4 percent of Boy Scouts nationwide. Daniel was the first scout in Troop 69 to attain an Eagle Palm pin in the last 15 years. His fellow troop member, Sebastian, completed 173 volunteer hours at Jack D. Gordon Elementary School for his Eagle Scout project, both impressive accomplishments. Daniel and Sebastian are exemplary of the Boy Scout slogan ``Do a good turn daily.'' I applaud their hard work and dedication to achieve this honor. They truly embody the Boy Scouts' commitment to our community. I am [[Page 11798]] always pleased to see young people with such dedication to giving back and making our neighborhoods better. Once again, congratulations to Daniel and Sebastian. ____________________ RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 24 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. ____________________ {time} 1400 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Holding) at 2 p.m. ____________________ PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Stir our spirits, O Lord, that we may praise You with full attention and be whole-hearted in all the tasks You set before us this day. We can see Your deeds unfolding in our history and in every act of justice and kindness. Bless those who have blessed us, and be close to those most in need of Your compassion and love. Fear of You, O Lord, is the beginning of wisdom. Bless the Members of this people's House with such wisdom. As they resume the work of this assembly, guide them to grow in understanding in attaining solutions to our Nation's needs that are imbued with truth and justice. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. ____________________ THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day's proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. ____________________ PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. CHABOT led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ____________________ CONGRATULATING YADKIN VALLEY MOTOR COMPANY ON 100 YEARS (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Yadkin Valley Motor Company in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. It is the oldest Ford dealership in the Carolinas and 20th oldest out of about 3,100 Ford dealerships nationwide. A.F. Kilby was the first of four generations of Kilbys to sell Fords at Yadkin Valley. His son, Andrew ``Bud'' Kilby, and grandson, John Kilby, Sr., now own the dealership. At 89 years old, Bud still works at the dealership 6 days a week. John serves as general manager. And his son, John Kilby, Jr., is a salesman and Internet manager. In May, more than 1,500 people turned out for a special car show marking the 100th anniversary. Several hundred vehicles, including a number of antique Fords, participated. Congratulations to the Kilby family and everyone at Yadkin Valley Motor Company on this significant milestone. ____________________ REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I met with business owners and the Chamber of Commerce back home in Michigan to discuss what actions we can take here in Congress to create jobs and to boost our economy. One action that came up is that Congress could immediately act to bring up legislation to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. It was clear to these businessowners Michigan jobs are at risk if Ex- Im is permanently shuttered. This bank, the Ex-Im Bank, supports over a million U.S. jobs, thousands of small businesses, across the country. Sadly, the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which has been supported for over 80 years by Democrats and Republicans in this House and in the White House, has become a victim of Washington's partisan gridlock, and it is Michigan's businesses and workers and workers all across this country that are paying the price for Congress' unwillingness to take this up. Nearly every developed country, including China, has an export credit agency of some type. Ex-Im cannot be allowed to expire. American jobs are at risk. Let's reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. ____________________ IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Iranian nuclear deal has been approved by the U.N. Security Council by a vote of 15-0. But wait. Isn't Congress supposed to vote on approval or disapproval to make it binding on America? Yes. But the administration, ignoring Congress' future vote, went to get the U.N. approval anyway. But this deal is bad for the world and the United States. The United States foreign policy used to be that Iran would never have nuclear weapons. That has changed. This deal legitimizes nuclear weapon development in 10 years. It allows the lifting of conventional arms embargo in 5 years. It allows Iran to develop ICBM capacity in 8 years. It immediately gives Iran billions of dollars, money that I believe will be used to give to terrorist groups, since Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Mr. Speaker, the United Nations doesn't control my vote. The people of Texas do. The people I represent think this is a bad deal and don't want the United States to be a part of this Iranian nuclear weapon development fiasco. And that is the way I will vote, whether the U.N. or the administration likes it or not. And that is just the way it is. ____________________ OLDER AMERICANS MONTH (Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this month is an opportunity to celebrate some critical programs. The Older Americans Act celebrated its 50th anniversary this past Tuesday. Medicare and Medicaid turn 50 later this month. And Social Security turns 80 in August. But it is also a time to reframe how we look at aging in this country. With Americans living longer and healthier lives, we need to create a new paradigm that ensures older Americans are living longer with the highest quality of life for the longest time possible. Doing this means we help our aging population feel part of the community, provide opportunities for them to stay physically and socially active, and maintain a serious purpose of life and a zest for life. I came to Congress to protect Medicare and Social Security. They are bedrock programs that seniors depend on for a safe, healthy, and secure retirement. As we celebrate the anniversaries this year, we need to improve and strengthen these programs to better meet the needs of our seniors. We can start by expanding Medicare to cover things like hearing aids. [[Page 11799]] ____________________ FLYING TIGERS (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, as we look back some 70 years in commemoration of the end of World War II, it is a good time to reflect upon one group of unsung heroes who went above and beyond their service to preserve the freedoms we enjoy today. The Flying Tigers aircraft was easily recognizable because it had the face of a shark painted on the nose of the plane and its menacing teeth served as a warning to their enemies wherever they flew. During World War II, when Taiwan was brutally attacked by the Japanese, its leader called upon the world community for help. A group of American volunteers answered the call and joined up with Taiwan's Air Force to become one of the most important elements in the ultimate defeat of the Japanese invaders. It is fitting that we recognize the role of the Flying Tigers and Taiwan's Air Force in holding off the onslaught that U.S. military forces eventually rolled back. Mr. Speaker, the Flying Tigers held the fort until our Nation was able to gather our strength. For this, we are eternally grateful. We remember. We are grateful. We salute you. ____________________ COLOMBIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I joined the people of Colombia and my fellow Colombian Americans in celebrating the nation's 215 years of independence. I am extremely proud of Colombia's rich history and vibrant culture. I am even prouder of the close friendship between our two countries, a partnership which has never been more important. On issues from narcotrafficking to the promotion of democracy, the United States and Colombia are working arm in arm together to make our hemisphere a more peaceful and prosperous place. Mr. Speaker, the Colombian people are celebrating their independence at a critical juncture in Colombian history. After decades of bloody conflict and instability, Colombia is engaged in intense negotiations with the FARC guerillas, talks that could produce a landmark peace agreement. This inspiring effort not only demonstrates the Colombian Government's commitment to peace, but also the Colombian people's capacity for healing and forgiveness. I commend Colombian President Santos and his administration for the progress to date and encourage both parties to press ahead, despite the obstacles that remain. Mr. Speaker, my sincere hope is that 1 year from today the Colombian people will be able to celebrate not just their innocence, but their freedom from fear and violence. ____________________ WOOD COUNTY'S BRANT FREELAND (Mr. McKINLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, it is the most trying times that bring out the best in people. West Virginia has faced high water and floods over the past few weeks. Recently there was an act of heroism in Wood County that deserves recognition on the House floor. On their way home on Sunday, 15-year-old Brant Freeland and his mother pulled over to wait out high water blocking the road. Brant noticed a car caught in the rising water ahead of him. Not thinking twice, Brant bolted from his car to see if someone was inside. There he found 69-year-old Connie Boggs trapped inside with the water rising. He wrenched open the door and got her to safety. Connie said, ``If it wasn't for Brant, I would more than likely have drowned.'' For his part, Brant said the last thing on his mind when he entered the water was being a hero. ``I was just worried about saving that lady's life. That is all.'' Brant did more than that. He showed us the kind of courage that is too often missing these days. ____________________ CHATTANOOGA 5 (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Marine Sergeant Carson Homquist, Marine Gunnery Sergeant and Purple Heart recipient Thomas Sullivan, Marine Lance Corporal Skip Wells, Marine Sergeant David Wyatt, and Navy Petty Officer Second Class Randall Smith. I also rise to assure their loved ones and the American people that Congress will act to prevent this tragic loss from occurring again. This week I am joining Congressman and former Marine Corps Major Duncan Hunter in introducing legislation to enhance security at our Armed Forces centers by allowing our military members to defend themselves from attacks. Congress and I send a clear message that this cowardly attack will not be ignored and our heroes shall not die in vain. I urge all Members to join me in flying the Marine Corps flag and the Navy Anchor flag outside their D.C. office this week. God bless America and the men and women who defend her. Semper fi and anchors aweigh. ____________________ AMERICANS SUPPORT BORDER SECURITY, NOT LEGALIZATION (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Americans do not agree with the President's executive order giving amnesty to 5 million immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, and they especially do not agree with Hillary Clinton's plan to legalize even more. A recent Rasmussen poll found that a majority of Americans, 63 percent, now think gaining control of our border is more important than legalizing those already in the United States. Earlier this month Rasmussen reported that a majority of Americans believe illegal immigration increases the level of serious crime in America. Tragically, the death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco serves as a reminder of how the administration's failed policies have endangered the lives of innocent Americans. Instead of putting the safety of Americans first, the administration has often given a free pass to violent criminals who cross our border illegally. The administration should listen to the American people. Securing our borders should be its first priority, not giving amnesty to those who are here illegally. ____________________ RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until approximately 4:30 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 14 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. ____________________ {time} 1631 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Farenthold) at 4 o'clock and 31 minutes p.m. ____________________ MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT A message in writing from the President of the United States was communicated to the House by Mr. Brian Pate, one of his secretaries. ____________________ COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives: [[Page 11800]] Office of the Clerk, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, July 21, 2015. Hon. John A. Boehner, The Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Speaker: Pursuant to the permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Clerk received the following message from the Secretary of the Senate on July 21, 2015 at 3:15 p.m. That the Senate passed S. 1177. With best wishes, I am Sincerely, Karen L. Haas. ____________________ ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material on H.R. 2256, as amended. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2256, as amended, the Veterans Information Modernization Act. I developed and introduced this legislation following an oversight hearing in January where the subcommittee attempted to determine the cost and value of the care that the Department of Veterans Affairs provides to our Nation's veterans. Through the course of that hearing, it became painfully obvious that VA leaders were unable to provide basic information about, for example, how much the VA spends on a single patient encounter in a VA primary care clinic. As a doctor who served veterans at the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center in my hometown of Iron Mountain, Michigan, for 20 years, it is unbelievable to me that the VA either does not have or is unwilling to share key information about the care that it provides. The Congressional Budget Office testified in January that the VA ``. . . provided limited data to Congress and the public about its costs and operational performance.'' The CBO went on to state, ``. . . if this data was provided on a regular and systemic basis, it could help inform policymakers about the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of VA's services.'' Similar sentiments about the need for the VA to be more forthcoming were echoed at that hearing by witnesses from the American Legion and the Independent Budget. We are all too well aware of the many--seemingly endless--scandals that have plagued the Department over the last year and a half. A lack of transparency is at the heart of all of these scandals, and one of the keys to overcoming them is requiring the Department to regularly provide specific information about the care that the VA provides. H.R. 2256, as amended, would accomplish that goal by requiring the VA to submit an annual report to Congress regarding the provision of hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care by the VA health care system. The report would encompass critical information about the operations of the Veterans Health Administration, including data regarding access, quality, workload, patient demographics and utilization, physician compensation and productivity, purchase care, and pharmaceutical prices. The VA would also be required to detail third-party billings and collections, including information on both small and large claims. This would ensure that the growing disparity between the amounts that the VA bills for and the amount that the VA collects is accounted for and that the VA receives every available dollar that it is owed and uses it to improve the services that the VA provides. Many of the data points included in this report are already provided by the Department of Defense for TRICARE. The regular receipt of this information would allow Congress, veterans, and the American taxpayers to make better informed decisions about the services that the Department is offering and to assist in creating the VA healthcare system that our veterans truly deserve. Other provisions included in the Veterans Information Modernization Act would broaden the VA's definition of a ``homeless veteran'' to include veterans and their families who are fleeing violent homes, improve the VA's processes for tracking and procuring biological implants, and establish a commission to examine the VA's mental health treatment model and the benefits of incorporating complementary and alternative treatments. I would like to offer my sincere gratitude and appreciation to my friends and colleagues--Congressman Gus Bilirakis, Congressman Phil Roe, and Congresswoman Janice Hahn--who have sponsored provisions of this bill. I would also like to thank Chairman Miller; Ranking Member Brown; Congresswoman Julia Brownley, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health; and all of the members of the Subcommittee on Health on both sides of the aisle for their hard work and leadership on this bill. I am proud to say that this bill, which was reported favorably out of the full committee earlier this summer and is fully offset, is supported by many veteran service organizations, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Concerned Veterans for America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Veterans Information Modernization Act. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2256, the Veterans Information Modernization Act, as amended. This bill does a number of things to improve access and quality of services to our Nation's veterans. This bill requires the Secretary to submit an annual report on the Department's furnishing of hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to veterans. One of our priorities on the committee is to ensure that safe, quality health care is provided to veterans and their families. This report will assist us in our oversight duties of the Department. This bill expands the definition of a ``homeless veteran'' to include veterans fleeing from domestic violence. As you know, veterans who experience domestic violence are considered at high risk for homelessness. This is a very vulnerable population, and anytime we find a barrier to care, we should remove it. Further, one of my biggest priorities as ranking member is to ensure that we provide safe, quality housing for homeless women veterans. Women veterans are an underserved population, and there is a serious lack of housing options for those who become homeless. There is an even greater crisis in attempting to find housing for women veterans who have children. This is largely due to the fact that many facilities do not allow women and children to be in the same facilities as [[Page 11804]] men. This must be corrected immediately. I have encountered several women--those who have been forced to live on the streets--in weekly motels and in other housing places that are not fit to live in due to domestic violence. This is completely unacceptable. We should be working closely with the VA and HUD to ensure that there is transitional and emergency housing available for women veterans during their greatest time of need. This bill addresses gaps in the identification, tracking, and the procurement of biological implants at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Finally, this bill would establish a commission to examine the effectiveness of the evidence-based therapy model for treating veterans' mental health illnesses. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their interest and support of veterans' issues. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my colleague and friend and the vice chairman of the committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2256, the Veterans Information Modernization Act. This bill makes positive, bipartisan reforms to the VA, which has become the hallmark of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We have such a good committee, Mr. Speaker. I am particularly pleased about the inclusion of my bill, H.R. 271, the Creating Options for Veterans Expedited Recovery Act, better known as the COVER Act. Last year the Veterans' Affairs Committee held a hearing regarding veterans' access to the VA's mental health services. At the hearing, we heard from the mothers and fathers of deceased veterans. I remember vividly how hearing their testimony moved me. I can't remember another instance when the Veterans' Affairs Committee room was so quiet and solemn as on that day. Statistics show that one in five veterans who serves in Iraq and Afghanistan has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. Now we must responsibly ask ourselves: Are we doing enough when it comes to addressing mental health in our veteran population? Recent data has shown that every day in this country approximately 18 to 22 veterans take their own lives. This statistic answers the question I posed earlier. It is obvious more needs to be done. Far too often we have heard of situations in which our veterans are being overprescribed opioids and antipsychotics. While traditional forms of therapies may work for some, tailoring therapies to the veterans and finding the balance between traditional and complementary, alternative treatments could be the difference in saving lives. Late last year I met with a veteran who was able to tell me just how much alternative treatments have improved his life. His treatment plan to address his PTS and physical injuries consisted of over 30 different pills every day. He told me how much this affected him. He said he felt hopeless and wasn't quite himself anymore. He then decided to take control of his life again and looked for an alternative. He found an alternative treatment in training and in caring for a service dog. {time} 1645 Now, his treatment includes one multivitamin, one other medication, and a four-legged companion that never leaves his side. The COVER Act is the next piece in a working formula to heal our veterans, mentally and physically. It will pave the way toward the inclusion of these complementary alternative therapies at the VA. These therapies include, but certainly are not limited to, service animal therapy, yoga therapy, acupuncture, equine therapy, and accelerated resolution therapy. Mr. Speaker, I have heard the stories from these veterans, and these therapies really work. They need access to these therapies. At a recent town hall, I even heard about the benefits of martial arts. The martial arts were treating PTS. Mr. Speaker, when treating mental health issues, one size does not fit all. Please support this good bill. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), my colleague and a fellow physician on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2256, as amended, which includes a bill I introduced, H.R. 1016, the Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act. A frightening January 2014 GAO report found that the VA does not use a standardized process for tracking biological tissue from a cadaver to a living donor veteran patient. In the event of a recall, it would be virtually impossible to track down which patient had received contaminated tissue. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration does not always ensure it is purchasing tissue from biological implant vendors that have registered with the FDA and does not maintain an inventory system to prevent expired tissue from remaining in storage alongside unexpired tissues. The GAO and Veterans' Affairs Committee staff have discovered that VA often uses a loophole that allows it to purchase biological implants on the open, unregulated market, which it does in 57 percent of its biological implant purchases. This bill would require the procurement of biological implants from vendors on the Federal supply schedules which have been appropriately vetted. For biological implants not on the Federal supply schedule but requested by clinicians, my bill requires justification and approval of open market purchases under the Federal acquisition regulation on a case-by-case basis rather than simply granting a blanket waiver. This bill would also direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to adopt FDA's unique device identification system for labeling of all biological implant tissue and implement an automated inventory system to track the tissue from donor to implant recipient. This legislation would also require all biological implant tissue to be procured through vendors that are registered with the FDA, accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks, and use FDA's unique device identification system. The 6 million veterans served annually by VHA deserve the highest standard of patient care in the Nation. Implementation of H.R. 2256 would help establish the VA as an industry leader in biologic implant safety and accountability. I want to thank the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee staff for their help in developing this legislation which truly puts veterans first. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's support, and I again encourage all Members to support H.R. 2256, as amended. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2256, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1557, introduced by my friend and ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Cummings of Maryland. He has done yeoman's work on this content. I was proud to join him as a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation that will help many of our Federal workers as they go through their work in knowing they have even more protections. The Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2015 strengthens accountability within our Federal workforce. The bill does so by improving agencies' processes for reporting instances of workplace discrimination and retaliation. It also requires agencies to create a system to track complaints of discrimination and retaliation from beginning to end. The bill ensures that agencies report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission whether disciplinary action has been taken against an employee for discrimination or retaliation. It requires agencies to provide electronic notification to employees when such an action occurs. The bill requires agencies to post additional information about discriminatory practices on their Web site. It also requires that adverse actions taken against any employee for discrimination or retaliation be included in that individual's personnel file. Combined, these provisions bring additional transparency and accountability to the Federal civil service and will help diminish instances of discrimination and retaliation within our government. Obviously, those things can't stand. The bill also makes agency Equal Employment offices a direct report to the agency head. This is an important step and a good portion of the bill that is being brought forth today. This change will help ensure that employees feel safe and comfortable when reporting discriminatory or retaliatory actions. Finally, H.R. 1557 makes clear that employees can report waste, fraud, and abuse within their agency to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or the inspectors general. Federal employees are essential in exposing wrongdoing within the government. An agency should never have the ability to tell a government employee that he or she cannot report waste, fraud, or abuse to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or the inspectors general. The bill reinforces that obstructing an employee's communication with Congress and other watchdogs is against the law. We should be encouraging open communication between Federal employees and Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, and the inspectors general to protect the integrity of our government and the taxpayers. I want to again thank Mr. Cummings for his leadership and work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1557. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the author of the Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act, I would like to thank Chairman Chaffetz and his staff for working with me in drafting this bipartisan legislation. I also appreciate the chairman's support for this bill during the committee's consideration this past March. I thank Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton for cosponsoring the bill. As a former Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, her expertise in employment law is unparalleled in Congress. I also appreciate the support of Representatives James Sensenbrenner and Sheila Jackson Lee, who cosponsored the bill. I especially want to thank Tanya Ward Jordan, Paulette Taylor, and all the members of the Coalition 4 Change, also known as C4C, for their invaluable assistance on this legislation. I am also grateful that this bill has strong support of the Make It Safe Coalition. Both C4C and the Make It Safe Coalition are dedicated to ending discrimination and retaliation against whistleblowers in the Federal workplace, and I applaud their leadership and their hard work. The Federal EEO programs are critical to ensuring that Federal workplaces are free from discrimination and that any barriers impeding fairness in [[Page 11807]] personnel decisions are identified and eliminated. These programs exist to ensure that our Federal workplaces uphold the guarantee of equal opportunity. That is the right of every citizen in this great country. If discrimination occurs, these programs must be able to investigate and adjudicate employee complaints impartially and in a timely manner. {time} 1700 In fiscal year 2012, Federal employees and job applicants filed nearly 16,000 complaints alleging that they had been victims of discrimination. Although the vast majority of Federal workplaces are in compliance with current EEO requirements, some Federal agencies have failed to meet the standards of a model EEO program. For example, in 2014, the EEOC issued a report on the Social Security Administration that made 12 findings regarding Social Security's failure to maintain a model EEOC program, ensure efficient management of the various stages of the complaint process, provide uniform training to ensure equal opportunities, and implement effective and efficient antiharassment policies and procedures. The EEOC made more than 60 recommendations for reform of that one program alone. My bill would require that EEO programs operate independently of an agency's human resources or general counsel offices and that the head of the program report directly to the head of an agency. This would ensure that effective implementation of the EEO program is prioritized at the highest level of an agency and that program's sole purpose is ensuring equal opportunity for all employees. H.R. 1557 would also strengthen the accountability mechanisms that are central to the effectiveness of the EEO process. This legislation would expand the notifications that agencies are required to provide when discrimination is found to have occurred and would require agencies to track and report whether such findings have resulted in any disciplinary action. Finally, the act would prohibit the use of nondisclosure agreements that restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the office of special counsel, or an inspector general any information that relates to any violation of law, rule, or regulation or instance of waste, fraud, or abuse. According to the 2014 Federal employee viewpoint survey, only 60 percent of Federal employees agreed that they could ``disclose a suspected violation of any law, rule, or regulation without fear of reprisal.'' As I often say, we are better than that. Employees need to have confidence that they can report an act of discrimination without suffering retaliation, and they need to know that such reports will be thoroughly, fairly, and timely investigated and adjudicated. The Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2015 will strengthen existing requirements to ensure that Federal EEO programs meet these standards and that agency management of the EEO process follows the best practices available. Again, I take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to thank Chairman Chaffetz. This was truly a bipartisan effort. We saw a problem, and we put our heads together and tried to address it. I would urge all Members of the House to vote for it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me rise today to thank both the chairman and the ranking member of this committee, Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings, for their leadership on a very important issue, which I rise to be part of and with a little history on this issue with the earlier passage of the No FEAR Act so many years ago. I support this legislation which ensures agencies effectively implement their Equal Employment Opportunity, or EEO, programs and that Federal employees are never prevented from disclosing discriminatory or wasteful actions to Congress, the office of special counsel, or inspectors general. How important is that? We have a history of addressing workplace equality, and that is why I sponsored similar legislation with the No FEAR Act, which was first introduced in Congress in 2002. This was previous legislation that had a sense of Congress provision, whereas this particular legislation further strengthens the responsibilities and rights of employees. The No FEAR Act set the precedent for imposing additional duties upon Federal agency employers, intended to reinvigorate their longstanding obligation to provide a work environment free of discrimination and retaliation. On October 2, 2000, the House Science Committee held a hearing dealing with actions at one of our agencies. Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo had been in my office repeatedly. I mention her name because of her continued vigilance in speaking about issues dealing with whistleblowers. In actuality, this one involved a $600,000 jury decision against the EPA for race and sex discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As we all listened in this hearing, it was clear that what we wanted to do was prevent retaliation, which we see in this legislation here today. I am grateful that we now have a roadmap for dealing with individuals who want only the best for our government. I can give some of the names as an example: Mark Felt, the FBI agent known as Deep Throat during the Watergate scandal of the 1970s; Frank Serpico, a New York police officer who confronted his department for the rampant corruption the leadership let take place; Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive who admitted that tobacco companies knew they were putting addictive chemicals into their cigarettes; and, of course, Sherron Watkins, an executive of the Enron Corporation. Of course, these individuals come from different walks of life, but the whole idea is to make sure that we, as Members of Congress, recognize that whistleblower activities or actions are clearly a part of good government. According to the 2014 Federal employee viewpoint survey, only 60 percent of Federal employees agreed that they could ``disclose a suspected violation of any law, rule, or regulation without fear of reprisal.'' I know that your committee, Mr. Chaffetz and Mr. Cummings, is really the front line of providing this forum; and I am glad to be able to join you as a member of the Homeland Security Committee and Judiciary Committee to, again, emphasize the importance of safe and discrimination-free workplaces. I am grateful, again, to have had the opportunity firsthand to listen to at least one of our whistleblowers who only wanted to be able to help establish a workplace that was free of discrimination and fear. Again, I want to make mention of Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, a dedicated Federal employee who worked so very hard. [From NPR.org, Sept. 6, 2011] High Price of Blowing the Whistle on EPA Marsha Coleman-Adebayo earned a doctoral degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and worked with the United Nations before joining the Environmental Protection Agency in 1990. During her time at the U.N., she also developed an expertise in African developmental issues. During her tenure at the EPA, Coleman-Adebayo says she requested that the agency devote attention to environmental problems in South Africa that were allegedly caused by an American company. She says that the agency reneged on promises to investigate the matter, and the harder she pushed for change, the more she faced a backlash from her superiors. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I make mention that we passed the No FEAR Act with a number of Members. As we have noted a number of whistleblowers who were actually Persons of the Year on Time Magazine, I join my colleagues in supporting the present underlying legislation and ask all Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original co-sponsor and strong support of H.R. 1557, the ``Federal Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2015.'' I support this legislation because it ensures agencies effectively implement their Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs and [[Page 11808]] that federal employees are never prevented from disclosing discriminatory or wasteful actions to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or Inspectors General. Let me express my thanks to Ranking Member Cummings for introducing this critical legislation that is essential to ensuring that our federal workplaces are free from discrimination, and that any barriers impeding fairness in personnel decisions are identified and eliminated. We have a history of addressing workplace equality and that is why I sponsored similar legislation when the No Fear Act was first introduced to Congress in 2002. The No Fear Act set the precedent for imposing additional duties upon Federal agency employers intended to reinvigorate their longstanding obligation to provide a work environment free of discrimination and retaliation. If you would allow me I would like to put a face on this problem. On October 2, 2000, the House Science Committee held a hearing entitled ``Intolerance at EPA--Harming People, Harming Science?'' Dr. Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, an EPA whistleblower, won a $600,000 jury decision against EPA for race and sex discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. During that hearing, then-chairman of the Science Committee Congressman Sensenbrenner illuminated the dangerous precedent set by the EPA, stating, ``While EPA has a clear policy on dealing with employees that discriminate, harass and retaliate against other EPA employees, no one apparently involved in the Coleman-Adebayo or Nolan cases have yet to be disciplined by EPA.'' Mr. Speaker, no employee should fear voicing their concerns in reference to a safer, more work conducive environment. We often look at individuals or groups who step forward as whistleblowers. This term has been used with a negative connotation to describe insubordinate employees, but history has shown us that whistleblowers are often heroes that have shed light on employers' illegal practices and as a result made the workplace better for future employees. Mark Felt, the FBI agent known as deep throat during the Watergate Scandal of the 1970s. Frank Serpico, New York police officer who confronted his department for the rampant corruption the leadership let take place. Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive who admitted that tobacco companies knew they were putting addictive chemicals into their cigarettes. And Sherron Watkins, an executive of the Enron corporation who was vital in exposing the financial lies and frauds of the company. All these individuals stood up against well-established corporations and agencies even when others doubted their claims. We must protect these types of acts in Federal offices and successfully implement the Equal Employment Opportunity Programs (EEO). Mr. Speaker, in a sense every Member of Congress is a whistleblower for the people in that uncovering and correcting problems in the agencies that administer the laws is an essential part of our oversight responsibilities. According to the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, only 60 percent of federal employees agreed that they could quote, ``disclose a suspected violation of any law, rule or regulation without fear of reprisal.'' We must do better and ensure employees have confidence that they can report an act of discrimination without suffering retaliation. Employees need to know that EEO reports will be thoroughly, fairly, and timely investigated and adjudicated. H.R. 1557 would require that EEO programs operate independently of an agency's human resources or general counsel offices. This bill requires the head of the program report directly to the head of an agency and the act would prohibit the use of non-disclosure agreements that restrict an employee from disclosing to Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, or instance of waste, fraud or abuse. As a senior member of the Committees on Homeland Security and the Judiciary, and as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I understand the importance of safe and discrimination free workplaces. In conclusion, let me express my appreciation again to Ranking Member Cummings for introducing this legislation and Chairman Chaffetz for shepherding this bill to the floor. By strengthening existing requirements to ensure federal EEO programs meet high standards, we are implementing the best practices available to combat workplace discrimination. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, we urge the House to vote in favor of this very important legislation. It is bipartisan and does address issues that are of concern to all of us. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I simply want to thank those Members who have worked hard on this bill. One that is of special note is Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. He has done great work on this, particularly trying to hold people accountable at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the EEOC issues there. This bill would not be a reality without Mr. Cummings. We thank him for his leadership on this. I am proud to support it. I think all the Members in this body should support it. It does further the protections for employees. It makes government better and more responsible. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1557, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1557. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________ CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 114-49) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, is to continue in effect beyond July 24, 2015. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 with respect to transnational criminal organizations. Barack Obama. The White House, July 21, 2015. ____________________ RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess subject to the call of the chair. [[Page 11809]] Accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 12 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. ____________________ {time} 1742 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Farenthold) at 5 o'clock and 42 minutes p.m. ____________________ FTO PASSPORT REVOCATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 237) to authorize the revocation or denial of passports and passport cards to individuals affiliated with foreign terrorist organizations, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 237 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and validity of passports, and for other purposes'', approved July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 211a et seq.), commonly known as the ``Passport Act of 1926'', is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT. ``(a) Ineligibility.-- ``(1) Issuance.--Except as provided under subsection (b), the Secretary of State may refuse to issue a passport to any individual whom the Secretary has determined has aided, assisted, abetted, or otherwise helped an organization the Secretary has designated as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189). ``(2) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a passport previously issued to any individual described in paragraph (1). ``(b) Report.-- ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary of State refuses to issue or revokes a passport pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall, not later than 30 days after such refusal or revocation, submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report on such refusal or revocation, as the case may be. ``(2) Form.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) may be submitted in classified or unclassified form.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 days to revise and extend and to include extraneous materials on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. International travel by terrorist recruits poses a deadly and growing threat. It is estimated that ISIS alone has drawn 20,000 foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq. Extremist groups in Libya, Yemen, and elsewhere also draw foreigners into their deadly campaigns. These include thousands of westerners, primarily from Europe, but also a couple of hundred people from the United States so far. The threats are as real as today's headlines: British officials today arrested a man for plotting attacks on U.S. military personnel there in Britain and for planning to travel to Syria to join ISIS, along with his uncle. If they are successful in traveling, these foreign fighters receive terrorist training and they hone their skills there on the battlefield. Some have even appeared as executioners in ISIS' gruesome propaganda videos. If they return home, hardened fighters come back more hateful, certainly more deadly. {time} 1745 The killing of four U.S. marines and one sailor in Chattanooga, Tennessee, last Thursday; the attempted attack in Garland, Texas, in May; and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing all demonstrate that the United States is not immune from lone wolf and small-scale attacks of the type that ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula continue to call for. Surprisingly, the statutory authority to prohibit such travel in support of designated terrorist groups hasn't kept pace with the threat. I want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, Judge Ted Poe of Texas, for his work in introducing H.R. 237, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act, as a critical countermeasure. This bipartisan and commonsense bill grants the Secretary of State the authority to refuse or revoke a passport to any individual whom the Secretary determines has helped a designated foreign terrorist organization in realizing its jihadist ambitions. Such authority is not currently spelled out in statute, but depends on interpretation of Federal regulations, and this legislation will write it into permanent law. Mr. Speaker, I would just note that the text before us today grants permissive authority to the Secretary and, thus, the discretion to avoid interfering with law enforcement or intelligence activities that might be compromised if such a revocation were mandatory. While we, of course, expect that the Secretary of State will exercise this authority within the bounds of constitutional due process, the bill also requires a report to Congress whenever such authority is used to help ensure oversight and to provide transparency. Individuals who actively support designated terrorist organizations must be stopped from traveling abroad to learn how to kill Americans and our allies. Spelling this out clearly in permanent law will help prevent misguided individuals from getting further radicalized abroad, which leads to terrorist attacks on the homeland. Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) and his 10 bipartisan cosponsors for their work in bringing the bill forward, and this measure obviously deserves our support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, July 20, 2015. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R. 237, the ``FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2015,'' which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. As you know, H.R. 237 contains provisions that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary. As a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite the House's consideration of H.R. 237, the Committee on the Judiciary will not assert is jurisdictional claim over this bill by seeking a sequential referral. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding and agreement that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 237, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 237. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC, July 20, 2015. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 237, the FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2015, and, on the basis of agreed edits in the suspension text of the bill, for agreeing to forgo a sequential referral request so that it may proceed expeditiously to the Floor. [[Page 11810]] I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 237 into our Committee Report and into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on the Judiciary as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 237, as amended, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this legislation authorizes the Secretary of State to deny the issuance of or revoke the passport of an individual who is affiliated with or providing assistance to a designated foreign terrorist organization. I would like to thank the author of this legislation, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), for his leadership on this issue and for working with us in a bipartisan manner. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Royce said a few moments ago, this is a commonsense bill. It is a reasonable step our government can take to address the rise of the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, while acting within our authority to deny or revoke passports for those who are affiliated with or are aiding, assisting, or abetting an organization that the Secretary has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. Whether you call them ISIS or ISIL or Daesh or their latest preferred term, the Islamic State, one thing is quite clear: this organization has captured large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria with lethal efficiency. This brutal terrorist group has engaged in mass executions, targeted religious minorities, raped and enslaved women, destroyed priceless historical treasures, and effectively redrawn the borders of the Middle East. With its extensive propaganda efforts, including the sophisticated use of social media, ISIS has recruited tens of thousands of foreign fighters--reportedly more than 1,000 a month--including a significant number from Europe as well as some, remarkably, from the United States. Mr. Speaker, this flow of foreign fighters is a serious threat, especially with U.S. passport holders among them. The Foreign Affairs Committee has held hearings looking at the impact of ISIS and its use of foreign fighters. Our colleagues and constituents alike are very concerned about what might happen when these fighters return home, radicalized by ISIS ideology and armed with the knowledge of battlefield tactics. H.R. 237, the FTO Passport Revocation Act, would address this problem by authorizing the Secretary of State to deny passports to known members or supporters of ISIS and other terrorist groups. It would allow the Secretary to revoke the passports of those who have already left the United States so they are unable to return and sow terror here at home. Mr. Speaker, the United States has a strong national security interest in defeating ISIS. I support the various lines of effort to counter the terrorist group, cracking down on ISIS' finances, countering their propaganda efforts, and stopping the flow of foreign fighters. To be clear, this legislation will not solve the problem of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, but it is a sensible and important step in the right direction. Many of our coalition partners, including France, Britain, and Australia, have already taken steps to restrict or revoke passports for ISIS supporters. We must use all the tools at our disposal for protection of our homeland. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade and author of this important legislation. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel. Also, I want to thank the cosponsors of this legislation--as mentioned earlier, it is an equal number of Republicans and Democrats--but especially Brad Sherman and William Keating on the minority side. Mr. Speaker, in 2015, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said that 180 Americans have tried to go fight in Syria, either for ISIS, Al Nusra, or some other Islamic extremist group. There may be more; we don't know. Americans citizens fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq are real, dangerous threats to the United States. These individuals are receiving training that makes them capable of sophisticated terrorist attacks, and they put themselves under the command and control of leaders in foreign places and leaders who want to attack the United States. This is not unique to the United States. As the chairman has mentioned earlier, the West--European countries--have this as a tremendous problem where their citizens go and fight in Syria; they are trained, and they come back and cause havoc in these countries in the West. It is not a hypothetical threat in the U.S., either. Moner Mohammad Abusalha was the first American to carry out a suicide bomb attack in Syria. Before he did so, he returned home to Florida as a fully trained terrorist. Our government had absolutely no idea. He was also a card- carrying member of al Qaeda, aligned to the Al Nusra front. Fortunately, he did not carry out an attack on the United States, but he could have. Last September, ISIS announced a shift in strategy. Instead of using Americans to win in Syria, it called upon Americans to attack the United States after being trained in Syria. In an audiotape, one of their leaders was heard saying: ``Rig the roads with explosives for them. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads.'' He is talking about Americans killing Americans who have been radicalized by ISIS. Earlier this year, Mr. Speaker, a 23-year-old Somali American man from Columbus was indicted on charges of supporting terrorists. He was trained in Syria and told by a cleric to go back to the United States and carry out an attack. That is the first time we have caught someone who was specifically told to go back home and attack the United States. These traitors who have turned against America and joined the ranks of foreign radical terrorist armies should not be allowed to come back in to the United States, unless it is in handcuffs. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 237, the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation Act, is a critical bill at a critical time. This bipartisan bill grants the Secretary of State the authority to revoke or deny U.S. passports of individuals who support designated foreign terrorist organizations. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court has ruled in Haig v. Agee that the Secretary of State has the authority to revoke a passport when the national security of the United States is threatened. We are not talking about citizenship; we are talking about revocation of a passport. This bill does not deal with the issue of citizenship. Finally, Mr. Speaker, there is a due process available for those who wish to challenge the Secretary of State's decision. Under existing regulations, a person is entitled to a hearing within 60 days of receiving notice that that passport is being revoked. Foreign fighters are flowing into Iraq and Syria by the thousands. Some of them are Americans. We must stop these outlaws from coming back to the United States and committing crimes against us. And that is just the way it is. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. ISIS is absolutely a barbaric regime that cannot be negotiated with and must be defeated. They literally want to return civilization back centuries and centuries. It is hard for me and I think it is hard for almost any American to imagine what could possibly be going [[Page 11811]] through the mind of a U.S. citizen who would be attracted to go over there and make common cause with ISIS. Mr. Speaker, as the son of an immigrant who knows the sacrifices his father and grandparents made to come to this country, the fact that someone would actually jeopardize the most valuable thing they have, their American citizenship and their U.S. passport, to join ISIS is completely unfathomable. We absolutely have to give our Secretary of State this authority. ISIS sadly presents a real threat both abroad and at home. This is a commonsense measure that we can take, and we must absolutely take it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will just quote the Bureau of Counterterrorism, Mr. Speaker. They say that the rate of foreign terrorist fighter travel to Syria exceeded the rate of foreign terrorist fighters that travel to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, or Somalia at any point in the last 20 years. Individuals drawn to the conflict were diverse in their socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds, highlighting the need for comprehensive countermessaging and early engagement to dissuade vulnerable individuals from traveling to join the conflict. The bill before us today, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 237, is a necessary addition to our national defense. It creates an important deterrent, and it reduces the ability of terrorists to travel. I, again, thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Poe, and the ranking member, Mr. Keating of Massachusetts, and the bipartisan cosponsors of the bill before us today. Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the measure, and I yield back balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 237, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________ RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday was a very difficult day in my beautiful hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was a day of horror; it was a day of terror, and it was a day like no other I have lived in my life. Today, I am joined in this great House by my colleagues from the Tennessee delegation. Chattanooga is my hometown. A lone gunman--a terrorist, an evil man--killed five wonderful United States servicemembers, four marines and one sailor. At two locations in Chattanooga, he opened fire. There was devastation; there was death, and there was horror, and I am so deeply saddened. Before I ask Members for a moment of silence, I am going to ask this great House--the people's House--for something special because, through all the carnage in the face of evil, I saw Chattanoogans come together with good. In the face of despair, I saw Chattanoogans come together with hope. I saw something in my darkest hour; I saw the greatness in America. Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Whites, Blacks, and Latinos came together. We prayed together. We hoped for better days together. We honored the men and women who serve us in all of our branches together. I feel for our great marines. I feel for our Navy in these difficult times. Let me tell you this: the Chattanooga Police Department selflessly showed up and fought this terrorist and killed him. Hamilton County police were there. While a brave sailor tried to cling to life, I saw throngs of doctors and nurses at Erlanger hospital giving their best skills to try to save this man. Sadly, they were unsuccessful. This is a day I never want to see again. I ask you that we resolve to keep all American servicemen and -women safe here on American soil. We must do that. We owe that to those five wonderful lives that we lost, all precious. I am going to ask for all of us to be Chattanooga strong. I am going to ask all of us to please come together as Americans. I will read the name of those five outstanding folks: United States Marine Gunnery Sergeant Thomas J. Sullivan; United States Marine Staff Sergeant David Allen Wyatt; United States Marine Sergeant Carson Allen Louis Holmquist; United States Marine Lance Corporal Squire Kimpton Paul Wells; and United States Navy Petty Officer Second Class Randall Smith. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in honor of these great Americans. The SPEAKER. The House will observe a moment of silence. ____________________ VETERANS INFORMATION MODERNIZATION ACT The SPEAKER. Without objection, 5-minute voting will continue. There was no objection. The SPEAKER.

There was no objection. ____________________ EDEN PRAIRIE RELAY FOR LIFE (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an event this weekend in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, that will raise critical funds for cancer research. The Relay for Life brings together individuals from all walks of life that have been affected by cancer as they team up to find a cure. This year's event, which combines previous relays that have taken place in Bloomington, Eden Prairie, Richfield, Hopkins, and Minnetonka, is aiming to raise over $90,000 for cancer research. Mr. Speaker, every year 14 million people learn the devastating news that they have cancer, and the Relay for Life helps provide important funding that helps develop the cures and treatments that will also help millions of people. A big thank you to the organizers of this event. Helping find a cure for cancer will not happen without the dedicated effort and events like the Relay for Life. ____________________ {time} 1915 SUPPORTING PLANNED PARENTHOOD (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening to correct the record on women's health. As the only woman in a tristate delegation that includes New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, I speak for millions of women whose right to abortion was codified by the Supreme Court decades ago. I also speak for the millions more women who don't come from States like New Jersey where clinics that provide a full range of women's health services are accessible, States like Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi where legislatures full of men would love to see those clinics closed for good. Last week another antiabortion group, under the guise of legitimate news, released a doctored video to attack Planned Parenthood. This attack isn't about the trumped-up claims in the video. It is about the same tired efforts to make it harder for women from every walk of life and every corner of the country to make the health choices that work for them. It is sad that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so quick to hop on that bandwagon. Enough, Mr. Speaker. This is enough already. ____________________ IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL (Mr. DeSANTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I hope that every Member of this body reads the joint comprehensive plan of action that the Obama administration has agreed to with Iran. Because, if they do, I think you will see overwhelming majority vote to repudiate it. You have heard about some of the massive influx of cash for Iran. You have heard about their ability to keep their nuclear infrastructure, all these hugely problematic provisions. Interestingly, we talk about if Iran violates the deal, we can snap back economic sanctions. In fact, Iran can snap back in a nuclear direction. [[Page 11814]] Here is what the agreement says: Iran has stated that, if sanctions are reinstated, in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitment under this JCPOA, in whole or in part. That means, if Iran cheats and we go to penalize them, Iran is reserving the right to simply go back to producing nuclear weapons. We have been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Mr. Speaker, this is a bad deal. ____________________ FORMER CONGRESSMAN LOUIS STOKES (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise, as dean of the Ohio delegation, to bring to my colleagues' attention and those who are listening that one of our great Members of Congress from Ohio, Congressman Lou Stokes, who served so ably, with such dignity, with such acumen, and with such heart has been diagnosed with a very serious type of cancer. His days with us are numbered. I know that many Members hold memories of Lou, and there will be many tributes paid to Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio. Without question, his service was legendary, along with his brother, who became the first African American mayor in our country, the city of Cleveland. If we look coast to coast, the people of Ohio are walking in prayer with the Stokes family now. If Congressman Stokes is listening, I hope he knows that the love of this House, the place to which he dedicated the best years of his life, are with him. Thank you, Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, for what you have done for America, for the people of Ohio, and for the people of Cleveland. History will record the greatness of your service to others. We love you. We pray with you. We walk with you. ____________________ REMEMBERING MIKE ``TUNA'' McELROY (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight with deep sadness at the loss of my friend, Mike McElroy, the mayor of Decatur, Illinois, just last week. Mike was not just my friend. He was a friend to so many, and he led the City of Decatur through some very difficult times to where Decatur, my former hometown, as a student at Millikin University, has been able to see the progress that many envisioned 26 years ago when Mike and his wife, Lynn, made Decatur their hometown. Mike is going to be remembered not only as a friend of mine, but a friend to the entire community, be it the YMCA that he served on the board of directors, St. Teresa school that he was so active in, or the many other community efforts that he was a part of. ``Tuna,'' as he was known, is going to be missed by all, but especially missed by me. Mike was an early supporter of mine and a friend when I didn't have as many friends in that town as I started my journey that ended right here on this House floor when I was sworn in a few short years ago. Tuna, you left this Earth way too early. My heartfelt condolences go out to the entire Decatur community, who will miss you, and, most importantly, to your wife, Lynn, and your son, Matt. Rest in peace, my friend. ____________________ DODD-FRANK ACT (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the fifth anniversary of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, the financial crisis of 2007 was not an accident and not an unavoidable by-product of free markets. It was a mistake, a mistake driven by ideologically driven deregulation. Countries which maintained adequate capital requirements did not suffer a financial crisis. Countries which maintained an adequately regulated primary and secondary mortgage market did not suffer through a housing bubble. In response to the crisis, taxpayers stepped in and saved the global financial system by stabilizing the marketplace and staving off a second Great Depression through economic stimulus. To ensure that taxpayers would not be on the hook for the irresponsible actions by some on Wall Street, the Dodd-Frank Act required that financial institutions hold adequate capital against the risks they take and take responsibility for the risks that they sell into the market. The Dodd-Frank Act has unquestionably made our markets safer and more stable. ____________________ PIONEER DAY (Mr. STEWART asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my home State of Utah in celebrating Pioneer Day. In a world that seems to be filled with strife and confusion, I am proud to take a moment to celebrate something positive. On July 24, 1847, Brigham Young led a determined group of pioneers, wagons, and handcarts into the Salt Lake Valley where he uttered those now famous words, ``This is the place.'' Over 40,000 pioneers traveled west to Utah. In doing so, they suffered incredibly, hunger, cold, disease, exhaustion, the death of loved ones. My own ancestors were among the many who did suffer. Once they arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, they worked tirelessly to take the desert and to make it bloom into the thriving communities we have today. My, how things have changed. Utah is considered the best managed State. They are considered some of the finest and highest quality-of-life communities. They are one of the best States to do business. We have the greatest snow on Earth, and our National Parks are truly magnificent. We celebrate Pioneer Day to honor those who demonstrate their courage during their journey west and for all those who continue to enrich our great State of Utah. ____________________ KEYSTONE PIPELINE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in 2010, the southern segment of the Keystone pipeline system began operating, carrying crude oil from Oklahoma to Illinois and Texas. According to multiple news outlets, this existing southern segment of the Keystone system just pumped its one billionth barrel of oil. The Federal approval process only took 2 years to complete, and there have been no incidents as a result of this infrastructure. Yet, here we are 5 years later and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would connect Canada and the United States, still remains unapproved after 7 long years of repetitive reviews. Approval of the Keystone XL pipeline will provide American families with new job opportunities and a reliable source of North American energy in the safest, most efficient way possible. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, I rise today to once again urge the President to approve the Keystone XL. This southern portion of the Keystone pipeline has proven to be a safe and effective way to transport oil, and the northern segment into Canada will provide the same benefits. ____________________ CONGRATULATIONS ZACH JOHNSON (Mr. BLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Zach Johnson, a native of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and the First District I represent, on his win in yesterday's British Open, held at St. Andrews in Scotland, the birthplace of golf. [[Page 11815]] Zach is well known in Iowa for his incredible work ethic and perseverance. Zach was not the best player on his Cedar Rapids Regis High School golf team, and he wasn't the number one golfer on the Drake University golf team. Few gave him a chance of someday being a professional golfer, but he refused to give up on his dream of making the PGA tour, and his hard work over the years has definitely paid off. Zach has 12 PGA wins, including the 2007 Masters and now the British Open, and has represented the United States in the Ryder Cup four times. Zach has lived the American Dream through hard work and perseverance. Yet, he describes himself as ``just a guy from Iowa who has been given some talent.'' Zach's humility, as well as his talent and work ethic, are examples to all of us. Today we tip our hat to Zach Johnson and his entire family. The entire First District of Iowa is incredibly proud of his success. ____________________ HONORING GRANITE STATE HERO JEREMY GRACZYK (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of New Hampshire's own Major Jeremy Graczyk, a decorated Marine, combat veteran, and American hero. A native of Atkinson, New Hampshire, Major Graczyk graduated as valedictorian from Timberlane Regional High School, attended college at the U.S. Naval Academy, and went on to be commissioned in the United States Marine Corps, where he served as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and was deployed over seven times to Afghanistan and Africa. Due to his bravery and dedication to our Nation, he has been awarded over 20 decorations. To say Major Graczyk embodied the meaning of our State's motto ``Live free or die'' is an understatement. As we honor the anniversary of his death, we continue to remember and celebrate his life. It is because of soldiers like him that our Nation remains the land of the free and the home of the brave. And for that, we are forever grateful. ____________________ IN MEMORY OF LaVERNE GRELL (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to note the passing of a true gem, a jewel to northern California, LaVerne Grell of Yuba City. Now, my family has the unique experience of having my grandmother, Marjorie, and LaVerne born on the same day in the very same small town amidst the rice fields of northern California. My grandmother, Marjorie, and LaVerne spent many years together celebrating birthdays, music, life, and friends. We were blessed with my grandmother for 77 years. But LaVerne, in northern California, we were blessed with for 100 years. So LaVerne's loss indeed makes a big ripple. She made a big ripple in her life with all the people she touched and her love of music. Indeed, she was a talented musician and freely gave her time and her talent for decades through teaching music at Yuba College, participating in Handel's Messiah for almost 75 years and playing the organ at Marysville's First Presbyterian Church for 20 years. Indeed, when we lose somebody, we have what we call a celebration of life. Her celebration of life was last November when she reached her 100th birthday, and she had the best party I have ever seen with an orchestra, cellos, and everything. She got on the keyboard herself and showed us what 100 years of life and vigor in northern California looks like. We will miss her, but we will always smile when we think of LaVerne Grell. ____________________ {time} 1930 PLANNED PARENTHOOD PRACTICES (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, like my colleagues, I was deeply disturbed by the video that surfaced last week and the allegations regarding Planned Parenthood's selling the body parts of unborn children. Just today, another video was released showing a senior Planned Parenthood official make flippant comments about receiving money for the organs of aborted babies. The practices brought to light in these videos and reports are shocking and sickening. When such reports come forward, it is our moral responsibility to act. We must take action on behalf of the most vulnerable and precious lives among us. Madam Speaker, I commend the House Energy and Commerce and House Judiciary Committees that have begun efforts to investigate these heinous practices, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to ensure we get to the bottom of these allegations. Planned Parenthood and all those involved must be held accountable. I stand with all who are dedicated to fight to protect innocent life. ____________________ CONDEMNING PLANNED PARENTHOOD TRAFFICKING SCANDAL (Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, in just a few moments, we will hear from a number of colleagues who are all here gathered in great sadness and with heavy hearts to denounce, once again, another revelation of another gruesome practice by the organization--the taxpayer-funded organization--called Planned Parenthood. Madam Speaker, it is important to note that Planned Parenthood was founded in racism. It profits from the pain of abortion, and now it traffics in baby parts. How much more do we have to know to awaken us, awaken our conscience as a nation, to the gruesome realities again of this taxpayer-funded organization? So I am pleased that my colleagues have gathered tonight to talk more in depth about this, but also to highlight the fact that we are all interested in ongoing congressional investigations to determine what efforts, what laws, or what new steps need to be taken to ban the unethical and dehumanizing practice undertaken by Planned Parenthood. We must challenge this assault on human dignity, especially to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. I find it very interesting, Madam Speaker, that the early feminist movement was dedicated to protecting women from abortion. ____________________ ALL LIVES MATTER The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Allen). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, for 30 years, Planned Parenthood has worked to dehumanize the babies that they have aborted, claiming that these little babies were just clumps of cells, just clumps of tissue; but through the recent videos that have come out, they have, in essence, admitted what we have known all along--that these are actually little humans. These are little babies, and their organs are being harvested for profit: little baby heads and [[Page 11816]] little baby livers, little baby hearts and little baby lungs--little baby lungs that will never have an opportunity to cry, little baby lungs that will never be used to learn how to speak, and little baby lungs that will never learn to sing because they have been killed in the womb. These are little babies that are so well developed that they can survive outside the womb. These little babies feel pain in the abortion. These are little ones who, again, don't have lobbyists in this town that work for them. They are voiceless, they are defenseless, and so often they are powerless. But this House is coming together tonight in extraordinary form to make sure that these little ones are not forgotten, because we are standing up for them to make sure that their lives matter because in America we believe that all lives matter, whether you are born or unborn. So I am proud to be part of this Special Order tonight. I am proud that we have so many Members who want to come down and speak on this important topic. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who has been such a leader in the pro-life movement. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Duffy. Thank you for yielding to me and for your leadership on this extremely important human rights issue. Mr. Speaker, in 2011, an undercover videotape sting operation by Live Action exposed several Planned Parenthood affiliates who are eager, ready, and willing to facilitate secret abortions for child sex trafficking victims--some as young or younger than 14--to get them on the streets again. As the prime author of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the landmark law that seeks to protect victims, mostly women and children, I found the on-the-record willingness of Planned Parenthood personnel to exploit young girls and partner with sex traffickers to be absolutely appalling. Watch the video yourself on liveaction.org. In 2012, Live Action released another sting operation video, part of a series called ``Gendercide: Sex Selection in America,'' showing Planned Parenthood staff advising undercover female investigators how to procure sex selection abortions. Caught on tape, Planned Parenthood tells the investigator to wait until the baby is 5 months along to get an ultrasound that will reveal the sex of the child, then, if it is a girl, kill it. Planned Parenthood is okay with terminating the girl child in its huge network of clinics simply because she is a girl. What a dangerous place for little girls. Now we have learned that Planned Parenthood is trafficking in baby body parts and intact organs like livers and hearts, charging up to $100 or more per body part. Not only has Planned Parenthood killed over 7 million innocent babies in their chain of abortion mills, about 330,000 children per year, but now shocking new undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress show high-ranking Planned Parenthood officials explaining how they market and profit from the sale of the organs of their victims and how doctors maneuver deadly abortion tools to ensure--they call them graspers--intact organs. In one clip, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, senior director of Planned Parenthood Federation of America's medical services and a late-term abortionist herself, explained: We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I am not going to crush that part. I am going to basically crush below, I am going to crush above, and I am going to see if I can get it all intact. Dr. Nucatola says on camera: I would say a lot of people want liver; and for that reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they will know where they are putting their forceps. In other words, crush the baby to death, but do it in a way that preserves certain organs and body parts for sale. Dr. Nucatola even suggests and is caught on tape talking about creating a menu. Today, another new devastating video by the same organization shows a Planned Parenthood Federation top doctor, Dr. Mary Gatter, offering to use a ``less crunchy technique'' to get more intact organs and baby body parts. Less crunchy? Like Dr. Nucatola, Dr. Gatter is nonchalantly talking about crunching--that is, crushing--babies to death in ways that are more likely to preserve body parts and intact organs. This is unconscionable, it is inhumane, and it must stop. I am glad that the House Republican leadership has called for full investigations into this dehumanizing practice. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership tonight especially, of all times. Mr. Speaker, it is our highest ideal as Americans that every human life is endowed with dignity and has value. As Americans, we have a shared responsibility to protect the innocent and defend the rights of those who are unable to defend themselves. But rather than protecting and defending this dignity, Planned Parenthood is seemingly attempting to cash in on it. Recently, shocking and appalling videos have come to light exposing senior employees at Planned Parenthood casually discussing both the harvesting and selling of organs of aborted children. These videos portray a chilling transactional approach to ending human life. Mr. Speaker, as a matter of morality, history, science, reason, and, most importantly, my personal faith, I can come to no other conclusion but that every human life begins at conception and every human life is worthy of protection. Psalm 139:13 says: For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother's womb. What God has knit together, apparently Planned Parenthood wishes to crush. But that is not my word, Mr. Speaker; that is their word. You have heard it spoken on this House floor as Senior Director of Medical Services at Planned Parenthood said: We have been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I am not going to crush that part. I am not sure I have ever repeated such vile and cruel words on this House floor before, Mr. Speaker; and whether one considers themselves pro-life or pro-choice, I would hope that every American believes that harvesting and trafficking baby organs violates the sanctity to which every child created in the very image of God is entitled to. So, Mr. Speaker, I add my voice thanking our leadership of this Congress for calling on investigations of these horrific acts, and I call on the Obama administration to denounce them and find a way to stop these gruesome practices. Almost every day, Mr. Speaker, we hear somebody utter words on the House floor, ``We must do something for the least of these.'' Truly unborn life is the least of these. So let's start tonight and hold life precious. Mr. DUFFY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson). Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, many of us have seen it, a recently surfaced, horrifying video that provides evidence that Planned Parenthood employees participate in the harvesting of fetal body parts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in absolute disgust. Not only is Planned Parenthood profiting from abortions, but this video shows a top Planned Parenthood executive discussing how best to procure and sell specific organs from these defenseless, aborted babies' bodies. As a father and a grandfather, I find these acts unconscionable and barbaric. We have a moral responsibility to ensure that these acts are fully investigated and that Planned Parenthood is held accountable for their actions. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Fred Upton of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee for taking immediate action and announcing their respective investigations into this horrific practice. [[Page 11817]] Mr. Speaker, I cannot fathom why taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are provided to organizations that actively allow such gruesome practices to occur. In 2013, abortions made up 94 percent of Planned Parenthood's so- called pregnancy services--94 percent. Prenatal care and adoptive referrals accounted for only 5 percent and half, or 0.5 percent, respectively. Yet taxpayer funding accounts for 41 percent of Planned Parenthood's overall revenue. We must act now to prevent even a single dime from going to organizations such as Planned Parenthood that flaunt such blatant disregard for human life, and we need colleagues on both sides of the aisle to step up and join us in this effort. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to one of the leaders on this issue, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). {time} 1945 Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, Congressman Duffy, for leading this effort and leading this Special Order today. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my continued outrage at, now, two abhorrent videos that have been released in the last week in which two Planned Parenthood senior doctors describe the process by which they and their coworkers kill unborn children and harvest their organs for sale. Like many Americans, I was shocked not only by what I learned about Planned Parenthood's standard practices, but by the cold, callous indifference in which its medical leadership detailed the barbaric murder of society's most vulnerable children. In the United States, we provide protections for the least among us in numerous ways from medical research, to welfare programs, to healthcare assistance; yet here, we stand on the floor of the United States House of Representatives to discuss whether the sale of human body parts harvested from aborted children violates basic human dignity and perhaps even the law. Mr. Speaker, the question that strikes me today is not whether this practice is immoral or illegal--for surely no Member of Congress or of humanity can, in good conscience, claim that we support these heinous activities--instead, I am left considering what could we have done or perhaps what should we have done to protect women and innocent children from this outrageous practice. I am left to think what kind of Nation allows these heinous acts to continue. We are the United States of America, a country founded on the belief that each individual holds dignity and worth in the eyes of our creator. If Planned Parenthood is discovered to have been altering abortion procedures so as to sell human baby hearts, livers, lungs, brains, and other organs, then they have violated their own guidelines as well as Federal laws from partial-birth abortion to the sale of human organs. It will be up to Congress to intervene on behalf of the thousands of unborn children. Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that there is a prevailing attitude inside Planned Parenthood that is so disgusting, so horrifying, and so disturbing that it warrants a congressional investigation and action. I thank House leadership and our chairman for opening up this investigation and for following our request into this unconscionable activity now. I want to thank the Members of the Missouri State legislature, my own home State of Missouri, who have committed to investigating Planned Parenthood in the State of Missouri, assuring Missourians that our laws prohibit these unthinkable acts, and hold Planned Parenthood accountable for any wrongdoing. Mr. Speaker, we have a duty as elected Representatives to the United States to stand up for the most vulnerable among us, to lend a voice to the voiceless, and stand up for injustice. I will continue to fight for the day when abortions and the atrocities associated with it are not only illegal, but unthinkable. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's powerful comments. She is right, we do need an investigation: Federal, State, FBI, and DOJ. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black). Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Planned Parenthood has blood on its hands. Over the last week, we have seen multiple videos showing its employees brazenly discussing the harvesting of aborted babies' tissues and organs, but the truth is Planned Parenthood's culture of depravity runs much deeper than these couple of videos. In my home State of Tennessee, Planned Parenthood, the supposed champion of safe abortions, sued to overturn our State's informed consent and mandatory licensing laws, measures that were put in place to protect women's health and safety. When I authored an amendment to our State constitution allowing legislators to reinstate these protections, Planned Parenthood ran an ill-fated smear campaign attempting to confuse the facts and turn Tennesseans against the measure. You see, Planned Parenthood doesn't empower women; it deceives them at their most difficult and vulnerable moments. It values convenience over truth and profit over life. As a nurse, I have seen the big abortion industry's shameful tactics with my own eyes. That is why, for 2 years now, I have sponsored the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act to address one of Planned Parenthood's largest government revenue streams. I continue to urge passage of this legislation, but in light of these videos, we must take the fight a step further. For these reasons, I have just introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, legislation that would enact an immediate moratorium on all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood while Congress carries out a full investigation. I eagerly await the findings of this forthcoming investigation, but do you know what, Mr. Speaker, no matter what it reveals, here is the truth: Planned Parenthood has made a business out of destroying that which God has created. It performs over 327,000 abortions a year, all while receiving roughly $500 million in annual funding from the taxpayer dollar. The one-sided relationship between Planned Parenthood's ever-growing bank account and American taxpayers must be severed. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments and leadership. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), one of our House leadership team Members. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for yielding time and leading this Special Order. I rise today to join my colleagues in bringing attention to allegations of serious misconduct by the country's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. There are no words to properly convey my grief and deep disgust at the cavalier way in which Dr. Deborah Nucatola details how she strategically crushes the tiny bodies of innocent, unborn children in order to harvest and sell their organs. Perhaps most disturbing is what Dr. Nucatola doesn't say. While she arbitrarily assigns monetary values to the hearts, lungs, and livers of these children, she recognizes no value in the lives of those being aborted. Mr. Speaker, I recently received a letter from a nurse who has assisted with abortions and witnessed firsthand the horrific nature of what that procedure entails. She told me that most women have no idea that they are subjecting their unborn children to such ghastly methods. Many of our colleagues in this House find it uncomfortable to talk about the issue of abortion, and I agree that it is difficult to consider and discuss these horrific practices, but the heinous nature of the methods used by Planned Parenthood is precisely why we, as a Nation and as a Congress, must confront it. These revelations merit a serious look at the practices of Planned Parenthood, and I support fully the robust [[Page 11818]] oversight and investigations being pursued by the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce Committees. It is my hope that their investigations will shed much-needed light on the organization's gruesome methods and will lead to important reforms that end these practices and stop the flow of taxpayer resources that support them. Few things demean the sanctity of human life more than elective abortion. One day, I hope that a culture of life will take hold in the United States and that all children will be protected under the law. However, until that day comes, it remains my solemn duty to stand up for life. Regardless of the length of this journey, I will continue to speak for those who cannot. Mr. DUFFY. We appreciate your voice being lent to the unborn. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler). Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is with a very heavy heart that I take to the floor today to speak out against what really I think anybody who saw it or witnessed the video or read the transcripts felt, which is outrage. For those of you who were able to stomach watching these videos, you were left with many shocking questions about an organization that appears to callously commodify human baby body parts. The first video showed a senior Planned Parenthood official describing how to place medical forceps on a baby during an abortion in order to best harvest specific organs. She bartered over prices for these little human parts. She did it over a casual lunch. Sadly, there are voices that defend Planned Parenthood and its practices. They minimize this as an isolated innocent by one individual and sought to move on as quickly as possible; but then came, today, a second video, and we can only guess that there are more to come. The likelihood that these are two isolated incidents with two individuals that don't represent Planned Parenthood's values, but approach the business of selling body parts seemingly without feeling in the exact same way, I am not buying it. I believe this body has a duty to investigate, regardless of where you stand on pro-life or pro-choice. Given the history of Federal funding to Planned Parenthood, we have to ask these questions: Is Planned Parenthood profiting from the sale of human baby body parts? Are the clinics' patients being asked if they are willing to donate? Do they know that the doctor who is performing their abortion could be profiting? Do they know whether or not this increases pain for their unborn baby during an abortion? Are these facilities abiding by State laws with regard to late-term and partial-birth abortions? Gosh, I ask this because it sure seems like they want babies in the later second and third trimesters because anybody who has been a mom or has followed this journey knows that that is when organ development really strengthens and grows. If you are just trying to profit, you want the organ that is best going to function, whether it is for research or whatever. I think we need to find out what they are even using this for. I want to know who is buying these baby parts. That is the other piece that this body needs to investigate and find out. Planned Parenthood has always purported to provide a necessary service for women's health; but I ask: Is this even safe? How long does this prolong a procedure? Is it really the motivation for their practices? Not if you follow the money--one of the doctors who was describing this, basically a harvesting doctor, joked she wants a Lamborghini. Like a lot of things, following the money does lead to answers, and this body is going to find out. Clearly, Planned Parenthood doctors are receiving and filling requests for hearts, lungs, lower extremities, and livers, a request that is unfortunately and apparently common. I have never taken to the floor of this House to express outrage over this issue, but today, I do, and it is time for answers. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I think America, with these videos, feels that very same outrage. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby). Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and I thank all of our colleagues that are here to talk on this extraordinary issue that has stunned us all. Last week, in the wake of the first video, Planned Parenthood responded by forcefully and categorically denying that the organization sells body parts of aborted babies for profit. The tone of Dr. Deborah Nucatola describing the way in which babies' organs are harvested and sold was unfortunate, they said, but there is nothing to see here. Well, just this afternoon, as I was sitting on the plane to come back to Washington, I watched the second video that has been released, showing a different senior official at Planned Parenthood discussing the same thing. Dr. Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood's Federation of Medical Directors' Council is shown negotiating prices for the tissue and even joking about her poor negotiation abilities, but that she wanted to settle on the prices soon because she wants a Lamborghini. Once again, the candid words of top Planned Parenthood officials believe the public spin on their PR teams--they felt like this was necessary to get what they wanted in order to make a profit. What we haven't heard from Planned Parenthood is a response to perhaps the biggest revelation, that its providers alter abortion procedures in order to gain access, as my colleagues have already discussed in great detail. What I found really stunning about Dr. Mary Gatter's comments that she made today is she discusses deliberately breaking the rules in order to obtain intact organs. She considers out loud on this video how to alter the abortion process to get intact baby organs. She said, We need a less crunchy option--this is sick to hear those words come from my mouth, that we need a less crunchy option when we are talking about a baby; this violates their rules--she says, as long as we do it in a way that doesn't cause more pain. These doctors sure sound like they know that there is a competitive black market at play and are willing to engage in illegal activity to tap into it. This is sickening, and it will not go unaddressed. {time} 2000 I said last week to my colleague--and I will say it again--that I do not care how much weight Planned Parenthood throws around this town. They are not above the law. If Planned Parenthood really has nothing to hide, then these officials will have no problem with a complete investigation. It is our responsibility to protect those who cannot defend themselves and to stop illegal activity when we see it. That certainly seems to be what is happening here, and I thank all of my colleagues for standing up for the unborn. Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I think it is a good point to make that there should be a set cost for these body parts. There should be costs of storing and transporting, but there should be no extra cost, and there should be no negotiation. Yet, if there is a black market and if markets are demanding certain prices because they are making a profit off of it, you are going to maybe have $30 for one and $100 for another based on the black market. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. I thank Representative Duffy for his leadership on this matter. Mr. Speaker, tonight I join my colleagues in speaking out against the barbaric and heinous actions we all witnessed in an undercover video in which Planned Parenthood was caught selling the body parts of aborted children. In 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions and received over a half billion dollars--$500 million--in taxpayer funding. Ironically, it was in 2013 that President Obama became the only sitting [[Page 11819]] President to ever address this organization. May I remind you that it was at this address that the President made the decision to invoke God's blessings on these hideous activities. The mask is now coming off an organization that barters the very parts of a baby in a manner that most Americans find appalling. So many of us here are parents. We have watched in awe at the ultrasound images of our children. We have seen their little hearts beat and have marveled at God's creation in how fearfully and wonderfully they are made. How can we stand idly and not speak out for these lives, the very least of these? That is why I have taken immediate action by joining in a letter with several of my colleagues, speaking out against Planned Parenthood's evil and depraved actions, and fully support a congressional investigation into this organization. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Congresswoman Black's bill, the Title X Abortion Provider Act. We must stop now these organizations from receiving a single taxpayer dollar through the Title X program. I urge the Senate to act quickly to pass the House's legislation that ensures no taxpayer dollars are used for abortions, H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015. May God give us continued courage to seek justice, to love mercy, and to speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves. Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), one of the most powerful voices in the House, specifically on the life issue. Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentleman. And I thank the gentleman for his leadership in organizing this hour. Mr. Speaker, we come to the floor tonight as mothers and grandmothers and dads and granddads, and we come with such heavy hearts and with such a burden for what we have found out, for what we have seen, and for what has been made public about Planned Parenthood. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I thought it was very interesting that the head of Planned Parenthood came out this week and said, ``Oh, we think there are more videos to come.'' That is because they know they have been caught, and they know they are guilty, and they know what they have done; but no amount of trying to go out and push it to the side is going to push this to the side. That is why our committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is taking up an investigation. We are already working on this. We are pushing forward to get the witnesses before us and to exercise the appropriate oversight that is there for us to do. Planned Parenthood does get Federal taxpayer dollars. The problem is money is fungible. And when you see what has been carried out in these videos--in their own words what they describe--you know how destructive that process is. As Mr. Walker just said, Planned Parenthood conducts over 300,000 abortions a year. They are the Nation's largest abortion provider. Their focus is no longer family planning or women's health. It is abortion. What we have found out is that, through this sector of their business that is focused on abortion, they have now moved even further away, and they are into selling body parts--harvesting and selling body parts. We have heard the Members speak so eloquently to this, and I know, Mr. Speaker, people can hear the emotion in our voices and in our hearts, because this is a subject you don't think about discussing on the House floor, but it is one that has been left for us to oversee. They talk about procuring these body parts. In their own words, they talk about setting the price, negotiating, dealing with the tissue brokers. These are the most abhorrent and inhumane statements and words and conduct. The conduct and the demeanor of these individuals on those videotapes cannot be denied and the casual nature with which they discussed this, as if it is routine. It is an expected part of their business. That is why we are moving forward to investigate them. That is why we feel funding should be restricted. Over 65 percent of the American people, Mr. Speaker, are against the use of taxpayer funds for abortion, and it is time for us to deal with, to hold accountable, to restrict, and to put some barriers around what has been happening with Planned Parenthood. It is an investigation we will pursue until we know the truth and have every element of truth. Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's wonderful comments. When you talk about the casual nature, you talk about doing procedures that are less crunchy. What are we talking about, less crunchy? We are crunching human bones. That is what they are actually saying in that videotape. Mrs. BLACKBURN. We are talking about setting the price for this. Mr. DUFFY. For crunching bones. Mrs. BLACKBURN. It is just their routine nature. This was not the first time they had done this. In listening to them, that is made very apparent. Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I am now proud to yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers), one of my good friends. Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for holding this very important Special Order. I want to thank my colleagues who are here today talking about this very important issue. It is not the first time that we have come together to talk about the importance of protecting life, the lives of those who are yet to be born. I can't even begin to tell you how disgusted I am, how nauseous I am right now, that we are having this discussion about the sale of baby body parts and that Planned Parenthood so values the organs of the unborn and, yet, so devalues the life of the unborn. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart in sharing these concerns with my fellow colleagues. We now know about the two videos that have been released, the first video showing the senior director of the medical services at Planned Parenthood, who was bragging in gruesome detail of how this group harvests and sells fetal organs. She described how they take particular care of the baby's organs. If only this group were just as devout in showing so much care, time, and attention to the life of the baby. In the second video are details of how the health of the mother is purposefully put in jeopardy to yield pristine, viable organs. Mr. Speaker, this is sickening. This is all for a price, a price which is being negotiated. Regardless of whether you are a pro-life individual or a pro-choice individual, you have to be absolutely appalled at this. As a nurse, a mother, and one who believes that the life of the yet to be born should be protected, I can't begin to understand how someone can recount these appalling details in such a nonchalant manner unless this has become routine. As Representatives, it is our job to protect the rights of women. It is our job to protect the rights of the unborn. This horrific revelation warrants a response from Congress, and I am proud to be on the Energy and Commerce Committee to begin this investigation. Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, and I look forward to an aggressive investigation by the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs). Mr. GIBBS. I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order tonight. Mr. Speaker, last week millions of Americans saw the horrific video in which a top Planned Parenthood doctor detailed the gruesome nature of abortion procedures. Dr. Deborah Nucatola's casual conversation about crushing the body of an unborn child is nothing short of barbaric. What is worse is the negotiation of the price of the remains of the unborn child. In a second video, which was released today, Dr. Mary Gatter negotiates the price of fetal remains, discusses a ``less [[Page 11820]] crunchy'' procedure to preserve body parts, and jokes about needing to purchase a Lamborghini from the profits of those organ sales. But this is not a joke. Profiting from the sale of human organs is illegal and so is changing a procedure specifically for organ harvesting. This is a terrible reminder of what an abortion really is, ending the life of a child. If harvested organs are so valuable, how valuable is the child? Is the value of a child's life not greater than the sum of his or her parts? How long will we, as a Nation, continue to allow such heinous, despicable acts? May these revelations on video serve as an opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the precious nature of life and how we treat the unborn, who are truly the most vulnerable and innocent among us. I thank Speaker Boehner and the Judiciary and Energy and Commerce Committees for opening investigations to determine what, if any, Federal laws were broken as a result of these awful practices. The House must not provide any Federal funds to Planned Parenthood when they condone and profit from these actions. I call on the President to denounce these practices, and I urge my colleagues in the House to support the elimination of Federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Mr. DUFFY. I couldn't agree more with the gentleman from Ohio in regard to taxpayer funding being used for abortion. I think so many Americans are outraged by Planned Parenthood and the abortions, but, now, specifically by these videos that have come to light. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn). Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his continued leadership on this critical matter of life. Mr. Speaker, I rise today sickened and angered by yet another report showing what Planned Parenthood's limitless disregard for the unborn child is. Watching senior Planned Parenthood executives discuss the sale of aborted babies' body parts while they casually dine is beyond revolting. This callous barbarism should have no place in civilized society. I am also troubled to have discovered that some of these abhorrent transactions may have taken place in my home State of Colorado. Reports surfaced last week revealing that Colorado State University appears to have violated State law by purchasing aborted baby body parts from a California affiliate of Planned Parenthood. If true, these actions would appear to violate a law that was created by a bill that I introduced and that became law during my time in the Colorado State Senate, a bill prohibiting the purchase of fetal tissue from an abortion. I have sent a letter to the university and have demanded an explanation. Further, I have provided a copy of the letter to Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, and I have urged her office to launch a full investigation. These troubling revelations exposing the monetization of fetal organs further demonstrate the need to fully defund Planned Parenthood. It is unacceptable that we continue to force taxpayers to subsidize this corrupt organization that disregards the dignity of human life while seeking to extract monetary gain from its destruction. {time} 2015 Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), one of my colleagues on Financial Services, one of our chairmen who has been doing fantastic work and a champion for life. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. I, too, thank my friend and colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership on this and so many others. Mr. Speaker, I just wish the American people could be here on this floor right now and feel the passion, the frustration--honestly, the anger. I especially want to address my female colleagues who have been here and have had the courage to come and take a stand. That isn't always done. I think it was especially hard a little earlier as we were doing 1- minutes seeing a colleague, watching a 1-minute address from an apologist of Planned Parenthood calling these horrors trumped up-- trumped up--disgusting, frankly. It is just amazing. This is one of the reasons why I voted, along with a number of my other colleagues, the vast majority of my colleagues on the Republican side, to defund Planned Parenthood. Forty-one percent of their total revenue is taxpayer dollars, $1.5 billion in 2011 to 2012. We must never forget that we are not just talking about numbers on a spreadsheet. We are talking about unborn children, not lab specimens. We are talking about human lives. We must continue to fight for every unborn child here just because of their intrinsic worth, not because of a spreadsheet or some sort of price list that Planned Parenthood or any other organization has put together. We must continue that fight, and especially when there are so many other options, that adoption option that is out there. When you see the work being done by crisis pregnancy centers like in my area, the Lakeshore Pregnancy Center, or the right-to-life organizations or any of those others that are out there in the trenches praying for, working for not just those children but, frankly, the parents that may be making a bad decision. We must continue to fight for the unborn here in Congress. I know I pledge to do that; I know so many of my other colleagues do, too. We must promote that culture of life and strong families in west Michigan, in this Nation, and around the world. I would just like to again thank my colleagues for calling attention to this horrific, horrific act that has been going on. Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. This debate has been going on for some time. Not long ago there was a debate between Rick Santorum and now Senator Boxer, and during that debate Senator Boxer was talking about life beginning when you take your baby home from the hospital. I mean, some of the viewpoints on the other side are absolutely outrageous. It just shows there is a lot of work to do. I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) to talk about this important issue. Mrs. HARTZLER. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership and hosting this Special Order tonight. Mr. Speaker, it is vital that we have this extremely important conversation concerning the unborn. While this topic is very difficult to discuss, it is something we must talk about and recognize in order to stop the unspeakable horrors currently taking place. Last week and this morning, new videos were released detailing how Planned Parenthood harvests and sells the body parts of aborted children. For decades, Planned Parenthood employees have tried to diminish the humanity of the unborn by belittling them to blobs of tissue. However, this video is evidence that Planned Parenthood knows that these are not simply blobs of tissue, but actual human beings that have tiny lungs, livers, and beating hearts. We need to get our priorities straight. In the video the Planned Parenthood doctor callously describes altering abortion procedures by crushing a baby's body in order to preserve certain organs for harvesting. She says: I am going to basically crush below; I am going to crush above. This is human life we are talking about. We cannot stand by while aborted baby parts are being sold for profit. This morning's video shows another Planned Parenthood doctor shamelessly haggling over the price of aborted baby body parts. She discusses how the price could change based on the volume and developmental stage of the aborted babies. While I am pleased that there are Federal and State investigations underway, I believe more needs to be done. Planned Parenthood has received over $200 million in Federal funds since [[Page 11821]] 2012. It is clear that Planned Parenthood places profit--not women's health and safety--ahead of all else, and they must be stopped. I urge support for Congresswoman Black's legislation that prohibits all Federal funds to Planned Parenthood. Federal dollars cannot continue to flow to any entity that has such a blatant and heartless disregard for human life. Mr. DUFFY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's powerful words. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber). Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to say something to my mom, Jeanne Weber, in Pearland, Texas. Mom, thanks for being pro-life. Thanks for cradling even the very thought of me in your heart and mind before I was conceived; and, Mom, thanks for cradling me in your womb and then later in your bosom and then in your lap, and all my young years. I love you, Mom. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I cannot tell you how deeply disturbed I am by these videos that have been unearthed showing employees of Planned Parenthood selling body parts of aborted babies. It has long been my mission to fight against any organization that will not protect the unborn. As a member of the Texas statehouse, I voted alongside other Texas House conservatives to defund the Planned Parenthood in Texas to ensure that taxpayer money would not be used on these ghastly abortion procedures. Now, as a Member of Congress, Mr. Speaker, I have fought alongside my colleagues to protect the unborn and the sanctity of life. On May 13, the House voted in strong support of my good friend Representative Trent Franks of Arizona's legislation, H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a crucial piece of pro-life legislation that bans the murder of babies who are at least 5 months old in the womb and can, indeed, feel the excruciating pain of dismemberment and a ghastly death that Planned Parenthood would perpetrate on them. In 2013, we saw the horror of Dr. Gosnell, and now we see the real disturbing practices of Planned Parenthood and their black market sale of body parts of aborted babies. Mr. Speaker, I only ask this: How can organizations put a price on tissues, limbs, and livers, and then not acknowledge that there is life at the time of conception? No price can be placed upon the worth of seeing a child born and take its first breath. And, Dad, before I go, thank you for standing alongside Mom and being pro-life. I love you both. Mr. DUFFY. The gentleman's remarks were well said. Aren't we all grateful that our parents were pro-life? It gives us a chance to be on this floor and express our views. I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the chair of our Conference but, more importantly, a mother. Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to join in expressing appreciation to Congressman Duffy, the gentleman from Wisconsin, for bringing us all together tonight on this very important issue and what has recently been uncovered through the videos featuring senior level Planned Parenthood officials admitting to unethical, potentially illegal procedures. It is really unthinkable to most of us. It is unthinkable not just because of their cold, nonchalant attitude toward ``crunchy procedures,'' but because these videos highlight that we have allowed the debate on women's health to get horribly skewed. Anyone watching these videos can say the American people must have answers. This isn't women's health. This is an agenda. It is an agenda that is driven by monetary gain, not the best interests of women. Abortion providers should not get to hide behind the foil of health care to get away with unspeakable acts. The practices described in these videos are despicable, and Planned Parenthood must be held accountable. If a hospital were even allegedly involved in any kind of illegal activity, we wouldn't hesitate for a second to haul them before a committee. Abortion providers should be no different. Policymakers who are serious about protecting women and families should be invested in getting to the bottom of these statements made by Planned Parenthood. I applaud our committees for launching inquiries into Planned Parenthood practices and procedures. The American people must have answers. Mr. DUFFY. Absolutely. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice). Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman and appreciate his leadership in this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand with my colleagues here tonight in mutual condemnation of Planned Parenthood and their horrific practices. Like so many others, I likewise have just been horrified, deeply disturbed by the flippant comments made by an executive at Planned Parenthood. It is bad enough knowing that this organization performs over 300,000 abortions every year, but it is another whole matter to come to the realization that they are also engaged in trafficking human baby parts. It is absolutely unconscionable. I believe that all life is sacred and needs to be protected. I commend my colleagues for stepping up and calling for a congressional investigation against Planned Parenthood. I also say a huge thank you to Governor Deal from my own State for, likewise, calling for an investigation of Georgia to see that infant organs are not for sale in that State. Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. It is time that Planned Parenthood be held accountable for these despicable acts. I again just say thank you, and I am honored to stand with my colleagues here this evening as we stand for life; and at the same time that we try to prevent these abysmal practices from marring our collective consciences, I plan to continue to champion life. It is just abhorrent that there would be any organization trying to make a profit, an industry for profit out of the sale and trafficking of baby human parts. Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Babin. Mr. BABIN. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my outrage over the recent disclosures of Planned Parenthood's deliberate efforts to harvest tissue from aborted babies. The practices described by Planned Parenthood officials on these videos are simply despicable, unspeakable, and barbaric. The lighthearted tone of Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the Senior Director of Medical Services for Planned Parenthood, as she talked about how much fetal tissue parts were worth while eating salad and drinking wine only adds words of insult to this atrocity. A video released just today shows Dr. Mary Gatter, another high- ranking Planned Parenthood official, again discussing fetal tissue payments. Gatter describes using a less crunchy technique to yield as much and many body parts as possible for more money to buy herself a Lamborghini. This is inhumane. As a health provider myself, I condemn it in the strongest terms. I hope the relevant medical licensing boards in their States disqualify her and Dr. Nucatola from ever practicing medicine again. It is a national disgrace that taxpayer dollars account for 41 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue and that over the past 3 years the organization has received $1.2 billion in funding from Medicaid. All of this for an organization that performs more than 300,000 abortions a year. American families should not be forced to pay the operating costs and salaries for abortion businesses, much less one that engages in fetal tissue trafficking. {time} 2030 As an original cosponsor of Representative Black's Defund Planned Parenthood Act, we are working to prohibit Federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood or any entity that performs abortions. I call upon the House and the Senate leaders to allow for its immediate consideration and attach it to any must-pass bill. [[Page 11822]] I would like to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin and all of my colleagues who are here tonight to speak on this important issue--and the millions of Americans who are leading this effort in all 50 States. May God bless all of you. Mr. DUFFY. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) for a few comments on this important issue of life. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to insist Congress stop the immoral and monstrous action being taken by Planned Parenthood in any way possible, and that includes making sure no more Federal dollars go to this organization. Today, we learned about a second video from yet another Planned Parenthood senior official who was recorded haggling over the price of body parts from murdered children and bumping up the price while joking she needed a new Lamborghini. It is disgusting. The first video, leaked on July 14, showed Planned Parenthood's practice of aborting babies and selling their organs. This behavior violates every moral and ethical code that I can think of. I was disgusted by the video showing a senior official enjoy lunch while discussing how easy it is to kill a child by crushing their heads in order to harvest the fetal organs. We must do more to create a culture that embraces life. If you are pregnant and seeking family planning services from Planned Parenthood, you are 42 times more likely to receive an abortion than prenatal care or an adoption referral. This isn't about women's health. It is about feeding an abortion mill. To me, it is unbelievable that taxpayer dollars continue to support this evil organization. Planned Parenthood's entire business model is centered around providing abortions, not giving quality medical care to women who need it. According to the Susan B. Anthony List, Planned Parenthood Clinic Director Abby Johnson has written that she was given an ``abortion quota'' and was even told by her superiors to double the number of abortions to bring in more revenue. It is not just abortions that are offensive about this organization. Planned Parenthood has also fought against mandatory reporting when they discover children are being sexually abused. Employees have acknowledged aiding and abetting human sex trafficking of young girls under the age of 14. It is time we give those who need it better access to real women's health care. We must defund Planned Parenthood now and use that funding to assist women who need real health care. Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about this too long. It is time to stop supporting a group who callously murders innocent and helpless children and sells their organs and calls it reproductive health care. Mr. DUFFY. As we are about to close this hour, we have had a chance to hear from so many members of the House Conference who have spoken out on behalf of the unborn, those little babies that don't have a voice to speak for themselves, and I know in the next half hour we are going to have Mr. Franks from Arizona continue this conversation with so many more of our members who want to be heard on this important topic. I just want to close with this. The Democrats talk so often about what big hearts they have. They talk about how compassionate they are for their brothers and sisters and their neighborhoods. The bottom line is, when you watch these videos and you see the harvesting of organs, the pain of little babies, I call on my friends across the aisle to show that compassion for the unborn and those voiceless little ones who need a voice to stand up for them and defend them at this very important time. There has been a time in our past, Mr. Speaker, where powerful people determined that there was a class that was less than human, and it is a black spot on our history. Today, there is a group in this House that has advocated that there is a class in this country that is less than human. Yes, they may not have a voice, but that does not make them less than human. And I am so proud of our team for standing up today to make sure that we fight for those people because they are not less than human. They deserve the right to life, and they deserve to have a defense. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________ CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ratcliffe). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks) for 30 minutes. General Leave Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I would first count it a privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem). Mrs. NOEM. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on an issue that has weighed very heavy on my heart; in fact, it has kept me awake at night for many nights. Two videos have recently come out showing senior Planned Parenthood executives and doctors callously discussing abortion procedures and the costs of that fetal tissue from aborted babies. It has turned my stomach to hear these people at Planned Parenthood. They claim to act in the best interest of women, but instead they talk about compensation for tiny organs from aborted babies. I find myself asking: How did we get here? How did this great country that was founded on Biblical principles get to a place where we have federally funded organizations like Planned Parenthood who claim to care for women and provide health care for them instead deceive people and use those dollars to end lives--end lives of our future women that could potentially lead this country--and then turn around and sell their body parts to put even more dollars in their pocket? It reminds me of the Edmund Burke quote that says: ``The only thing that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' And today, we have seen many good men and women come to this House floor and say that we will not ``do nothing.'' We have pushed on this issue before, but we are going to push even harder. We are going to talk even more. We are going to talk to people and have uncomfortable conversations about what is going on at Planned Parenthood. We are going to fight until we end the Federal dollars that flow into their bank accounts. We are going to fight until we make sure that our babies and our children are protected, whether they are born or unborn, and that every life is sacred; that we honor those Biblical principles that this country was founded on. Not only is what Planned Parenthood has been doing disgusting, but it raises questions about potential illegal behavior. Profiting from fetal tissue donation is illegal under Federal law, and so is altering procedures based on fetal tissue donation. So I have joined many of my colleagues here in the House, and we have asked our leadership team for an immediate investigation into Planned Parenthood and all of their practices. They need to be punished for what they have been doing. All lives matter, including the unborn. We need to do all we can to protect the most vulnerable among us. The world can be a very dangerous place, and it is dangerous because of the evil that is going on, but I believe it is much more dangerous when you have people who look on and do absolutely nothing to protect those among us. The duplicity of this organization needs to stop; and as long as Federal [[Page 11823]] dollars flow to this organization, we all need to feel responsible and do all that we can to end it. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, as profoundly tragic as it is, no one should have been surprised by the recent revelations that Planned Parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies. They have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity. They have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history, and Planned Parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3,000 little unborn American babies every day. These recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the Nation's largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life. It beggars incredulity that this Congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money--against the taxpayers' wishes, Mr. Speaker--to a heartless organization like Planned Parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason. This body recently passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that would, except in rare circumstances, protect both mothers and their little pain-capable unborn babies entering their sixth month, Mr. Speaker, of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of Planned Parenthood and evil monsters like Kermit Gosnell. If the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act had already been law, it would have saved the lives of thousands of late-term, pain-capable babies every year, and it would have made it much harder for Planned Parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from. Mr. Speaker, there is no question whatsoever that Planned Parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts. It is an unspeakable disgrace that the Obama Justice Department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts, but if this Congress and the American people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil, we do so at our moral peril. If the conscience of this Nation is to survive, it is now vital for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to become law. The House has already passed this critically important and timely legislation. It is now time for the Senate to do the same. We must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing late-term, pain-capable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered. Mr. Speaker, supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel pain--even those, they say, at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancy--as if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born. Mr. Speaker, almost every other civilized nation on this Earth protects pain-capable babies at this stage and at this age, and every credible poll of the American people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children. Yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the Federal Humane Slaughter Act. It is a tragedy that beggars expression. The voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice, especially the ones who profit from it, Mr. Speaker, will be very shrill and loud. But when we hear those voices, we should all remember the words of President Abraham Lincoln, when he said: ``Those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.'' Mr. Speaker, for the sake of all of those who founded and built this Nation and dreamed of what America could someday be, and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so Americans can walk in the light of freedom, it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be Members of this Congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Mr. Speaker, do we still hold these truths to be self-evident? Mr. Lincoln called upon all of us, Mr. Speaker, to remember that magnificent Declaration of Independence by America's Founding Fathers and ``their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the Divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on, and degraded, and imbruted by its fellows.'' He reminded those he called posterity--that is us, Mr. Speaker--that when in some distant future some man, some factions, some interest, should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that ``their posterity''--that is us, Mr. Speaker, ``might look up again to the Declaration of Independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began.'' {time} 2045 Thomas Jefferson, whose words marked the beginning of this Nation said: The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government. The phrase in the Fifth Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution, Mr. Speaker. It says: No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The 14th Amendment says: No State shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of all Americans and their constitutional rights, especially those who cannot protect themselves, is why we are really all here. Mr. Speaker, not long ago, I heard Barack Obama speak very noble and poignant words that, whether he realizes it or not, apply so profoundly to this subject. Let me quote excerpted portions of his comments. He said: ``This is our first task, caring for our children. It is our first job. If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. That is how, as a society, we will be judged.'' President Obama asked: ``Are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence, visited on our children year after year after year, is somehow the price of freedom?'' The President also said, ``Our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. That is our generation's task,'' he said, ``to make these words, these rights, these values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.'' Mr. Speaker, never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by President Barack Obama as those I have just quoted. How I wish Mr. Obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves, in the core of our souls, why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children. Are there any children more vulnerable than little pain-capable babies before they are even born? Mr. Speaker, it seems that, somehow, we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations; but, oh, how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time. As Americans, in the land of the free and the home of brave, we now live in a day when monsters like Kermit Gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and Planned Parenthood that, for financial gain, uses partial-birth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born. Mr. Speaker, what we are doing to these little children, the least of these, our little brothers and sisters, is real. The President knows that, and all of us here know that in our hearts. [[Page 11824]] Medical science, regarding the development of unborn babies, beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy, now demonstrates irrefutably that they do, in fact, experience pain. Many of them cry and scream as they are killed, but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air, we can't hear them. It is the greatest human rights atrocity in the United States today, and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that America was meant to be and for those noble Americans who died to make it come to be. Abraham Lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel, Mr. Speaker, and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment. He said: Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation. Mr. Speaker, these are, indeed, days that will be considered in the annals of history and, I believe, in the councils of eternity itself. This bloody shadow has loomed over America for too long. It is time for the Senate to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act because, in spite of all the political noise, protecting little pain-capable unborn children and their mothers is not a Republican issue; it is not a Democrat issue; it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family. It is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology. It is time for Members of the United States Congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here. It is time for all Americans, Mr. Speaker, to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of God and the inhumanity of what Planned Parenthood is doing to them. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa). Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Franks) for yielding me time, but also your longtime steadfast, earnest, and passionate leadership on this issue. It is much needed, especially in light of what we have seen this past week. We hear the euphemisms, the terms that are used talking about the unborn humans, the unborn babies. We hear terms like cell masses, cell clumps, specimens, calvaria when referring to a baby's head. A calvarium, is this even a term anybody in real life uses, especially when applied to an unborn baby's head? Is this a word that would apply to what ISIS does in beheading humans around the world? We don't use euphemisms like that. Why would we apply this to the unborn? These euphemisms disappear when there is a value assigned to the parts that can be harvested from the unborn. We hear descriptions of the techniques in this harvesting actually on the video that we have been hearing about and seeing, less crunchy techniques. The callousness of a terminology like that, less crunchy techniques, in order to preserve more parts for harvest. Are we talking about cheese puffs here? No; yet that is how callous this is. We talk about the price of parts in these videos. They have a value in this market they are talking about. Are we talking about cuts at a butchers' convention in pricing these parts? This is what it is like. It is unconscionable, Mr. Speaker, how callous, how base these terms are when we are talking about the unborn. We hear about how, for this process to happen, that consent is required. Well, who is being consented on this? The unborn donor, do they have a say in this? Obviously not. Mr. Speaker, and for all Americans, this issue is now right out in front of everyone in bright, vivid, bold, blood red colors for all to see what the attitude is, what the modus operandi for Planned Parenthood is and has been and will continue to be unless this body does something about it. We are right to call for investigations to get to the bottom if there is criminal activity here of what we have seen and is alleged with these videos. We are right to move forward with Mrs. Black's bill, should these come true. Even beyond that, for years, the millions of dollars that have been given to this organization, Planned Parenthood, to do what they do, it is time to defund them. . It also is time to move on my colleague from Arizona Mr. Franks' carefully crafted and obviously correct bill on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act because what kind of a country are we, what kind of a society are we to continue to allow these things to happen and not take action? I call on the Senate to take that bill up and pass it and put it on the President's desk, and he can explain to the American public his position on this issue. As we review, again, the grisly tactics of Planned Parenthood and others that would do as they do and the recent criminal prosecution of Kermit Gosnell--who isn't that much different than what we are talking about right here--if we don't take action, then we should be ashamed because, for all of us, the Lord is watching what we do. I thank my colleague. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), a grandfather, a father, and a lover of children. Mr. WALBERG. I thank the gentleman for the opportunity tonight to talk to this issue. I, too, stand in full support of passage of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and ask the Senate to reach down deep into their consciences, their hearts, their emotions. So often, we don't talk about that on the floor of this august body, the House of Representatives, but that is where it ought to flow because, indeed, we here, both in the House--the people's House--and the Senate, were sent to represent people, people of a great nation, people of a blessed nation, a nation that has honored the worth, the purpose, and the value of life itself since its inception. We were formed of people with great ideals; great value; great courage; and, indeed, formed with their blood given for the rights and freedoms of all individuals. For us to concern ourselves with protecting the most innocent among us, even those that are among us in the womb, I think of my new granddaughter in the womb right now, in my daughter's body, waiting for, in just a month and a half, the opportunity to breathe air itself and become a functioning human being cared for, growing and ultimately becoming all that God intended for her. I would say the same for any human being, born or unborn, that we must protect. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman from Arizona for his courage to push for this, with unwillingness to bend and bow under those that would say: Oh, get over it; stop defending something that is indefensible. I would say thank God for defending something that is totally defensible. As was mentioned earlier, we were founded on principles, principles that were firm and correct. The Founders and Framers long understood the power of truths versus human wisdom, truths and wisdom that said: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator, by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. {time} 2100 John Adams said, ``Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.'' And, indeed, what we have seen in videos in recent days, has evidenced that, when you step out of that moral principle, you go into things unthinkable and grotesque. It has been said that righteousness exalts a Nation, but sin is a reproach to any land. How could we not feel reproached in looking at videos of a licensed doctor who is willing to take and sell body parts and to countenance pain as something that is just part of [[Page 11825]] the process and to be totally unconsidered? Mr. Speaker, I spent a good deal of my early adult life in the pulpit, ministering to people from an authority far greater than this government or even this Constitution, the greatest document on the face of this Earth, manmade. But the psalmists said, ``Behold, children are a gift of the Lord. The fruit of the womb is a reward.'' That is true. Certain commentators will denigrate me for bringing up these truths, and so be it. But they are truths. Jeremiah, the prophet, speaking of God, said, ``Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart.'' The psalmist David, who became King David, said, ``For you formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb.'' Does that sound like what that doctor was doing in the womb, weaving, carefully forming? No. She was destroying. We must fight back against that evil. He went on to say, ``I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are Your works, and my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the depths of the Earth. Your eyes have seen my unformed substance. And in Your book were all written the days that were ordained for me when, as yet, there was not one of them.'' I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I thank him for his courage and standing for life itself and acknowledging the fact that the Creator has formed something of greatness. And we must not stand in the way, but do everything possible to reject the pain, to reject the defeat, to reject the conquering of the human spirit beginning right in the womb. May God help us in this country to repent, to seek his healing, to do right, and to spare the innocent among us. Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. Speaker, my time is nearly gone. And I suppose I take great heart from what I have heard here tonight because it seems to mirror history itself. When people of goodwill finally saw the victims in tragedies and recognized them as fellow human beings, their hearts and minds began to change. Mr. Speaker, I feel like the winds of change are beginning to blow here. I feel like people are starting to ask the real questions. And I know that, when we talk about abortion, it seems like all of the rules change. Sometimes you wonder if the furniture is going to start floating in the room when you hear some of the arguments. But the real question is: Does abortion take the life of an innocent child? If it doesn't, Mr. Speaker, I am willing to stop talking about it. But if it really does take the life of a child, then those of us in this Chamber standing in the seat of freedom of the greatest Nation in the history of the world also stand in the midst of the greatest human genocide in the history of the world. Mr. Speaker, I feel like America is finally beginning to see through some of the facade of the abortion industry and Planned Parenthood's obfuscation. But I have another fear, and that is that sometimes we have seen such horrors lately--the Kermit Gosnell clinic that snipped little babies' spines, the killing of children that are late-term, pain-capable--that recognition is beginning to seep through the conscience of America. But I paraphrase an old saint quote that said vice is an evil which is so frightening and mean that to be hated means only to be seen, but seen too often with its familiar face, first we endure and then we pity and then we embrace. One of the great weaknesses of mankind is that sometimes, when we see evil often enough, we become desensitized to it. Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry has shown us so much evil in recent decades that I wonder if we are becoming a little calloused to it. Do you ever wonder, Mr. Speaker, or ask yourself: Are we really killing more than 3,000 unborn children every day? Are we really staining the very foundations of this Nation with the blood of our own children? Is that really happening in America? Mr. Speaker, I would just suggest that it is past the time for great introspection on the part of this country because we are either the last best hope of the Earth or we will simply be another empire that lost its way. I am of the opinion that America, as they led the way to stop slavery, will someday recognize the humanity of these little babies and see all of humanity then begin to understand that protecting them is really part of who we all are. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________ LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Mr. Clawson of Florida (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of a family emergency.

Black, offered the following prayer: Let us pray. Lord of the harvest, we continue to seek You, for we desire to do Your will. You, O God, are our light and salvation, so we refuse to be afraid. As our lawmakers strive to walk uprightly, provide them with a harvest of truth, justice, and integrity. May they cultivate such ethical congruence that their rhetoric will be undergirded by right actions. Lord, keep them aware of Your continuous presence, as they find fullness of joy in doing Your will. Show them the path to life, as Your truth brings them to a safe harbor. We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen. ____________________ PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ____________________ RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The minority leader is recognized. Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader will be here shortly. I have gotten word he is not going to be here right now, so I am going to proceed. ____________________ IMMIGRATION Mr. REID. This past weekend, Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump did what he did best: He said something dishonest and really distasteful. In speaking about the senior Senator from Arizona, he mocked Senator John McCain, mocked his service in the Vietnam conflict. He went so far as to say John McCain was not a war hero. John McCain and I came to the House of Representatives the very same day, both new Members of the House. He was representing a district in Arizona and I my district in Nevada. We are neighbors. We served together in the House. We came here to the Senate at the same time. He is one notch ahead of me in seniority in this body because the State of Arizona has more people than Nevada. That is how seniority is determined, among other ways. John McCain was a naval pilot and comes from a family who served our country admirably in the military for decades--his grandfather and his father. On one of his first missions to Vietnam, John McCain was shot down and badly injured--broken back and arms. He was very badly hurt. He was placed in a Vietnamese concentration camp, where he spent almost 6 years. About half of that time was in solitary confinement, and many days and weeks of that were spent being punished, tortured, and rebreaking parts of his body that had been broken. John McCain, to me, is a hero. He is a person who has represented this country admirably in the Congress. He was a Republican nominee for President. America knows John McCain. I personally have some disagreements on policy on an occasion or two with John McCain, but we have never disagreed about our relationship. My relationship with Senator McCain is one where I have great admiration for him, for his strength of character, and for his moral courage in Vietnam. In the aftermath of these remarks about John McCain, Republicans have been falling all over themselves to criticize Donald Trump. But it makes me wonder: Where were all these same Republicans when Mr. Trump slandered millions? It was only a month ago that Trump said: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. That is his quote. When Trump insulted the Senator from Arizona, a Member of his own party, Republicans could not denounce him fast enough, but when Trump called immigrants ``rapists,'' there was nothing but silence--nothing but silence. There is an ugly truth behind that silence, and it is this: When it comes to immigration policy--and, frankly, most other policy--there is no meaningful difference between the Republican Party and Donald Trump. Consider the facts on just this one issue. Trump rejects a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. Instead, he favors a system of merit that creates a road to legal status. He has never ever said two sentences defining that. We have heard before the same kind of talk from Republicans, those running for President--I think we have 16 of them now. Jeb Bush rejects the pathway to citizenship. He claims to support a pathway to legal status but ``not necessarily citizenship.'' Scott Walker rejects a pathway to citizenship. He said, ``If somebody wants to be a citizen, they need to go back to their country of origin.'' The junior Senator from Texas also rejects a pathway to citizenship. He said, ``I think that it is likely that there could be some bipartisan solution to those who are here illegally if a path to citizenship were taken off the table.'' Governor Chris Christie rejects a pathway to citizenship, too. He said it is ``an extreme way to go.'' Trump wants to terminate President Obama's Executive actions on immigration, tearing apart millions of families and deporting about 800,000 DREAMers. We have heard that before, too. Jeb Bush also wants to repeal President Obama's Executive actions. On FOX News, on the ``Hannity'' show, he said he would ``repeal Obama's executive amnesty.'' That is a quote. The junior Senator from Texas also wants to terminate the President's Executive actions. Here is what he said: ``If I am elected president, the very first thing I intend to do on the first day is rescind every single unconstitutional or illegal executive action from President Obama.'' Governor Chris Christie is actively opposing the President's Executive actions. In fact, his State joined a lawsuit challenging President Obama's actions. The junior Senator from Florida also rejects President Obama's Executive actions that keep families together. Senator Rubio's spokesperson told one news outlet that ``immigration executive orders won't be permanent policy under [a Rubio] administration.'' These are the facts. When it comes to immigration policy--and, as I mentioned, sadly, most other policy issues--there is no daylight between Donald Trump and the rest of the Republican field. While the rest of the Republican Presidential hopefuls may not engage in the same repugnant rhetoric, make no mistake--they are all on the same page as Donald Trump. If I ask each Republican running for President ``Name one difference between your immigration policy and Trump's immigration policy,'' given recent history, there will be a deafening silence. [[Page 11832]] When Trump insulted McCain, Republicans couldn't denounce him fast enough, but when Mr. Trump called millions of hard-working immigrants rapists and murderers, there was nothing but silence. Maybe this is because none of the Republicans running for President can name a single way in which they disagree with Trump's policies on immigration. In the meantime, Democrats will continue to fight to pass comprehensive immigration reform, just as we did more than 2 years ago. We will continue to fight Republican piecemeal legislation that criminalizes immigrant communities--whole communities--and we will continue to fight for families who are constantly being scapegoated by today's Republican Party. ____________________ MEASURE DISCHARGED AND PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S.J.

The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ OVERTIME PAY Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe that real, long-term economic growth is built from the middle out, not from the top down. Our government, our economy, and our workplaces should work for all of our families, not just the wealthiest few. But across the country today, millions of workers are working harder than ever without basic overtime protection. That is why I am so proud to come to the floor today to express my strong support for the Obama administration's new proposal to restore overtime protections for millions of workers and families. Not only is this the right thing to do, but it is good for our economy. I wish to share a story of a man named Paul who lives in Massachusetts. As reported in the Boston Globe, Paul worked very hard at a discount retail store to provide for his family. Each week he was working 72 hours, on average. On one particular stretch, he worked for 40 days in a row without a single day off, but his employer didn't pay him one extra dime for the work he did beyond 40 hours a week. That is fundamentally unfair. And Paul, believe me, is not alone. There are so many workers like him in States across the country, and these workers feel as though they have been left behind in this economic recovery. They need government policies on overtime protections to catch up. In 1938, Congress recognized the need to set a standard for the 40- hour workweek. By law, when workers put in more than 40 hours a week, their employers had to compensate them fairly with time-and-a-half pay. But those protections have eroded over the past several years. In today's economy, many Americans feel as though they are working more and more for less and less pay, and in many cases, they are. A salaried worker can be asked to work 50 or 60 or 70 hours a week and never see a dime of overtime pay. One of the main reasons is because overtime rules are severely out of date. Right now, if a worker earns just a little more than $23,000 a year, he or she does not qualify for time-and-a-half pay. That salary threshold is much too low today. In fact, the current salary level is less than the poverty threshold for a family of four. Workers should not have to earn poverty wages to get guaranteed overtime protection. That salary threshold has only been updated once since 1975. Back in the mid-1970s, 62 percent of the American workforce was covered by overtime rules. Today, just 8 percent of our salaried workers have overtime protection, and big corporations have used these outdated overtime rules to their advantage. They force their employees to work overtime without paying them fair time-and-a-half pay. That, of course, is good for a big corporation's profit margin. But as the Union-Bulletin in Walla Walla, WA, editorialized a few weeks back, these workers are ``working, paying taxes, raising families, and often suffering due to the long hours.'' But unlike so many of the challenges we face here, there is a solution to this, and it doesn't require congressional action. Last week, the Department of Labor proposed to raise the salary threshold from about $23,000, which is what it is today, to just over $50,000 a year. That will restore overtime protections for millions of Americans. This, by the way, is especially important for parents. Think about what this would mean for a working mom who right now works overtime without getting paid for it. By restoring this basic worker protection, she can finally work a 40-hour workweek and spend more time with her kids. Or, if her employer asks her to work more than 40 hours a week, she would have more money in her pocket to boost her family's economic security. That is so important for strengthening our middle class today. Now, I do want to keep working to improve the proposed rule. I believe the Department of Labor should also update what is known as the duties test. For workers who make more than the salary threshold but still do what is called blue collar work, the duties test is designed to ensure that they get overtime protections. But today that duties test is out of date. Under the current law, big corporations can exploit the duties test to avoid paying their workers time-and-a-half, and I believe that needs to change. When workers put in more than 40 hours a week on the job, they should be paid fairly for it. That is just the bottom line. I have heard from some of my Republican colleagues that they do not want to update overtime rules. But if the Republicans want to take away this basic worker protection--basic worker protection--they are going to have to answer to millions of hard-working Americans who are putting in overtime without receiving a dime in extra pay. They can try, but I know I and many others are going to be right here fighting back for the workers and families we represent. Boosting wages and expanding economic stability and security is good for families, and it is good for our economy. And, by the way, that is exactly what we should be focused on here in Congress--to help grow our economy from the middle out, not just the top down. This isn't the only action we need to take to raise wages and expand economic stability for our families today. In the coming weeks and months, I am going to be working closely with Senate Democrats to continue our efforts to raise the minimum wage, to expand access to paid sick leave and fair and predictable work schedules, and to ensure women get equal pay for equal work. But restoring overtime protections is a critical part of our work to make sure more families get much needed economic stability. Enacting these [[Page 11833]] policies would be strong steps in the right direction to bring back the American dream of economic security and a stable middle-class life for millions of families. For workers such as Paul, who just want fair pay for a fair day's work, for the parents who have sacrificed family time for overtime and not seen a dime in extra pay, and for families who are looking for some much needed economic security, I urge all of my colleagues to support restoring overtime protections. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. ____________________ MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3038 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk that is due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 3038) to provide an extension of Federal-aid highway, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund, and for other purposes. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be placed on the calendar. ____________________ SCHEDULE Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me indicate to all Members that discussions continue on a way forward on a multiyear highway bill, and we will have more to say about that later in the day. ____________________ HONORING THE SERVICEMEMBERS WHO WERE KILLED IN THE CHATTANOOGA TRAGEDY Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at dawn, with Congress returning to session, we lowered the flag at the U.S. Capitol to half-staff in honor of the servicemembers who were killed in Chattanooga. What we saw there was a tragedy for our country. It was a terrible blow to everyone who loved these brave Americans. We will never forget their sacrifice, and we will continue to keep their families and their memories in our thoughts today. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ DRIVE ACT Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are going to be moving to the highway bill. In fact, we are going to have the motion to proceed today at 2:15 p.m., and I think it is important that people realize the significance of this. We do a lot of work around here that is not really critical. There are some issues that are. If you would like to read the Constitution sometime when you have nothing else to do, it will tell you that what we are supposed to be doing are two things: defending America and roads and bridges. That is what it says in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. So anytime you are sitting around with nothing to do, you ought to read it, and you will realize that what we are going to do at 2:15 today is very significant. Passing a long-term transportation reauthorization bill has been my top priority since I resumed the office of the chairmanship of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is probably the second most important thing we do, second only to the Defense authorization bill. In the first hearing we had in January, we had Secretary Foxx, the Secretary of Transportation, who is an outstanding Secretary. He is just as concerned about this as we are. Senator Boxer and I brought in Secretary Foxx as well as local government leaders to share the importance of ongoing Federal and State partnerships in maintaining the modern surface infrastructure system. Since that time, my committee has put forward a bipartisan bill called the DRIVE Act. It is significant, and it is not partisan. There is no such thing as a Democratic bridge or a Republican bridge or a Democratic road or a Republican road. Historically, Republicans have been recognized as leading in this area, from way back in the days when President Lincoln spearheaded the Transcontinental Railroad; Teddy Roosevelt and the Panama Canal; and, of course, the Interstate Highway System, created by President Eisenhower. President Eisenhower recognized that weakened defense and interstate commerce made our Nation vulnerable to the world. In 1952, when he proposed the Interstate Highway System, he commented that this was every bit as much about defending America as it was about the economy and being able to transport commerce around the States. In laying out the full interstate system, he envisioned it to be the physical backbone of the economy, fueling the growth of our GDP, our cities, and the competitiveness of our exports. This vision and certainty maximized the economic and mobility benefits of the system. Businesses and individuals knew that they could locate somewhere on the future interstate system and be connected to not just the rest of the country but the rest of the world. This legacy system, which was built over 50 years ago, had a design life of 50 years, and it has actually been over 60 years--close to 70 years since it was built. We are beyond our warranty period, and we are in serious danger of eroding half a century of investments without proper maintenance, modernization, and reconstruction. We are on borrowed time with a system that is in full need of restoration. Our national interstate system currently has a maintenance backlog of $185 billion on about 47,000 miles of interstate, and that is just to bring it back to the design it was in 1956. Maintaining Eisenhower's vision of economic opportunity and strength in defense requires a continued partnership between the Federal Government and the States, which is the hallmark of the DRIVE Act. Yet, due to 33 short-term patches since 2005--I have to say this because this is significant. We should be operating on a transportation reauthorization system all the time. The last one we did was in 2005. I was the author of it, in fact. That was a 5-year bill. Since that time, we have gone through some 30 different short-term extensions. A short- term extension doesn't do any good. A transportation reauthorization bill is needed in order to accomplish all the reforms that are necessary and to have time to handle the major, large problems we have to deal with. Passing a long-term bill is crucial to many aspects of day-to-day life in America. More than 250 million vehicles and 18 billion tons-- valued at $17 trillion--in goods traverse across the country every year. Yet every day 20,000 miles of our highways slow below the posted speed limits or experience stop-and-go conditions. The National Highway System is only 5.5 percent of the Nation's total roads, but it carries 55 percent of all vehicle traffic and 97 percent of the truck-borne freight. We are talking about 97 percent of the freight on only 5 percent of the highways. [[Page 11834]] Congress just passed a 2-month extension. Now we have a responsibility to pass a long-term bill. The highway trust fund currently needs $15 billion a year to maintain the current spending. When we started out with the highway trust fund, that was a percentage every year. When someone would drive up and pay a tax when buying gas, that was supposed to be for taking care of the highways--and it did. I can remember when I was serving in the House. The biggest problem we had at that time was we had too much money in the highway trust fund. We had more than we needed. I remember when President Clinton came in. He wanted to rob the highway trust fund for all of his programs. He got by with it for a while. That is not the problem anymore. The problem now is there is not enough money. The situation has changed. People are not using as much fuel. So we have fallen short by $15 billion a year of having the amount of money necessary to continue today's spending level. That is $15 billion a year. This is a 6-year bill. That means about $90 billion is needed in excess of the amount of money, revenue, that is derived from the highway trust fund. The DRIVE Act--that is what we call this--will put America back on the map as the best place to do business. The DRIVE Act has several key components that position America's transportation system to support our growing economy. It prioritizes funding for core transportation formula programs to provide States and local governments with a strong Federal partner. It prioritizes the Interstate Highway System, that national highway system, and the bridges at risk for funding shortfalls. It creates a new multibillion-dollar-per-year freight program to help States deliver projects and promotes the safe and efficient transportation of goods. It targets funds for major projects in the community, such as shown right here. This is a picture of the Brent Spence Bridge I have in the Chamber. This goes from Kentucky to Ohio and actually takes transportation also to Indiana. This is a very old bridge. You can see it is going to have to be replaced. These are the huge things you cannot do with short-term extensions. You are going to have to have a major bill, such as the one we are having right now. Lastly, the DRIVE Act provides greater efficiency in the project delivery process, reforms that put DOT in the driver's seat during the NEPA process by requiring agencies to bring all the issues to the table, keeping them under a deadline, and eliminating duplication. One of the problems we have with the environmental requirements is they end up delaying projects. So this bill gives exceptions. Let me say that I was very proud of Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer is a very proud liberal. I am a very proud conservative. One of the few things we agree on is the highway bill. It does require some changes that allow them to go ahead and keep working in spite of some of the NEPA requirements or the environmental requirements. This gives bridge projects special consideration, with new exemptions from section 4(f), the historic property reviews for concrete and steel bridges--a new exemption from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for bridges in serious condition. Now, this sounds kind of off the wall, but one of the problems is the swallows. The swallows go in there and they block--they nest in there. So we are supposed to be repairing bridges. The swallow is not an endangered species. It is not listed, but the Migratory Bird Treaty Act does give them protection, and this waives that in the case of bridge construction. It also enforces greater transparency for Federal funds to show the taxpayers where the money is being spent. This is just a brief overview of the bill. As the DRIVE Act progresses on the floor, I intend to address the significance of each program in more detail. The most important point I must address about the DRIVE Act is that our bill sets funding levels for the next 6 years. There is, at the very least, what the Federal Government should provide, so States, local officials, and the construction industry can gear up for the large $500 million to $2 billion major highway projects and bridge projects so we can get them off the ground. They have to get ready for it. That is what this bill does. Thousands of projects across the Nation are currently in jeopardy, and construction will come to a halt unless legislation becomes a reality. Future projects like--let's go back. You saw already the Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky. There is also the $2.6 billion Mobile River Bridge in Alabama. This is a projection of what it will look like. This is as it is today. This would be impossible without something like a 6-year bill. In DC, the Memorial Bridge is literally crumbling into the Potomac. People do not understand what happens to these bridges. You can see--in our case in Oklahoma, we had a bridge over I-35. In the year 2005, as a part of that bill, that legislation, we were able to repair it. In 2004, right before that took place, one of the chunks came off--just like you are seeing here on the bridge--and actually killed a young lady who was driving under it with her three children. That is how serious this is. This is the Arlington Memorial Bridge. It was built in 1932. Something has to be done with that. We will be able to do projects like this. More than just a small part of the economic success enjoyed by the United States over the past 50 years has been the Interstate System. Today, we literally sit at the crossroads of its future. The solution is urgent. This is why Senator Boxer and I are bringing the DRIVE Act to the Senate floor as a solution. It will ensure that States have the tools and the certainty to make the necessary new investments to rebuild Eisenhower's vision, to fight growing congestion, to maintain the mobility of goods and services necessary to keep the economy going. By passing the DRIVE Act, Congress will be able to take pave the way for the next 50 years of American excellence in infrastructure. I have to say this. The importance of this is that the only alternative is to have short-term extensions. I am talking about 1- and 2-month extensions, of which you cannot organize your labor. The cost of that--and by the way, I say this to my conservative friends--they will be friends, and I can say this, since I have been ranked as the most conservative Member of this body many times--that the conservative position is not to oppose this massive highway bill that we are going to have but to oppose the short-term extensions. It costs about 30 percent more for a short-term extension than it does for a highway reauthorization bill. That is why this is so important. Later on, I am going to go over many of the other bridges and structures around that are going to have to be addressed. In the meantime, this is something we are supposed to do. I kind of will end up where we started off; that is, there is an old document that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution. You go back and read that, you will find out what we in this body are supposed to be doing. It is defending America and it is providing bridges and roads. So as we progress on this, there will not be time to go into any more detail now because we have Members wanting to come down and use both the Republican and Democratic time between now and the noon hour, but at 2:15 we are going to have a motion we will be voting on to move to the consideration of this bill. It doesn't say you have to be for it or against it or you want to change it. If you want to have amendments, you have to get to the bill before you can have amendments. So a motion-to-proceed vote will take place at 2:15. Now, I want to tell all of the Members who are out there that if you have amendments--we are going to try to knock this thing out in 2 weeks. We are going to be down here talking about it for 2 weeks. But if you have amendments, if you want a chance to offer your amendments, you can offer them, but bring them down, file your amendments. If you do not do that, we will [[Page 11835]] pass a deadline and you will not be able to do that. So I encourage our Members to do that. I look forward to the next 2 weeks of discussing and passing the second most significant bill we will consider this year. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ WASHINGTON EXEMPTION FROM OBAMACARE Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to again bring up a very important issue. It is important because it impacts a major part of our lives, a major law that Congress passed several years ago. It is important because it goes to a fundamental principle--what should be a fundamental principle of American democracy--that what Washington passes for the rest of the country it should live with itself. I am talking about the Washington exemption from ObamaCare and my effort, with others, to end that double standard. As the Presiding Officer remembers, during the ObamaCare debate several years ago, this issue came up. It came up in the context of a floor amendment. It was an important floor amendment, one of the very few that conservatives in the Senate passed on the Senate floor. That amendment to the ObamaCare bill said that all Members of Congress and our staff would get our health care through the so-called ObamaCare exchange, just as millions of other Americans would under this plan--no special rules, no special treatment, no special exemption or special subsidy. That was important to say that Congress would live under whatever law passed for the rest of America, and that amendment was passed on the Senate floor. It became part of the broader bill, and it was eventually passed into law. Obviously, as you know, I opposed-- strongly opposed--and continue to oppose the ObamaCare bill and the law, but that amendment was made a part of it. Well, after it was passed into law, it was sort of one of those cases of which Nancy Pelosi said that we have to pass the law to figure out what is in it. After the fact, lots of folks on Capitol Hill in Washington started reading the law more carefully, read that provision, and said: Oh, you know what. How are we going to deal with this? Surely, surely we aren't going to be subjected to the ObamaCare exchanges the same as millions upon millions of other Americans--even though that is exactly what the statute said. Well, at that point a very determined lobbying campaign got under way--a lobbying campaign of many Members on Capitol Hill--of the President. And the campaign was simple. People rushed to the administration, rushed to President Obama and said: Oh, you need to change this. We can't live with the statute and the significant section of the statute that says all Members of Congress need to go to the exchange for their health insurance, just as millions of other Americans do. Sure enough, after months of that very determined and, sadly, bipartisan lobbying campaign, President Obama issued one of his countless Executive orders and edicts to essentially change, with the stroke of his pen, contrary to statute, a significant part of the ObamaCare statute. He has done that dozens--if not hundreds--of times, and this is one significant example of that. He changed what the statute said and took a lot of the sting out of that provision of the law for Members of Congress. Through an OPM rule, he said two things. First, Members of Congress, when you go to the exchange, which is mandated, don't worry; you are going to have a big taxpayer-funded subsidy follow you to the exchange--unavailable to every other American at our income level and completely unique to Members of Congress. No other American going to the ObamaCare exchanges enjoys this. But out of thin air, we are going to give you a big, taxpayer-funded subsidy that is nowhere in the statute. Then the second significant thing President Obama did through that OPM rule was to say this: Members of Congress, this doesn't have to apply to your staff even though it says it does. You can designate whomever you want on your staff as ``nonofficial'' and they don't have to go to the ObamaCare exchange at all. Well, virtually all of my Republican colleagues regularly come to the floor and rightly complain about President Obama changing statutory law with the stroke of his pen, acting beyond his authority. This is a crystal-clear example of that. If we complain about it in other context, I think we should speak up and complain about it even when it benefits us. So that is what I am doing. We should not stand for this Washington exemption from ObamaCare. We should not stand for this complete, complete double standard. We should insist that we live by that clear language of the ObamaCare statute so that every Member of Congress gets his or her health care on the so- called ObamaCare exchange, just as millions of other Americans do--no exemption, no special subsidy, and no special treatment in any way, shape or form. I have been fighting since that OPM rule to make sure we do exactly that. There will be a floor amendment this week to pursue that end, and I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, to support that important floor amendment. It is important to do that for two reasons--one, focused on principle and one focused on real practicality. First, as to the principle, I think it is a basic fundamental principle of American democracy--it certainly should be--that what Washington passes on the rest of the country it lives with itself. That should be a fundamental principle of American democracy. So my legislation, the No Exemption for Washington from Obamacare Act, the floor amendment which embodies exactly that legislation, would say that every Member of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and their political appointees get their health care from the ObamaCare exchanges just like millions of other Americans--no special exemption, no special subsidy, no special treatment, no special insider deal. The second reason we should support that is a lot more practical, and that is that when you make the cook eat his own cooking, it often improves dramatically. When you force the chef to have every meal out of his own kitchen, the product often improves dramatically. So that is what I want to do in a simple, straightforward way, abiding by the clear language of the ObamaCare statute itself. All of official Washington--every Member of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and all of their political appointees--should have to go to the exchanges for their health care, just like millions of other Americans who have to as their fallback option. And we should do it in the same way--no special exemption, no special subsidy, no special treatment, and no special insider deal. It is important we say this, and it is important we do it. We have an opportunity do it on the floor as we debate the bill before us. I urge my colleagues to support this important floor amendment and to lend support to the free-standing bill that I have introduced. As I travel to Louisiana, I have regular townhall meetings, and I have regular telephone townhalls when I am stuck here in Washington and voting. Probably, the biggest single complaint I hear that really and rightly gets under the skin of my fellow Louisiana citizens goes to the heart of this discussion. Why the heck does everybody in Washington think they are above us? Why do they pass laws and never have to live under them themselves? Well, this is a crystal-clear example of that. What is worse is that the statute itself sets out that we would live under ObamaCare, getting our health care from the ObamaCare exchange just like millions of other Americans. If you don't believe that is what the statute mandates, look exactly at the [[Page 11836]] particulars of how Congress and the President are currently getting around that through the special OPM rule that President Obama issued. This rule says that Congress can get its health care from a special small business exchange in the District of Columbia and can have a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy applied, even though it is unavailable to every other American at our income level. Now, what is wrong with that? Well, under the ObamaCare statute itself, that small business exchange is specifically set up and regulated and limited to small businesses of 50 employees or less. How did Congress define itself as a small business with 50 employees or less? It is interesting, if you pull the paperwork that the leadership of the House and Senate sent over to allow Members to participate in this exchange. The folks who submitted that paperwork on behalf of the House and the Senate, who signed off on it saying that everything contained therein was true and accurate, said: How many employees does the Senate have? Forty-five. How many employees does the House have? Forty-five. Really? That is interesting. This is a flatout lie. It is a flatout lie submitted in writing by the House and Senate on behalf of all of us to shoehorn Congress in to this small business exchange to get extra added benefits, to get this taxpayer-funded subsidy unavailable to every other American at our income level. And that proves how outrageous this end run around the statutory language is. So again, I urge all our colleagues to come together in support of this fix and to say: Yes, it should be the first rule of American democracy that what we pass for the rest of America we live by ourselves. That is important, and we are going to do it in this case and in every case. I urge my colleagues to support our freestanding bill--the No Exemption for Washington from ObamaCare Act. I urge our colleagues to support the floor amendment, which is the same as that freestanding bill, and to pass it as a floor amendment--to pass it into law through that mechanism. Before yielding the floor, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be equally divided. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL JAMES WINNEFELD, JR. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to ADM James Winnefeld, Jr., who is retiring at the end of this month after serving with distinction for more than 37 years, culminating his career as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Throughout his service as a senior military leader, Admiral Winnefeld has provided this body, and in particular the Senate Committee on Armed Services, with valuable testimony and candid military advice. Over the last 4 years, Admiral Winnefeld has served as the ninth Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His vast experience, knowledge, outstanding leadership, and professionalism, combined with his deep respect and consideration for our service men and women, will be greatly missed. During his tenure as Vice Chairman, Admiral Winnefeld provided military advice to not only the legislative branch but also to the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a wide range of complex military and national security issues during an extremely challenging period in our country's history. In a challenging fiscal and security environment, Admiral Winnefeld helped to lead our military through global events and threats, to include the Department of Defense's rebalance to the Pacific, Iraq troop withdrawal, Afghanistan transition, the global threat of ISIL, instability in Syria, and Russia's provocative actions in Eastern Europe. In addition, the Vice Chair played key roles in advising our Nation's leaders on various counterterrorism efforts. As Vice Chairman, he led the development and implementation of the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, an effort that involved thousands of senior leadership man hours. Pivotal to his role as the Vice Chairman, he also chaired the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, where he worked tirelessly to transform the requirement processes to become more agile, transparent, and inclusive. Admiral Winnefeld focused his efforts on the immediate capability needs of the combatant commanders and the most pressing military issues of the joint warfighter. As cochair of the Defense Acquisitions Board, Admiral Winnefeld worked to link the requirements, resource, and acquisition communities in developing programs to deliver appropriate capabilities to the joint warfighter at the right time and for the right price. Admiral Winnefeld's work as a cochair of the Nuclear Weapons Council ensured our military's nuclear enterprise and No. 1 priority remained viable and relevant as a strategic deterrent to our Nation's adversaries. Admiral Winnefeld graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology--also known as Georgia Tech--and received his commission from the Navy ROTC Program there. He subsequently served with three fighter squadrons flying the F-14 Tomcat and as an instructor at the Navy Fighter Weapons School. Admiral Winnefeld's unit commands at sea include Fighter Squadron 211, the USS Cleveland, and the USS Enterprise. He led the ``Big E'' through her 18th deployment, which included combat operations in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom immediately after the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001. As the commander of Carrier Strike Group TWO, he led Task Forces 50, 152, and 58 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and maritime interception operations in the Arabian Gulf. He also served as the commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet, the commander of NATO Allied Joint Command Lisbon, and the commander of Striking and Support Forces NATO. His shore tours include service in the Joint Staff Operations Directorate, as senior aide to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and as executive assistant to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. As a flag officer, Admiral Winnefeld served ashore as the director of Warfare Programs and Transformational Concepts at U.S. Fleet Forces Command, as the director of Joint Innovation and Experimentation at U.S. Joint Forces Command, and as the director for Strategic Plans and Policy on the joint staff. Prior to becoming the vice chairman, Admiral Winnefeld served as the commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command and the U.S. Northern Command. As the commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, Admiral Winnefeld led historic advances in the working relationship between NORTHCOM, Homeland Security, FEMA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, and the National Guard, specifically with the dual status commander concept. In addition, he led the U.S.-Mexican military-to-military relationship to a historic level of collaboration and brought tangible results to our Nation's important struggle against the fast-growing transnational criminal organizations. Through his distinctive accomplishments, Admiral Winnefeld culminated a long and distinguished career in the service of our Nation. His tenure leaves a lasting, positive legacy on our armed services. I appreciate his extraordinary service which reflected great credit upon himself, the U.S. Navy, and the Department of Defense. For nearly 40 years, Admiral Winnefeld has performed his duty professionally, honestly, and with great dedication. Our Nation will miss his [[Page 11837]] leadership and expertise. We wish him and his family all the best as he moves to the next phase of his life. Personally, I want to thank Admiral Winnefeld and say job well done, God bless, and Godspeed. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ ``NEW HORIZONS'' PLUTO MISSION Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, 46 years ago yesterday, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first people to walk on the Moon. September will bring the 53rd anniversary of President Kennedy's speech that launched America on the quest to land them on the Moon. He set that goal for the country not because it was easy but because it was hard. I am here to congratulate the men and women of the New Horizons mission for making the hard work of sending a spacecraft to Pluto look easy. One week ago today, what had once been a fuzzy picture of Pluto came into sharp focus. Dramatic transformations inspire everyone. As you can see, NASA delivered an amazing before-and-after story. Until the New Horizons flyby, the best picture we had of Pluto offered little detail of our neighbor at the edge of the solar system, but now we can see distinct features on its surface, including something that looks like a heart. Who couldn't love that. Thank you for this great picture. It took the New Horizons spacecraft 9\\1/2\\ years to cross the 3 billion miles between Pluto and Earth, but it was a mission much longer in the making. In the late 1980s, a group of scientists came together to advocate for sending a spacecraft to the edge of the solar system. Such a mission would tell us more about Pluto and once again push back the edge of the known frontier. Many of those scientists are still involved with the New Horizons mission, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's own Richard Binzel. While these scientists pushed to get the green light for the mission, it was only achieved by the partnership between NASA, some of our best U.S. universities and the aerospace industry, and the hard work and innovation of their scientists, engineers, and staff. From just the initial information returned this week, scientists have to rethink what they thought they knew about Pluto, its Moons, and its space environment. Images came back of mountains of frozen water as high as the Rocky Mountains on Pluto. On its Moon Charon, we can now see deep canyons and a row of cliffs and troughs stretching 600 miles, as far as from Washington, DC, to Atlanta. Instruments on the New Horizons probe confirm that the Pluto system contains a large amount of frozen water. That is an essential building block of life. One thing scientists didn't see--many of the meteorite impact craters--suggests that Pluto was geologically active relatively recently. The voyage of discovery from the flyby will continue for years to come. Not only will scientists learn more, but they will also train the next generation of planetary scientists. I am proud the youngest member of the New Horizons team is Alissa Earle, a graduate student at MIT. The New Horizons team is following in the great American exploration tradition. They are pushing back the boundaries of geography, knowledge, and technology. In doing so, they are inspiring the world. No matter what you think of the classification of Pluto as a dwarf planet, we can all agree that the New Horizons mission is already a massive achievement. I look forward to the further revelations it will bring as its data streams back to Earth and it travels to the far edges of our solar system. Finally, I would like to note that in the same week of taking us to Pluto, NASA also commenced the continuous monitoring of the Sun and the Earth--the only home humans have known thus far. I hope the events of this past week confirm the importance of using all of NASA's tools to further the exploration of our solar system and universe and better understand our own planet as well. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ HONORING THE LIVES OF FIVE AMERICAN HEROES Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am here with our senior Senator Lamar Alexander to speak on something very tragic that occurred in our State and in my hometown. I rise to honor the lives of five American heroes--the five American heroes we honor today with the lowering of the flags here at the U.S. Capitol. Our community is heartbroken, as has been said many times, our State is heartbroken, and I believe our Nation is heartbroken that these outstanding young men died in the way they did, but we honor their lives. We mourn their loss. We think of the greatness they embodied: Thomas Sullivan, David Wyatt, Carson Holmquist, Skip Wells, and Randall Smith. I think as the Nation has learned about these individuals carrying out what many would consider to be mundane activities in support of our U.S. military, those who protect us, they understand the greatness they symbolized, most of them having served in Afghanistan and Iraq and some of them younger, beginning their careers, but all having excellent backgrounds and exemplifying the very best America has to offer. Our Nation mourns, our community mourns, and we have lost five of our greatest. Also, hospitalized in Chattanooga today is a young man named Dennis Pedigo, whose mother and father both served on the Chattanooga Police Department, and he has followed in their footsteps. I think people have heard all around our country the tremendous heroism that was exemplified by the Chattanooga Police Department, which rushed at the assailant and brought him to his end--by the way, trained to do so, trained to go at them. This was not a SWAT team, but these were patrol squads that were trained to deal with this kind of situation and no doubt saved the lives of other people in doing so. So we honor them. We honor all of them. We celebrate them. As a community we have been harmed, and our community has prayed. We had a vigil on Friday night that was extraordinary. Senator Alexander was there with our Governor, our mayor, county officials, and others. It was an extraordinary time of our community coming together around what has happened. I do believe that what people all over the country and the world have heard about ``Chattanooga strong'' is true, and I think our community will be even stronger because of what has happened, and our Nation must understand where we are in the world and that these types of activities will possibly continue. I had a very good conversation on Friday with the Pentagon to talk about what they are doing. I know threat activity has been rising for some time, and they are looking at what needs to be done to ensure this doesn't happen again. I had a very good conversation this morning with Senator McCain, who I know is leading efforts with House Members to figure out if there is a way to add something to the NDAA, a piece of legislation that we can deal with very quickly here so we can make sure we have policies to protect lives. Our community is praying for these individuals. It is my hope that we will put policies in place to ensure we appropriately protect these individuals. In addition to that, there are tangible things we can do. I know that [[Page 11838]] when something like this happens, there are certain types of Federal benefits. Our offices are working together with outside groups to coordinate that. Thankfully, our community has come together to make sure these families have the financial support they need beyond that. There is an effort under way in Chattanooga now--and I hope people around the world will participate--to make sure that the financial support that is necessary to sustain these families in light of what happened occurs. My friend and a great Tennessean--or at least we claim him as that because he lives in Chattanooga for part of the year--Peyton Manning, has lent his name to this effort. My sense is that we will see a generous outpouring to ensure that, at a base level, some of the financial needs of these families, if not all, will be dealt with in an appropriate way. I will close by saying this. Our community has been shocked, as has the world. We have lost five outstanding people, and it has shaken their families. I had the opportunity to meet briefly with the family of the fallen sailor, the last person who passed. He was riddled with bullets, and the Erlanger trauma squad worked with him for hours and hours and hours trying to save his life. Finally, after a tremendous fight, he lost his life--again, in the line of duty. The needs of these families are great. While our community is praying, they will try to meet their needs in other ways. How do we respond to this? Lamar and I have both mentioned what comes out of this, and the fact is that I feel that our community is like none I have witnessed from the standpoint of its compassion to others. My sense is that the way our community is going to respond to this is much like what I would refer to in Genesis 12, where God said to the Jewish people that they were blessed to be a blessing. I think most people in our community, our State, and our Nation believe we have been incredibly blessed, and my sense is that in addition to responding to the specific needs that need to be dealt with both here in Washington and back home and certainly at the State level, our community is going to rise up and ensure that, because we have been blessed, we continue to be a blessing to others. That is my hope, and that is what I am seeing happen. I have never seen such an outpouring of compassion anyplace else in my life. I am proud to represent Tennessee. I am proud that my hometown has responded in the way that it has, in spite of a deep mourning and grief that we have for these outstanding men who lost their lives in the line of duty. Senator Alexander and I will submit a resolution later today, and my sense is that the entire Senate will want to be a part of it. With that, I will turn to my distinguished friend, a great colleague, and one of the greatest Senators our State has ever had, Lamar Alexander. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corker for his eloquent and obviously heartfelt comments. He mentioned the word that we have heard most often since last Thursday, when he and I first got word of this tragedy, and the word is ``heartbroken.'' We are heartbroken for the lives that were lost, heartbroken for the families that remain, and heartbroken for the community of Chattanooga. We can see the deep emotion that Senator Corker has expressed. As a resident and former mayor of Chattanooga, that community is very special to him. On Friday at 5:30 p.m., in Mount Olivet Baptist Church, there was a memorial service that nearly 1,000 people attended. Senator Corker, our Governor, the police chief, and others spoke. I know most people in the country know about what happened that day. Most of them would have liked to have been there to do what they could in a time such as this. You never know quite what to say. Sometimes all you can do is just be there. This is especially hard because these were young men--young men in the service of our country, young men whose lives were filled with happiness, young men who had the expectation of a long life for themselves, young men who were filled with duty and service. They were living in a strong community. Faith and the sense of helping one another is strong Chattanooga faith. Chattanooga is a place of good neighbors. Chattanooga was recently named the best midsize city in America. Everything in Chattanooga seemed to be going in the right direction, and then this happened. So it is especially heartbreaking in the community of Chattanooga. On Friday, I thought--while trying to think about what words I could add to the words that were being said--about the time in 1985 when 289 members of the 101st Airborne Division lost their lives in a plane crash in Newfoundland, and President Reagan came to Fort Campbell to meet with the families to talk about it. I was Governor then, and I drove up to hear what he had to say. He spoke of those men and women--as these five were--as peacekeepers. They were there to protect lives, protect the peace, and to act as a force for stability and trust for our country. President Reagan said of those 289 men and women, which can be equally said of these five men, that their work was the perfect expression of the best of the Judeo-Christian tradition. They were the ones of whom Christ spoke when he said: ``Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.'' President Reagan said of the 289 who lost their lives 30 years ago what could be said of these five this week and what a poet said of soldiers in another war: They will never grow old; they will always be young. And we know one thing with every bit of our thinking: They are now in the arms of God. Chattanoogans said last Friday the words ``Chattanooga strong,'' and they were repeated by Senator Corker, the Governor, and most of the members of the community. People were standing up and supporting each other and the families who had been heartbroken by the loss of their loved ones. I am enormously impressed with the people of Chattanooga and their current leaders: the mayor, the Governor, and their Senator, who is also their former mayor. I believe Chattanooga will be strong. I think it is important, as we reflect and grieve here in the Senate with Chattanooga--not just with the families and the people who knew the five who passed--that we not only honor the five, but that we also honor the city and its response to this terrible tragedy. I pledge to continue to work with Senator Corker to do all that I can to help those five families and help create an environment that can keep Chattanooga strong. I thank the Presiding Officer, and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. ____________________ THE HIGHWAY BILL Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, after literally months of discussion and a lot of cooperation from chairmen and ranking members and staffs and Members from both sides of the aisle, I am happy to announce that Senator Boxer and I have an agreement for a multiyear, bipartisan highway bill. We hope to be able to discuss this agreement at our conferences shortly. This is a 6-year highway authorization that will allow planning for important long-term projects around the country. The bill also provides 3 years--3 years--of guaranteed funding for the highway trust fund. Senators from both parties know that a long-term highway bill is in the best interest of our country, so we will continue working together to get a good one passed. Thanks to the dedication of both Republican and Democratic Senators and their staffs, I am hopeful that we will. I wish to thank some other people who have been involved in getting us to where we are. In particular, I thank Chairman Jim Inhofe, Chairman Orrin Hatch, Chairman John Thune, and Chairman Richard Shelby for their efforts to reach a bipartisan accomplishment. [[Page 11839]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we have an agreement--and I am sure we do because I have great respect for Senator McConnell, Senator Boxer, and, of course, Senator Inhofe. We have this issue, though: We haven't seen the bill. There can be an agreement, but until we put an agreement in writing, things are a lot different. We have a number of committees that need to look this over in addition to the EPW Committee on which Senator Boxer is the lead Democrat. We have the Commerce Committee that we have to deal with. We have the Finance Committee that we have to deal with. We have the Banking Committee that we have to deal with. I want a highway bill. I have had the good fortune of being chairman of the EPW Committee twice. I worked on a number of long-term highway bills back in the good old days when we did that, and I hope we can have a long-term bill again. But we can't move forward on a bill until we have read it and seen it and studied it. That doesn't mean study it for several days, but we need to look at this document. I need to have a caucus after we have this document so we can look at it. So I hope my friend the Republican leader will be patient and wait until we get something we can study, and I will have a caucus with my caucus and we will sit down and decide how we should move forward on this matter. I repeat, I admire all of the hard work that has been done by everybody up to this point, but we have to make sure we move forward with this in the right direction. I understand all the issues probably more than most about all the time involved in a bill such as this. There are all kinds of potential ways to stall this, but we are not going to do that on our side. We are going to be as expeditious as we can once we have something that we can read and understand and, as I said, study so we can understand it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before my leader leaves the floor, I wish to thank him because he and Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, and the rest of the leadership team have been pushing hard for a bill. As my leader knows, I have been negotiating in good faith with the Republican team, headed by Leader McConnell, for a long-term, robust bill. I agree with Leader McConnell that we have an agreement in principle. I also agree with my leader that we have to look at the details. So my work now turns to getting those agreements up on the Internet so people can read for themselves the various titles. It is my understanding that we will start to see that language momentarily. I know we are working hard with my Chairman Inhofe to make a couple of changes to EPW. But I have to say we have reached an agreement in principle on a 6-year bill with 3 years of funding, and the text will be printed shortly. I believe it is a breakthrough. The highway trust fund goes bust in 10 days. This is what is happening across the country. It is unreal that in my State we would have this bridge collapse, I say to my friends, and now commerce can't move between California and Arizona because we have had this collapse on Interstate 10. How strange this would be if this-- thank God no one lost their life in this accident. But this bridge was rated structurally obsolete, so we knew it couldn't bear all the traffic. It is a huge amount of traffic. So this is my poster child for why I am working so hard on this. I thank my Republican friends because they have really worked hard. Of course, I am looking at Bettina and Neil. I was talking to them at 11:30 last night, and in the leader's office we resolved the last couple of pressing issues, with his help. But we have to see the text. My friends on the other side want to see the text of the Iran agreement. This isn't exactly the same, but we do need to see the text. So I am urging everybody to get the text up as fast as possible so we can vote as soon as possible. This is a breakthrough, but we need to see the details. I thank Leader McConnell because this has been a difficult negotiation but I think one that is going to bear fruit in terms of millions of jobs and thousands of businesses in much better shape. Thank you very much. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Order of Business Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the cloture vote we were originally going to have at 2:15 p.m. will be pushed back several hours to 4 p.m. I will just add--in addition to the comments of the Senator from California--I wish to thank Senator Inhofe, who I think was in the Chamber. Mr. INHOFE. Right here. Mr. McCONNELL. Nobody has been a stronger advocate for a multiyear highway bill than the Senator from Oklahoma. In spite of the rather dramatic philosophical differences which exist between the Senator from California and the Senator from Oklahoma, when it comes to a transportation bill, they have been a remarkable team over the years. So I thank my chairman as well for an extraordinary contribution to all of this. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. I wish to say that working in concert with Senator Boxer has been a pleasure. A lot of times philosophically in this room here we disagree with each other, but then when it gets down to what we are supposed to be doing here--I have to remind people quite often that if you read the Constitution about what we are supposed to be doing here--I am talking about Members of the U.S. Senate--we are supposed to be defending America and roads and bridges. That is it. So this is by far the most important matter before us right now, now that we have the Defense bill behind us, and I look forward to making this a reality. The idea of a 6-year bill is very significant because without that we can't do the big projects. This morning on the floor with charts I showed all the different big, large structures, such as the Spence Bridge between Kentucky and Ohio. These are bridges and projects that have to be done, and there has to be a long-term bill in order to do that. I also shared this morning an experience that I had on the I-35 bridge that we put in through--the last major bill we had was in 2005. We put those repairs in there. That was in Oklahoma City. We actually had the death of a lady who was driving her three children under a bridge with concrete falling off. So we have to repair America, and this is the first step toward that repair. It is very important that we proceed to the bill. I would suggest to people that if you don't like it and if you plan to vote against it, that is fine, but bring it out here so we can discuss the merits, the demerits, and we can also start working on amendments. I would encourage any Member who is listening right now to bring amendments to the floor because when we proceed to the bill, I am going to be down here on the floor as long as we are in session, and I will be wanting to get to these amendments. It doesn't do any good to wait until the last minute and then show up and say ``I have an amendment'' on the day of passage of the bill. We will have deadlines. In order to get germane and nongermane amendments up for consideration, we have to have them down here, and if Members miss a deadline, then Members won't have that opportunity. So it is really up to the Members now to make sure that happens, but before we can get to that, the one thing that has to happen is we have to proceed to the bill. That has to be passed at 4 o'clock today. I yield the floor. ____________________ ORDER FOR RECESS Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess as under the previous order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page 11840]] ____________________ CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed. ____________________ RECESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate stands in recess until 2:15 p.m. Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:28 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Portman). Mrs. ERNST. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ CLOTURE MOTION Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call be waived. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The bill clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 19, H.R. 22, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans Administration from being taken into account for purposes of determining the employers to which the employer mandate applies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

On this vote, the yeas are 41, the nays are 56. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that many of our colleagues on the other side have voted against cloture at this particular point. They wanted to have further time to read the bill. I want everybody to understand that the text is filed, it is at the desk. There are detailed summaries available online on the EPW Committee Web site. As everyone knows, Senator Boxer, I, and others have been discussing this in great detail. I am hopeful that by tomorrow we will have cloture on the bill and an opportunity to go forward. Let me just say to everybody that I know I haven't threatened a Saturday session all year, but there will be a Saturday session and probably Sunday as well. Let me tell you why. We have a chance to achieve a multiyear, bipartisan highway bill. Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer reported out a 6-year bill. This is a 6-year bill. We have paid for the first 3 years. I believe our colleagues on the other side will find these pay-fors credible. They may not love every single one of them, but there is not a phony one in there. If we can get this bill over to the House, it is my belief they will take it up. Give the House of Representatives an opportunity to express itself on this bill. Imagine the scenario if we actually were able to produce a multiyear highway bill and get it to the President's desk for signature before the August recess. It is something we could all feel proud of. In my view, there has been outstanding bipartisan work on this, and so we need to keep at it, and that will require us, most definitely, to be here this weekend. ____________________ MORNING BUSINESS Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Democratic leader. ____________________ THE HIGHWAY BILL Mr. REID. Madam President, first, we all appreciate the work done by Senator McConnell and Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer has been tireless on this, as she is on everything. But we have an issue that I think we need to address. We received this bill, which is more than 1,000 pages, about an hour ago. I am going to have a caucus tomorrow, and I hope we will have an opportunity at that time to have reports from committees of jurisdiction. Committees of jurisdiction is more than just the Environment and Public Works Committee; finance is involved, commerce, banking, and other committees, of course, are interested. So we need the opportunity to look at this bill. This is a big bill with a lot of different sections in it dealing with a lot of different issues. We are not asking for anything unusual; we just want to be able to study the bill and talk about it in a private meeting tomorrow at 12 o'clock. Now, if we were doing something that was--``What are you talking about? You mean you want to read this?'' Please. I mean, we have pages of quotes from my friends. Senator Enzi said: That is what created this enormous outrage across America of: Did you read the bill? How can you read the bill if you have not seen anything in it, if it has not been given to you? I do not think it is intended to be given to us until we have to shuffle this thing through at the end [and not know what is in it]. Lamar Alexander, one of the most thoughtful people I have served with in government, said a couple of years ago: We want to make sure the American people have a chance to read it and they have a [[Page 11841]] chance to know exactly what it costs and they have a chance to know exactly how it affects them. That is not an unreasonable request, we don't think. That is the way the Senate works. That is our job. When it came to the Defense authorization bill, we spent a couple of weeks doing that. When it came to No Child Left Behind, the Education bill, we spent 7 weeks going through it. . . . The Homeland Security bill took 7 weeks. The Energy bill in 2002 took 8 weeks. A farm bill last year took 4 weeks. So we have a little reading to do, a little work to do. John McCain said: But could I also add, if we haven't seen it, don't you think we should have time to at least examine it? I mean, I don't think it would be outrageous to ask for a bill to be read that we haven't seen. I--as have a number of people in this body--have worked on highway bills in the past. We have worked on these bills, and they have taken weeks to get done. We are being presented with something here that basically says: You take this or leave it. That isn't the way it should work around here. I am going to do everything I can to move forward on a long-term highway bill. I want to get it done. But we are going to have to look at this and find out what my different committees think, what different Senators think, what people at home think. You know, I have a lot of people at home who are interested in what is in this bill. There is the banking provision. There are the pay-fors. I looked at them last week, but that has been a moving target also. The ranking member of our Finance Committee at this stage--unless he has learned something in the last half hour--doesn't know what the pay- fors are either. So, in short, we want to be as cooperative as we can, but we are not going to lurch into this legislation without having had a chance to read in detail this 1,030-page bill and, after having read it, to have a discussion within the caucus on this bill. We would be in a very difficult position if--as the Republican leader said, we are going to work over the weekend, which is fine. I have no problem with that. I have tried that myself a few times; it didn't work so well. But I am willing to be part of the deal here if we need to work this weekend to get it done. I don't know what the House plans to do, but we are assuming a lot, that the House is going to take up this bill. If they did, that would be wonderful, but I have to say that based on my conversation with the Democrats in the House, in conversations they have had with the Republican leadership over there, I don't think there is a chance in the world they are going to take up this bill. They have sent us a bill--a bill that is for 5 months, with conversations between the White House--not our Whitehouse but the President's White House--to come up with a long-term highway bill. Part of that is some consideration of the Export-Import Bank. I realize how important that is. I have been on this floor talking about how important that is. We have about 45 different countries that have, as we speak, ex-im banks that are working, that are taking away all of our business, so it is important that we get that done also. But we cannot let one get in the way of the other. It is not our fault--Democrats' fault--that we don't have an Ex- Im Bank bill. We didn't create the problems with Ex-Im having gone out of business. So I want to get a highway bill done and I want to get Ex-Im Bank done, but the Ex-Im Bank problem should not stand in the way of us getting a good, strong, robust highway bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my good friend the Democratic leader was saying as recently as a couple of weeks ago that we need to do a long-term highway bill. Well, Senator Boxer and I took him seriously. We have worked hard to come up with a bipartisan, multiyear, paid-for highway bill. The fact that it hasn't been online very long is a good argument, and our friends will have an opportunity to read every bit of it. I hope at that point they will find it attractive to move forward. As I have said for over I guess now something like 2 months, this bill is an opportunity for those who support the Ex-Im Bank to offer an amendment on that subject. So it is further complicated in terms of timing by the fact that the House of Representatives is leaving a week earlier than we are. I can't say with certainty that the House of Representatives will take up and pass a multiyear highway bill that doesn't raise the gas tax and is credibly paid for, but it is a lot more attractive, it strikes me, than a 6-month extension that we have to revisit again in December. I am hopeful that the House will take a look at what we have done on the Senate side on a bipartisan basis and find it very appealing. So we would like to work our way through this and we intend to work our way through it--including the weekend--to get what we believe is an important accomplishment for the country over to the House of Representatives so they can take a look at it, and maybe they will find it appealing as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if I could say to both leaders, whom I respect tremendously--and I agree with Leader Reid 99.9 percent of the time--this is the situation: We have a highway trust fund expiring, going bust, going broke, and, yes, we have to spend some time. You know, we have a lot of staff; we can divide this up--250 pages, 4 people. We have a summary. We have a summary of the bill out there for everybody, and we can just say we need 4 weeks or 6 weeks to look at it. The EPW piece, as my friend Senator Inhofe knows, has been out there for 3 months--not that long; at least 2 months. We haven't changed much in that. It has been out there, so that has been reviewed. All I want to say is this: If we could just keep our eye on the prize--and I understand that the way we proceed over here is important. That is why I voted no, not to go to a bill I wrote with Senator McConnell, because I agree with my leader completely. We need a chance to look at it. But I would submit that this isn't the first time we have ever done a highway bill. This is a little different from a health care bill in the sense that it is a highway bill. Most of it is very similar. I would say EPW builds off the old bill we had before, and most of the bills track older bills. I don't think it is going to be that hard for us to detail our staff to read it because--here is the problem--if we don't, we have 800,000 construction workers who are still not back to work, and we have 7 States that have stopped doing anything. So if we could just keep our eye on the prize, which is businesses being able to do what they want to do: build--I had a bridge collapse 2 days ago. You can't get from California to Arizona. So I hope that tomorrow we will be able to join with our friends and vote to proceed. If we don't like the bill, we will have three more opportunities to vote no. But I would love to get on this bill, get moving on it, and see if we can keep this economy moving in the right direction and not take a chance, as many economists said we will, if we don't do a long-term bill. I yield the floor. Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from California yield for a question? Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will. Mr. McCONNELL. My understanding is that the Senator and Chairman Inhofe have been discussing with people around the country who would benefit from this bill. Does the Senator have a sense of their enthusiasm for the product we have come up with? Mrs. BOXER. I do. As I shared with Leader Reid today, we have 68 organizations, from labor, to business, to general contractors. I have the list. They are asking us, begging us to move forward--the National Governors Association. It is really a broad-based number of organizations that don't agree all the time. I mean that the building trade doesn't often agree with the Chamber of Commerce, but they agree on this. So I think there is enthusiasm. Mr. McCONNELL. Would I be correct in saying they are less than enthusiastic about another short-term extension? Mrs. BOXER. They agree with those of us who have said that is a death by [[Page 11842]] a thousand cuts. We just can't keep on doing these short-term extensions. I would say this to the Republican leader. If you or I went to the bank to get a mortgage and the banker smiled and said that you get that mortgage, but it is only for 6 months or 5 months, you wouldn't buy the house. No one is going to build a new project or fix a bridge that has multiyear costs if they know the money could run out in 5 months or in the short term. Mr. McCONNELL. Would it also be correct, I ask the Senator from California, if we are fortunate enough to send a multiyear paid-for highway bill over to the House, that the same constituent groups that have had an interest in this and have indicated their enthusiasm to you would likely descend on the House and suggest that this might be something they ought to take a look at? Mrs. BOXER. I think there will be huge momentum if we are able to pass this in a bipartisan way; yes, I do. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have been listening carefully to what concerns people have, and I have to remind everyone that it was June 24--June 24--that we passed this bill out of committee. We had been working on this bill for months before that. All of us realize that between the last bill we had, which was a multiyear bill in 2005--that we then had a 5-year bill, and since that expired at the end of 2009, we have had nothing but extensions. Those extensions cost 30 percent off the top just because short-term extensions don't work. But we went ahead, and we passed a bill. The reason I am optimistic that if we can get this to the House they will sign it is because that wasn't a problem at all when it went to the House the last time. We showed them that the cost of the bill is far less--the conservative position. That was with 33 Members of the House on the transportation and infrastructure committee. So all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats on their committee voted for it. Those same Democrats and Republicans over there would support this. I think the reason they came out originally for a shorter term bill was to pack it in with some other things they wanted to get passed. But I have yet to talk to the first Member of the House who doesn't say: If you bring us a multiyear bill, we will sign it. So I think that is a moot statement. I think that will happen, and we are willing to stay here until it does happen. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman and the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee pointing out that the actual underlying authorization language in this legislation has been public information since June 24--June 24. The only thing that is a little different about this underlying bill--it is not as if this were air-dropped out of heaven, and it showed up on people's desks--is that Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Committee on Finance, and other committee chairmen on the commerce committee, EPW, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee have come up with a group of pay-fors to figure a way to pay for 3 years now of this underlying 6-year bill. So I think it is absolutely accurate to say that the good work being done by the Environment and Public Works Committee to pass a 6-year bill will be done when this bill is passed, but we have only been able to agree on 3 years of pay-fors. I wish we could have gone longer, but that is not bad considering our recent record with these temporary patches, which I agree is a terrible way to do business. So I congratulate the Senator from California and those who have worked to make this bill as good as it is, but I want to make another point. There are others who are arguing: Well, we shouldn't be doing this. We ought to be passing a temporary patch, and then we should be doing international tax reform and trying to come up with some additional revenue out of that process that will pay for a 6-year bill. Well, the fact of the matter is that nothing we will do with this bill precludes that good work from going forward. As a matter of fact, after 3 years of paying for this bill, at some point we are going to have to find a way to recharge the bill in order to complete the work that was first started in the underlying 6-year bill. So I don't want anybody to be under a misconception, because I think you might if you didn't know the context of thinking that all of a sudden this 1,000-page bill appeared on people's desks, and they do not know where it came from, and they do not know anything about its provenance or what it will actually do. The truth is very, very different. It is important, and I respect the fact, as the Senator from California has made the point, that people do need to get comfortable with the paperwork. But what we have tried to do is to come up with credible ways to pay for the bill that actually represents a consensus to pay for 3 years rather than this idea of a 6-month patch and hoping that somehow we will come up with the money in December for a 6-year bill. So while I regret this failed cloture vote, this bill does represent a significant step forward, and I am encouraged by what I have seen in terms of the bipartisan cooperation that allowed us to make progress on a number of contentious matters so far this year, and I thank the minority whip for his good work on this as well. We passed an education bill. We passed trade promotion authority. It was not universally popular on both sides, but this was a priority for the President and I think something that represents a step forward for our economy, opening markets for the things we raise and grow and the things we make in this country. We have done a number of important things that I hope begin to regain the public's trust and confidence that we are actually able to function and that even though we have very different ideas about how to get to a conclusion, we can actually find common ground and make some progress. In my State in particular--Texas being a large State--the Texas A&M Transportation Institute estimates that by the year 2020, 8.4 billion hours will be spent waiting in traffic--8.4 billion hours. Of course, that also means that 4 billion gallons of gas will be wasted in the process. Imagine the pollution, not to mention the heartburn associated with congestion on our highways and roadways. We are, thank goodness, a fast-growing State relative to the rest of the country. We are a big State. We need the transportation infrastructure to keep our economy moving and to create jobs and economic growth. So I am confident we can work in a bipartisan manner to address what I hope is just a temporary obstacle and avoid these patches that kick the can down the road and provide no predictability or planning ability so these long-term projects can be initiated and completed. I would just point out the fact that Texas has not waited on the Federal Government in order to deal with its transportation needs. Last November, by an overwhelming 4-to-1 margin, Texans approved a ballot initiative that provided an additional $1.7 billion to upgrade and maintain our transportation network. So I congratulate our leaders at the State level who have taken the initiative to begin to make that downpayment on upgrading and maintaining our transportation network, but estimates are we need as much as $5 billion in order to do that. So this represents just a downpayment. We need to pass the Federal highway bill in order to complete our work. As I pointed out, our State has currently about 27 million people. By 2040, it is estimated to reach as many as 45 million people. So we need this infrastructure, but we are not alone. We are not unique in that sense. Every State needs transportation infrastructure to keep people and goods moving in order to continue to grow our economy because a growing economy creates jobs and opportunity, and the one thing we need in this country is a growing economy. [[Page 11843]] Last year, in 2014, the Texas economy grew at 5.2 percent. The U.S. economy grew at 2.2 percent. That is why, because of that 3-point differential, we have created more jobs in Texas--or seen jobs created by the private sector, I should say--than anywhere else in the country. If we fail to pass a multiyear transportation bill, if we somehow decide to shoot ourselves in the foot and fail in this important effort, we will have only ourselves to blame, and we will be contributing to the problem rather than contributing to the solution. The resources provided for in this legislation will help relieve urban congestion, upgrade rural routes, and improve the overall safety and efficiency of our highways. It is something our friends across the aisle just a few short weeks ago said they wanted. They said they were worried about this impending deadline coming up where we needed to do something, and they were predicting that perhaps we would just have another patch. They called for a longer term highway bill. So I would urge our colleagues to take yes for an answer. Thanks to the good work done by Chairman Hatch of the Committee on Finance and a lot of work on a bipartisan basis across the aisle, we have actually come up with enough money--enough legitimate pay-fors--to pass a 3-year transportation bill with the prospect, if we can come up with some additional funds through international tax reform, to backfill the final 3 years. So nothing here actually precludes that effort. Nothing cuts that off. This is, I think, part of doing our basic job as Members of the Congress. It is not particularly attractive or sexy or interesting, but it is about competence, it is about doing our job, and it is about putting the American people's interests first. So I hope by tomorrow our colleagues will have had a chance to satisfy themselves and understand the pay-fors in this bill, recognizing that most of this information has been out there in the public domain for a long, long time. I am not asking them to like it, I am not asking them to fall in love with the pay-fors, but I am asking them to let us go forward and to let the Senate be the Senate. Let people offer their ideas, hopefully get votes on constructive suggestions, eventually pass this legislation, and send it over to the House, where I predict, if it comes out of the Senate with a good strong vote, our friends in the House will take it up and pass it and send it to the President, and we will have fulfilled our responsibility. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me add my voice to this bipartisan chorus. It is embarrassing to the United States of America that we are now in the midst of our 33rd short-term extension of the highway trust fund. This 60-day extension ends in 10 days. It is true and the Senator from Texas is correct that many of us have come to the floor and said this is beneath the dignity of a great nation--that we cannot invest in our own economy, in our own business growth. Building the highways and bridges and the mass transit that sustains a great nation takes a determined long-term effort. Now, there are those--not on our side of the aisle, but there are those--who question whether the Federal Government should be involved in this at all. The so-called devolution movement argues, I understand, that this really should be a State and local matter: Get the Federal Government out of the business of planning the transportation grid for America. I have three words for those people who believe that: Dwight David Eisenhower, a Republican President who, in the 1950s, had the vision and determination, once he had seen the autobahn in Germany, to say that the United States of America needs an interstate highway system for its national defense. That is how he sold it. He sold it to a bipartisan Congress, and we have lived with that benefit ever since. Our generation and even those before us have inherited the vision of that President and Members of Congress who said: Let us invest in the long-term development of America. Think about your own home State and what interstate highways mean to your economy. In my State, if you are a town lucky enough to live next to an interstate, you are bound to have a good economy. And if you are blessed with the intersection of two interstates, hold on tight, because the opportunities are limitless. So that generation 60 years ago had a vision. The question is, Do we have a vision? We certainly don't with 60-day extensions with the highway trust fund. That is why when Senator McConnell on the Republican side offered a long-term approach, 3 years--I wish it were 6--but 3 years actually paid for, I believe we should take it seriously. One Senator among us, Senator Boxer of California, did. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Barbara Boxer rolled up her sleeves and started negotiating, crafting an agreement. How about this for an assignment. We said to Senator Boxer: Come up with a long-term highway trust fund bill, get it through four different committees to the satisfaction of at least the majority of the 45 other Democratic Senators, work out your differences, and report to us in 10 days. She did. I have to give credit to her, as big as this bill may be--and by Senate standards it is one of the larger ones--it was an undertaking she took seriously and we should take seriously too. Now that we have the bill, there is no excuse. There is plenty of time to read this. Don't believe that every word on every page is valuable, but let's go through it carefully and make sure we understand completely what we are doing before we vote. That was the cloture vote we had earlier today. When I went home over this weekend and called leaders in my State--I called the CEOs of two major corporations, I called the labor unions, I called the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and they were over the moon and happy with the notion that we are finally going to come up with at least a 3-year highway trust fund bill. I will be reading this carefully. In the course of reading it, I hope I can come to the conclusion that this is the right answer to move us forward to build our infrastructure for the next generation. ____________________ NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, when President Obama came to office, he looked out at the threats across America, and there were four hard- target threats: Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. The situation in Iran was particularly worrisome because there was a recurrent belief that Iran was developing nuclear weapons. I have heard critics ask: Well, what difference would it make? How foolish would it be for Iran to launch a nuclear weapon against anyone? Every nuclear weapon that is launched has a return address, and that country will pay dearly for a reckless decision such as that. But the fear the President had and we shared was that if Iran developed a nuclear weapon in the Middle East, it would trigger an arms race, and many other countries in that volatile region of the world would then seek to develop their own nuclear weapons and the potential conflagration was incredible. There was also a concern that one of the first targets of Iran would be our close ally and friend, the nation of Israel. It is easy to reach that conclusion when you read and hear the rhetoric of the rightwing in Iran, which will not even recognize Israel's right to exist. President Obama set out to do something about it. It was clear from our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan that sending in American troops was something that had to be thought about long and hard. We have the best military in the world, but let's face it, what we faced in Iraq with roadside bombs maimed and killed so many American soldiers that we realized this new world of asymmetric military confrontation didn't guarantee that the best military in the world would have an easy time of it. We ended up with almost 5,000 casualties in Iraq and nearly 3,000 now in Afghanistan, and Afghanistan turned out [[Page 11844]] to be the longest war in U.S. history. This President and the American people were reluctant to face another military confrontation. This President made a decision. I have talked to him about it. He decided every leader from every country who came in to see him would be asked to join in an effort to impose sanctions on Iran to bring them to the negotiating table over the issue of their nuclear capability. The President put together an incredible coalition because we learned long ago unilateral sanctions are not worth much, but if you can bring many nations around the world into a common purpose of putting the pressure on a country, it can have a positive impact. The coalition the President put together was amazing; witness the negotiations themselves where China and Russia were sitting at the same side of the table as the United States and the European Union--England and France--and many other countries joined us in imposing these economic sanctions when they had little to gain and a lot to lose when it came to the oil resources of Iran. The President's determination to put the sanctions on Iran was for the purpose of bringing them to the negotiating table. That diplomatic gathering would literally have been the first meeting in 35 years between Iran and the United States, representing that period of time when our relationship with Iran had reached its lowest possible point. At this point, the goal of the negotiation was very clear: stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. How real was the threat that they were developing such a weapon? If you go back in time and read the quotes from the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, for years--more than 10 years--he has been warning that the Iranians were close to developing a nuclear weapon. It was a matter of weeks, months, a year at the most by most of his estimates. Of course, Israel, more concerned than most about the nuclear threat, warned the world of what would happen if Iran developed a nuclear weapon. Last week, after lengthy negotiations, the President announced with Iran and the others who sat at the table--P5+1, as they are known in shorthand--that they had reached an agreement with Iran. It was interesting to watch the reaction of Members of Congress. There were some Members of Congress who condemned that agreement before it was even released to the public. You see, 47 Members of the other side in the Senate had sent a letter to the Ayatollah in Iran during the course of negotiations, before any agreement was reached, warning him and his nation not to negotiate with this President of the United States. That was unprecedented. That had never happened before in American history--when a political party reached out to a sworn enemy of the United States and gave them advice not to speak to our leader. That letter went on to say that even though you think you reached an agreement between Iran and the United States, don't be misled; ultimately, Congress would have the last word on that agreement. It was no surprise in that environment that so many Senators and Congressmen from the other side of the aisle instantaneously condemned this agreement. Some of us decided to take a little time and perhaps reflect on it, read it, and reach out to people who were involved in it. I took last week to read the 100-plus pages of this agreement and to talk further to our Nation's top experts, including the Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, Secretary of State John Kerry, and others, about this agreement, hoping I could come to understand exactly what was being offered by way of stopping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. I am under no illusions about the Iranian regime. Its support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas is well documented, its abysmal human rights record is well known, and its brutal suppression of its own people during the 2009 election in Iran is well documented. Iran also continues to hold a number of Americans on outrageous charges, including Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and the Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian. I joined a few years ago, in 2007, with Republican Senator Gordon Smith in introducing the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act--key components of which became the basis for a strict petroleum sanctions regime that helped bring Iran to the negotiating table. I voted for all the key sanctions bills against Iran, and I have tried to be a consistent voice for increasing military assistance to Israel. When I chaired the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I was proud to double the Iron Dome funding request of Israel for their own defense of their nation. The agreement before us is a comprehensive solution to the nuclear weapons issue with Iran. Without a nuclear weapon to embolden Iran, the agreement allows the United States and its allies to better deter Iran's destabilizing actions. Let's take a reflective moment and look at the history--recent history--in the United States. Strong leaders and nations such as the United States meet and talk to their enemies and negotiate when it is in their national interest. It was John Kennedy who said: ``We should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate.'' These kinds of negotiations aren't an example of weakness but in most cases are an example of strength, and sometimes the benefits aren't obvious immediately; they are realized over time. It is simply common sense. It has been the practice of this Nation, America, for generations, regardless of who is President, to meet and try to negotiate for a more peaceful world. Throughout our history, American leaders have successfully and aggressively used diplomacy, Presidents of both political parties. In 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis. We faced the prospect of a nuclear war, a standoff with the nation, where we knew and they knew they had the capacity to detonate a nuclear weapon in the United States. Few realize how close we came to a nuclear confrontation. There were many hawks in Washington during President John Kennedy's administration who said let's take them on. Some even suggested a full invasion of Cuba, but John Kennedy wisely pursued a careful balance of strength and diplomacy, using a blockade and negotiations to bring us back from the brink. Few people knew the Kennedy administration was secretly negotiating with the Soviets while the Cuban Missile Crisis was unfolding, and ultimately President Kennedy agreed to remove American nuclear-armed Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy as part of an agreement that Soviet Premier Khrushchev remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba. Are we going to say now in reflection that John Kennedy should never have negotiated during this crisis because the Soviets were out to destabilize the world and to spread communism? Let's not forget when John Kennedy entered into this negotiation, the Soviet Union had not only placed nuclear missiles in Cuba--they were in the process of placing them--but it was occupying Eastern Europe and trying to spread communism around the world. The bloody Korean war, where my two brothers served in the U.S. Navy, was a war in which the Soviets helped the North Koreans against the United States. Yet we sat down and negotiated with the Soviet Union. Fast forward a few years. In 1972, then-President Nixon traveled to Communist Red China to begin establishing normalized relations. China wasn't a friend of the United States. It was a key supporter of the North Vietnamese, who were ruthlessly fighting and killing U.S. forces in Vietnam at that same time. In fact, during Nixon's visit with then-Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, China was sending more weapons to the North Vietnamese. This was happening even while Nixon was asking China to end its support for the North Vietnamese. China's regime was also fomenting Communist revolutionary movements [[Page 11845]] in Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand--all against the U.S. interests. Domestically, in China, Chinese leader Mao Zedong had persecuted millions of his own people as part of the brutal Cultural Revolution. I recognize, as President Nixon did then, that it is hard to enter into negotiations with a regime as nefarious as China, and just as with Iran today, many conservatives denounced Republican President Nixon for doing so. However, as China's sphere of influence grew and relations between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorated, many in both parties--including President Nixon--recognized it was time to change. Nelson Rockefeller, President Nixon's rival for the Republican nomination in 1968, called for more contact and communication. It was former Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat, who proposed the building of bridges to the people of mainland China. Then-Senator Ted Kennedy recognized President Nixon's diplomatic efforts toward China as a ``magnificent gesture.'' Other Members of the Democratic-controlled Congress agreed. There was a time when foreign policy was bipartisan. There was a time when Democrats would speak up defending a Republican President, even when the most conservative Members of his own party were condemning him. Over time, President Nixon's decision paid dividends in America's interest. China moderated its foreign policy and established better relations with our country. These relations aren't perfect, but we know we made progress and we are in negotiations. China sat with us on the same side of the table trying to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. More recently in the late 1980s, President Ronald Reagan began discussions with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on the possibility of nuclear arms reductions. It was inconceivable when those talks started in October of 1986 that they could really negotiate. Who would imagine that these two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, with thousands of nuclear warheads pointed at one another, could actually sit down and reach an agreement limiting the use of nuclear weapons? The Cold War was far from over at that time. In 1979 Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan and continued to attempt to spread communism. That led President Carter to halt efforts to negotiate the SALT II Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty. The list of Soviet aggression at that moment in time was lengthy. Yet it was President Ronald Reagan who said he would sit down and negotiate with the Soviet Union. I have an excerpt here from the January 17, 1988, New York Times about the opposition Ronald Reagan faced in negotiating an arms agreement with the Soviet Union. It may sound familiar to what we are hearing today about President Obama's efforts in Iran. Already, right-wing groups . . . have mounted a strong campaign against the INF treaty. They have mailed out close to 300,000 letters opposing it. They have circulated 5,000 cassette recordings of Gen. Bernard Rogers, former Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, attacking it. And finally, they are preparing to run newspaper ads this month savaging Reagan as a new Neville Chamberlain, signing an accord with Hitler and gullibly predicting ``peace for our time.'' These were conservative Republican critics of President Ronald Reagan, who was negotiating with the Soviet Union to try to limit the spread of nuclear weapons and was being likened to Neville Chamberlain. Does that sound familiar? In May of 1987, the conservative National Review magazine had a cover with the title ``Reagan's Suicide Pact.'' President Reagan eventually agreed with then-Secretary of State Schultz that arms control could and would improve U.S. national security. In December of 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, committing the two superpowers to eliminate all of their nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. This treaty, the Reagan-Gorbachev Soviet Union arms control treaty, was one of the first to rely on extensive onsite negotiations for verification. Do you remember who coined the phrase ``trust but verify''? It was Ronald Reagan in his negotiations with the Soviet Union. It took 5 months after Ronald Reagan reached this agreement for this Chamber to vote 93 to 5 in favor of that treaty at a time when the Democrats had a majority. I could go through the long list of Democratic Senators who supported President Ronald Reagan in his efforts to try to create a more peaceful world. Ultimately, because of that agreement, more than 2,000 short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missiles were destroyed. Our relationship with the Soviet Union didn't improve overnight, and we certainly still have our problems with them today. But going back to what I said earlier, the Russians sat on the same side of the table as the United States in this negotiation for this agreement to end the threat, or at least delay the threat, of nuclear power and nuclear weapons in Iran. Imagine if 47 Senators, during the course of Ronald Reagan's negotiation with Gorbachev, had written in the middle of those negotiations to Mr. Gorbachev and said: Ignore President Ronald Reagan; don't negotiate with him because we are not going to accept it here in Congress. If that had happened, there would have been cries of treason for sending that kind of letter. It didn't happen. Those were the days when there was a bipartisan approach to foreign policy in the United States. Today we have a chance and an opportunity with Iran that hasn't presented itself for more than 30 years--the opportunity to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It is not going to solve all the problems with Iran overnight, but it does solve, I believe, one critical problem. The agreement retains U.S. freedom of action to counter Iran in any part of the world. After all, if Ronald Reagan didn't stop trying to counter Soviet actions after negotiating an arms treaty with Gorbachev, President Obama will not and should not stop working to diminish Iran's influence after this agreement. I am under no illusions that for some period Iran did pursue a nuclear bomb. If that had happened, it would have been disastrous. And I am under no illusions that Iran lied in the past about these efforts. I know they did. But the agreement reached last week provides unprecedented safeguards and inspections to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons now or in the future. The United States and its allies are strong enough to enter into this agreement, not because Iran is suddenly trustworthy or an open democracy but because it serves our national security interests to do it. Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, and Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman negotiated this agreement with a single focus: Prevent Iran from getting any closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon. They achieved that goal, and that is why I am supporting this effort by the President to bring a more stable and peaceful situation to the Middle East. To appreciate the magnitude of their challenge, let's step back and take stock of Iran's nuclear weapons program as it is today before this agreement goes in place. Iran currently has enough nuclear material to make 10 nuclear weapons. It has more than 19,000 centrifuges, many of which are more advanced and powerful. Immediately prior to the interim agreement with the P5+1, Iran was enriching its uranium to 20 percent. The breakout time--the time it would take for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon--was estimated to be 3 months. It was an incredibly large and dangerous nuclear capability, growing at a significant rate, and virtually unconstrained. That is what this President inherited from the previous administration. But thanks to this effort, this agreement cuts off every single one of Iran's potential pathways to a bomb. It shrinks major portions of their nuclear infrastructure. It eliminates many parts of it. It extends the breakout time to at least 1 year. Should Iran renege on this and decide they are going [[Page 11846]] forward with a nuclear weapon, we believe that under this agreement it will take them at least a year to achieve it--a year in which we can put pressure and more, if necessary. The agreement reduces Iran's uranium stockpile by 98 percent, cuts its number of centrifuges by more than two-thirds, and for the next 15 years, caps its enrichment at 3.67 percent. It prevents Iran's underground facility at Fordow from being used for uranium enrichment. Iran is required to change its heavy water reactor at Arak so that it can no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium. How will we know? Because we are helping to design and to monitor the fuel in and out of this facility and verifying it every step of the way. All of us have deep suspicions about Iran's nuclear ambitions, and we should. What if they try to build a secret facility? Well, our negotiating team, led by an extraordinary man, Secretary of Energy Moniz, designed a verification plan with no exits. Our team thought long and hard over the last 2 years about how we might be able to stop cheating. For every potential technique, they embedded a countermeasure in the text of the agreement. This weekend Secretary Moniz explained that it would be ``virtually impossible'' to hide nuclear activities under this agreement. It is the strongest nuclear verification system ever imposed on a peaceful nation. Its end result is that Iran will not be able to do anything of significance without being caught. And going back to Ronald Reagan, our inspectors will be on the ground. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator's time has expired. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. This agreement requires the IAEA to have 24/7 access to all of Iran's declared nuclear facilities. This means in-person inspectors, remote cameras, tamperproof seals--all of the world's most sophisticated detection technologies. As one nuclear expert commented last week, ``If a rat enters a nuclear facility [in Iran], we will know it.'' Critically, this intrusive monitoring goes all the way into the nuclear supply chain, from uranium mines to centrifuge production. We cover it all in this agreement. It will allow IAEA inspectors to follow every ounce of uranium from the ground to its final destination, and every piece of nuclear infrastructure from its creation to its use. If Iran tries to divert anything to a covert facility, we will know. This agreement also sets up a dedicated procurement channel. Any dual-use item Iran wants to purchase from the international community must go through this channel. The U.S. and its allies have a veto over such purchases. It makes it almost impossible for Iran to import anything of benefit to a nuclear weapons program. Lastly, Iran must also abide by the Additional Protocol forever. This allows the IAEA to have access to non-nuclear sites in a timely fashion, in as little as 2 hours. The agreement also requires any disputes over access to these non-nuclear sites to be resolved in short order. If not, Iran would be in violation of its commitments and sanctions could quickly snap back. Critics have complained about the time period our nuclear experts negotiated. But as Secretary Moniz and many others with Ph.D.'s have pointed out, uranium has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. It doesn't disappear like invisible ink. It cannot be cleaned up in a matter of weeks. If Iran cheats, we will know. President Reagan was correct to negotiate with the Soviets when there were strategic openings and President Obama is doing the same thing with the Iranians. The potential benefits of this deal are too significant, and the costs of not doing so too high, to just walk away. If we walked away, the international sanctions regime would crumble and Iran would have few if any restrictions on its program. Imposing more sanctions or simply bombing Iran today would create an even greater security risk to the region. In fact, if we bombed Iran today, it would almost certainly withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and kick out inspectors. As soon as that happens, Iran's nationalistic backlash would almost assure that the regime would build a nuclear bomb. Over the longer term, if Iran were to fail or cheat despite its international commitment, we retain the right to use military force and we would be in a much better position internationally to do so. And accepting this deal does nothing to stop the U.S. and allied efforts from countering Iran's behavior elsewhere in the world. Key sanctions on Iran's support for terrorist groups will remain in place. Our support for regional allies will remain strong, if not stronger. And, critically, an Iran determined to destabilize parts of the Middle East with a nuclear weapon in its arsenal, will no longer be an option. No doubt this is why some 60 of the most respected names in foreign policy, Democrats and Republicans alike, recently wrote in support of this agreement. Those signing included Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Secretary of Defense William Perry; Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill; National Security Advisors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft; Under Secretaries of State Nicholas Burns and Thomas Pickering; U.S. Ambassadors Ryan Crocker and Stuart Eizenstat; U.S. Senators Tom Daschle, Carl Levin, George Mitchell, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, and many others. We should do the same and support this agreement in the Senate. I see the Senator from South Dakota is here, and I will wrap up. Let me conclude. When I sat down to read this agreement--and I don't know how many of my colleagues have--I was struck on the third page with this statement in the agreement with Iran: Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapon. That is quite a statement. It was our goal at this negotiation. Do I believe it? Some, but I have my doubts. That is why we had to have an inspections regime from the Iranian mines right through the production facilities. That is why we had to dramatically cut back on their capacity to build weapons-grade fuel, and that is why this agreement is now--most of the countries believe--moving us in the right direction in Iran. There are critics. We heard a lot of them here in the Senate. There isn't a single critic who has stepped up with a better idea. They said: Well, let's go back to the sanctions regime. The countries that joined us in that sanctions regime did it to bring Iran to the negotiating table, and it worked. They now have an agreement they believe in and we should believe in too. To think that we are going to renew sanctions or place unilateral sanctions--that to me is not likely to occur if Iran lives up to the terms of this agreement. I will add the other alternative. We know the cost of war. We know it in human lives, we know it in the casualties that return, and we know it in the cost to the American people. Given a choice between the invasion of Iran or working in a diplomatic fashion toward a negotiation so we can lessen this threat in the world, I think President Obama made the right choice. I support this administration's decision to go forward with this agreement. I will be adding my vote to the many in the Senate in the hopes that we can see a new day dawning and in the hopes too that like President Nixon and President Reagan and even like other Presidents before us who have sat down to negotiate with our enemies, at the end of the day we will be a safer and stronger nation because of it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota. ____________________ THE HIGHWAY BILL Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I will speak about the Iran nuclear agreement in just a moment. But before I do that, I will briefly talk about the legislation before us on the floor, and that [[Page 11847]] is the reauthorization of the highway bill, which is something we have to do on a fairly regular basis around here. Every so many years the authority to spend out of the highway trust fund expires, and we can't fund the infrastructure needs that our country has in terms of roads, bridges, construction, maintenance, and all of those things that are so important to our competitive economy. This week we have an opportunity to do something that hasn't been done around here in a long time, and that is to fund a multiyear highway bill. The reason that is important is because people who rely upon highway funding that comes through the highway trust fund need to be able to make plans. State departments of transportation, those who are involved in the construction, such as contractors, and all the people who are involved and the jobs that are associated with this process need the certainty that comes with a long-term bill. Today I was told that there have been 33 short-term extensions over the last few years since the last long-term highway bill was passed, I believe, somewhere around the 2005 timeframe. I was part of that. I was a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee at the time. I worked on highway bills as far back as my days in the House of Representatives, when I served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. This is something that we have to do here on a regular basis if we are going to ensure that we have a competitive infrastructure in this country suitable to moving people and goods in a way that keeps our economy moving forward and growing. That is why, in my view, when we have an opportunity to get a multiyear bill, we shouldn't pass on it. If we continue to pass 6-month and 1-year extensions, all we are simply doing is kicking the can down the road. I would say that 33 short-term extensions is not a very good way to run a railroad and certainly not a very good way to run a highway program. I know there are going to be differences. The committee that I chair, the commerce committee, was involved with marking up portions of the highway bill that pertained to highway safety and some railroad provisions and other items that would be included in this bill. We worked on that through the weekend, and I think we addressed many of the concerns that Members on both sides had, and I feel very good about where that part of the bill is. I worked as a member of the Finance Committee and tried to find ways to pay for this. If we can get a multiyear bill in place that provides the certainty, the predictability, and the reliability that we need in our highway funding process in this country, it would be a very good thing. As we all know, it is incredibly important to economic growth and to jobs. The certainty that comes with a long-term bill is something that we all ought to strive for. So I hope, notwithstanding the differences that exist in the vote we had earlier, that tomorrow when we take up this legislation again we will get the votes that are necessary to proceed to the bill and begin to move forward with the process in the hopes that we might get something to the House that they might be able to act on and then we can get it to the President's desk. Then, at least for the foreseeable future, we can get this issue dealt with so we don't have to come back and do this every 6 months or every 3 months or whatever those 33 extensions have consisted of over the past few years. ____________________ NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, former President Jimmy Carter was recently asked about President Obama's successes on the world stage. He said in response: I think they've been minimal. . . . [O]n the world stage, just to be as objective about it as I can, I can't think of many nations in the world where we have a better relationship now than we did when he took over. He went on to say: If you look at Russia, if you look at England, if you look at China, if you look at Egypt and so forth--I'm not saying it's his fault--but we have not improved our relationship with individual countries and I would say that the United States influence and prestige and respect in the world is probably lower now than it was six or seven years ago. That is former President Jimmy Carter describing current President Obama's foreign policies. Unfortunately, that is an accurate assessment of President Obama's rocky history on foreign policy. Last week's deal with Iran does not look likely to improve the President's record of minimal success on the world stage. Last week the administration announced that the United States--along with five other nations--had reached an agreement with Iran that the administration claims will prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The contents of the agreement, however, were met with skepticism and concern from a number of quarters. Former Senator and Democratic Presidential candidate Jim Webb said that the deal sends a signal that ``we, the United States, are accepting the eventuality that they will acquire a nuclear weapon.'' The senior Senator from New Jersey said, ``The bottom line is: The deal doesn't end Iran's nuclear program--it preserves it.'' The Washington Post noted that Tehran ``fought for, and won, some troubling compromises'' on inspections, especially considering Iran's record of violations. The Post also pointed out what many Republicans have noted--that ``Mr. Obama settled for terms far short of those he originally aimed for.'' Israel, the only functioning democracy in the Middle East, called this deal a ``historic mistake,'' and neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia expressed concern that this agreement may actually increase the threat Iran poses to their security. Then, of course, there was Iran's reaction. Iran's President hailed the agreement, while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised negotiators. Lest anyone think this marked a softening of Iran's attitude toward the United States, however, Khamenei emphasized that ``our policy toward the arrogant U.S. government won't change at all.'' Echoing the chants coming from the people, he stated, ``You heard `Death to Israel,' `Death to the U.S.' . . . we ask Almighty God to accept these prayers by the people of Iran.'' These are not the words of a reliable partner. These are the words of the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. There is good reason to be concerned about this agreement. This deal not only fails to provide reassurance that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon, it may actually enhance Iran's chances of acquiring a bomb. For starters, this deal fails to include any adequate method of verifying that Iran is complying with the agreement. Time and time again, Iran has made it clear that it cannot be trusted to comply with any deal. Iran has a history of building nuclear facilities in secret. The enrichment facility at Fordow, which will remain in place as part of this agreement, is just one example of an enrichment facility that was originally hidden from the outside world. The fact that Iran cannot be relied on to follow the outlines of an agreement means that verification--specifically, ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections of suspicious sites--is an essential part of any credible deal. But the final deal that emerged doesn't come close to ensuring anytime, anywhere inspections. It does provide for 24/7 inspections of Iran's currently known nuclear sites, but it forces inspectors to request access to any other site they deem suspicious. Iran can refuse requests, and appealing those refusals could take close to a month, leaving the Iranians plenty of time to hide evidence of suspicious activity. Forcing Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure and halt uranium enrichment would have provided some assurance that Iran's quest for a bomb had been halted. But the nuclear agreement the administration helped reach doesn't require Iran to dismantle any of its nuclear infrastructure. The agreement does require Iran to take [[Page 11848]] some of its centrifuges offline, but they do not have to be removed or dismantled--simply put into storage. The agreement also explicitly allows Iran to continue enriching uranium. While it prohibits Iran from enriching uranium to the level required for a nuclear weapon, the restriction is of limited value considering that Iran retains the equipment and production capacity it would need to build a bomb. I haven't even mentioned other areas of concern with this agreement. In exchange for Iran's agreeing to--supposedly--stop its effort to acquire a nuclear weapon, billions of dollars in Iranian assets will be unfrozen and the sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy will be lifted. Right now, despite its struggling economy, Iran manages to provide funding and other support to Syria's oppressive government, to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, to Houthi rebels in Yemen, and to militias in Iraq. It is not hard to imagine what it will do with the billions of dollars it will gain access to under this agreement. The deal negotiators reached with Iran will also expand Iranian access to conventional weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are generally used as a vehicle for the delivery of nuclear weapons. While the deal does temporarily extend restrictions on the import of these weapons, it does so for just 5 years in the case of conventional weapons and for just 8 years in the case of ballistic missiles. That means that in as few as 8 years, Iran will be able to purchase a ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. Obviously, there is a lot to be concerned about when it comes to this deal, and after the agreement was released last week, both Democrats and Republicans expressed the desire to examine those provisions and hear from members of the administration. So what did the President do? He declared that the agreement was a triumph of diplomacy and took immediate action to send the bill to the United Nations for a vote. That is right. The President didn't wait to hear from Members of Congress or the American people; he just went ahead and asked the United Nations for its approval. In other words, the President unilaterally committed the United States to supporting the deal without knowing whether the United States Congress or the American people are in favor of the agreement. This is especially disappointing considering that just 2\\1/2\\ months ago, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted overwhelmingly to require that the President submit full details of any nuclear agreement to Congress before it could be agreed to. The President signed this legislation--the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act--into law on May 22, but apparently he feels free to ignore the spirit, if not the letter, of the act. When word emerged that the President was going to send a resolution directly to the U.N. without waiting for the American people or Congress to weigh in, both Democrats and Republicans asked the President to hold off. Democrats who requested that the President wait to submit the agreement included the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who characterized the White House's decision as ``somewhat presumptuous,'' and the Democratic whip in the House of Representatives, who said, ``I believe that waiting to go to the United Nations until such time as Congress has acted would be consistent with the intent and substance of the Nuclear Agreement Review Act.'' Circumventing elected Members of Congress to gain the U.N.'s approval before Congress has had a chance to review the agreement suggests that the President has a higher regard for the United Nation's opinion than for the opinion of the American people. President Obama is apparently betting on the chance that in 10 years' time, Iran's views toward the rest of the world will have changed and will no longer be seeking death to Israel and America or furthering terrorism in the Middle East. It is a nice notion, but nothing in Iran's history of terrorism, violence, and deceit suggests it is a scenario that is likely to come to pass. And if it doesn't happen, as a result of this agreement, Iran will be in a much better position to develop a nuclear weapon than it is today, as even the supporters of this deal acknowledge, not to mention that Iran will be in a position to purchase the missiles necessary to deliver nuclear weapons to locations in the Middle East and beyond. During negotiations on this deal, it became obvious that the President was determined to make reaching an agreement with Iran his legacy. It is possible that he will get his wish, but it may not be the legacy he wanted. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, as he has suffered through a considerable number of them, this is the 107th time I have come to the floor to urge my colleagues to wake up to the threat of climate change. All over the United States, State by State by State, we are already seeing the real effects of carbon pollution. We see it in our atmosphere, we see it in our oceans, and we see it in our weather, in habitats, and in species. The American people see it. Two-thirds of Americans, including half of Republicans, favor government action to reduce global warming, and two-thirds, including half of Republicans, would be more likely to vote for a candidate who campaigns on fighting climate change. Polling from the Florida Atlantic University shows that more than 73 percent of U.S. Hispanics--a pretty key voting block--think global warming is a serious problem. Sixty-two percent of Republican Hispanics are concerned about this. And I have said this before: If you ask Republican voters under the age of 35, they will tell us that climate denial is ``out of touch,'' ``ignorant,'' or ``crazy.'' Those are the words they selected in the poll--not my words. So we might expect Presidential hopefuls to incorporate climate action into their campaign platforms. We might expect the Republican candidates to address this problem in an honest and straightforward manner. But we would be wrong. What have we seen from the Presidential hopefuls? These candidates avoid any serious talk of climate change even as their own home States face climate and ocean disruptions. So in the weeks ahead, I will take a look at the Presidential candidates on climate change and what is up in their home States. Today I will look at Florida, home to 20 million Americans, including two of the top Republican Presidential candidates. A swing State with 29 electoral votes, Florida is a major political prize. Florida is also ground zero for climate change. With over 1,200 miles of coastline, Florida is uniquely vulnerable, for instance, to sea level rise. So what do Florida's two Presidential candidates have to say about climate change? Well, it seems they are not sure. ``I don't think the science is clear of what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural. It's convoluted,'' says former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. ``[T]here's never been a moment where the climate is not changing,'' says Florida's junior Senator. ``The question is: what percentage of that . . . is due to human activity?'' Scientists tell us that warming is ``unequivocal''--that is a strong word for scientists to use, unequivocal--and that human activity is the dominant cause of the changes we have seen--indeed, the only plausibly valid explanation. Both Presidential hopefuls from Florida have invoked the now classic denial line ``I am not a scientist.'' Well, good [[Page 11849]] thing, then, that we are not elected to be scientists. We are elected to listen to them. And if these two Floridians were listening to their own best scientists, they would learn a lot. In fact, 42 scientists from Florida colleges and universities wrote an open letter to Florida State officials. ``It is crucial for policymakers to understand,'' they wrote, ``that human activity is affecting the composition of the atmosphere which will lead to adverse effects on human economies, health and well being''--not so convoluted after all. The letter continued: The problem of climate change is not a hypothetical. Thousands of scientists have studied the issue from a variety of angles and disciplines over many decades. Those of us signing this statement have spent hundreds of years combined studying this problem, not from any partisan political perspective, but as scientists--seekers of evidence and explanations. As a result, we feel uniquely qualified to assist policymakers in finding solutions to adapt and mitigate so we can protect the people of this state and their enterprises and property. So it is OK if we are not scientists. The scientists are there to help. They have offered to, and they understand this. While my Senate colleague from Florida is unsure about his own home State climate science, he seems quite certain about the economics of policies to curb carbon pollution, such as cap and trade. ``I can tell you with certainty,'' he has said, ``it would have a devastating impact on our economy.'' I would suggest that the Senator from Florida take a closer look at the facts because his position on these two issues boils down to wrong and wronger. I know this because my home State is one of nine Northeastern States that require utilities to buy carbon emissions allowances. We are actually doing it. The proceeds are directed back into the regional economy through things such as energy efficiency investments and renewable energy projects. And we have the results. The results are in. Just from 2012 to 2014, the program generated $1.3 billion in economic benefits for New England, and it saved consumers over $400 million in energy costs. This climate solution was a boost to the economy, and it cut carbon dioxide emissions in the region by a quarter. The Republican candidates from Florida are running against the facts and they are running against the opinions of experts and local leaders in their own home State. In a June 19 editorial, the Sun Sentinel praised Pope Francis's recent encyclical on climate change and its call to swift action, because of the threat climate change poses to South Florida. The editors wrote that ``the Pope's declaration puts pressure on [the they are Floridians . . and because they aspire to be national leaders.'' The editors continue: ``Candidates who aspire to be inclusive, effective leaders cannot see . . . science through a political lens.'' That is the Sun Sentinel. Archbishop Thomas Wenski of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami explained Pope Francis's message to the Miami Herald. ``What the Pope is saying is, `Let's talk about this,''' the archbishop said. ``And that requires--whether you're a Democrat or Republican or left or right--it requires that you transcend your particular interest or ideological lens and look at the issue from the common good.'' For Florida, that common good is imperiled by climate change. South Florida has seen almost 1 foot of sea level rise in the last 100 years. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact is a bipartisan coalition--Republicans and Democrats--of four South Florida counties. Those four South Florida counties predict that the waters around southeast Florida could surge up to another 2 feet in less than 50 years. Our children will live to see that. I visited Florida on my climate tour last year. I heard firsthand about the threats climate change poses to the Sunshine State from Glenn Landers, senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Everglades Division. Engineer Landers has worked on water resources and restoration projects in Florida for nearly 20 years. This is the map he used to show me what just 2 feet of sea level rise means for South Florida. What it means for South Florida is there is a lot less of South Florida above water. Florida is home to some of the country's top universities and research institutions. The Florida Climate Institute is a network of scientists and research programs from eight universities, including the University of Florida, Florida State, and the University of Miami. The Florida Climate Institute is dedicated to ``climate research in service of society.'' These are some of Florida's brightest minds. Recognizing businesses' and communities' need for useful data and solutions that are based on Florida's unique characteristics, the Florida Climate Institute publishes research to help improve understanding of the increasing climate variability in Florida. If Florida's leaders respond responsibly to the changing climate, writes the group, ``Florida is well positioned to become a center of excellence for climate change research and education and a test bed for innovations in climate adaptation.'' Well, responsible officials in Florida are already taking action. My friend the senior Senator from Florida took the Senate commerce committee to Miami Beach town hall to examine the dangers posed by rising seas. The Miami Herald said this about Senator Nelson's efforts to raise awareness about the threat to his State: South Florida owes [Senator] Nelson its thanks for shining a bright light on this issue. Everyone from local residents to elected officials should follow his lead, turning awareness of this major environmental issue into action. It is critical to saving our region. In Fort Lauderdale, Mayor Jack Seiler is working with NOAA and State and Broward County officials and the South Florida Regional Planning Council to protect his city from flooding and climate change. Yet on climate change, Florida's own Presidential candidates have got nothing. Zero. No plan. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine showed me the huge pumps his city has installed to pump out the floodwaters that come in on high tides from the rising seas and with storms. Each pump can move 14,000 gallons of water per minute. Imagine that. But Florida's Presidential candidates have no plan. The mayor of Monroe County, Sylvia Murphy, a Republican, has put climate and energy policy at the heart of her 20-year growth plan for the county. Why? Her county covers all of the Florida Keys and some of the Everglades. She is going to lose a lot of it if we don't get ahead of this, and she also sees what is happening to her reefs offshore. Yet, despite the overwhelming consensus of scientists in their own State, Florida's Republican Presidential candidates have got nothing. The junior Senator from Florida even suggested that we should wait for China to take action before we address this problem. The junior Senator from Florida, on foreign policy, has spoken often about the need for American leadership on issues of global importance, saying, for instance, that America must ``continue to hold this torch'' of peace and liberty. Earlier this year, Jeb Bush echoed that sentiment, saying, ``American leadership projected consistently and grounded in principle has been a benefit to the world.'' Well, fine words, but where is their leadership on climate change? They got nothing. It is our responsibility as a great nation to set an example for others to follow, not to sit back and wait for others to act. Failing to act on climate change would both dim our own national torch and give other nations an excuse for delay. Failure, with the stakes this high, becomes an argument for our enemies against our very model of government. As Pope Francis said, ``The world will not forget this failure of conscience and responsibility.'' We will own that. The question is why Republican Presidential candidates refuse to engage on climate change. They ignore their own home State universities. They ignore their own home State mayors, local officials. They ignore their own home [[Page 11850]] State engineers. Why? Why, when the evidence is so plain? Why the pretense that climate solutions are bad for the economy when actual experience proves that is not true? Why the pretense? Why can't they credibly speak about America's responsibility to lead? Why would they have us ignore one of the most pressing national and global issues of our time? All I can hope, for their sake and for ours, is that they soon wake up. I yield the floor. Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask to speak for up to 5 minutes in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. ____________________ CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, 5 years ago today, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Washington passed this 2,300-page bill, creating more burdensome regulations that did not solve the crisis, and, in many ways, made it worse. You are going to hear a lot about the failures of the Dodd-Frank Act over the next few years. From what was intended to rein in five major banks who led us into trouble in the 2008 crisis, has created unintended consequences today that are affecting thousands of small town regional banks across our country. I rise today to speak about one agency created by the Dodd- Frank law, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB. While many Americans may not have heard of the CFPB before, they will in the future. This agency touches every aspect of people's lives, from credit card records, mortgage applications, student loans, and car sales to much more. The CFPB seemingly knows more about American consumers than we know about the very agency that is supposed to be protecting them. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, every month the CFPB scrubs data on credit card transactions, debit card transactions, consumer mortgage loans, car loans, and hundreds of thousands of other personal financial information. This leads to several questions. Why are they collecting this information in the first place? How does collecting credit card statements help protect consumers? How secure is all of this data? Unfortunately, we know very little about what the CFPB is doing with all of this sensitive information, except looking for additional opportunities to regulate. Remember, before 2009 we already had six prudential regulators mandated, among other things, to protect the consumer. Yet as a result of 2008, instead of streamlining and consolidating, we actually added a seventh prudential regulator charged with consumer protection, the CFPB. Today, the CFPB operates on top of the existing regulators, in addition to--not in replacement of--these agencies, and duplicating efforts among these other agencies. By design, Dodd-Frank ensured that the CFPB does not have the same oversight control as other agencies. Currently, Congress does not even have control over how the Bureau spends its funds or is even appropriated. The CFPB operates outside the regular appropriations process of Congress, which other independent agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and others, are all subject to. Why would any government agency with access to that much consumer data be unaccountable to Congress? Recently, I introduced legislation to help shed more light on this agency and bring the CFPB under the appropriations process of the Congress. The sheer volume of consumer data being collected by the CFPB is concerning and ripe for abuse. In fact, the GAO and the Federal Reserve inspector general both have warned about the need for increased security. Without full congressional oversight, how can we be sure this consumer data is secure? What kind of records does the CFPB keep? How would we know if it has been compromised? We have already seen the devastating effect of data breaches all over our Federal Government, and the damage it is doing to the American people across all sectors of our government, including the most recent OPM data breach, impacting millions of Americans and some of our intelligence assets abroad. We have seen the potential exposure of extremely sensitive national security information. Also, we recently had a debate about privacy regarding the NSA metadata program. Many of my colleagues expressed outrage for the scope of the NSA program, even when the mission was protecting national security. We are now talking about an agency collecting massive amounts of personal consumer data, many times more data than the NSA program. The CFPB's goal claims to be consumer protection. For all we know, this information they are collecting is even more susceptible to security threats and security breaches. If there is one thing we can agree upon, we need to make sure all Americans' personal information is safe and secure--especially from Washington. If some were upset about privacy in the NSA debate, we should certainly be paying attention to what the CFPB is doing with this personal information today. Getting the CFPB under congressional oversight should not be a partisan issue. In order to protect consumers, we need to know what is going on in the very government agency tasked with protecting them. That is why we need to put in place more transparency--not less--more control, and more oversight. We can start by bringing the CFPB under congressional oversight immediately so we can actually protect consumers and stop the potential for abuse, fraud or identity theft. While this agency was originally designed to protect consumers, one can only wonder how Washington's collecting so much personal information will actually protect us. I will be speaking much more on this topic as the weeks go by. Let it be said tonight, though, that on the fifth anniversary of Dodd-Frank, we are beginning to look at the unintended consequences of this rogue agency, the CFPB. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming. ____________________ DODD-FRANK ACT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank the Senator from Georgia for his outstanding comments. He is truly a great addition to this body and to the Budget Committee, where I have watched him go through numbers. I once mentioned that he knew how to balance the budget because he had been in business before, at which point he corrected me and said: In business, you don't get to just balance the budget. He is very correct on that. We are at a point where we cannot afford to just balance the budget. We have to start paying down some of the debt if we expect our kids to ever be able to afford the interest. So I thank him for his comments. I am going to pile on with some more comments about some of those same things. I want to talk about what I have talked about several times over the past 5 years; that is the Dodd-Frank Act, which passed this body 5 years ago today, July 21, 2010. This mammoth bill, which totaled 2,300 pages, has, 5 years later, led to many thousands of pages of rules and regulations. It is estimated that only 238 of the 390 rulemakings required by the law have been completed--millions of pages, and we still only have 238 of 390 rulemakings that the 2,300-page bill required. Theoretically, then, tens of thousands of pages of more regulations can be expected in the coming years--regulations that do not fix too big to fail, regulations that unduly burden our community banks and our credit unions, regulations that cover a host of industries that did not contribute to the financial crisis. And it does compromise the privacy of Americans. I would like to take this opportunity to expand on these ideas. First of all, I would like to point out that I actually [[Page 11851]] read the whole bill. I read it. I highlighted it. I put in colored tabs in different sections so I could refer to them easily. Then I talked to my colleagues, and I spoke on the floor to raise concerns about the bill roping in industries that did not cause the financial crisis, about the fact that it did not fix too big to fail. I raised a real ruckus about the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the CFPB, when they were trying to just kind of gloss over it and its ability to collect the financial information of American citizens without their consent. I filed a simple amendment that would have required this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to obtain written permission from consumers before collecting their information. Of course, my amendment was not allowed a vote and now the CFPB is collecting massive amounts of personal financial data. So here we are 5 years later, and hindsight has proven that many of the concerns I raised during the consideration of this bill were valid. I have often said that knee-jerk reactions to legislative form have a very real danger of overcorrecting and causing a myriad of problems. In fact, some people say that if it is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting to. That is exactly what happened here. We did it through a comprehensive bill--2,300 pages. I do not like comprehensive bills. The purpose of comprehensive bills is so that they are incomprehensible, so that people cannot understand them. The best way to legislate is to take things in logical pieces and solve that problem in a way that all of America can come along with and understand. Those problems are unintended consequences when they are in comprehensive bills. In correspondence and conversation with folks from Wyoming over the years, I have said that I treat all legislation the same. I read it and I consider both intended and what might be unintended consequences of the legislation. What I am here to talk about today are some of the consequences of the Dodd-Frank Act after 5 years. First, there is the too-big-to-fail question. The Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to make it so American taxpayers would, according to President Obama, ``never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's mistakes. . . . there will be no more tax-funded bailouts--period.'' Dodd-Frank increased capital requirements, it increased liquidity requirements, and it has been adding rules and new regulations steadily for the last 5 years. Folks who support the law would say all of those things are good things and make for a more secure financial sector. However, one of the contributors to too big to fail was the consolidation of banks and the financial industry, a byproduct of which was the reduction of the number of smaller community banks that serve small business owners, families, farmers, and ranchers, the people who actually know their customers. But thanks to the massive amount of rules and regulations, the Dodd-Frank has resulted in the compliance costs for community banks and credit unions going up significantly, and it increased the likelihood of consolidation. That fails the consumer. Smaller community banks struggled to keep up with the flow of regulations and compliance costs. For example, since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the average compliance cost for larger institutions is about 12 percent of operating costs. For community banks, the cost to comply with the same regulations, a one-size-fits-all approach is 2\\1/ 2\\ times greater, or 30 percent of the operating costs. That is a big bite. I was visiting some of those community banks and listened to them talk about the different regulations they now had to comply with. One of them had made this magnificent chart so that all of their loan officers could both follow along and make sure they got all of the parts of the procedure that this law had in regulation at that time. Now, they had to hire a compliance officer as well. They had been able to handle that part themselves before. But after they explained all of this to me, I said: Now, let's see. My wife would kind of like to expand the kitchen in our house. We have added onto it once before. If I wanted to get a loan from you, how long would it take me to get the loan? I said: I have a house in Gillette, and I have a house in DC, and I have both of them paid for. So we really do not have any outstanding debt. How long would that take? They said: A minimum of 77 days. Then, of course, there would have to be an extra week so that if you decided it was not a good deal, you could undo the loan. I wanted the loan. I wanted it 77 days before. I had to wait that long, and then there is a week for it. But here is another kicker that is in the bill. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has up to 150 days to tell me that I made a bad loan and cancel it. Hopefully, the construction would already be started by that time. Well, I remember when I wanted to do that addition on the house. I went to my banker, and I explained to him what I wanted to do. It took me a whole day to get that loan--a whole day. Now, it is going to take 77 days, plus 1 week, and then I guess we have to wait 150 days to see if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is going to decide that they know better than I know. My State of Wyoming is one of the most rural in the country. We had mostly community banks in Wyoming. I can attest that every visit I have had with banks in Wyoming since this law passed has had one main subject that remains constant: We are being crushed under the weight of these regulations. We are having to make tough choices about the services we provide. Some of these banks are starting to consolidate with larger banks and become branches. Credit unions are not faring any better. According to the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, more than 1,250 credit unions have disappeared since the passage of Dodd-Frank. Of that number, over 90 percent had fewer than $100 million in assets, and the No. 1 reason they give for having to merge out of the business was the inability to keep up with the regulatory burden they face. This is one unacceptable consequence of the Dodd-Frank law and one folks on both sides of the aisle should be appalled by. Now, equally appalling--maybe more appalling--is the importance the Dodd-Frank Act afforded to the agency it created, which the Senator from Georgia just talked about, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the CFPB. Now, this is an agency that really doesn't come under our jurisdiction; it actually works under the Federal Reserve and gets, I think it is up to 12 percent of the revenues of the Federal Reserve now, plus inflation. They will get up to 15 percent, plus inflation. We have no say over that. They don't report to us in any way, shape or form. This agency has grown to over 1,450 employees. It has a facility whose offices' renovation budget has spiraled to over $216 million and faces almost no accountability to Congress. I don't have enough time allotted to talk about all the activities of the CFPB, but make no mistake, this agency's reach has increased exponentially over the past 5 years to the point where it is now taking enforcement actions covering telecommunications companies and has broadened its authority over the auto industry, which was specifically exempted from the CFPB in the Dodd-Frank bill. Let me tell you how that happened. I did a bunch of speeches on the floor. I was interested in that third section. The first section was about the banks, the second was about hedge funds, and the third was about the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that wasn't going to have any control by anybody. I found that little paragraph in there that said they have the ability to cancel a loan up to 150 days after the bank and the person-- or whomever they are borrowing the money from--and the person receiving the money agreed to the loan. They can cancel it. I pointed that out in speeches. One group of people listened to me. It was the automobile dealers. The automobile dealers flooded Washington [[Page 11852]] with lobbyists, and they got an exclusion in the bill for automobile loans. That is the only exclusion in there. Of course, they are being retaliated against now for that, and I will talk about that in just a minute too. The CFPB issued a final rule on June 10 that would allow it to supervise nonbank companies qualified as larger participants of a market for automobile financing, along with a separate rule defining certain auto leases as a financial product or service. What does this mean? It means the CFPB has expanded its oversight powers by saying: Oh, yes, auto leases are a financial product. They don't like what they did to us. It is a service, and we are allowed to regulate those. So we will just increase our level of oversight over this industry. In fact, they have even taken a look at some of the loans that have been resold by automobile dealers and said those were discriminatory because they weren't the same. Well, when you go to the bank to sell a loan, you don't get the same deal every day, so that is really not discrimination, but according to this group that doesn't have any oversight over it, it is. On the same day, the CFPB released its auto finance examination procedures for CFPB examiners to examine both banks and nonbanks. Keep in mind this is one example of hundreds of rules, enforcement actions, and other activities this agency is involved in across industries. Beyond increasing its incredible oversight reach, the CFPB has also engaged in massive data collection dating back to 2011. I spoke about this data collection, and the Senator from Georgia spoke about this data collection. I spoke about the data collection before the confirmation of Richard Cordray to be the Director of the CFPB on July 16, 2013. I was the only Senator to speak before this vote, and I repeated something I said during the debate of the Dodd-Frank Act that I think bears repeating again. On May 20, 2010, I said: This bill was supposed to be about regulating Wall Street; instead it's creating a Google Earth of your every financial transaction. That's right--the government will be able to see every detail of your finances. They can look at your transactions from the 50,000 foot perspective or they can look right down to the tiny details of the time and place where you pulled cash out of an ATM. I talked about some of the data we had at that time. I am, unfortunately, going to expand on those comments because the CFPB continues to collect massive amounts of data without consent of the consumers. The Government Accountability Office, GAO, is a nonpartisan, independent agency that investigates how the Federal Government spends taxpayer dollars. They released an extensive report on September 2014 detailing the data collection of the CFPB. Here is what they found. Of the 12 large-scale collections they reviewed, three included information that identified individual consumers. The CFPB said those three collections weren't subject to the Dodd-Frank prohibition on collecting personally identifiable information. What? The CFPB is collecting information on 700,000 auto sales per month, 10.7 million consumer credit reports per month, 25 million to 75 million individual credit card accounts, 29 million active mortgage loans, and 173 million total loans, as well as one-time collections of 5.5 million private student loans and 15 million to 40 million payday loans. This isn't the whole list, this is a sample rundown. Let's see, they are into the automobile sales, everything with your automobile sales, your consumer credit reports, your credit cards, your mortgage loans, your total loans, your student loans--and, if you do it, payday loans. Again, that is just a sample rundown. Let's take a minute to let these numbers sink in. The CFPB collects information on 25 million to 75 million credit card accounts on a monthly basis. They want to be able to monitor 95 percent of all credit card transactions by 2016. I don't know about you, but this is highly disturbing, especially in light of the fact that the GAO report found that CFPB did not employ sufficient security and privacy protections to make sure this data remains safe. In summary, the CFPB is collecting sensitive financial information on individuals by name, on millions of Americans, some of which has personally identifiable information that is supposed to be removed or not used, and they don't have the appropriate safeguard to protect this information. Considering the increase in cyber attacks faced across different sectors in our country, including the Federal Government, this information is not just troubling, it is terrifying, especially because there is no way for a single American to opt out of this collection or require notification that their information is being collected and stored. Let me assure you, it is, and not only that, there is no way for Congress to have a say to exert oversight to take a closer look at what the CFPB is up to. One thing that is clear to me, every American deserves better than this, and after 5 years, I think it is safe to say we can do much better than this--and we better do much better than this--or we will have what the book ``1984'' suggested is going to happen. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ CYBER SECURITY Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the headlines in the past few months have been enough to paint a startling picture of how our Nation is handling technology and security these days. Before I came to Congress, I spent 12 years working in the technology sector, but it doesn't take an extensive background in these fields to see that in the ever-changing realm of technology and online communication, America's constitutional freedoms and civil liberties are at risk and our security as a nation is under attack. When it comes to protecting American citizens' privacy and personal information, we as a nation need to respond to the new threats our enemies are posing and the new tactics they are using and demand equal vigilance from those in our government who claim they have American safety at heart. The modern battlefield is changing. We see it changing before our very eyes, and America needs to adapt. With the incredible advantages that modern technology offers, also with that come greater risks as well as greater responsibility. Our enemies, America's enemies, are utilizing social media in particular to recruit others to their side to plot against our rights, our freedoms, our American way of life. As Michael Steinbach, the Assistant Director at the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, said to the House Homeland Security Committee just last month: ``The foreign terrorist now has direct access into the United States like never before.'' We know for a fact that ISIS aggressively uses social media to spread its propaganda, to target individuals in our own country, and to urge them to attack us on our own soil. In March of this year, the New York Times reported that ISIS's use of social media, including Twitter and high-quality online recruiting videos, has been ``astonishingly successful,'' and the speed at which modern social media moves means America must move faster. In fact, we read about the recently foiled terrorist attack in Boston, where Islamic extremists planned to behead law enforcement officials. It shows us the importance of engaging these online terrorists, their propaganda machines, interpreting their encrypted communications, and cracking down on the spread of online terrorist networks--but how can we fight back against these cyber threats from abroad when our own government officials show themselves to be woefully incompetent? We in this country spent months debating the National Security Agency's [[Page 11853]] bulk collection of Americans' metadata, and in the meantime, while we are having this debate, Chinese hackers stole millions of Americans' personal information. In fact, it is estimated now those Chinese hackers broke into the Office of Personnel Management--basically the HR system of the Federal Government--and stole over 20 million records of employees of the Federal Government. This recent breach of Federal employees' information may possibly be rooted in a phishing email. In fact, in a recent article in Ars Technica on June 8, they said: It may be some time before the extent of the breach is known with any level of certainty. What is known is that a malware package--likely delivered via an e-mail ``phishing'' attack against OPM or Interior employees--managed to install itself within the OPM's IT systems and establish a back-door for further attacks. The attackers then escalated their privileges on OPM's systems to the point where they had access to a wide swath of the agency's systems. These hackers broke into the computers at the Federal Government's Office of Personnel Management. They were downloading the very forms Federal employees use to gain national security clearances. In fact, earlier this month USA TODAY said: The hackers took millions of the forms used by people to disclose intimate details of their lives for national security clearances. The information could be used to unmask covert agents or try to blackmail Americans into spying for an enemy. In fact, I was one of those millions of Americans--as were other Members of Congress--whose personal information was compromised in this breach, and I demanded accountability from the Director and others at the OPM, but we also need to address the systemic problems with cyber security in this country directly. The outdated security systems at the OPM and other agencies of the Federal Government recently hacked show that America is not up to speed with the kinds and the levels of cyber threats our country is facing. Let me give an example. In the publication Ars Technica of June 8, 2015, it says: The OPM hack is just the latest in a series of Federal network intrusions and data breaches, including recent incidents at the Internal Revenue Service, the State Department, and even the White House. These attacks have occurred despite the $4.5 billion National Cybersecurity and Protection System program and its centerpiece capability, Einstein. Falling under the Department of Homeland Security's watch, that system sits astride the government's trusted Internet gateways. Einstein was originally based on deep packet inspection technology first deployed over a decade ago, and the system's latest $218 million upgrade was supposed to make it capable of more active attack prevention. But the track flow analysis and signature detection capabilities of Einstein, drawn from both DHS traffic analysis and data shared by the National Security Agency, appears to be incapable of catching the sort of tactics that have become the modern baseline for state-sponsored network espionage and criminal attacks. Once such attacks are executed, they tend to look like normal network traffic. Put simply, as new capabilities for Einstein are being rolled out, they're not keeping pace with the types of threats now facing federal agencies. And with the data from OPM and other breaches, foreign intelligence services have a goldmine of information about federal employees at every level of the government. And this just at a time when the threats to our Nation are at very high levels. The article continues: It's a worrisome cache that could be easily leveraged for additional, highly-targeted cyber-attacks and other espionage. In a nation with a growing reputation for state of the art surveillance initiatives and cyber warfare techniques, how did we become the ones playing catch up? But this isn't just about being sloppy or being slow; this is a matter of national security. America needs to get smart on cyber security and tech issues and to hold officials accountable for their behavior because there is just too much at stake if we fail. The American people will pay the price for a failure to adapt to this rapidly changing world of technology, this rapidly changing world of media, this rapidly changing world of information gathering, and for sheer carelessness on the part of those in authority. Private sector innovation and progress can help America compete. As a member of the committee on commerce and having spent 28 years in the private sector--the last 12 years with a cloud computing startup which we took public and which became a great cloud computing company, with offices all over the world but based in my home State of Montana--I admit I had to smile when I saw that so many Congressmen want to regulate the private sector to protect the private sector from private threats. Well, again, in 28 years of serving in the private sector, I never once had my information breached. I never once had a letter from my HR department saying my information had been comprised. It wasn't until I became a Federal employee, elected to Congress a few years ago, that my information was compromised. The private sector runs a whole lot faster than the public sector. I think the government needs to look within to make sure we can be at the forefront of cyber technology and security, but these efforts will be thoroughly wasted if the Federal Government does not take the necessary precautions and procedures to protect the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. ____________________ STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening to speak about our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, sometimes referred to as the SPR. It is a national security asset that has come into the news of late for a host of different reasons. I am here this evening because of the concerns I have that others are potentially looking to our Strategic Petroleum Reserve--our strategic energy asset--as nothing more than a piggybank to fund some of the needs we have here in this Congress. I believe it is extremely shortsighted to raid our Nation's oil stockpile as an offset for the extension of the highway trust fund, and that is what we have had some conversation about today. We had a vote earlier about whether to move forward on the highway trust fund. But as we have looked to find pathways forward for a multiyear highway trust fund reauthorization, which is something I support, it is important to know that not all pots of money are equal, that perhaps some are truly national security assets for which perhaps we need to show more considered respect. I had an opportunity a few days ago--on Friday--to tour our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I went to the Choctaw Bayou site near Baton Rouge, LA. It was an opportunity for me to get a firsthand look at some of the challenges that currently face our four Strategic Petroleum Reserves that we have down in the Louisiana, Texas area and to have a better understanding as to their operational readiness. Quite honestly, it is a trip I wish more of our Members were willing to take because I think it would become clear to many the potential mistake we would be making in forcing the sale of billions of dollars of our emergency oil solely to pay for unrelated legislation. It is akin to selling the insurance on your house in order to pave your driveway. It just doesn't make sense. For some, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve may be a very unknown national security asset. They do not really know what it is. But the SPR is our Nation's insurance policy against global energy supply disruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established by law back in 1975 under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and its mission is twofold: to ensure U.S. energy security by reducing the impacts of potential disruptions in U.S. petroleum supplies and secondly to carry out U.S. obligations under the international energy program. We have about 700 million barrels of oil that are tucked away in underground salt caverns down in Louisiana and in Texas. We have a couple refined product reserves in other parts of the country, but our Strategic Petroleum Reserves are there in Louisiana and Texas. So if we have a major hurricane [[Page 11854]] that takes out production in the Gulf of Mexico, as we saw with Hurricane Katrina back in 2005, we can turn to the SPR to help fill the gap. We did that in 2005. That is exactly the type of reason you would have the strategic asset. But there are other times we have turned to the SPR. If there is a terrorist attack or a broader war disruption that alters the ability of other nations to send us oil, we can again turn to the reserve for help. We did this in 1991 with the Iraq war and then again in 2011 with the Libya supply disruption. So, again, when there was an emergency and we needed to ensure U.S. security, we had a ready reserve fund to turn to. In the absence of policies that will allow our Nation to produce all of the oil it consumes every day, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is really our best answer to the sudden absence of the energy we need, whether it is driving to work, whether it is powering our ships or our airplanes, moving our goods, or whatever that reason may be. With the discussion we had today in terms of how we pay for this multiyear transportation bill, we are being asked to dramatically diminish the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve based again on the need to pay for the extension of the highway trust fund. It is totally unrelated--totally unrelated. Those who would argue in favor of taking from the SPR, their argument is pretty simple. In fact, it is way too simple. They suggest that our international obligations require us to store enough petroleum to match 90 days of net imports. That is true. And they will say that given the growth we have seen in domestic oil production, we have enough now that we have a surplus within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some have even suggested that an SPR is not even necessary anymore. Well, I would be the first among us to suggest that changes need to be made to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Again, this was established back in 1975, and I think it is very fair to say the world has changed. It has changed dramatically since the 1970s. The global environment in which we are operating has changed dramatically. And the Department of Energy has said that today the impacts of an overall supply disruption of global oil markets would have the same effect on domestic petroleum product prices regardless of how U.S. oil import levels--or whether U.S. refineries import crude from disrupted countries. So there is a recognition that we have to get to modernizing the SPR. We have to ensure that we have right-sized it, that we are in alignment when it comes to moving oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at those times we have determined are appropriate. So I think it is important to know we are not just sitting still on this. The Department of Energy has begun work on a comprehensive, long- term strategic review of the SPR. We had good discussion about this when I was down in Louisiana on Friday with the Deputy Secretary of Energy, Chris Smith, talking about what this review will entail. It is looking at future SPR requirements regarding the size; regarding the composition of it; the geographic location--it has been suggested that perhaps there might be regional approaches; determining where we have chokepoints within the system in terms of distribution; how we move it; determining the impacts of what we see globally and what is happening with our own domestic production; and again being smart in how we are making sure we have right-sized the SPR and, in fairness, modernized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have a committee, as you know, Mr. President, that likes to roll up our sleeves and get into the weeds on making sure our policies are current and are relevant. We need a deliberative process that will provide us with the proper understanding of the stakes and our options when it comes to how we handle our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What we do not need--what we do not need--is an arbitrary process that picks a number. Right now, for purposes of the offset of what they are coming to the energy committee for, they are picking a number of--let's sell 101 million barrels of oil to fund a portion of the highway trust fund. Again, where is the connection between ensuring that we don't erode our national energy security assets? I have said many times that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an ATM. It is certainly not the petty cash drawer for Congress. We have a responsibility. A decision to sell substantial volumes of oil will increase our vulnerability to future supply disruptions at a time when we are still importing oil. We are importing about 5 million barrels a day. Think about this. Think about the timing of this. It simply could not be worse. When you talk about volatility in the world, think about the news you read about today, what is happening in Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Now is the time for us to say that our national energy security assets are not that important; it is OK to nibble around the edges or worse and take significant amounts to put out on the market? Let's consider a few facts to put things into perspective. First of all, you talk about the market. It is a buyer's market out there. The International Energy Agency warns of a massively oversupplied balance sheet. The Energy Information Administration shares that assessment in its latest monthly outlook, noting that production continues to exceed consumption across the globe. Of course, now as we are seeing the outcome from the negotiations with Iran, they are going to be in a position soon to put their oil out onto the world market. Oil prices are sitting right now around $50 a barrel. Think about it. Not all of the oil that is in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was perhaps bought high, but think about it. Selling it now is the very definition of selling low. We are at $50 a barrel right now. The sales that are envisioned in this highway bill would shortchange taxpayers in terms of emergency protection because you are eroding the fund, but think about the proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Effectively, we bought high and we are going to sell low. Second, drawing down barrels from the SPR would put the Federal Government in a position of direct competition with domestic producers. That may be temporarily defensible during a severe interruption, but let's remember where we are right now. The midcontinent is already awash in crude. Our outdated ban on oil exports, which should be fully repealed and fully repealed soon in my view, has not been repealed yet. It is sitting there in place, and what it is doing is keeping oil that is trapped in the United States, threatening productions and jobs at the same time. What you are talking about with this proposal to sell off the oil from SPR is you are going to sell it first very low and then you are going to put it into a market that is already oversupplied. I was in the Gulf of Mexico this weekend at a place called Port Fourchon, where truly you think about the part of the country that is supporting an oil and gas industry, robust, ready to go to work, but what we saw there were supply vessels that were sidelined and drill ships that were waiting. You tell those hard-working men and women there who aren't working as hard as they would like that perhaps somehow it is a good idea that they should be taking money from our savings account--taking the oil from our savings account and dumping that into the market. Third, our Nation's energy security cannot depend on commercial stocks alone. They rise and fall based on market expectations, not on the strategic environment, and are not tethered to our Nation's energy security. Since the passage of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in 1975, there was a bipartisan consensus that maintained that it is the Federal Government, not private industry, that will ensure that our obligations are met. Clearly, not much has changed in that calculation, certainly in my mind. Fourth, threats to global security continue to abound and they seem to worsen. As Iran, ISIS, and other threats destabilize the Middle East, [[Page 11855]] some 17 million barrels per day still flow through the Strait of Hormuz. The Suez Canal and its accompanying pipeline carry just under 5 million barrels per day, despite a budding insurgency that fired a rocket at an Egyptian Navy vessel earlier this month. Instability in Venezuela, which produces about 2\\1/2\\ million barrels per day, would also directly impact the major American refining center in the Gulf of Mexico. You have all of this volatility and instability, and this is the time again that we are going to take our insurance policy and we are going to erode it? We are going to make us less energy secure? It makes no sense. By way of comparison, the drawdown rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is about 4.4 million barrels a day, probably a little bit less. But, seriously, any number of disruptions could arise and make those barrels very precious. Secretary Moniz gave a speech about a month ago, and he stated that the distribution rate is probably much lower than our drawdown capacity of 4.4. The distribution rate is compromised because of some of the issues we talked about earlier, which are changes in midstream, infrastructure, and congestions in the system. When you talk about our ability to respond, we are limited. If Congress is going to sell any oil from the SPR--and I am not suggesting this is a good idea--one of the things we must do is we should agree that any proceeds would first be used to pay for upgrading the reserve itself, pay for the modernization, help to ensure it has the ability to do that which we have tasked it to do. It needs significant modifications to preserve its long-term viability and to ensure that it can truly move the oil in the event of an emergency, whether it is a natural disaster or whether it is a terrorist threat or war. But it would be a travesty if we were to dramatically reduce the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while we continue to ignore its maintenance and its operational needs. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve must be modernized for the 21st century. Its size, its geographic disposition, the quality of the oil it stores--right now it is about one-third to two-thirds distribution between sweet and sour crude--the desirability and understanding is we need to move more into a refined product storage or holding instead of the crude. These are all issues that merit further attention, but we need to have a deliberative process. We need the review that the Department of Energy is conducting. We need the review that committees such as ours will advance and consider. What we do not need is a spur- of-the-moment deal that would sacrifice our energy security and perhaps much more. I know this conversation will continue about how we move a highway bill forward. Count me as one who wants to ensure that we are doing right by our highway systems. Our infrastructure is key, but we also have key energy infrastructure. Part of that key infrastructure lies with the security asset, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we have. Let's focus on that word ``strategic'' before we move too quickly and in a manner that is shortsighted and will jeopardize our security and our inability to respond. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO MARTA ADAMS Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Marta Adams, who is retiring from her position as chief deputy attorney general for Nevada. For more than 27 years, Marta has been serving Nevada; and though many Nevadans may not know Marta, she has been working diligently to keep them safe. Soon after Marta graduated from the University of Wyoming College of Law in 1977, she began practicing law in the Silver State. She quickly gained experience in environmental law, and her knowledge about the West and its natural resources have contributed greatly to her successful legal career. Marta's persistence and commitment while representing the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects in opposing the Yucca Mountain project was instrumental in our State's legal fight against efforts to force nuclear waste on Nevada. Since 2008, Marta has worked as chief deputy attorney general and maintained a strong voice for Nevada on all issues pertaining to Yucca Mountain. On behalf of Nevada, I thank Marta for her decades of dedicated public service and wish her the best in her well-earned retirement. ____________________ CAMERON AND DELEVAN, ILLINOIS, TORNADOES Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the third time this year, Illinois communities are assessing damage and cleaning up after tornadoes. One twister struck the town of Cameron, in Warren County, on Thursday evening. Moments later, another struck the town of Delevan, in Tazewell County. The tornadoes were accompanied by storms with heavy rain and flooding. The National Weather Service says both tornadoes were category EF-2. That means that the winds blew up to 130 miles per hour. Homes in both small towns suffered severe damage. Several homes had roofs torn off, while others were completely flattened. The tornado that hit Delevan touched down without warning because tornado sirens lost power a few seconds after they began to sound. Debris from homes and farms was scattered across the community. Many roads in the community were impassible due to down trees and power lines. Emergency responders wasted no time going house to house in both communities. I spoke with Warren County sheriff Martin Edwards on Friday afternoon. Thankfully, there were no fatalities or serious injuries reported. The communities are busy cleaning up today and utility companies are working to get gas and electricity back on. Over the weekend, Sparky's Smokeshack set up a smoker on the edge of Cameron. The popular rib joint served up free meals to anyone who needed them. American Red Cross volunteers also are providing food and water. As is so often the case when a disaster like this strikes, first responders and friends and family members are helping people whose homes and businesses were damaged. I thank the first responders and all of the members of these communities for their work. The Illinois delegation and I stand ready to help in any way we can, particularly if the Governor requests Federal assistance. I have no doubt that the people in Cameron and Delevan will rebuild. Our thoughts are with the many people today who lost homes and other property. ____________________ GUATEMALA Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the Congress focused on the U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement, it is not surprising that recent developments in Guatemala have not received the attention they deserve, either here or in the international press. I want to speak briefly about this as it should interest all Senators, particularly at a time when the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras are seeking significant U.S. funding to support the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle of Central America. The Cold War history of U.S. involvement in Guatemala is not one we can be overly proud of. The role of the United Fruit Company, the CIA, Guatemala's landholding elite, and others in orchestrating the removal of democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman in 1954, the training and equipping of the Guatemalan military that carried out a scorched earth campaign against a rebel insurgency and the rural indigenous population in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and policies favoring the financial and political elite who perpetuated the racism, social and economic inequities, corruption, violence, and impunity that persist to this [[Page 11856]] day, are all part of that collective experience. One of the vestiges of that period is the continuing harassment, vilification, death threats, and even malicious prosecutions of human rights defenders and other social activists. It is regrettable that Guatemala's authorities have failed to condemn or take effective steps to stop this pattern and practice of threats and abuse of the justice system. Yet while the 1996 Peace Accords that finally ended 36 years of armed conflict were, for the most part, not implemented, since then the United States has sought to help address the causes of poverty, inequality, and injustice in Guatemala. We have funded child nutrition and public health programs, bilingual education for indigenous children, efforts to reform and professionalize the police, prevent violence against women, strengthen the institutional capacity of the Public Ministry, locate and identify the remains of thousands of people who disappeared during the war and ended up in mass graves, support reparations for victims of the Chixoy massacres, protect biodiversity and preserve pre-Columbian archeological sites in Peten. The results of these efforts have been mixed, but they do signify a positive trend in our relations with Guatemala in recent years for which the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter- American Foundation, the Inter-American Development Bank, and others deserve credit. President Perez Molina also deserves credit for supporting the agreement to finance the Chixoy reparations plan, which some in his own government opposed. It is now essential that the agreement is implemented so the communities who suffered losses are compensated. The United States has also been a strong supporter of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, otherwise known as CICIG, which, in collaboration with the Office of the Attorney General, has played an indispensable role in investigations and prosecutions of cases of corruption, organized crime, and clandestine groups, as well as crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities dating to the civil war. I commend the way CICIG Commissioner Ivan Velasquez and Attorney General Thelma Aldana are working together to address these issues. Each year since CICIG's inception in 2007, as either chairman or ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that funds U.S. foreign aid programs and as a former prosecutor and chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have included a U.S. contribution to CICIG. I have also twice supported the extension of CICIG when it was nearing the end of its mandate. Most recently, when President Otto Perez Molina indicated that he did not intend to renew CICIG's mandate, I argued that the weakness of Guatemala's justice system and the continuing high levels of corruption and impunity were compelling reasons to extend CICIG. I was gratified that earlier this year its mandate was extended until 2017. While Guatemala's justice system remains fragile, the partnership between CICIG and the Public Ministry has played a critical role in advancing the cause of justice in Guatemala. But Guatemala's problems are not unique. Honduras and El Salvador suffer from many of the same conditions--weak justice systems that lack credibility, rampant corruption, threats and assassinations of human rights defenders, journalists, and even prosecutors, and a history of impunity. I hope those governments look to CICIG as a model for how they could benefit from the technical expertise and independence of the international community to help address these deeply rooted problems. Simultaneous with President Perez Molina's decision to extend CICIG's mandate, the need for CICIG became even more apparent. As a result of its investigations, high-ranking officials in the Perez Molina government, including Vice President Roxana Baldetti and one of her top aides, as well as the President's chief of staff and other senior officials, have either resigned or been arrested due to allegations of bribery and other corruption related to customs and social security. In addition, a leading Vice Presidential candidate of the Lider Party has been implicated. This may only be the tip of the iceberg, as it is common knowledge that corruption is widespread in Guatemala. Such scandals involving powerful public figures are by no means unprecedented, as other Guatemalan officials--including a former President and Minister of Interior--have been implicated in such crimes and became fugitives from justice. But unlike in the past, these latest scandals have galvanized a diverse spectrum of civil society to join in peaceful public demonstrations over a period of several months calling for an end to corruption and impunity and for the resignation of the President who would be replaced by a transition government in accordance with Guatemala's Constitution. The timing of these protests is significant, as Presidential elections are scheduled for September 6 and speculation is rife as to whether or not President Perez Molina will serve out his term. The United States has a strong interest in democracy and justice in Guatemala, as well as a better life for the millions of Guatemala's citizens, particularly indigenous and other historically marginalized groups, who live in poverty. Many, with only a few years of formal education and no reliable source of income, including victims of ethnic discrimination, gangs and violent crime, have risked life and limb in search of opportunities in the United States. It is our hope that the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity, with complementary and balanced investments in governance, prosperity, and security, will begin to provide the economic opportunities and address these difficult social and law enforcement challenges in a sustainable way. I look forward to discussing these issues with our friends in the House of Representatives later this year. More immediately, it is important that the United States carefully calibrates its response to the popular demands for reform. What is happening in Guatemala today is both unique and encouraging in the way it has inspired and united, for the first time in Guatemala's history, indigenous and non-indigenous, both rural and urban groups, poor and middle class who previously did not share a common agenda. This has enhanced the prospects for real change in a country that has been plagued for two decades by the divisive, tragic legacies of the war and by powerful forces in government and the private sector resistant to change for generations. In this context, civil society requires support and protection, taking into account Guatemala's past history of repression and violence. I urge U.S. officials to make clear that the United States unequivocally supports the aspirations of Guatemalan civil society that is now struggling for the right of all the Guatemalan people to have transparent and accountable government, including honest and professional police and an independent judiciary. Guatemala is a country with an extraordinarily rich culture, natural resources, and human potential. But without respect for human rights and the rule of law and real change that provides for equitable economic opportunities and political representation, that potential will remain unfulfilled. It is long past time for an end to impunity, including for public officials who misuse their office to enrich themselves, their families, and their friends, and for a new era of effective governance, prosperity, and freedom from fear for all Guatemalans. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO BRENDAN J. WHITTAKER Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to recognize Brendan J. ``Bren'' Whittaker, a distinguished public servant and recognized leader in conservation efforts in the New England Northern Forest region. In addition to his conservation work, Bren [[Page 11857]] spent more than 45 years in the Episcopal ministry, leading a full-time parish. I know Bren first not as a priest, but as a dedicated public servant for more than 40 years. Bren has held many titles at every level of government, including town meeting moderator, town selectman, county forester, chairman of district 1 environmental commission, director of Vermont State Energy Office, Vermont Secretary of Natural Resources, U.S. Department of Agriculture FSA State Committee member and more. In addition to his schooling in theology, Bren studied forestry, and he holds degrees in both disciplines. In the early 1990s, I worked with New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman to establish the Northern Forest Lands Council, and Bren agreed to be part of that select group. He later joined the Vermont Natural Resources Council as Northern Forest project manager, and continues to work as a board member for conservation organizations in Vermont and New Hampshire. Bren served each post with distinction and has been deeply involved for nearly 40 years in the vast changes taking place across the Northern Forest. I have been pleased to continue working with Bren since his appointment to the USDA's Farm Service Agency State Committee in Vermont. Bren continues to serve as a selectman in Brunswick, VT, and operates a vegetable farm, roadside stand and seasonal restaurant supply business with his wife, Dorothy. I have touched on Bren's State and Federal public service, but his even greater contributions to his community may be through his ministry, as so eloquently enumerated in the article entitled Thanks to a Mentor and North Country Champion, written by Rebecca Brown, a member of the New Hampshire legislature and a student and friend of Bren. It was published in 2014 in the Littleton Courier. I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Brown's article be printed in the Record as a tribute to Brendan J. Whittaker's decades-long and continuing service to his neighbors, community, the States of Vermont and New Hampshire, and to the Nation. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [Littleton New Hampshire Courier, Dec. 2014] Thanks to a Mentor and North Country Champion (By Rebecca A. Brown) This season of giving thanks and celebration, I want to mark the final retirement of Brendan Whittaker from his Episcopal ministry. ``Final'' because he retired from full- time parish work many years ago, but has been serving in various priestly roles until the Sunday before Thanksgiving. I write because Brendan's effect on people and the communities of the North Country have been (and I am confident will continue to be) enormous, yet he has gone about his work over the last couple of decades with little fanfare or notoriety, but with his genuine and affecting warmth. In this way he follows in the footsteps of one of his mentors, Carleton Schaller, also an Episcopal priest who we all lost earlier this year. For much of his earlier career, Brendan was very much in the public eye, especially when he was Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources for Vermont. Walk through Montpelier or attend a conservation gathering anywhere in VT with Brendan today, and you'll encounter many people who still hold him in the highest regard. I do think he's one of the best-loved people in Vermont. Years ago, he was named the ``person from away'' (he was born and raised in Massachusetts) who most deserved to be a genuine Vermonter. Brendan and his wife Dorothy have farmed and managed their woodlot in Brunswick, in northern VT along the Connecticut River, for over 50 years. They arrived in the late 1950s, he as a newly minted (UMass) forester working for Essex County. But an additional call pulled at him, and he took a degree from the Episcopal Divinity School in Boston. His first parish work was in Brandon, VT starting in 1963. He later was full-time rector at St. Paul's in Lancaster. He was also rector at St. Mark's in Groveton, in Island Pond, Vt., and the Church of the Epiphany in Lisbon, where he served his last day. Brendan's divinity school thesis was one of the earliest church ``insider'' calls to link Christian faith and the environmental movement. His writing foreshadowed his long career as a professional forester and a working priest, and helped move the Episcopal Church to embrace stewardship of the earth as a moral obligation. I first encountered Brendan from afar through his role in the Northern Forest Lands Council, the pivotal group created by Congress to address the alarming forestland changes in northern New England and New York. Brendan represented Vermont. As a young journalist new in the North Country and exploring forestry, land use, and community issues, I studied the Council's 1994 report ``Finding Common Ground'' very closely and followed those involved with creating it. Around that time, I noted the formation of the Forest Guild as a progressive alternative to the Society of American Foresters, with Brendan among the founders. I also encountered various essays he'd written, and found him to be among the most articulate writers and thinkers about our region, someone I hoped to cross paths with someday. We finally did cross paths in 2005 when I joined the staff of the Connecticut River Joint Commissions, the VT-NH group advising the two states on issues affecting the river and watershed. Brendan was a VT commissioner. At that time Brendan was filling in occasionally at the Lisbon church (Tod Hall was the regular vicar), and from time to time would leave me phone messages that he'd be preaching and inviting me to attend. As someone who'd never gone to church save for weddings and funerals, I did not jump at the opportunity. But eventually I decided it would be the polite thing to do, and with some trepidation agreed. The night before, he called to explain what to expect, including taking communion, which made me even more nervous. I knew that ritual only through extended family occasions in the Catholic Church where infidels like me could not and did not participate. He assured me that taking communion could be considered a symbolic breaking of bread together as a community, and did not demand belief in the literal ``blood of Christ.'' This was the first of many alternative insights to the Christian traditions and liturgy to which he introduced me. As someone whose understanding of Christian thought was arrested at the kindergarten level of God as a bearded man in the sky, this was an important awakening, and introduced me to a wide world of spiritual thought. With his guidance and lending of books from his library, I read many of the now classic and radical theological texts of the mid 20th century. I found an exciting, intellectually and spiritually stimulating pantheon including Tillich, Bonhoeffer, John Robinson, and more contemporarily, Alan Watts and John Spong. At the same time, I found a wonderfully accepting and warm band of people at the Lisbon church. I enjoyed with Brendan post-church conversations (and many while working in the woods or at the farm) about Christian-- and increasingly on my part, Buddhist--thought, and returning again and again to our shared love of the environment and what all this meant for activists and stewards. Eventually I left the Joint Commissions and started working for the Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust, a group I'd started. I asked Brendan if he'd consider becoming an advisor to ACT-- expecting him to say no, for given his high level career (in addition to his government work he'd been on the board of just about every major New England environmental organization) why bother with a little start up like ACT? But he graciously agreed. Now, Brendan chairs the ACT Lands Committee, and regularly works with us on forestry issues and with landowners who are considering conservation. Brendan is like one of his beloved stiff asters, the unusual plant that grows near the liquor store in Groveton, able to find nourishment in dry gravel, and subject of one of his most memorable sermons. His calling was to work with the underserved, and he found his parish in the great unruly life of the North Country, independent and fiercely neighborly. He also found his parish with the people working in conservation, including the game wardens he directed as ANR secretary and continues to have special regard for. He's done great service for our land and people, and I am tremendously grateful to have him as a friend, colleague, and mentor. Former Courier Editor Rebecca Brown is director of ACT, and serves as a NH State Representative. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO MIKE DONOGHUE Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's attention to the continued First Amendment advocacy of a Vermont journalist, Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press. The Vermont Press Association has presented Mike with the prestigious Matthew Lyon Award, for his staunch advocacy of First Amendment rights. Mike is a talented and seasoned reporter, and in more than 40 years as a staff writer at the Free Press he has covered local, State and national news, as well as sporting events--all, with integrity and vigor. He has shown a steadfast commitment to truth-telling, to getting the facts, and getting them right, for the people of Vermont. [[Page 11858]] While Mike has achieved noteworthy accomplishments and awards during his tenure at the Free Press, it is, especially, his work as an advocate and teacher of First Amendment protections that have drawn the distinction of the Matthew Lyon Award. He served two terms as president of the Vermont Press Association, where he worked to expand the use of cameras in Vermont courtrooms. As a founder of the Vermont Coalition for Open Government, he has provided testimony in front of the Vermont Legislature on a regular basis and on a variety of topics related to First Amendment rights. Mike not only is a veteran reporter and volunteer advocate but a dedicated educator as well. He is an adjunct professor of journalism at Saint Michael's College in Colchester--my alma mater--and he has trained young journalists throughout Vermont and New England as well as through the auspices of the New England Press Association, the New England Society of Newspaper Editors, and Investigative Reporters and Editors. His commitment to teaching and defending the tenets of the First Amendment led him to participate as a trainer in Ireland after the country passed its Freedom of Information Act in 1997. The Vermont Press Association each year offers the Matthew Lyon Award to an individual who has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to the First Amendment and to ``the public's right to know the truth in Vermont.'' It is named for Congressman Matthew Lyon, one of the foremost defenders of the Bill of Rights. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of Vermont, as well as Kentucky, beginning in the 5th Congress. Congressman Lyon is known for his time in jail-- and subsequent reelection during his sentence--on charges of sedition in 1798 for his sharp criticism of President John Adams. Throughout his career, Mike Donoghue has worked tirelessly to promote accountability of public officials, and transparency in government agencies. As an earlier recipient of this same award, I will always feel a special kinship in these efforts with champions like Mike Donoghue. I ask unanimous consent that this announcement from the Vermont Press Association about Mike Donoghue's selection for this award be printed into the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: BFP's Donoghue Wins VT Press 1st Amendment Award (By The Vermont Press Association, July 6, 2015) Montpelier.--Longtime journalist and educator Mike Donoghue of South Burlington has been selected to receive the Matthew Lyon Award for his lifetime commitment to the First Amendment and the public's right to know the truth in Vermont. The Vermont Press Association, which represents the interests of 11 daily and about four dozen non-daily newspapers circulating in Vermont, will honor Donoghue at its annual meeting and awards banquet at noon Thursday, July 16 at the Capitol Plaza in Montpelier. Donoghue, an award-winning veteran news and sports writer for the Burlington Free Press, is being recognized for efforts in his spare time working as an adjunct professor of journalism at St. Michael's College, as a longtime officer with the Vermont Press Association and his volunteer efforts with various groups including New England First Amendment Coalition (NEFAC), New England Newspaper and Press Association (NENPA) and the Society for Professional Journalists (SPJ). VPA President John Flowers said Donoghue has been on the front lines in seeking greater public accountability through a range of efforts, including that government officials and courts ensure records are easily available to the public, and that government meetings and court hearings are open to Vermonters. ``Mike's efforts in accountability journalism at the Burlington Free Press are well documented over several decades. But the Lyon award is focusing on his efforts in educating students, the public, government officials, and journalists--both for print and electronic media outlets. Mike is called upon frequently to speak in classrooms, in the community and at professional conferences from Vermont to Ireland.'' His work has helped improve both the open meeting law and public records law in Vermont, Flowers said. He noted it was while serving as VPA President in the mid-1980s that Donoghue helped lead the media efforts in successfully obtaining approval for cameras in Vermont Courts. St. Michael's College recruited Donoghue in 1985 to teach as an adjunct professor in the journalism department, where he still helps. He also served as an officer for the Vermont Press Association for 35 years until he resigned as its executive director earlier this year. Donoghue was instrumental in getting the VPA headquarters anchored at St. Michael's College. Donoghue serves on the executive board of NEFAC, a six- state effort promoting the First Amendment. He was on the New England Press Association Board of Directors and various committees 1995-2001. The Society of Professional Journalists appointed Donoghue in 1990 to serve as the Vermont chairman for Project Sunshine, a nationwide First Amendment effort--a volunteer hat he still wears. The VPA solicits nominations from Vermonters each year for the Lyon award, which honors people who have an unwavering devotion to the five freedoms within the First Amendment and to the principle that the public's right to know the truth is essential in a self-governed democracy, Flowers said. Donoghue has been named to five halls of fame. They include induction as one of 35 charter members selected by the New England Press Association for its Community Journalism Hall of Fame in 2000. Three years later he was named one of three charter members selected nationwide by the Society of Professional Journalists and The National Freedom of Information Coalition for their National Hall of Fame for Local Heroes. Other honors include the Yankee Quill Award in 2007 for a lifetime commitment to outstanding journalism in New England and beyond; selected the New England Journalist of the Year for print or electronic media in 2013; and voted by Gannett employees nationwide to receive ``Greater Good Award'' from the company in 2013. The Lyon Award is named for a former Vermont congressman who was jailed in 1798 under the Alien and Sedition Act for sending a letter to the editor, criticizing President John Adams. While Lyon was serving his federal sentence in a Vergennes jail, Vermonters re-elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives. Lyon is credited with ousting Adams when he cast the deciding vote in favor of Thomas Jefferson when the 1800 presidential race went to Congress for a final determination. Previous Matthew Lyon winners include Patrick J. Leahy for his work as a state prosecutor and U.S. senator; Edward J. Cashman for his efforts as Chittenden Superior Court clerk, a state prosecutor and state judge; Robert Hemley, for his many successful fights as a lawyer to keep courtrooms open and court files available to the public; Gregory Sanford, state archivist, for his work in maintaining, restoring and saving government records for public access; H. Allen Gilbert, executive director of ACLU in Vermont for fighting for greater public access to government records and for public disclosure about police misconduct; and Ken Squier and WDEV- radio for efforts to inform Vermonters about state and local issues. ____________________ VOTE EXPLANATION Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for votes on S. 1177, the Every Child Achieves Act from Monday, July 13, 2015, through Thursday, July 16, 2015. Had I been present I would have voted in favor of invoking cloture on the substitute amendment No. 2089, cloture on the amended underlying bill, and final passage of S. 1177. I also would have voted in favor of amendments Nos. 2132, 2162, and 2180. ____________________ EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is clear to me that No Child Left Behind was broken and that it was not serving the best interest of children in Michigan or the rest of the country. That is why I voted to support the passage of the Every Child Achieves Act, which moves away from high stakes testing and puts decisions on education back in the hands of our States, school districts, parents, and the teachers, who are in the best position to make those decisions. However, I continue to have reservations about the Every Child Achieves Act, particularly the changes to formulas that govern how resources are allocated. The bill as drafted will reduce the support that Michigan schools have for recruiting teachers and school leaders at the same time as it reduces support for their professional development. It also cuts the future resources dedicated to the education of the most [[Page 11859]] vulnerable low-income children in Michigan, sending that money to other States, using a formula that effectively rewards States for investing less in education. It is wrong to take resources away from one set of children and give them to another, and then call it equity. While I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from North Carolina to change his original amendment, the modified version would still have a negative impact on the children of Michigan. This is the reason I voted no on this amendment. As this bill continues to conference committee, I intend to continue to fight to ensure that every child in Michigan has the best possible access to quality public education and that Michigan is treated fairly in the funding formulas. ____________________ OLDER AMERICANS ACT Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to see that the Older Americans Act reauthorization passed the Senate last week. This law, which turns 50 years old this month, provides critical services like home-delivered meals, transportation, and elder abuse protections. I would like to thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for their efforts to pass this bill. I would also like to acknowledge the many organizations representing tens of millions of Americans who worked with me and my staff to get this bill passed, including the National Council on Aging, Meals on Wheels America, AARP, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and many others. While this bill is a good step forward, I would have preferred that it go much further. Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Shockingly, 1 in 5 seniors is living on an average income of $8,300 per year. We learned from the Government Accountability Office last month that nearly 4 million seniors experience food insecurity and do not know where their next meal will come from. Fewer than 10 percent of low-income seniors who need a meal delivered to their homes receive one. There are seniors across the country who may not have enough money to eat dinner tonight. For the generation that fought to defend democracy and built our great Nation, we must do everything we can to make sure that seniors do not go hungry. Older Americans should not have to choose between buying medicine or keeping a roof over their heads or having food on the table. Providing home-delivered meals--Meals on Wheels--for seniors is not only the right thing to do, it makes good economic sense. Why is that? If frail seniors do not get the nutrition they need, they are more likely to fall and break a hip and wind up in the hospital emergency room or in a nursing home. At the end of the day, investing in nutrition which keeps seniors healthy actually saves us money by keeping them out of the hospital. Since 2006 when the Older Americans Act was last reauthorized, the U.S. population over 60 has grown by about 30 percent. Has funding gone up by 30 percent? No. In fact, funding has been basically flat, and when you account for inflation, funding has actually decreased by about 12 percent. I strongly believe we should significantly expand funding for Older Americans Act programs. The truth is that the priorities we hold--treating seniors with respect, making sure seniors have the food they need--have the overwhelming support of the American people. These principles are among the foundations of a just and fair society where people look forward to growing old. I thank my Senate colleagues for their support of this important reauthorization bill. I hope that my colleagues in the House of Representatives take up and pass this bill swiftly so that it can become law without any further delay. ____________________ INNOVATION SCHOOLS DEMONSTRATION AUTHORITY Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am joined by the chair and ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to discuss one of my amendments, Whitehouse No. 2185, to the Every Child Achieves Act, which would establish an Innovation Schools Demonstration Authority. I thank them for their leadership on this important legislation and join them today to discuss the purpose of the amendment. Teachers and school leaders possess a unique understanding of the students and communities they serve. My amendment is intended to help schools address these unique needs through increased autonomy from local, State, and Federal regulations. In Rhode Island I have heard from school leaders who would like to extend the school day for struggling students, take ownership over school budgeting and financing or manage their school's human resources but are unable to do so because existing rules and regulations get in the way. The prospects of moving bureaucratic approaches at all three levels of government can be daunting, but this measure is designed to clear a path. Several States are already experimenting with increased school autonomy. In Massachusetts, where State law allows for innovation status, schools are already benefiting from regulatory flexibility. In Revere, MA, the Paul Revere Elementary School uses regulatory flexibility around staffing, budgeting, scheduling, and curriculum to operate a school model that emphasizes staff collaboration and differentiated instruction. In Falmouth, MA, the Lawrence School is using regulatory flexibility to improve its governance and decisionmaking structure in a way that emphasizes faculty input and satisfaction. In addition to Massachusetts, States as diverse as Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, and West Virginia have established State laws that promote innovation through autonomy. The Innovation Schools Demonstration Authority builds on these efforts by establishing a fast-track process to give public schools relief from the local, State, and Federal regulations that can be barriers to school-based innovation. The program is designed to serve existing public schools, specifically those where teachers, parents, administrators, and members of the community are working together to implement new, evidence-based models of teaching, learning, and school administration. When these existing schools are selected for innovation school designation, they will be able to obtain expedited relief from regulations that would otherwise prevent them from implementing their school vision. A key element of this program is that the whole school community wants to participate. Innovation schools must demonstrate support from administrators, parents, and at least two-thirds of the current teaching staff. They are encouraged to form advisory boards to bring community expertise from businesses, higher education, and community groups, among others, into school planning, operations, and oversight. And, importantly, innovation schools will remain part of their local education authority, serving as laboratories for experimentation, the benefits of which can serve as a model for other schools in the district. Mrs. MURRAY. I thank Senator Whitehouse. As ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I support this amendment, which establishes a process for educators in traditional public schools to pursue innovative, community-inspired strategies to improve education. My home State of Washington has benefited from educator-initiated innovation through the Washington Innovative Schools Program. I am proud to say that we now have almost thirty designated innovative schools that are pursuing creative and innovative educational ideas with a high level of parent and community involvement. And while providing room for innovation is important, it is also essential that we maintain important Federal safeguards. This is why under this amendment, innovation schools must still [[Page 11860]] comply with part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This program will ensure that we balance the need for flexibility while maintaining strong accountability. Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Senator Whitehouse for his work on this amendment. The thinking behind the Innovation Schools Demonstration Authority is consistent with the approach we have taken throughout the Every Child Achieves Act: returning more decisionmaking authority back to our 100,000 public schools and promoting greater flexibility in achieving high standards. This pilot program would allow for the creation of autonomous schools that would operate under the same accountability standards as other schools in the school district; however, these innovation schools would be granted flexibility to increase student achievement in innovative ways to best serve the needs of their students. Through increased autonomy and flexibility, innovation schools may see some of the same demonstrated successes as charter schools. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Ranking Member Murray and Chairman Alexander for their support. I hope this measure will meet all of our expectations and create great examples of innovative, student-centered public schools. ____________________ RECOGNIZING ST. MARY OF THE ASSUMPTION CATHOLIC CHURCH UPON ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church in the German Village neighborhood of Columbus, OH, as it celebrates its 150th anniversary. In 1865, St. Mary initially operated under the leadership of Rev. Francis S. Specht in a building that featured a one-room church, one-room school and second- story rectory. In 1866, the parishioners began construction on a German-gothic inspired church. In 1893, the parishioners built the iconic steeple, which rises to 197 feet and still stands tall today. The parish is home to more than 500 families, with parishioners from 5 different counties in Ohio. St. Mary also hosts more than 50 weddings each year and has approximately 230 students enrolled in prekindergarten through the eighth grade. The parish mission is ``to be of one mind and heart with the Church by loving God with all our heart, all our mind, all our strength, all our soul; and by loving our neighbor as ourselves.'' St. Mary fulfills its mission by supporting the needs of its congregation, hosting community activities, and educating its students. Nearly 95 percent of the students at St. Mary have been fortunate enough to receive tuition assistance. I am here today to honor St. Mary of the Assumption and its congregation. I congratulate all who were involved in making its first 150 years a success. ____________________ ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS F_____ RECOGNIZING THE BOBBY FAMILY OF ROSCOE, SOUTH DAKOTA Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Bobby family from Roscoe, SD, for their work in railroad service. Roger, Duane, Albert, Bill, and Dale--led by their late father LaVern Bobby-- have served a combined total of 232 years with the railroad industry. The six men have worked with Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroads, all serving in the Maintenance of Way department throughout their careers. Following LaVern, who joined railroad service in 1955 after serving on a U.S. Navy destroyer in World War II, the Bobby boys have dedicated their lives to the railroad. Their railroad service has spanned across a variety of Midwestern States, including South Dakota, Minnesota, and Illinois. They have made many sacrifices, frequently traveling, moving, and leaving their families at home to fulfill their duties with the railroad. The entire Bobby family deserves recognition for their hard work ethic, patriotism, and service to the railroad system. I extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Bobby family for their dedication to an industry that is vital to our economy by connecting our country and transporting goods. I hope that the Bobby legacy will continue to thrive with the generations to come. ____________________ MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries. ____________________ EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate messages from the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate committees. (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate proceedings.) ____________________ PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE ______ REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13581 ON JULY 24, 2011--PM21 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, is to continue in effect beyond July 24, 2015. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons. The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 with respect to transnational criminal organizations. Barack Obama. The White House, July 21, 2015. ____________________ MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the [[Page 11861]] following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate: H.R. 2898.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to eliminate the current ban on crude oil exports; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 94 Whereas, the efficient exploration, production, and transportation of oil in Louisiana prevents waste of the state's natural resources; contributes to the health, welfare, and safety of the general public; and promotes the prosperity of the state; and Whereas, the tax revenues and economic prosperity deriving from this Louisiana energy renaissance have greatly benefitted Louisiana public schools, higher education, critical infrastructure development, and public health and safety programs; and Whereas, improved technologies and abundant resources have made the United States of America the world's leading oil and natural gas producer, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia; and Whereas, the 1970s-era federal law prohibiting crude oil exports is a relic from an era of scarcity and flawed price control policies; and Whereas, allowing American crude oil exports will strengthen U.S. geopolitical influence by giving our trading partners a more secure source of supply, and allowing the export of American crude oil will make our allies less dependent on crude oil from Russia and the Middle East; and Whereas, the world's other major developed nations allow crude oil exports, making the U.S. the only nation that does not take full advantage of trading a valuable resource in what is an otherwise global free market; and Whereas, crude oil exports will benefit the U.S.'s national security interests by decreasing the likelihood that global oil supply can be used internationally as a strategic weapon; and Whereas, numerous studies have found that allowing American crude oil into the world's free market will benefit U.S. trade and American consumers while creating more high-paying jobs for Louisianians; and Whereas, the U.S. is the largest exporter of refined petroleum products and would benefit even more substantially from the export [[Page 11863]] of both crude oil and refined petroleum products; and Whereas, at least seven independent studies have confirmed that repealing the ban on American crude oil exports will lower U.S. gas prices, benefitting Louisiana consumers and businesses; and Whereas, many small and large Louisiana businesses that support oil and gas development will benefit from ongoing production; and Whereas, manufacturers will benefit from less volatility in energy costs; and Whereas, encouraging a global marketplace that is more free from artificial barriers will economically benefit Louisiana, the rest of the U.S., and our friends around the world: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to recognize that crude oil exports and free trade are in the national interest and take all necessary steps to eliminate the current ban on crude oil exports; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-51.

A bill to require agencies to publish the categorization of certain proposed and final rules, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Regulatory Impact Scale on the Economy Small Business Act, also known as the RISE Act. One of Congress's most fundamental responsibilities is to provide oversight to [[Page 11866]] its vast regulatory structure, particularly as it pertains to small businesses. However, Congress lacks the proper framework to effectively monitor the impact of regulatory activity on small businesses. Today, there is no transparent, standardized means to realize the economic scale of regulatory rules, either proposed or finalized, to frame their economic significance on a comparative basis. Likewise, the American public also has no means to effectively gauge and monitor the significance of regulatory rules. With the current lack of scale, there is no means to categorically delineate between a ``big regulation'' and a ``really big regulation,'' resulting in less effective oversight. In addition, agencies wield tremendous discretionary power in determining whether required small business analysis applies. Today, regulatory flexibility analysis is triggered when a proposed rule is determined by the issuing agency to have a ``significant economic impact'' on a substantial number of small entities. However, Congress has provided no bright-line standard to determine what constitutes significant economic impact, allowing agencies to exercise an unnecessary amount of leniency to bypass regulatory flexibility analysis, which is meant to give special consideration to small businesses. To improve both Congress and public's ability to provide regulatory oversight, I recommend that Congress should require agencies to categorize each proposed and final rule based on the following categories of economic impact: category 1 between $100 million and $500 million; category 2 between $500 million and $1 billion; category 3 between $1 billion and $5 billion; category 4 between $5 billion and $10 billion; and category 5 at $10 billion and over. To disallow agencies from abusing broad discretionary power, Congress should establish a bright-line standard for ``significant economic impact'' of $100 million. Providing such guidance will provide accountability and consistency across the vast regulatory structure and provide efficiencies for Congress. I believe this important piece of legislation will provide clarity and direction for our regulatory efforts, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1807 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Impact Scale on the Economy Small Business Act of 2015'' or the ``RISE Small Business Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. CATEGORIZATION OF RULES. Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(f) Categorization of Rules.-- ``(1) In general.--Before an agency promulgates a proposed or final rule that the agency determines is likely to have an annual effect on the economy of not less than $100,000,000, the agency shall-- ``(A) assign the rule to the applicable category described in paragraph (2) based on the highest possible annual effect that the agency determines the proposed or final rule is likely to have on the economy; and ``(B) publish in the Federal Register the assigned category for the rule. ``(2) Categories.--A proposed or final rule is a-- ``(A) category 1 rule, if the agency determines that the rule is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of not less than $100,000,000 and not more than $499,999,999; ``(B) category 2 rule, if the agency determines that the rule is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of not less than $500,000,000 and not more than $999,999,999; ``(C) category 3 rule, if the agency determines that the rule is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of not less than $1,000,000,000 and not more than $4,999,999,999; ``(D) category 4 rule, if the agency determines that the rule is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of not less than $5,000,000,000 and not more than $9,999,999,999; and ``(E) category 5 rule, if the agency determines that the rule is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of not less than $10,000,000,000. ``(3) Submission to oira.--Each agency shall, on an annual basis, submit to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs a list of the rules, by category, that the agency published in the Federal Register under paragraph (1) during the preceding year. ``(4) Publication on oira website.--Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs receives a list of rules from an agency under paragraph (3), the Administrator shall publish on [www.reginfo.gov](http://www.reginfo.gov)-- ``(A) the list of rules received from the agency under paragraph (3); and ``(B) an estimate of the costs and benefits of each rule included on the list.''. SEC. 3. DEFINING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR INITIAL AND FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSES. Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in paragraph 6, by striking ``and'' at the end; (2) in paragraph 7, by striking the period at the end and inserting a semicolon; (3) in paragraph 8-- (A) by striking ``Recordkeeping'' and all that follows through ``The'' and inserting ``the''; and (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (4) by adding at the end the following: ``(9) the term `significant economic impact' means an annual economic effect of not less than $100,000,000.''. ____________________ SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS ______ SENATE RESOLUTION 224--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE AREA BETWEEN THE INTERSECTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE, NORTHWEST AND VAN NESS STREET, NORTHWEST AND INTERNATIONAL DRIVE, NORTHWEST AND INTERNATIONAL PLACE, NORTHWEST IN WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, SHOULD BE DESIGNATED AS ``LIU XIAOBO PLAZA'' Mr. CRUZ (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs: S.

Res. 226 Whereas Fidel Castro and Raul Castro have been the autocratic rulers of the Republic of Cuba for 56 years; Whereas Fidel Castro and Raul Castro have relentlessly and consistently oppressed any efforts to bring democratic freedoms and human rights to the people of the Republic of Cuba for this 56-year period; Whereas Oswaldo Paya was a Cuban political dissident dedicated to promoting democratic freedoms and human rights in the Republic of Cuba; Whereas the Communist Party of Cuba has always viewed such commitment to freedom as a threat to its existence; Whereas on July 22, 2012, a violent car crash, widely believed to have been carried out by the Castro regime, took the lives of Paya and Harold Cepero, another dissident; Whereas the official investigation into the crash has been demonstrated to be compromised and the Castro regime has offered no plausible evidence of its innocence, leaving the circumstances of the death of Paya unknown; Whereas opposition by Paya to the Communist Party of Cuba began at a young age, when he refused to become a member of the Young Communist League as a primary school student, and continued through high school when he publically criticized the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union; Whereas the Communist Party of Cuba responded to the opposition by Paya to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union by sending Paya to a labor camp for 3 years; Whereas Paya forewent a chance to escape the Republic of Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, deciding instead to continue the fight for democracy in the Republic of Cuba, saying, ``This is what I am supposed to be, this is what I have to do.''; Whereas by creating the Varela Project in 1998, Paya demonstrated his staunch commitment to peacefully advocating for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly for his fellow Cubans; Whereas in recognition of his determination for political reforms through peaceful protests, Paya was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament in 2002, the W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award from the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs in 2003, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by former Czech President Vaclav Havel in 2005; and Whereas renaming the street in front of the Embassy of the Republic of Cuba in the District of Columbia after Paya serves as an expression of solidarity between the people of the United States and the people of the Republic of Cuba who are engaged in a long, non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that-- (1) the street between the intersections of 16th Street, Northwest and Fuller Street, Northwest and 16th Street, Northwest and Euclid Street, Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, should be designated as ``Oswaldo Paya Way'', and any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record to that area should be deemed to be a reference to ``Oswaldo Paya Way''; (2) the address of 2630 16th Street, Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia, should be redesignated as 2630 Oswaldo Paya Way, and any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to that address should be deemed to be a reference to 2630 Oswaldo Paya Way; and (3) the Administrator of General Services should construct street signs that-- (A) contain the phrase ``Oswaldo Paya Way''; (B) are similar in design to the signs used by Washington, District of Columbia, to designate the location of Metro stations; and (C) should be placed on-- (i) the parcel of Federal property that is closest to Oswaldo Paya Way (as described in paragraph (2)); and (ii) the street corners of 16th Street, Northwest and Fuller Street, Northwest and 16th Street, Northwest and Euclid Street, Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia. ____________________ SENATE RESOLUTION 227--CONDEMNING THE ATTACKS OF JULY 16, 2015, IN CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE, HONORING THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO LOST THEIR LIVES, AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT AND PRAYERS FOR ALL THOSE AFFECTED Mr. CORKER (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Booker, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burr, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Daines, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Ernst, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Flake, Mr. Franken, Mr. Gardner, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Heller, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Markey, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moran, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Paul, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Peters, Mr. Portman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Sasse, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Scott, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Udall, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: S.

(2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following definitions apply: (A) Small business concern.-- (i) In general.--The term ``small business concern'' means a small business concern (as the term is used in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).

(B) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.-- The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged individuals'' has the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection. (3) Amounts for small business concerns.--Except to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent of the amounts made available for any program under title I of this Act and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, shall be expended through small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

SEC. 10205. POSTHUMOUS PARDON. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, and controversial figure in the history of the United States who challenged racial biases. (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to parents who were former slaves. (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled throughout the United States, fighting White and African- American heavyweights. (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns. (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World. (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great white hope''. (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada. (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed the ``Battle of the Century''. (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the United States. (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites. (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White women. (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose''. (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter. (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann Act. (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, and then married Jack Johnson. (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson had transported her across States lines for the purpose of ``prostitution and debauchery''. (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison. (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and various European and South American countries. (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915. (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July 1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title. (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause. (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946. (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame. (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, 111th Congress, agreed to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th Congress that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon for his racially-motivated 1913 conviction. (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon-- (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the annals of criminal justice in the United States; and (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural contributions of Jack Johnson to society.

VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I stand before you today to pay tribute to the victims of the S.S. Eastland disaster, which occurred in Chicago 100 years ago. On the centennial of this solemn event, the family of one of the victims, Anna Kubiak, will lay down a ceremonial wreath in remembrance of Anna and the other victims of the disaster. The S.S. Eastland Memorial dedication ceremony will take place at the Old Lighthouse Museum in Michigan City, Indiana, on July 25, 2015. The S.S. Eastland disaster occurred on the morning of July 24, 1915, near the Clark Street Bridge in Chicago, Illinois. The S.S. Eastland was chartered by the Western Electric Company to transport employees, families, and friends across Lake Michigan to Michigan City for a day of celebration that was to include food, a parade, sporting events, and other festivities. Unfortunately, the S.S. Eastland never left the Chicago River that tragic morning. While the S.S. Eastland was still docked, it slowly began to roll over into the river with more than 2,500 passengers and crew members on board. Eight hundred and forty-four people lost their lives in the disaster, including twenty-two complete families, and many more were injured. The immense loss sustained that day will be recalled by generations to come, and the tragedy of that fateful morning will be remembered as one of the most catastrophic maritime events in American history. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commemorating the centennial anniversary of the S.S. Eastland disaster. We honor the victims and their families as we remember this devastating day in our nation's history. I would like to commend the efforts of the many people who dedicated their time and efforts to make the S.S. Eastland Memorial dedication ceremony possible. ____________________ RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NORTHWEST FLORIDA'S MARION CLIFTON ``M.C.'' DAVIS ______ HON. JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and legacy of Northwest Florida's Marion Clifton ``M.C.'' Davis, who lost his battle with lung cancer on July 11, 2015. A longtime resident of Walton County, Florida, M.C. had an abiding love for Northwest Florida. He dedicated much of his life to preserving the Gulf Coast's natural beauty for current generations and future generations to come, and the Northwest Florida community mourns his passing. Born October 18, 1944 in Douglas, Georgia, M.C. graduated with a Political Science degree from the University of North Carolina in 1970 and his J.D. from Samford Law School in 1973. After an immensely successful business career, which saw him pursue many different career paths, M.C. decided to use his success to help restore and preserve the land that he loved. Northwest Florida is blessed with immense biological and ecological diversity, with a high concentration of plants and wildlife alike, and in 2000, M.C. purchased more than 50,000 acres of land in Walton County to create the Nokuse Plantation, the largest privately held nature preserve east of the Mississippi River. As a result of his dedication to conservation, M.C. has helped lead efforts to restore several native plant and animal species, including longleaf pine, which once blanketed millions of acres in the Southeast, and gopher tortoises, which are listed by the state as a threatened species. In addition, countless plants and animals from diverse parts of nature can be found on Nokuse Plantation, including eagles, ospreys, bobcats, foxes, raccoons and armadillos, among others. Indeed, M.C. has called this project a 300-year effort to help restore the full biological wealth bestowed on Northwest Florida. Nokuse Plantation also sits in a critical area of Northwest Florida, serving as a link between several important sites, including Eglin Air Force Base Reserve, Blackwater River State Forest and the Conecuh National Forest. By helping to preserve this critical resource, Nokuse Plantation also helps ensure that sufficient base buffering exists to support critical military missions at Eglin Air Force Base. In addition to his work establishing Nokuse Plantation, M.C. also founded the E.O. Wilson Biophilia Center. Located on the Nokuse Plantation, the E.O. Wilson Biophilia Center provides students in the 4th through 7th grades, as well as their teachers, the opportunity to study in one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the United States. Each year, more than 5,000 students from across Northwest Florida study at the E.O. Wilson Biophilia Center, which helps integrate into the State of Florida's curriculum, particularly in the important Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Throughout his life, M.C. touched the lives of many and without question, his generosity and commitment to nature will be felt in Northwest Florida for many generations to come. While many will remember M.C. for his dedication to preserving Northwest Florida's natural beauty, to those who knew him best, M.C. will be remembered as a loving husband, father, and grandfather. On behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged to recognize the life of M.C. Davis. My wife Vicki and I extend our heartfelt prayers and condolences to his wife and high school sweetheart, Stella; his children Crystal, Lisa, and Wendy; his granddaughters, Claire, Alex, Julia, Mary-Shelton; and the entire Davis family. ____________________ CELEBRATING ELOISE BRONAK'S 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER of missouri in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mrs. Eloise Bronak on her 100th Birthday, which she will be celebrating on July 28, 2015. Eloise Bronak was born in Decatur, Illinois. She has lived in Texas and Michigan, and eventually settled in St. Clair, MO. For the past seven years, she has lived at Willow Brooke Assisted Living Facility in Union, MO. Eloise served our nation during World War II as a Navy nurse. In 1944, Eloise joined the Navy as a registered nurse, but was unable to serve overseas due to her height. ``They wouldn't let me go overseas because I was too little--I couldn't stretch enough,'' she joked. ``I was to take what was left over.'' During her service of three years in the Navy, Eloise took care of wounded soldiers who returned to the United States. After her time in the service, she continued to serve in the medical field by working in public health, at the medical department at Chrysler in St. Louis, MO, and in health care in St. Louis County. Eloise had the opportunity to see the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. with the Franklin County Honor Flight. Birthdays are a very special time. It's a time to come together and celebrate your life and accomplishments and recognize the impact that you have had on the lives of those around you. I ask you in joining me in recognizing Eloise Bronak on this momentous occasion. ____________________ RECOGNIZING VIETNAM VETERANS ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF THE VIETNAM WAR ______ HON. DANIEL T. KILDEE of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask the United States House of Representatives to join me in [[Page 12093]] recognizing the veterans of the Vietnam War on the 50th anniversary of the start of the conflict. U.S. ground combat operations began in South Vietnam in 1965, with the last troops being pulled out in May 1975. Over three and a half million Americans served in Vietnam during that period, and more than 58,000 lost their lives. It is my honor to recognize the veterans of Vietnam and their families for their patriotism and sacrifice. While this anniversary presents a clear opportunity to remember the sacrifices of our veterans, I want to make sure our nation does not forget their contributions in the generations to come. The immense perseverance and bravery of our soldiers both in the face of conflict and in the decades following exemplify the American commitment to service and democracy. We owe these veterans our profoundest gratitude. I would particularly like to recognize the contributions of Michigan veterans. Over 400,000 men and women of our state served in the Vietnam War, with 2,654 paying the ultimate sacrifice. On July 18th, we honor our state's veterans at the Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly, Michigan. It is my honor to represent many of these men and women, and my duty to respectfully preserve their memories with the same dedication with which these veterans defended our freedoms. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the veterans of Vietnam and extend my deepest appreciation to them for their years of service to our great country. ____________________ THE GOLDMAN ACT TO RETURN ABDUCTED AMERICAN CHILDREN: ENSURING ACCURATE NUMBERS AND ADMINISTRATION ACTION ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of everyone--especially all of the left-behind parents I saw in the audience--for joining me at a hearing I held last week to discuss how the U.S. Department of State's first annual report under the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act can better correspond with the mandate set by Congress and achieve the return of abducted American children, which is the ultimate objective of the Goldman Act. Every year, an estimated 1,000 American children are unlawfully removed from their homes by one of their parents and taken across international borders. International parental child abduction rips children from their homes and families and whisks them away to a foreign land, alienating them from the love and care of the parent and family left behind. Child abduction is child abuse, and it continues to plague families across the United States. For decades, the State Department has used ``quiet diplomacy'' to attempt to bring these children home. But we know that less than half of these children ever come home--even from countries that have signed the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. In a hearing I held on this issue back in 2009, former Assistant Secretary of State Bernie Aronson called quiet diplomacy ``a sophisticated form of begging.'' Thousands of American families still ruptured and grieving from years of unresolved abductions confirm that ``quiet diplomacy'' is gravely inadequate. Last year, Congress unanimously passed the Goldman Act to give teeth to requests for return and access. The actions required by the law escalate in severity, and range from official protests through diplomatic channels, to extradition, to the suspension of development, security, or other foreign assistance. The Goldman Act is a law calculated to get results, as we did in the return of Sean Goldman from Brazil in late December, 2009. But the new law is only as good as its implementation. The State Department's first annual report that we reviewed last week is the first step in moving past ``quiet diplomacy'' to results. The State Department must get this report right in order to trigger the actions above and for the law to be an effective tool. Countries should be listed as worst offenders if they have high numbers of cases--30 percent or more--that have been pending over a year: or if their judicial or administrative branch, or central authority for abduction fail in their duties under the Hague Convention or other controlling agreement, or; if their law enforcement rarely fails to enforce return orders or access rights. Once these countries are properly classified, the Secretary of State then determines which of the aforementioned actions the U.S. will apply to the country in order to encourage the timely resolution of abduction and access cases. While the State Department has choice of which tools to apply, and can waive actions for up to 180 days, the State Department does not have discretion over whether to report accurately to Congress on the country's record, or on whether the country is objectively non- compliant. As we have seen in the human trafficking context--I authored the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 as well as the Goldman Act-- accurate accounting of a country's record, especially in comparison with other countries, can do wonders to prod much needed reform. Accurate reporting is also critical to family court judges across the country and parents considering their child's travel to a foreign country where abduction or access problems are a risk. The stakes are high: misleading or incomplete information could mean the loss of another American child to abduction. For example, a judge might look at the report table filled with zeros in the unresolved cases category--such as in the case of Japan-- and erroneously conclude that a country is not of concern, giving permission to an estranged spouse to travel with the child for a vacation. The estranged spouse then abducts the child and the left- behind parent spends his or her life savings and many years trying to get the child returned to the U.S. All of which could have been avoided with accurate reporting on the danger. I am very concerned that the first annual report contains major gaps and even misleading information, especially when it comes to countries with which we have the most intractable abduction cases. For instance, the report indicates that India, which has consistently been in the top five destinations for abducted American children, had 19 new cases in 2014, 22 resolved cases, and no unresolved cases. However, we know from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC, that India has 53 open abduction cases--and that 51 have been pending for more than 1 year. While the State Department has shown willingness to work constructively on making the report better--for example, meeting last week with staff--our June 11 hearing left many questions unanswered as to why this report failed to hold countries accountable for unresolved cases. We wrote the law with the belief that the State Department was formally raising these cases by name with the foreign ministries of destination countries, and asked that cases still pending one year after being raised would be counted as ``unresolved.'' But these cases were not included in the report. A few parents who reported their cases to the State Department years ago and who have been consistently begging the Department for help were told by their case officers recently that the cases were formally communicated to India in May of 2015. May of 2015--delay is denial. The Goldman Act also requires the State Department to take actions against countries such as India and Japan if they refuse to resolve abduction and access cases. The Goldman Act also requires the State Department to begin negotiations with countries like India and Japan for a bilateral agreement to secure the resolution of the more than 100 open cases we have pending with those two countries--cases that are not listed as ``unresolved'' in the report. The Goldman Act requires an end to the status quo--but the first step toward change is telling the truth in the report. Which is why I am so concerned that Japan was not listed as showing a persistent failure to work with the U.S. on abduction cases. Japan has never issued and enforced a return order for a single one of the hundreds of American children abducted there. It holds the world record on the abduction of American children never returned. And yet it got a pass on more than 50 open cases, most of which have been pending for 5 years or more. Among such cases is that of Sgt. Michael Elias, who has not seen his children, Jade and Michael Jr., since 2008. Michael served as a Marine who saw combat in Iraq. His wife, who worked in the Japanese consulate, used documents fraudulently obtained with the apparent complicity of Japanese consulate personnel to kidnap their children, then aged 4 and 2, in defiance of a court order, telling Michael on a phone call that there was nothing that he could do, as ``my country will protect me.'' [[Page 12094]] Her country, very worried about its designation in the new report, sent a high-level delegation in March to meet with Ambassador Jacobs and explain why Japan should be excused from being listed as ``non- compliant,'' despite the fact that more than one year after signing the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Japan has ordered zero returns to the U.S. Just before the report was released in May--two weeks late--Takashi Okada, Deputy Director General in the Secretariat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the Japanese Diet that he had been in consultation with the State Department and ``because we strived to make an explanation to the U.S. side, I hope that the report contents will be based on our country's efforts.'' In other words, Japan understood it would get a pass from the State Department and escape the list of countries facing action by the U.S. for their failure to resolve abduction cases based on what Mr. Okada euphemistically refers to as ``efforts,'' not results. Sgt. Michael Elias's country has utterly failed to protect him. He has seen zero progress in his case over the last year--the 7th year of his heart-wrenching ordeal--and yet the State Department cannot even bring itself to hold Japan accountable by naming Japan a worst offender in the annual report. The Goldman Act is clear: All requests for return that the State Department submitted to the foreign ministry and that remained unresolved 12 months later are to be counted against Japan--and followed up with action. The Goldman Act has given the State Department new and powerful tools to bring Japan, and other countries, to the resolution table. The goal is not to disrupt relations but to heal the painful rifts caused by international child abduction. The question still remains, will the State Department use the Goldman Act as required by law? ____________________ RECOGNIZING COLLIN HORAN FOR EXCEPTIONAL COMMUNITY SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE NORTH POINT VETERANS PROGRAM ______ HON. BILL SHUSTER of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Collin Horan, a Greencastle-Antrim Middle School student, for his dedicated service to the North Point Veterans Program. Mr. Horan chose to work with the North Point Veteran's Home, a housing, employment, independent living, and recovery-oriented service provider for displaced veterans, out of a sense of gratitude for our former service members, and given his family's ties to the military. After speaking with the home's 23 current residents, Mr. Horan set out with the help and support of his parents, Don and Lauren Horan, to provide the veterans with an impressive donation, which included home living essentials like towels and toiletry items, as well as significant funds for the home to purchase a refrigerator and laptop computer. Garnering support from the members of St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Funkstown and a number of local businesses, Mr. Horan worked tirelessly and even overcame a health setback to complete the service project in conjunction with his church confirmation. It is my honor to recognize Mr. Horan, a selfless young man, and congratulate him for his committed service to the North Point Veteran's Home, our country's service members, and his local community. ____________________ RECOGNIZING DR. RON KRUSE FOR HIS RETIREMENT ______ HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER of missouri in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent of mine, Dr. Ron Kruse. He retired as Executive Director from the Developmental Services of Franklin County on June 8, 2015. Dr. Kruse has contributed to the county for 28 years. Dr. Kruse was the first employee and executive director hired in 1987, and under his leadership DSFC expanded to a team of 142 employees. He served 38 years in the field, 28 of those serving the people of Franklin County with developmental disabilities. His work provided case management at the local level by developing the Franklin County Dental Network, Behavioral Services Early Intervention programming, and by partnering with county agencies to meet the residents' transportation needs. This showcases his ability to make a positive impact and leave behind a strong legacy with an organization that provides quality, innovative services. DSFC enhances employment opportunities, educational and developmental programs, family support programs, and community living options. The organization also promotes public awareness and community collaboration to serve individuals with developmental disabilities, such as Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, Autism, or a similar condition diagnosed before the age of 22. Thanks to Dr. Kruse's efforts, Franklin County will continue to move in the right direction for people with development disabilities. With this retirement, Dr. Ron Kruse can now spend more time with his family which includes: his wife Pamela, daughters Jill and Kate, and grandson Ellis. I ask you to join me in recognizing Dr. Ron Kruse on his retirement after 28 years of commitment to his community. ____________________ HONORING MR. ROY LEE SEAY ______ HON. KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Roy Lee Seay, who has been honored for his services in the Vietnam War. Through his service in the United States Army, Mr. Seay earned several medals and awards such as the Bronze Star, the Army Commendation Medal with one Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, the National Defense Service Medal, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Marksman Badge with Auto Rifle Bar, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal with ``60'' device. Mr. Seay was also recently surprised to find out he has been recognized with the following awards: the Silver Star, the Vietnam Service Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, the Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle and Machinegun Bars, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unity Citation with Palm Device. Mr. Seay was born July 12, 1947, in Mer Rogue, Louisiana to the late Robert Seay and Elizabeth Seay. In October 1970, roughly eight months after returning from the war, Mr. Seay and his wife, Maggie Seay, moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he worked for Food Machinery Corporation/United Defense Industries for twenty-nine years until his retirement in 1999. Mr. Seay is a dedicated member of his church, New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Minneapolis, where he also works as a Sunday School Teacher. Mr. Seay's family is of utmost importance to him. He is the proud father of three daughters: Debra Brinkley, Sandra Moore, and Lawanda Moore; and one son: Lonnie LaValias. I wish to congratulate Mr. Seay and his entire family, on a lifetime of service--to his county, to his family, and to his community. Thank you, Roy, for your service. ____________________ DIGNIFIED INTERMENT OF OUR VETERANS ACT ______ HON. BILL SHUSTER of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on an issue plaguing our nation's veterans, and to thank two of my constituents from Fayette County, Mr. Lanny Golden, a Vietnam Veteran, and Mr. Ron Metros, a member of Rolling Thunder's Pennsylvania Chapter 5, for working with me on legislation to return dignity and respect to our country's heroes. There are an estimated 47,000 unclaimed veteran remains that have been left to collect dust on funeral home shelves because the next of kin has not or could not be identified. Existing legislation directs the Veteran Affairs Administration, veteran service organizations, and funeral directors to work together in identifying veteran status for the deceased and making every effort to locate the next of kin. Unfortunately, there are a host of barriers that prevent effective collaboration among these stakeholders. For example, in my state of Pennsylvania, the Missing in America Project found nearly 100 unclaimed veterans within a couple years' time. Some of those veterans were sitting on shelves for more than 20 years awaiting burial. We can speculate regarding the reason for this disgrace but we cannot know for sure [[Page 12095]] without giving this issue the attention it deserves. That is why I have introduced H.R. 1338 ``Dignified Interment of Our Veterans Act of 2015.'' My bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study on matters relating to the claiming and interring of unclaimed veteran remains. The intent of the study is to confirm the scope of this problem, uncover any barriers associated with claiming and interring veteran remains, and solicit recommendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs on potential program improvements. This is the first step in returning honor to our country's heroes. Again, I would like to thank Mr. Metros and Mr. Golden for their dedicated work in service to our country's veterans. When asked why he is so passionate about this issue, Mr. Golden, who served with the First Air Cavalry Division during the Vietnam War, simply replied that these are his Brothers in Arms and they deserve to be buried beside those that have walked the same path. I fully agree with Mr. Golden and would like to say thank you to all who have served this great nation. I will make every effort to ensure your final resting place be of dignity and honor. We will not forget you. ____________________ HONORING JUDGE MICHAEL POLLARD ______ HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA of arizona in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, today I wish to recognize the hard work of Judge Michael Pollard and his tremendous impact on the Tucson community. His selfless work for the American people started when he was drafted into the United States Marine Corps in 1967. He was assigned to the Echo Company 2nd Battalion 4th Marines, proudly serving his country in Vietnam. Following his time in the military, Judge Pollard graduated from the University of Arizona, College of Law in 1972. He then worked tirelessly in private practice as a prosecutor and public defender for 20 years before being appointed as a Tucson City Court magistrate in 1994. Since that appointment, Judge Pollard has worked relentlessly to improve his community through his service on various committees, including as chair of the Arizona Supreme Court Committee on the Impact of Domestic Violence in the Courts, as the state judicial representative to the Arizona Full Faith and Credit Team, and as co- chair of the Tucson/Pima County Homeless Plan Implementation Task Force, continuing to direct homeless courts in the region. Judge Pollard's most recent contribution to Tucson can be found in his honorable and dedicated work with his fellow veterans. In 2009, along with a handful of other judges, he developed the Regional Municipalities Veterans Treatment Court. This organization works to provide veterans an opportunity to avoid jail time and clear any misdemeanor charges they may have on their record. In return, the veteran must complete court-mandated rehabilitation and support courses, many times working with the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System and other local organizations that provide those services. Since its inception, this program has allowed over 600 veterans to work towards a healthy, clean lifestyle without the difficulties of possessing a criminal record. Thanks to Judge Pollard and his team, countless veterans have been able to move past their misdemeanors and progress to non-violent, healthy lives. He sees these misdemeanors not as permanent hardships, but as potential turning points for those who accept them. He provides a second chance for those who have fought for our country, and for this I am grateful. Judge Pollard demonstrates an individual who truly works for the betterment of his community, both among Tucsonans and his fellow veterans. ____________________ IN TRIBUTE TO UMOS ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON. GWEN MOORE of wisconsin in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to UMOS, a nationally renowned agency whose corporate headquarters is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In July, 2015, UMOS will celebrate its 50th Anniversary. UMOS began as a single-focused, single state, migrant and seasonal farm worker serving agency only. Today, UMOS offers various programs and services to diverse populations with a diverse staff. Currently, UMOS employs 300 people and operates 40+ programs with more than $25 million grant and performance-based contracts from federal, state, and local funding sources. UMOS operates programs throughout the state of Wisconsin, as well as in Minnesota, Missouri, and Texas, along with a housing consortium in an eight-state area. It provides programs and services in three major categories: workforce development, child development, and social services including: farm labor, housing, HIV prevention services, domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking supportive services, home energy assistance, food pantry and Head Start. In addition to these programs, UMOS sponsors and organizes a number of cultural and community events in Wisconsin. Much of the success of UMOS can be attributed to its longtime President and Chief Executive Officer, Lupe Martinez. He has led the agency for over 40 years and spent most of his professional career at UMOS. Mr. Martinez is dedicated to advocating and providing programs and services to improve employment, provide education opportunities as well as health and housing supports for UMOS' clientele whether they are migrant and seasonal farm workers or other underserved populations. Lupe Martinez has always gravitated toward leadership roles even as a child; he was one of 10 siblings in a family of migrant workers and accepted the responsibility of paying bills and managing the family finances. Today he manages the largest Hispanic nonprofit organization in Wisconsin and one of the largest in the nation. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say the UMOS hails from the 4th Congressional District, and pleased to give praise to Lupe Martinez, their Board of Directors and staff. I wish them many more years of success. ____________________ RECOGNITION OF THE CAREER AND RETIREMENT OF MR. MARTY BEIL ______ HON. MARK POCAN of wisconsin in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional career of Mr. Marty Beil, who will retire this week after having served as Executive Director of the American Federation of State, Municipal and County Employees (AFSCME) Council 24, the Wisconsin State Employees Union since 1985. Over the course of his 30 years at the helm of AFSCME Council 24, Marty has come to be known by many as the face of public employee unions in the State of Wisconsin. Marty began his career in public service in 1969 working for the state's Division of Corrections as a probation and parole officer. It didn't take long for Marty to become involved with the union, and in 1973 he became president of the local chapter. In 1978 Marty was then elected president of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, a position which he held until 1985 when he was chosen to take over as executive director. Throughout his time as director, Marty was appointed by Wisconsin Governors to many high level committees and commissions on which he served as the spokesman for Council 24 and an outspoken advocate for state employees. The hallmark of Marty's career was perhaps during the highly divisive 2011 session of the Wisconsin State Legislature when Governor Scott Walker introduced Act 10, the controversial legislation suspending most collective bargaining powers of the state's public unions. The bill was unprecedented in Wisconsin, which was the first state in the country to provide collective bargaining rights to public employees in 1959, and the legislation drew significant public dissent. Marty provided pivotal leadership and was a constant presence throughout the weeks of protests at the State Capitol where crowds of demonstrators numbered over 100,000 at times. It is a true honor to recognize the career of Marty Beil, a tireless advocate and leader for state employees and working families in my district and across the state. His contributions are an important legacy in the longstanding tradition of fighting for workers' rights and protections in the State of Wisconsin. [[Page 12096]] ____________________ HONORING BOB FALLSTROM ______ HON. RODNEY DAVIS of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bob Fallstrom, a friend, veteran, and newsman, who passed away on July 10, 2015 at the age of 88. Mr. Fallstrom served as an integral part of life in central Illinois by delivering the news to countless Central Illinoisans for 66 years. He left a lasting impact on many throughout the entire state of Illinois. As a young man, Mr. Fallstrom worked at a movie theatre with the dream of a career in the news. Despite never having earned a college degree, he eventually achieved his dream, landing a position with the Herald & Review, a local newspaper in Decatur, Illinois. Mr. Fallstrom put his professional dreams on hold to serve his country during World War II--a testament to his dedication to service and putting others first in all aspects of his life. After the war, Mr. Fallstrom returned to central Illinois and once again picked up his reporter's notebook. He worked for decades as a sports editor for the paper and kept regular attendance at sporting events throughout the region. Known as the ``good news editor,'' he was also described as a ``talking encyclopedia'' of central Illinois history. I am proud to honor Mr. Fallstrom for his service to his country and his community. He was a devoted husband, father, veteran, and newsman that left an indelible memory on the lives of so many. My thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Fallstrom's family as central Illinois has lost a truly bright and impactful leader. ____________________ HONORING THE SERVICE OF MR. ALGIN ROBERTS ______ HON. ANDY BARR of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding individual, Mr. Algin Roberts, of Frankfort, Kentucky. Mr. Roberts celebrates his ninetieth birthday on July 26th, and I want to honor that special occasion by acknowledging his distinguished military service during World War II. Mr. Roberts, a part of the greatest generation, served our nation in the United States Army. Mr. Roberts joined the Army when he was just fifteen and he turned sixteen while crossing the Atlantic to fight. He was a member of the Army's 1st Infantry Division. They took part in the invasion of North Africa and Sicily. They were later sent to England for R&R and were a part of the D-Day invasion in 1944. Mr. Roberts' unit was among the first to land on Omaha Beach where the fighting was fierce. Mr. Roberts later came down with malaria and spent a long recovery time in England. After the war, Mr. Roberts returned home and became a Kentucky State Police officer where he had a long and distinguished career. The bravery of Mr. Roberts and his fellow men and women of the United States Army is heroic. Because of the courage of individuals from Franklin County and from all across our great nation, our freedoms have been saved for our generation and for future generations. He is truly an outstanding American, a patriot, and a hero to us all. On the special occasion of his ninetieth birthday, he and his family can reflect proudly on his contributions to the world through his brave military service. ____________________ EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS OF THE SENSELESS SHOOTING IN CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak out against the senseless loss of innocent lives resulting from another unthinkable act of violence. My thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Chattanooga, Tennessee, who were affected by the shootings on Thursday morning, July 16, especially the victims, the families, and our military community affected by this catastrophe. From current reports, we know that gunshots were fired at a military recruiting center and a Navy Reserve center in different parts of Chattanooga, Tennessee, late Thursday morning, tragically taking the lives of four Marines and wounding several others. I want to commend the law enforcement and emergency service agencies for their prompt response and management of this morning's tragic shootings and for carrying out the investigation thereafter. Americans come together at such times of tragedy to support each other. So at this time, I ask all Americans to keep the victims, their families, and our military members, in their thoughts and prayers. There is no place in a civilized society for such senseless acts of violence. Changing a culture of violence will not happen overnight but that is no excuse for failing to try. We must keeping trying. We must work tirelessly. For the sake of the victims of Chattanooga, Tennessee, we must not give up. I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of the victims in Tennessee, and victims of gun violence everywhere. ____________________ OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL DEBT ______ HON. MIKE COFFMAN of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, on January 20, 2009, the day President Obama took office, the national debt was $10,626,877,048,913.08. Today, it is $18,151,862,792,175.02. We've added $7,524,985,743,261.94 to our debt in 6 years. This is over $7.5 trillion in debt our nation, our economy, and our children could have avoided with a balanced budget amendment. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO JERRY AND JOYCE MEZ ______ HON. DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jerry and Joyce Mez, owners of the Farmall-Land Museum in Avoca, Iowa. Since 2005, Jerry and Joyce have greeted visitors to their museum, home of over 200 International Harvester tractors. Visitors from all 50 states and at least 16 countries, including Australia, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, have viewed this outstanding collection of tractors. The Farmall tractors are known as ``reds'' due to their distinctive color. Though the museum opened 10 years ago, it has been Jerry's dream for some 40 years. He started collecting International Harvester tractors in 1970. His museum idea followed shortly thereafter. The oldest Farmall tractor in his collection is a 1914 model and the newest model is dated 1985. Joyce also takes an active role in the museum. She helped develop a lounge so patrons could rest during the museum tour, which covers 26,500 square feet. The lounge is known as the ``Tractor Widows Lounge.'' Jerry and Joyce take great pride in sharing their collection with the hundreds of visitors each year. I commend Jerry and Joyce for establishing the Farmall-Land Museum in Avoca, Iowa. The museum is a great addition to the City of Avoca and to the State of Iowa. I am proud to represent Jerry and Joyce in the United States Congress. I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating them for achieving their dream and for sharing their collection with us. I wish them and their family nothing but the best moving forward. ____________________ RECOGNIZING EMMA SHIREY'S FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR ACHIEVEMENT ______ HON. BILLY LONG of missouri in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Emma Shirey on receiving a renowned Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Grant for the 2014-2015 academic year. Emma, a native of Nixa, Missouri, was awarded the Fulbright U.S. Student Program grant to teach in Taiwan, where she has gained valuable career experience serving as an English Teaching Assistant. The award has allowed Emma to interact with young Taiwanese students and make valuable contributions to Taiwan's youth after her graduation from Truman State University with a degree in Sociology. [[Page 12097]] A Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship allows individuals to teach English and serve as a cultural ambassador for the U.S. by being placed in a classroom abroad. In doing so, Emma has successfully played a big role in spreading the value of American ideas and education. I am extremely proud that talented, hardworking and dedicated individuals, such as Emma, represent the Seventh District of Missouri. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Emma Shirey for her service and for receiving this esteemed award. ____________________ IN HONOR OF BECKY MOELLER, PAST PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY-TREASURER FOR THE TEXAS AFL-CIO ______ HON. MARC A. VEASEY of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Becky K. Moeller for her service to the organized labor movement as Secretary-Treasurer and President of the Texas AFL-CIO. Ms. Moeller's retirement comes after her long tenure within the Texas AFL-CIO, where she worked to advance hands-on political and legislative educational programs and fight for working people against tough odds. In 2003, Ms. Becky Moeller was elected as Secretary-Treasurer for the Texas AFL-CIO, making her the first woman to hold a statewide elected office in the Texas AFL-CIO. During her four year tenure as Secretary- Treasurer, Ms. Moeller used her budgetary expertise to keep many of the organization's signature programs despite a decline in funds. In 2007, Ms. Moeller was elected President of the Texas AFL-CIO, effectively overseeing the 235,000-member labor federation's legislative, political education and community service programs. During her tenure in these two positions, Ms. Moeller helped introduce a revamped and revised education program that enabled organized labor leaders to contact union members more effectively during ``Get Out the Vote'' campaigns. This particular initiative proved successful for labor-supportive Texas Legislature and Congressional candidates. Ms. Moeller's dedication to organized labor goes beyond her work within the AFL-CIO. Before her leadership in the Texas AFL-CIO, Ms. Moeller served as president of the Communications Workers of America Local 6137, the Corpus Christi local union representing workers at SBC (now AT&T). Ms. Moeller served in several capacities, including job steward, chief steward, Executive Board member, vice president and secretary-treasurer. Ms. Moeller also served as President of the Coastal Bend Labor Council and as a member of the Texas AFL-CIO Executive Board. For several years, Ms. Moeller chaired the Texas AFL-CIO Scholarship Committee. She also traveled the state of Texas to promote unions and assist in a variety of worker actions. In addition to her commitment to organized labor, Ms. Moeller served as a member of her local United Way Board of Governors and the Corpus Christi Workforce Development Board and also worked a number of voter registration drives. She was appointed by Governor Ann Richards as Chair of the Texas Department of Licensing Regulation commission. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO GREENFIELD MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ______ HON. DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate a great Iowa institution, Greenfield Municipal Utilities. On June 12, 2015, Greenfield Municipal Utilities celebrated 125 years of business. A short ten years after Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, a group of Greenfield city councilmen and businessmen began planning a municipal light plant to provide the town with electricity. In the fall of 1890, their idea became a reality when Greenfield was one of the first towns in Iowa to have a plant. Members of the Board of Trustees today include Lynne Don Carlos, Terry Schneider, and Bob Guikema. I applaud and congratulate the Greenfield Municipal Utilities for their 125 years in Iowa's Third Congressional District. I am proud to represent them in the United States Congress. I know that my colleagues will join me in congratulating and wishing the Board of Trustees and their employees nothing but success in the future. ____________________ RECOGNIZING COLIN THOMAS, SAM LAFFEY, AND MOSES WEISBERG ______ HON. KEN BUCK of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colin Thomas, Sam Laffey, and Moses Weisberg for their hard work and dedication to the people of Colorado's Fourth District as interns in my Washington, DC office for the Summer 2015 session of Congress. The work of these young men has been exemplary and I know they all have bright futures. They served as tour guides, interacted with constituents, and learned a great deal about our nation's legislative process. I was glad to be able to offer this educational opportunity to these three and look forward to seeing them build their careers in public service. Our interns have made plans to continue their work with various organizations in Washington, Colorado, and Kansas. I am certain they will succeed in their new roles and wish them all the best in their future endeavors. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Colin Thomas, Sam Laffey, and Moses Weisberg for their service this summer. ____________________ CONGRATULATING THE TAYLORVILLE OPTIMIST CLUB ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON. RODNEY DAVIS of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Taylorville Optimist Club on their 50th anniversary this year. The Optimists have shown inspiring dedication to their mission of fostering an optimistic way of life in my hometown. The Optimist Club was chartered in 1965, and there are currently over sixty active members. Since their charter, they have been a force of good in the community. They instigate a meaningful difference in the attitudes of our community's youth at events throughout the year; bringing out the best in kids by providing hope and a positive vision. Over the past five decades, the Optimist Club has been resilient in pursuit of their mission. The club makes various important contributions to the people of Taylorville throughout the year. Fitting for this time of year, they honor our freedom by providing the fireworks for the Independence Day celebration. In the spring, they host their annual Easter Egg Hunt for children in the community. During the school year, they assist local students who exemplify their mission with scholarships. The Taylorville Optimist Club has shown that a positive outlook is essential in facing everyday life. Their commitment to service has helped make my hometown community what it is today. As a past member of the Optimist Club, I am proud of this club's reputation. Its legacy can be seen in the lives of all those it has enriched over the past fifty years, and I look forward to another fifty. ____________________ CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MR. THOMAS FRITZ ______ HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS of washington in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of Mr. Tom Fritz, who tragically passed away last week in a devastating fishing accident. A leader who helped to bring countless jobs and collaborative healthcare to Eastern Washington, Tom was a pillar of strength and generosity in our Greater Spokane community and will be greatly missed. A beacon in our community, Tom tirelessly led Inland Northwest Health Services for the last 16 years before retiring last December. Founded as a joint venture of the area's largest hospitals and their parent companies, under his guidance, INHS grew to over 1,000 employees and brought in more than $200 million in gross revenues, becoming one of the region's largest employers and one of its most active businesses. Having the vision to partner with community entities, Tom led INHS to provide exemplary access to health services not only in Spokane but all across our country. He [[Page 12098]] drove their efforts through forward-thinking solutions, unique partnerships and innovative technologies. Tom's vision for INHS was to provide a collaborative approach to health care that is unlike any other. Tom had a heart of gold. He tirelessly advocated for programs and initiatives that benefited the community he loved. A tremendous leader, Tom will be remembered for his years of service to our community in Eastern Washington and for his commitment to INHS's collaborative mission. To those he worked with on a daily basis, he will forever be remembered as a great friend and colleague. Although Tom Fritz' passing has left many heavy hearts in Eastern Washington, the memory of this actively passionate and engaged individual has left a lasting impact on the lives of many back home in the Inland Northwest. Thank you, Tom, for your years of dedication and service to our community and state. My thoughts and prayers are with your family and friends during this difficult time. ____________________ COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE ``FEDERAL CIGARETTE LABELING ACT'' OF 1965 ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ``Federal Cigarette Labeling Act'' of 1965. Passed by the 89th Congress, the ``Federal Cigarette Labeling Act'' was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on July 27, 1965, in response to the mounting scientific evidence that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer and is a serious public health concern for the nation. At the time this act was being debated in Congress, cigarette smoking was simply not viewed as a public health concern. Cigarette smoking was viewed as a norm, with virtually no harmful effects. Tobacco companies often falsified data to make the claim that some cigarettes were even healthy for you to smoke. One famous advertisement campaign was for the Lucky Strike cigarettes made by the American Tobacco Company in the 1930s which used advertisements that stated ``20,679 physicians say Luckies are less irritating.'' Another advertisement campaign by the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company was called the ``More Doctors'' campaign which attempted to reshape the image that cigarettes were safe. These are just a few of the false advertisements about the implications of smoking on an individual's health by the tobacco industry and which were a contributing factor in the rise of lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. To assist in educating the American people about the dangers of smoking the ``Federal Cigarette Labeling Act'' required the entire tobacco industry to adapt to new regulations mandating that cigarette packages have a health warning label that stated, ``Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health.'' By implementing this simple warning label on cigarette packing, the public was given a notice on every box of the potential harm these tobacco smoking products may cause. This legislation also required the Federal Trade Commission to report to Congress annually on the effectiveness of cigarette labeling for the public. Along with labeling, this legislation created a framework of how the current promotional practices were to be employed by the tobacco industry for promoting their products. This legislation accelerated the American public's knowledge of the true dangers of smoking cigarettes. In 1986 Congress continued this endeavor to educate the American public on the harms of tobacco use by passing the ``Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act,'' which extended the health warning labels from just cigarettes to include smokeless tobacco products, along with the advertisements for them. In my city of Houston, Texas, lung cancer has become the deadliest cancer for my constituents, affecting not just former smokers but also nonsmokers. Progressive legislation like the ``Federal Cigarette Labeling Act'' has helped inform the American people of the potential danger of using tobacco products. Mr. Speaker, this is why I am proud to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ``Federal Cigarette Labeling Act'' of 1965 and to recognize its remarkable contributions to American public's access to information that allows them to make the best informed decision for their personal health. ____________________ MARKING 41 YEARS SINCE THE TURKISH INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF NORTHERN CYPRUS ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 41st anniversary of the Turkish government's illegal invasion of Cyprus in 1974. This tragedy of that aggression continues to this day. Northern Cyprus continues to be occupied by Turkish troops. More than 216,000 Cypriots continue to be displaced or their descendants denied their rightful property claims in ancestral homelands--and this includes 5,000 Americans of Cypriot descent. Sadly, the occupation authorities continue their direct attacks on the religious freedom of Orthodox Christians and the island's rich Orthodox Christian cultural heritage. Cyprus's ancient Christian heritage goes back to the mission of St. Paul and St. Barnabas in 45 A.D.--Barnabas is remembered as the founder and patron saint of the Church in Cyprus. Even in recent years, Turkish security forces have continued to disrupt the religious services of Orthodox believers in northern Cyprus, and, sadly, the desecration and destruction of religious sites continues. Forty-one years after the Turkish government's invasion, Christian believers still cannot freely visit all religious sites on the island, nor use Christian religious sites for their rightful purpose. Sites looted of revered icons remain vacant, and sacred objects of Cypriot Orthodoxy regularly turn up on the international art market or are held in museums against the wishes of the Orthodox community. The services for the faithful that do take place remain tightly restricted by Turkish authorities through special permitting or other challenges to registering congregations. These violations of basic rights are a legacy of intolerance wrought by the 1974 invasion. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in urging the administration to vigorously promote meaningful settlement negotiations that affirm the fundamental freedoms and human rights of those Greek Cypriots who are displaced or enduring in northern enclaves. ____________________ RECOGNIZING EVAN McCARTNEY'S FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR ACHIEVEMENT ______ HON. BILLY LONG of missouri in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Evan McCartney on receiving a renowned Fulbright Study and Research Award for the 2014-2015 academic year. Evan, a Nixa, Missouri, native and United States Air Force Academy graduate, was awarded the Fulbright grant to study the field of political science in Ukraine. There, he has learned the country's military aviation history and future through Ukraine's National Aviation University. Fulbright Study and Research grants allow recipients to design projects and work with advisers and foreign universities to pursue a particular field of study. Given the ongoing conflict in the region, I am certain Evan's bright mind and American military background has shed new light on the ongoing situation there. I am extremely proud that talented, hardworking and dedicated individuals such as Evan have great opportunities to represent the Seventh District of Missouri. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Evan McCartney for his scholarship and for receiving such an esteemed award. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO KID ZONE EARLY LEARNING CENTER ______ HON. DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kid Zone Early Learning Center for the opening of their new facility in Adair, Iowa. Kid Zone strives to enrich the lives of young children in the Adair community with a faculty of dedicated teachers and caregivers. Their [[Page 12099]] focus on cultivating a positive learning experience and a nurturing environment will be a great asset to the residents of Adair. I commend Kid Zone Early Learning Center and their staff for the service they provide to families in Adair and southern Iowa. I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating Kid Zone for their new location. I wish them and their staff nothing but the best moving forward. ____________________ RECOGNIZING PHILIP A. CLEMENS ______ HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor Philip A. Clemens, a constituent of mine and community leader who is retiring after serving almost 50 years with the Clemens Family Corporation. Mr. Clemens has spent his entire working life with his family business, The Clemens Family Corporation, headquartered in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Over the years, Mr. Clemens has worked in all areas of the business-- from the clean-up crew to Chairman and CEO, a position he served in for 15 years. With Mr. Clemens' leadership, the Clemens Family Corporation has grown into one of the largest companies in the industry, employing hundreds of my constituents with good-paying, family-sustaining jobs. Mr. Clemens has devoted his knowledge and expertise to not only the growth of his own business, but the future of the meat industry as a whole. His lifelong contributions to the industry are unmatched. For his influence, he's received the highest award given in the industry-- the North American Meat Institute's Industry Advancement Award, the Knowlton Award for industry innovation, and the Research Institute of America's outstanding management award. However, Mr. Clemens isn't just known for his business accomplishments, he's also an active volunteer known by many in our area for his dedication to the Indian Valley and North Penn communities. Some of those roles include his work as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Lancaster Bible College, his work with the North Penn United Way, and his efforts with the Profit Sharing Council of America. In addition, he is also very active at the Calvary Church of Souderton, where he serves on the Elder Board. Mr. Clemens is a dedicated family man, a highly successful entrepreneur and a man who generously donates his time to better our community. I am proud and privileged to honor him today and appreciate all he has done for the people of our community. On behalf of the constituents of the 8th District of Pennsylvania, I wish Mr. Clemens a happy, relaxing and pleasant retirement. ____________________ HONORING MR. DAVID SCHLEGEL, MR. PEIDONG YANG, MS. CAROLYN BERTOZZI, AND MR. JIZHONG ZHOU ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the accomplishments of four scientists, affiliated with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who have been named by U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz as recipients of the 2015 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy's highest scientific honor. The Department of Energy's Ernest Orlando Lawrence Awards were established by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1959, to honor Ernest Lawrence, the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of the cyclotron, the forerunner of today's particle accelerators, and the founder and namesake of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory--located in my very own 13th Congressional District of California. The four winners associated with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and their accomplishments are as follows: David Schlegel, an astrophysicist who serves as the Principal Investigator for the BOSS project on the Sloan Telescope, the Co- Principal Investigator for the DECals sky survey, and the Project Scientist for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). He was recognized for his ``exceptional leadership of major projects making the largest two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps of the universe, which have helped ascertain the nature of Dark Energy, test General Relativity, and positively impact fundamental understanding of matter and energy in the universe.'' Peidong Yang, a faculty chemist who holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division, the University of California (UC) Berkeley, where he holds the S.K. and Angela Chan Distinguished Professor of Energy chair, and the Kavli Energy NanoSciences Institute (Kavli-ENSI), for which he is a co-director. He was recognized for his ``seminal research advancing the synthesis and understanding of nanoscale materials, including semiconductor nanowires and metal nanocrystals, and their impact to structures and devices for applications in nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, and energy conversion.'' Carolyn Bertozzi, also a faculty chemist with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division, a professor of chemistry and of chemical and systems biology at Stanford University, and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She was recognized for her ``significant scientific research contributions at the interface of chemistry, biology and nanoscience, including major advances in the chemistry and biology of complex carbohydrates, including the development of nanotechnologies and chemistries for probing biological systems, optimizing bioreactors, and innovating tailored devices and materials.'' Jizhong Zhou, a Presidential Professor in Botany and Microbiology and Director of the Institute for Environmental Genomics at the University of Oklahoma, a guest researcher with Berkeley Lab's Earth Sciences Division, and a principal investigator for ENIGMA (Ecosystems and Networks Integrated with Genes and Molecular Assemblies). He was recognized for his ``outstanding accomplishments in environmental genomics and microbial ecology, including the development of innovative metagenomics technologies for environmental sciences, for groundbreaking discoveries to understand the feedbacks, mechanisms, and fundamental principles of microbial systems in response to environmental change, and for transformative leadership to elucidate microbial ecological networks and to link microbial biodiversity with ecosystem functions.'' On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I salute you all. I thank you for your contributions to the scientific field and congratulate you on your many achievements in research. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO EDD LEACH ______ HON. DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Edd Leach of Council Bluffs, Iowa. Edd is the owner of Leach Camper Sales in Council Bluffs. Leach Camper Sales was opened in 1962 by Edd's father. Edd joined the business in 1969 when his Dad offered him a deal: if Edd would work at the business for five years, he would end up owning half the business. Since then, Edd and his wife, Donna, have built a very successful business together. They offer RVs of all sizes, and a complete parts and repair department to service their customers' needs. The family owned business includes their daughter and grandsons. Leach Camper Sales is home to a number of employees who have spent years helping serve the area. I commend Edd and his staff for their dedicated service to Council Bluffs and southwest Iowa. I am proud to represent them in the United States Congress. I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating Leach Camper Sales for their many achievements in the recreational vehicle industry. I wish Edd, his family, and his employees all the best moving forward. ____________________ RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF DR. MEI BAI FOR HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIELD OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS ______ HON. LEE M. ZELDIN of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Doctor Mei Bai, whose innovation and leadership at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York, in my district, has greatly impacted the field of nuclear physics. This month she receives the E.O. Lawrence Award, [[Page 12100]] a prestigious award bestowed by the Department of Energy for exceptional scientific achievement. Dr. Bai joined Brookhaven National Lab in 1999 as a research associate in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Accelerator Physics Group, was promoted to Associate Scientist in 2001, and to Scientist in 2004. In 2000, she was the recipient of the American Physical Society's Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Beam Physics Award. In 2010, the Asian Committee for Future Accelerators and the organizing committee of the 2010 First International Particle Accelerator Conference awarded Bai a prize for her significant and original contributions to the field of accelerator research. Dr. Bai recently joined the Nuclear Physics Institute in Germany, which conducts experimental and theoretical basic research in the areas of nuclear, hadron, and particle physics. In the 1990s, Dr. Bai and her colleagues devised a way to keep protons circulating in an accelerator polarized, or all spinning in the same directions on their axes. This was a crucial development which was successfully demonstrated at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, which is an accelerator that is a key part of the RHIC complex. This week, Dr. Mei Bai is being honored with an E.O. Lawrence award for her outstanding research, which has allowed for the first direct measurement of the contributions of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons to the spin of the proton. Physicists from around the world study polarized protons at RHIC to determine the answer to a fundamental question--how protons get their spin, an intrinsic property of the particle that is not completely understood. Dr. Bai's work enabled RHIC researchers to successfully accelerate individual beams of polarized protons to 255 billion electron volts of energy. The beams were collided at a total mass energy of 510 billion electron volts, making RHIC the world's first and only high energy polarized proton collider. Today, I thank her for her enthusiasm and the inspiration she provides to other scientists at Brookhaven National Lab and the international community. I congratulate Dr. Bai on her accomplishments and this very significant award. ____________________ RECOGNIZING TOM KERR ON BEING NAMED ``PAUL KROEGEL REFUGE MANAGER OF THE YEAR'' ______ HON. SEAN P. DUFFY of wisconsin in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Tom Kerr for his leadership and attention to our community's and our nation's wetlands. As the manager of Wisconsin's St. Croix Wetland Management District and Whittlesey Creek National Wildlife Refuge, Mr. Kerr understands that environmental conservation isn't something that can simply be purchased; it requires local engagement. This is why he's organized working programs such as Conservation Day, a collaborative event that educates students about what's involved in sustaining our ecosystems. I am proud that Mr. Kerr's outstanding years of service and dedication are being recognized with the National Wildlife Refuge Association's ``Paul Kroegel Refuge Manager of the Year'' award--one of the nation's highest honors given to conservation leaders. While overseeing thousands of acres of marshes, grasslands, and oak savanna throughout Northern and Central Wisconsin, Mr. Kerr finds unique ways to engage his neighbors and to lend a hand to many bird species in the process. I appreciate this opportunity to honor Mr. Kerr for putting conservation at the forefront in our community. On behalf of Wisconsin and this entire body, we thank him. ____________________ RECOGNIZING MS. SOFIA BILSKI ______ HON.

CEDRIC L. RICHMOND of louisiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Armand Louis Charbonnet, the Vice President of Charbonnet-Labat-Glapion Funeral Homes, who passed away on July 9, 2015, at the age 84. Mr. Charbonnet was a United States Army veteran, a lifelong Catholic, member of the Vikings Krewe, patriarch of his family, and a leader in the New Orleans community. He directed numerous funerals in New Orleans and surrounding parishes in one of the oldest continuously operating African-American funeral homes in the country. Known for its traditional jazz funerals, horse drawn glass hearses, and the famous saying ``My Soul Goes to Heaven but take my body to Charbonnet,'' Charbonnet-Labat-Glapion Funeral Homes has served Louisiana for more than 132 years. To honor Mr. Charbonnet, who was affectionately known by family and friends as ``Big Daddy,'' today we recognize the fulfillment of his mission. In commemoration of his life and achievements we strive to put the needs of others first as he did for countless families through the painful process of laying a loved one to rest. ____________________ INTRODUCTION OF THE TEACH SAFE RELATIONSHIPS ACT ______ HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to introduce the Teach Safe Relationships Act along with my colleagues Suzanne Bonamici and Alma Adams. Too often, young Americans engage in abusive, unhealthy relationships. In fact, young women between 16 and 24 years old are victims of intimate partner violence at three times the national average of all women. These statistics and the stories of sexual abuse and dating violence among teens and college students demand that we examine innovative approaches to curb unhealthy relationship behavior. The Teach Safe Relationships Act, introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, takes a strong step to address this problem by ensuring that American students discuss safe relationship behavior as part of sex education. Through comprehensive curricula that use effective approaches to prevent teen dating violence, sexual assault, and harassment, we [[Page 12101]] can ensure that our young people have the tools they need to make safe decisions in relationships and identify unhealthy or abusive behavior. I am encouraged that key provisions of this legislation have been included in the Every Child Achieves Act in the Senate, and hope that my colleagues in the House will build on that momentum by supporting the Teach Safe Relationships Act. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS HALLMAN ______ HON. DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Nicholas Hallman of Des Moines, Iowa for receiving a coveted Fulbright award during the 2014-2015 Academic Year. Nicholas is a recent graduate of the University of Iowa with a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies, History, and French. He will travel to Turkey in September 2015 and begin his work in one of the newly-established state universities. While in Turkey, Nicholas will be teaching English and plans to establish an American film and television club. He hopes to bridge the gap and make comparisons between American and Turkish society. Nicholas would also like to spend time organizing relief efforts for war refugees and volunteer at refugee camps. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I recognize Nicholas today. It is the young people like him who are willing to work hard and make sacrifices for the betterment of society that will lead our future generations. I know my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in congratulating Nicholas on this outstanding achievement and wish him nothing but continued success moving forward. ____________________ INTRODUCTION OF THE CLEAN SLATE FOR MARIJUANA OFFENSES ACT ______ HON. EARL BLUMENAUER of oregon in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing legislation that will allow certain federal marijuana offenders the opportunity to clear their record. In 1973, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the personal possession of a small amount of marijuana. Since then, an additional 15 states have adopted similar policies. 23 states, the District of Columbia and Guam have passed laws that allow for the use of marijuana for certain medical conditions. In 2012, Washington and Colorado legalized the adult use of marijuana and in 2014, Oregon and Alaska followed suit. Oregon also recently led the nation in passing legislation to reduce penalties for marijuana offenses and qualifying certain marijuana offenses for expungement that could not previously be expunged. Under the Controlled Substances Act, however, marijuana remains a Schedule I substance, classified as severely as heroin and LSD and defined as having no medical value. As a result, at the federal level, possessing or distributing marijuana, regardless of the amount and regardless of state law, remains illegal. While the current Administration's policy is not to prosecute those who are operating in compliance with state law so long as they meet certain federal enforcement priorities, this was not always the case and may not always be the case going forward. Until recently, too many people were wrongly caught up in the conflict between federal and state law. In 2013, after a state-legal marijuana industry began to emerge in Montana, a federal investigation responded with a series of 33 sentences against individuals, many who argued they were abiding by that system. The federal government also pursued drug trafficking charges against a family in Washington claiming to grow marijuana within the bounds of Washington's medical marijuana law. The $10 million trial ultimately resulted in a manufacturing charge that will remain on their record. In addition, while the federal government generally devotes more resources to large-scale drug trafficking and lets local jurisdictions enforce marijuana possession offenses, federal possession charges occur. Over the past 10 years, at least 1,100 people have been sentenced for marijuana possession at the federal level. The Clean Slate for Marijuana Offenses Act of 2015 creates a pathway for two groups of federal marijuana offenders to expunge--or clear the criminal record of--their marijuana offense: those who were federally charged for activity that was legal in the state they were in at the time; and those whose offense was the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. A federal drug conviction, no matter how small, can follow a person for their entire life, potentially limiting education and employment opportunities. As more and more states legalize different uses of marijuana, no one should be saddled with a record for activities related to marijuana that were legal in their state. In addition, the possession of a small amount should not ruin a person's chances at significant opportunities later in life. While the number of people charged with federal possession offenses is low, over seven million people have been arrested with marijuana possession when totaling state, federal and local law enforcement statistics over the past 10 years. This legislation sends a strong signal to state and local jurisdictions that allowing a pathway for expungement for certain marijuana offenders should happen at all levels of law enforcement. ____________________ TRIBUTE TO WHITEROCK CONSERVANCY ______ HON. DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Whiterock Conservancy for the opening of their new Whiterock Conservancy Backcountry Trail. At nearly forty miles, the Whiterock Conservancy Backcountry Trail is one of the largest destination trail systems in Central Iowa. After raising funds for seven years, 20 miles of the trail, two new campgrounds, and many other new visitor experiences are complete. Six miles of new equestrian trails will take riders to new vistas, and the double track trail now loops along both sides of the Raccoon River, providing all users, including the mobility challenged or drivers in low power ATV's, with a wonderful background for enjoying their leisure time. These trail improvements allow hikers, snowshoers, bikers, and nature lovers alike the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful landscape of central Iowa. I applaud and congratulate Whiterock Conservancy for achieving their goals and opening this wonderful destination for Iowans and all Americans to enjoy. I know that my colleagues join me in congratulating Whiterock Conservancy and their board of directors and wishing them all continued success in the future. ____________________ CLASS 6A PLAYER OF THE YEAR _____ HON. PETE OLSON of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kourtney Coveney of Katy High School for being named Class 6A Player of the Year by the Texas Sports Writers Association. Kourtney led her team to the first state softball title in district history. Throughout the season she had a 3.32 earned run average as well as 79 strikeouts in 135\\2/3\\ innings. Not only is she an excellent pitcher, Kourtney's batting average is .511 with 17 doubles, a home run, and 54 runs batted in. She will continue her softball career at West Texas A&M University. Kourtney has made her parents, coaches, and the town of Katy proud. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional District of Texas, congratulations to Kourtney Coveney on all of her achievements. We look forward to hearing more about her continued success. ____________________ REMEMBERING LOU LENART ______ HON. STEVE ISRAEL of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a true hero of the United States and Israel, Lou Lenart. I would like to recognize his heroic efforts and great sacrifice in keeping both countries safe during World War II and Israel's War of Independence. Lou began his incredible journey as Layos Lenovitz in a Hungarian village near the Czech border. When he was 10 years old, he moved with his family to the United States in order to escape increasing anti- Semitism. At age seventeen, Lou enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps where he became a fighter pilot. [[Page 12102]] He served in the U.S. military valiantly, flying in the Battle of Okinawa and other engagements in the Pacific. After the war, he learned that fourteen of his relatives who had remained in Hungary had been killed in Auschwitz. This prompted him to join a clandestine effort to smuggle surplus American aircraft into Israel. He also helped recruit other war veterans like himself to fly for the Israeli Air Force (IAF). After surviving the treacherous journey smuggling aircraft into Israel, Lou led his comrades Ezer Weizman, Eddie Cohen, and Modi Alon in the IAF's first mission. On May 29th, 1948, two weeks after Israel declared its independence, Egyptian soldiers and tanks were advancing to Tel Aviv. With Lou at the helm, the secretly assembled IAF was able to force the Egyptian troops to retreat. This mission gave Lou the most accurate nickname I have ever heard, ``the man who saved Tel Aviv.'' Lou served bravely throughout Israel's War of Independence and later participated in Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, which airlifted Iraqi Jews to Israel. After leaving the military he became a pilot for El Al Airlines and a film producer. Lou passed away on Monday of this week at age 94, but his life will forever be remembered as one of exceptional service and commitment to both the United States and Israel. His sacrifices and achievements are great, and I hope Lou's heroic efforts will serve as a reminder to us all that one individual can truly make a difference. ____________________ LIVING WATER INTERNATIONAL'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY _____ HON. PETE OLSON of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Stafford, Texas's own Living Water International on its upcoming 25th anniversary. Over the last 25 years, Mike Mantel and his team have drilled over 15,000 wells and provided clean water to people in more than 23 countries. After taking a water well drilling trip to Senegal, Mike was inspired to provide clean water to people around the world. To Mike, getting people water was the foundation for a successful life. A life where agriculture could develop, people would be healthier, and women could spend less time hauling water and more time in school. Living Water International's mission to share the love of God and provide access to clean drinking water to countries around the world is inspiring. As a community, we are humbled and grateful by the work Mike and his team at Living Water International are doing. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional District of Texas, we thank you for 25 years of dedication to bringing clean water to people around the world. ____________________ DODD/FRANK 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY _____ HON. TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 21, 2015 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in recognition of the five-year anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This critically important piece of legislation has strengthened oversight of the financial sector, given regulators the tools to end the era of ``too big to fail,'' and has eliminated loopholes that allowed risky and abusive practices to go unnoticed and unregulated. As we mark this five-year anniversary, we must recognize that the ``Great Recession'' of 2008 did not occur naturally as a part of the regular financial cycle, but as a result of the lack of transparency and accountability in the financial sector. During the ``Great Recession'' the American economy lost over 4 million jobs, 13 trillion dollars in household wealth and approximately 5 million homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure. Consequently, Dodd-Frank implemented reforms to prevent the bad actors from continuing to commit the types of deceptive and harmful practices that led to these catastrophic results. Most notably, Dodd- Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which over the past five years has returned over $10.1 billion dollars to over 17 million consumers that were subjected to unfair treatment. No legislation is perfect, and there is still room for minor tweaks to be made in order to ensure Dodd-Frank achieves its original goal of increased transparency, market efficiency and consumer protection. However, we must continue to defend against Republican attacks to completely dismantle this critically important legislation. The sad reality is that Republican majority has spent countless hours attempting to weaken the financial regulatory system, and to reverse many of the important reforms made by Dodd-Frank. We must continue to protect our recovering economy, promote stability in our financial markets, and ensure that regulators have the tools to protect the American people. "}
