This process is approximately 95% accurate and therefore you may find a small number of duplicate records in your search results. Summary of Search: Kirschner wires (k-wires, bone wires) and fractures/injuries/trauma of the hand (e.g. fingers, thumbs, metacarpals, phalanges - not wrist, carpals or distal radius) Limits: All Years All Languages Human Studies (where possible) Time taken to complete the search: (i.e. devising the search strategy, looking through the results and preparing this document) 10 hours 57 mins Please note: For Medline and Embase, the search strategy was devised using two main concepts: (1) Kirschner wires (including the synonyms k-wires, bone wires and bone pins) AND (2) Hand fractures, injuries or trauma (including fingers, thumbs, digits, metacarpals and phalanges but not wrist, carpal or distal radius). Both thesaurus terms and textwords (i.e. words or phrases in the Title or Abstract) were identified for each concept. No outcomes, age groups or study design restrictions were specified in the search strategy. Due to the Medline and Embase databases containing a mixture of indexed and unindexed references, the The Royal Society of Medicine Library 3 Human indexing term was applied to the final results and an additional search line was added to remove the Animal indexing term but retained any unindexed references which were likely to contain a mix of human and animal studies. Three different results sets are available for downloading: Set S21 (1554 references) represents the results of the search following the application of the Human limit as described above with set S24 (1102 references) further limiting these results to English language articles only. Set S22 (1147 references) represents the results of set S21 excluding case reports with set S25 (773 references) further limiting these results to English language articles only. Set S23 (1089 references) represents the results of set S21 excluding case reports, letters, editorials, comments/notes and news with set S26 (715 references) further limiting these results to English language articles only. No manual checks for relevancy of the results was made so please be aware that there will obviously be a number of references that will not answer your search question precisely given the sensitive nature of the search strategy used. In the Cochrane Library databases, the Medline search strategy was translated based on the two main concepts outlined previously retrieving a total of 51 references. As there is no additional charge for the references, I downloaded all 51 without making any further manual checks for relevancy so please be aware that there will obviously be a number of references that will not answer your search question precisely. In addition, the results found in the Cochrane Library were not compared with those retrieved in Medline and Embase so some references may be duplicated across the databases. This is due to the Cochrane Library databases being available on a different search platform than Medline and Embase. All articles in the Cochrane Library databases are presented in full (i.e. up to abstract level, where available). Please be aware that the full-text of Cochrane reviews or structured abstracts from DARE are not downloaded, as this option is not offered by the database. Instead, an URL link to the full-text (where available) is provided for each record. The Royal Society of Medicine Library 4 For the other web sites searched, these are listed separately below. They are basically divided into two areas: (1) Clinical trial registers of ongoing or recently completed trials (WHO ICTRP Search Portal; ISRCTN Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register); (2) Resources for locating ongoing or published systematic reviews or health technology assessments (CRD HTA, PROSPERO, NICE Evidence Search, TRIP). For each web site, the reasoning behind how the results were downloaded is given. For those where it was not possible and/or where there were too many references to copy and paste individually, instructions are provided on how to run the search strategies yourself.

The Royal Society of Medicine Library 8 The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR, Cochrane Reviews): Issue 6 of 12, June 2015 13 complete reviews or protocols: Record #1 of 13 ID: CD006522 Madhok Rajan TI: Different methods of external fixation for treating distal radial fractures in adults SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews YR: 2008 NO: 1 John Wiley & the distal radius is a common injury. A surgical treatment is external fixation, where metal pins inserted into bone on either side of the fracture are then fixed to an external frame.Objectives: To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing different methods of external fixation for distal radial fractures in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (June 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials which compared different methods of external fixation in adults with a distal radial fracture.Data collection and analysis: All review authors independently performed study selection. Two authors independently assessed the included trials and performed data extraction.Main results: Nine small trials involving 510 adults with potentially or evidently unstable fractures, were grouped into five comparisons. The interventional, clinical and methodological heterogeneity of trials precluded data pooling. Only one trial had secure allocation concealment.Two trials comparing a bridging (of the wrist) external fixator versus pins and plaster external fixation found no significant differences in function or deformity. One trial found tendencies for more serious complications but less subsequent discomfort and deformity in the fixator group.Three trials compared non-bridging versus bridging fixation. Of the two trials testing uni-planar non-bridging fixation, one found no significant differences in functional or clinical outcomes; the other found non-bridging fixation significantly improved grip strength, wrist flexion and anatomical outcome. The third trial found no significant findings in favour of multi-planar non-bridging fixation of complex intra-articular fractures.One trial using a bridging external fixator found that deploying an extra external fixator pin to fix the 'floating' distal fragment gave superior functional and anatomical results.One trial found no evidence of differences in clinical outcomes for hydroxyapatite coated pins compared with standard uncoated pins.Two trials compared dynamic versus static external fixation. One trial found no significant effects from early dynamism of an external fixator. The poor quality of the other trial undermines its findings of poorer functional and anatomical outcomes for dynamic fixation.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient robust evidence to determine the relative effects of different methods of external fixation. Adequately powered studies could provide better evidence.

No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of bone scaffolding for treating distal radial fracture in adults.Data collection and analysis: Two people independently selected studies and undertook assessment and data collection.Main results: Ten heterogenous trials involving 874 adults with generally unstable fractures were grouped into six comparisons. No trial had proven allocation concealment.Four trials (239 participants) found implantation of bone scaffolding (autogenous bone graft (one trial); Norian SRS - a bone substitute (two trials); methylmethacrylate cement (one trial)) improved anatomical outcomes compared with plaster cast alone; and two found it improved function. Reported complications of bone scaffolding were transient discomfort resulting from extraosseous deposits of Norian SRS; with surgical removal of one intra-articular deposit.One trial (323 participants) comparing bone substitute (Norian SRS) versus plaster cast or external fixation found no difference in functional or anatomical outcomes at one year. Statistically significant complications in the respective groups were extraosseous Norian SRS deposits and pin track infection. One trial (48 participants with external fixation) found that autogenous bone graft did not significantly change outcome. There was one serious donor-site complication.One trial (21 participants) found some indication of worse outcomes for hydroxyapatite bone cement compared with Kapandji's intrafocal pinning.Three trials (180 participants) found bone scaffolding graft (one trial); Norian SRS (one trial); methylmethacrylate cement (one trial)) gave no significant difference in functional outcomes but some indication of better anatomical outcomes compared with external fixation. Most reported complications were associated with external fixation; extraosseous deposits of Norian SRS occurred in one trial.One trial (93 participants with dorsal plate fixation) found autografts slightly improved wrist function compared with allogenic bone material but with an excess of donor site complications.Authors' conclusions: Bone scaffolding may improve anatomical outcome compared with plaster cast alone but there is insufficient evidence to conclude on functional outcome and safety; or for other comparisons. US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006836.pub2/abstract Record treating mallet finger SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews YR: 2004 NO: 3 Library 10 AB: Background: Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened out due to injury of the extensor tendon mechanism. Treatment commonly involves splintage of the finger for six or more weeks. Less frequently, surgical fixation is used to correct the deformity.Objectives: To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of treating mallet finger injuries.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 1 2008), EMBASE (1988 to 2008 week 11), other databases, reference lists of articles and various conference proceedings.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials evaluating different interventions, including no intervention, for treating mallet finger injuries.Data collection and analysis: Both authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information.Main results: Four trials were included. These involved a total of 278, mainly adult, participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. All four trials were methodologically flawed, including inadequate outcome assessment.Three trials compared different types of finger splints versus a standard Stack splint. One trial found a lower incidence of treatment failure in participants treated with a perforated custom-made splint. One trial found there were fewer complications in participants treated with a padded aluminium-alloy malleable finger splint; however, the incidence of treatment failure was similar in the two treatment groups. One trial evaluating the Abouna splint found a similar incidence of treatment failure in the two groups. However, the Abouna splint often needed replacing due to disintegration of its rubber cover and rusting of the exposed wires and was also less popular with participants.The fourth trial found no statistically significant differences between participants whose mallet finger was treated with Kirschner wire fixation and those with a Pryor and Howard splint. Similar numbers had complications in the two groups.Authors' conclusions: There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different, either custom-made or off-the-shelf, finger splints used for treating mallet finger injury. There was a useful reminder that splints used for prolonged immobilisation should be robust enough for everyday use, and of the central importance of patient adherence to instructions for splint use. There was insufficient evidence to determine when surgery is indicated. US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004574.pub2/abstract Record #4 of 13 ID: Rajan TI: External fixation versus conservative treatment for distal radial fractures in adults SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews YR: 2007 NO: 3 John Wiley & ('broken wrist') is a common clinical problem. It can be treated conservatively, usually involving wrist immobilisation in a plaster cast, or surgically. A key method of surgical fixation is external fixation.Objectives: To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing external fixation with conservative treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials involving The Royal Society of Medicine Library 11 adults with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared external fixation with conservative treatment.Data collection and analysis: After independent study selection by all review authors, two authors independently assessed the included trials. Independent data extraction of new trials was performed by two authors. Pooling of data was undertaken where appropriate.Main results: Fifteen heterogeneous trials, involving 1022 adults with dorsally displaced and potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures, were included. While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation especially in terms of patient characteristics and interventions. Methodological weaknesses among these trials included lack of allocation concealment and inadequate outcome assessment.External fixation maintained reduced fracture positions (redisplacement requiring secondary treatment: 7/356 versus 51/338 (data from 9 trials); relative risk 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.32) and prevented late collapse and malunion compared with plaster cast immobilisation. There was insufficient evidence to confirm a superior overall functional or clinical result for the external fixation group. External fixation was associated with a high number of complications, such as pin-track infection, but many of these were minor. Probably, some complications could have been avoided using a different surgical technique for pin insertion. There was insufficient evidence to establish a difference between the two groups in serious complications such as reflex sympathetic dystropy: 25/384 versus 17/347 (data from 11 trials); relative risk 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 2.32.Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults. Though there is insufficient evidence to confirm a better functional outcome, external fixation reduces redisplacement, gives improved anatomical results and most of the excess surgically-related complications are minor.

These included the application of an external support (plaster cast or brace) and fracture manipulation.Data collection and analysis: Both review authors performed independent trial selection and quality assessment. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional and clinical, including complications, outcomes. The trials were grouped into categories relating to manipulation of displaced fractures; use and extent, including forearm position, of immobilisation; use of braces; different casting materials and techniques; and duration of immobilisation. Although quantitative data from some trials are presented, the lack of good quality trials and trial heterogeneity inhibited pooling of results.Main results: One trial was newly included in this update. In all, there are 37 trials, involving a total of 4215 mainly female and older patients, meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Comprehensive details of the individual trials are provided in tabular form, and their results, grouped as indicated above, have been presented in text and graphs. The poor quality and heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, interventions compared and outcome measurement, of the included trials meant that no meta-analyses were undertaken.Authors' conclusions: There remains insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which methods of conservative treatment are the most appropriate for the more common types of distal radial fractures in adults. Therefore, at present, practitioners applying conservative management should use an accepted technique with which they are familiar, and which is cost-effective from the perspective of their provider unit. Patient preferences and circumstances, and the risk of complications should also be considered.Prioritising research questions to clarify the most appropriate conservative treatment for this common fracture is warranted. Researchers should differentiate between extra-articular and intra-articular, and non-displaced and displaced fractures, ascertain patient preferences, and agree a core outcome data set. US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000314/abstract Record #7 for non-ultrasound guided axillary brachial plexus block in adults undergoing surgery of the lower arm SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews YR: 2013 NO: Wiley plexus is a common anaesthetic technique for distal upper limb surgery. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and updated in 2011.Objectives: To compare the relative effects (benefits and harms) of three injection techniques (single, double and multiple) of axillary block of the brachial plexus for distal upper extremity surgery. We considered these effects primarily in terms of anaesthetic effectiveness; the complication rate (neurological and vascular); and pain and discomfort caused by performance of the block.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists of trials. We contacted trial authors. The date of the last search was March 2013 (updated from March 2011).Selection criteria: We The Royal Society of Medicine Library 13 included randomized controlled trials that compared double with single-injection techniques, multiple with single-injection techniques, or multiple with double-injection techniques for axillary block in adults undergoing surgery of the distal upper limb. We excluded trials using ultrasound-guided techniques.Data collection and analysis: Independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two investigators. We undertook meta-analysis.Main results: The 21 included trials involved a total of 2148 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery. Risk of bias assessment indicated that trial design and conduct were generally adequate; the most common areas of weakness were in blinding and allocation concealment.Eight trials comparing double versus single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (risk ratio (RR 0.51), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.85). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve location showed that the effect size was greater when neurostimulation was used rather than the transarterial technique.Eight trials comparing multiple with single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.44) and of incomplete motor block (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96) in the multiple injection group.Eleven trials comparing multiple with double injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40) and of incomplete motor block (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85) in the multiple injection group.Tourniquet pain was significantly reduced with multiple injections compared with double injections (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.84). Otherwise there were no statistically significant differences between groups in any of the three comparisons on secondary analgesia failure, complications and patient discomfort. The time for block performance was significantly shorter for single and double injections compared with multiple injections.Authors' conclusions: This review provides evidence that multiple-injection techniques using nerve stimulation for axillary plexus block produce more effective anaesthesia than either double or single-injection techniques. However, there was insufficient evidence for a significant difference in other outcomes, including safety.

No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating rehabilitation as part of the management of fractures of the distal radius sustained by adults. Rehabilitation interventions such as active and passive mobilisation exercises, and training for activities of daily living, could be used on their own or in combination, and be applied in various ways by various clinicians.Data collection and analysis: The authors independently selected and reviewed trials. Study authors were contacted for additional information. No data pooling was done.Main results: Fifteen trials, involving 746 mainly female and older patients, The Royal Society of Medicine Library 14 were included. Initial treatment was conservative, involving plaster cast immobilisation, in all but 27 participants whose fractures were fixed surgically. Though some trials were well conducted, others were methodologically compromised.For interventions started during immobilisation, there was weak evidence of improved hand function for hand therapy in the days after plaster cast removal, with some beneficial effects continuing one month later (one trial). There was weak evidence of improved hand function in the short term, but not in the longer term (three months), for early occupational therapy (one trial), and of a lack of differences in outcome between supervised and unsupervised exercises (one trial).For interventions started post-immobilisation, there was weak evidence of a lack of clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving formal rehabilitation therapy (four trials), passive mobilisation (two trials), ice or pulsed electromagnetic field (one trial), or whirlpool immersion (one trial) compared with no intervention. There was weak evidence of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion (post external fixation) (one trial), intermittent pneumatic compression (one trial) and ultrasound (one trial). There was weak evidence of better short-term hand function in participants given physiotherapy than in those given instructions for home exercises by a surgeon (one trial).Authors' conclusions: The available evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to establish the relative effectiveness of the various interventions used in the rehabilitation of adults with fractures of the distal radius.

The management, including surgical intervention, of these fractures varies widely. This is an update of a The Royal Society of Medicine Library 15 Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2010.Objectives: To review the evidence supporting the various treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search ended in January 2012.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials pertinent to the management of proximal humeral fractures in adults were selected.Data collection and analysis: Two people performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Only limited meta-analysis was performed.Main results: Twenty-three small randomised trials with a total of 1238 participants were included. Bias in these trials could not be ruled out. Additionally there is a need for caution in interpreting the results of these small trials, which generally do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that any non-statistically significant finding is 'evidence of no effect'.Eight trials evaluated conservative treatment. One trial found an arm sling was generally more comfortable than a less commonly used body bandage. There was some evidence that 'immediate' physiotherapy compared with that delayed until after three weeks of immobilisation resulted in less pain and potentially better recovery in people with undisplaced or other stable fractures. Similarly, there was evidence that mobilisation at one week instead of three weeks alleviated short term pain without compromising long term outcome. Two trials provided some evidence that unsupervised patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction for an adequate self-directed exercise programme.Six heterogeneous trials, involving a total of 270 participants with displaced and/or complex fractures, compared surgical versus conservative treatment. Pooled results of patient-reported functional scores at one year from three trials (153 participants) showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (standardised mean difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.22; negative results favour surgery). Quality of life based on the EuroQol results scores from three trials (153 participants) showed non-statistically significant differences between the two groups at three time points up to 12 months. However, the pooled EuroQol results at two years (101 participants) from two trials run concurrently from the same centre were significantly in favour of the surgical group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in mortality (8/98 versus 5/98; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.36; 4 trials). Significantly more surgical group patients had additional or secondary surgery (18/112 versus 5/111; RR 3.36, 95% CI 1.33 to 8.49; 5 trials). This is equivalent to an extra operation in one of every nine surgically treated patients.Different methods of surgical management were tested in seven small trials. One trial comparing two types of locking plate versus a locking nail for treating two-part surgical neck fractures found some evidence of better function after plate fixation but also of a higher rate of surgically-related complications. One trial comparing a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary nails found some evidence of a short-term benefit for the nailing group. Compared with hemiarthroplasty, tension-band fixation of severe injuries using wires was associated with a higher re-operation rate in one trial. Two trials found no important differences between 'polyaxial' and 'monaxial' screws combined with locking plate fixation. One trial produced some preliminary evidence that tended to support the use of medial support locking screws in locking plate fixation. One trial found better functional results for one of two types of hemiarthroplasty.Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial).Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to inform the management of these fractures. Early physiotherapy, without immobilisation, may be sufficient for some types of undisplaced fractures. It remains unclear whether surgery, even for specific fracture types, will produce consistently better long term outcomes but it is likely to be associated with a higher risk of surgery-related complications and requirement for further surgery.There is insufficient evidence to establish what is the best method of surgical treatment, either in terms of the use of different categories of surgical intervention (such as plate versus nail fixation, or hemiarthroplasty versus tension-wire fixation) or different methods of performing an intervention in the same category (such as different methods of plate fixation). There is insufficient evidence to say when to start mobilisation after either surgical fixation or hemiarthroplasty.

Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and more susceptible to redislocation, especially in active young adults.Objectives: To compare surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute anterior dislocation of the shoulder.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (14 August 2009), The Cochrane Library (2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009), trial registration databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions.Data collection and analysis: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results were pooled.Main results: The four included studies involved 163 participants, mainly active young adult males. All had had a primary (first time) traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Methodological quality was variable.All participants of one trial returned to active military duty. Two trials respectively reported similar numbers with reduced sports participation or non return to previous activities. The other, an inadequately reported, trial found significantly fewer people in the surgical group failed to attain previous levels of sports activity.Pooled results from all four trials showed that subsequent instability, either redislocation or subluxation, was statistically significantly less frequent in the surgical group (risk ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.44). This result remained statistically significant (risk ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.59) for the three trials reported in full. Half (17/33) of the conservatively treated patients with shoulder instability in these three trials opted for subsequent surgery.Different, mainly patient rated, functional assessment measures for the shoulder were recorded in these trials. The results were more favourable, usually statistically significantly so, in those treated surgically.The only complication reported was a septic joint in a surgically treated patient. There was no information on shoulder pain, long-term complications or resource use.Authors' conclusions: Limited evidence supports primary surgery for young adults, usually male, engaged in highly demanding physical activities who have sustained their first acute traumatic shoulder dislocation. There is no evidence available to determine which treatment is better for other patient groups.Sufficiently powered, good quality, well reported randomised trials are required that compare surgical treatment with conservative treatment for these injuries, including in people at lower risk of recurrence. Long-term surveillance of outcome, looking at shoulder disorders including osteoarthritis is also required. US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004325.pub2/abstract Record #12 the management of mandibular fractures SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews YR: 2013 NO: 7 The Royal Society of Medicine Library 17 PB: John Wiley & Sons, the mandible (lower jaw) are a common occurrence and usually related to interpersonal violence or road traffic accidents. Mandibular fractures may be treated using open (surgical) and closed (non-surgical) techniques. Fracture sites are immobilized with intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or other external or internal devices (i.e. plates and screws) to allow bone healing. Various techniques have been used, however uncertainty exists with respect to the specific indications for each approach.Objectives: The objective of this review is to provide reliable evidence of the effects of any interventions either open (surgical) or closed (non-surgical) that can be used in the management of mandibular fractures, excluding the condyles, in adult patients.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 28 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 February 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 February 2013), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to 7 April 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 7 April 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 7 April 2013). The reference lists of all trials identified were checked for further studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. Any studies that compared different treatment approaches were included.Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were to be expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was to be investigated to include both clinical and methodological factors.Main results: Twelve studies, assessed as high (six) and unclear (six) risk of bias, comprising 689 participants (830 fractures), were included. Interventions examined different plate materials and morphology; use of one or two lag screws; microplate versus miniplate; early and delayed mobilization; eyelet wires versus Rapid IMF? and the management of angle fractures with intraoral access alone or combined with a transbuccal approach. Patient-oriented outcomes were largely ignored and post-operative pain scores were inadequately reported. Unfortunately, only one or two trials with small sample sizes were conducted for each comparison and outcome. Our results and conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution. We were able to pool the results for two comparisons assessing one outcome. Pooled data from two studies comparing two miniplates versus one miniplate revealed no significant difference in the risk of post-operative infection of surgical site (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 0.41 to 4.22, P = 0.64, I2 = 0%). Similarly, no difference in post-operative infection between the use of two 3-dimensional (3D) and standard (2D) miniplates was determined (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.13, P = 0.81, I2 = 27%). The included studies involved a small number of participants with a low number of events.Authors' conclusions: This review illustrates that there is currently inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness of a single approach in the management of mandibular fractures without condylar involvement. The lack of high quality evidence may be explained by clinical diversity, variability in assessment tools used and difficulty in grading outcomes with existing measurement tools. Until high level evidence is available, treatment decisions should continue to be based on the clinician's prior experience and the individual circumstances.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005.Objectives: To assess the effects of different surgical techniques for trapeziometacarpal (thumb) osteoarthritis.Search methods: We searched the following sources up to 08 August 2013: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2013), EMBASE (1974 to August 2013), CINAHL (1982 to August 2013), Clinicaltrials.gov (to August 2013) and World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Portal (to August 2013).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs where the intervention was surgery for people with thumb osteoarthritis. Outcomes were pain, physical function, quality of life, patient global assessment, adverse events, treatment failure or trapeziometacarpal joint imaging.Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently screened and included studies according to the inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data, including adverse events.Main results: We included 11 studies with 670 participants. Seven surgical procedures were identified (trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition Artelon joint resurfacing, arthrodesis and Swanson joint replacement). We did not find any studies that compared surgery with sham surgery or surgery with non-surgical interventions.Most included studies had an unclear risk of most biases which raises doubt about the results. No procedure demonstrated any superiority over another in terms of pain, physical function, quality of life, patient global assessment, adverse events, treatment failure (re-operation) or trapeziometacarpal joint imaging. One study demonstrated a difference in adverse events (mild-moderate swelling) between Artelon joint replacement and trapeziectomy with tendon interposition. However, the quality of evidence was very low due to a high risk of bias and imprecision of results.Low quality evidence suggests trapeziectomy with LRTI may not provide additional benefits or result in more adverse events over trapeziectomy alone. Mean pain (three studies, 162 participants) was 26 mm on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (0 is no pain) for trapeziectomy alone, trapeziectomy with LRTI reduced pain by a mean of 2.8 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.8 to 4.2) or an absolute reduction of 3% (-10% to 4%). Mean physical function (three studies, 211 participants) was 31.1 points on a 0 to 100 point scale (0 is best physical function, or no disability) with trapeziectomy alone, trapeziectomy with LRTI resulted in sightly lower function scores (standardised mean difference 0.1, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.32), an equivalent to a worsening of 0.2 points (95% CI -5.8 to 6.1) on a 0 to 100 point scale (absolute decrease in function 0.03% (-0.83% to 0.88%)). Low quality evidence from four studies (328 participants) indicates that the mean number of adverse events was 10 per 100 participants for trapeziectomy alone, and 19 events per 100 participants for trapeziectomy with LRTI (RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.73) or an absolute risk increase of 9% (95% CI 0% to 28%). Low quality evidence from one study (42 participants) indicates that the mean scapho-metacarpal distance was 2.3 mm for the trapeziectomy alone group, trapeziectomy with LRTI resulted in a mean of 0.1 mm less distance (95% CI -0.81 to 0.61). None of the included trials reported global assessment, quality of life, and revision or re-operation rates.Low-quality evidence from two small studies (51 participants) indicated that trapeziectomy with LRTI may not improve function or slow joint degeneration, or produce additional adverse events over trapeziectomy and ligament reconstruction.We are uncertain of the benefits or harms of other surgical techniques due to the mostly low quality evidence from single studies and the low reporting rates of key outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to assess if trapeziectomy with LRTI had additional benefit over arthrodesis or trapeziectomy with IA. There was also insufficient The Royal Society of Medicine Library 19 evidence to assess if trapeziectomy with IA had any additional benefit over the Artelon joint implant, the Swanson joint replacement or trapeziectomy alone.Authors' conclusions: We did not identify any studies that compared surgery to sham surgery or to non-operative treatments. We were unable to demonstrate that any technique confers a benefit over another technique in terms of pain and physical function. Furthermore, the included studies were not of high enough quality to provide conclusive evidence that the compared techniques provided equivalent outcomes.

[Chinese] SO: Chung-Kuo Hsiu Fu Chung Chien Wai Tsa Chih/chinese Journal of Reparative & Reconstructive compare differences in the clinical outcomes between percutaneous pinning with plaster splint and open reduction and pulling out wire in the treatment of mallet fingers. METHODS: From December 2002 to September 2007, 72 patients with mallet fingers were treated. They were divided into two groups: group A and group B. In group A, 38 patients were treated by open reduction and pulling out wire, 34 males and 4 females, aged (26.0 +/- 8.5) years. Among them, 2 patients were injured in the index finger, 11 in the middle finger, 18 in the ring finger and 7 in the little finger. Thirty-three patients suffered from sports injuries, 5 from falling wounds. The average time between the injury and the surgery was (6.1 +/- 3.1) days. In group B, 34 patients were treated by percutaneous pinning with plaster splint, 26 males and 8 females, aged (28.1 +/- 10.7) years. Among them, 1 patient was injured in the index finger, 9 in the middle finger, 15 in the ring finger and 9 in the little finger. Thirty-one patients suffered from sports injuries, 3 from falling wounds. The average time between the injury and the surgery was (6.3 +/- 3.6) days. All the fingers had typical mallet malformation, and X-ray films showed avulsed fractures of distal-segment phalanxes at the dorsal basilar part. RESULTS: The operation time was (61.8 +/- 12.8) minutes in group A and (7.0 +/- 2.6) minutes in group B. All patients in both groups were followed up for 6-24 months (11.9 months on average in group A and 13.2 months in group B). In group A, apart from 3 patients who had flap necrosis and infection, all the other patients obtained healing by first intention. One patient had palmar skin ulcer at 6 days after the operation and healed after proper treatment. Thirty-six patients gained bone union at (47.6 +/- 8.7) days postoperatively and 2 patients had pseudarthrosis, which improved after reconstruction of the extensor tendon attachment point. According to the total active movement (TAM) functional assessment system, 10 cases were excellent, 18 good, 8 fair and 2 poor, with the choiceness rate of 73.7%. In group B, all incisions obtained healing by first intention without pin-track infection, flap necrosis and migration of the pins and gained bone union at (27.7 +/- 3.9) days after the operation. According to the TAM functional assessment system, 19 cases were excellent, 13 good and 2 fair, with the choiceness rate of 94.1%. There were significant differences between the two groups in operation time, complications, healing time and choiceness rate (P The Royal Society of Medicine Library 21 < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous pinning with plaster splint is simple in operation and has smaller incisions and fewer complications compared withopen reduction and pulling out wire, and proves to be a useful way in the treatment of mallet fingers.

SO: Journal of 10.1016/j.jhsa.2012.09.026 AB: PURPOSE: To determine the relative of various fixation methods for proximal phalanx intra-articular unicondylar fractures during simulated early active motion. METHODS: We created proximal phalangeal intra-articular unicondylar fractures in 13 fresh-frozen human cadaveric hands. Using a saw through a dorsal approach, we made an osteotomy beginning in the intercondylar notch and extending proximally at a 45\u00b0 angle to the radial border of the proximal phalanx. We fixed each of the 4 fingers on each hand with a 1.5-mm headless compression screw, a 1.5-mm lag screw, two 1.1-mm smooth K-wires, or one 1.1-mm smooth K-wire. We rotated the order of constructs randomly for each hand. We simulated active range of motion on a custom-loading device at 0.25 Hz from full finger extension to full flexion for 2,000 cycles and measured displacement by a differential variable reluctance transducer. RESULTS: We found no significant differences in displacement of the fracture site among the 4 methods of fixation. Movement in the control specimen with no osteotomy fixation was significantly higher than with each of the other fixation methods. CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanical stability did not differ among the fixation methods for proximal phalanx unicondylar fractures in a flexion-extension active range of motion model. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Fixation of these fractures with any of the methods tested may provide sufficient stability to withstand postoperative therapy when there is no substantial resistance to active motion.

Twenty-nine patients were treated by percutaneous transverse K-wire fixation and 30 patients were treated with intramedullary K-wires. They were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 24 months for radiological and functional outcome in terms of union rate, union time, complication rate, pain, movement and grip strength. Radiographs did not show any significant differences in the union rate and union time. There was no statistical difference in complication rate, pain scores, total active motion and grip strength between the two groups. The authors suggest that both methods are comparable, good and safe methods of treating closed, displaced fractures of the metacarpal neck of the little finger, without significant complications.

SO: Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland) YR: 2005 of the proximal interphalangeal joint of a finger were treated with either closed reduction and transarticular Kirschner wire fixation (eight cases) or open reduction and internal fixation, using either one or two lag screws (six cases) or a cerclage wire (five cases). At a mean follow-up of 7 (range 6-9) years, most patients reported satisfactory finger function, even though some of the injuries healed with proximal interphalangeal joint incongruency (seven cases) or subluxation (four cases). Those treated by open reduction complained of more \"loss of feeling\" in the affected finger and those specifically treated by cerclage wire fixation reported more cold intolerance and had a significantly larger fixed flexion deformity (median, 30 degrees : range 18-38 degrees ) and a smaller arc of motion (median, 48 degrees : range 45-60 degrees ) at the proximal interphalangeal joint, despite having the best radiological outcomes. Closed reduction and transarticular Kirschner wire fixation produced satisfactory results, with none of the eight patients experiencing significant persistent symptoms despite a reduced arc of proximal interphalangeal joint flexion (median=75 degrees ; range 60-108 degrees ). The results of this relatively simple treatment appear at least as satisfactory as those obtained by the two techniques of open reduction and internal fixation, both of which were technically demanding.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of the treatment of isolated fractures of phalanges in 22 patients, 18 men (82%) and 4 women (18%), aged a mean of 28 years, who were randomized to one of the two methods: close reduction and immobilization in a plastofit splint or percutaneous fixation by Kirschner-wires were assessed. Patients were followed-up at 2 and 6 months and measurements included active range of motion, total and pinch grip strength and DASH score. RESULTS: Bone healing was achieved in all patients. No significant secondary displacements were noted in either group, requiring change of the treatment mode. At 2 months, all but one (DASH score) considered parameters were statistically significantly better in patients treated conservatively. At 6 months, the outcomes did not differ statistically significantly, however were hence better in conservative treatment group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate greater effectiveness of conservative, than operative by Kirschner-wiring treatment of phalangeal fractures. One may assume that withdrawal of immobilization of proximal interphalangeal joint and early mobilization might improve functional results after operative treatment.

Functional mobilization was started after 1 week in both groups. A radiological and clinical assessment of flexion and extension of the small finger metacarpophalangeal joint was done at 2 and 6 weeks, and at 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition patient satisfaction and grip strength were recorded at 12 months. No statistically significant differences in range of motion and grip strength were found between the two groups. Patient satisfaction and the appearance were superior in the surgically treated group. We conclude that intramedullary splinting for displaced fractures of the little finger metacarpal neck offers an aesthetic, but not a functional advantage.

One was treated by closed reduction and Kirschner wire fixation and the second treated by open reduction and lag screw fixation. An independent observer assessed function, pain, movement, grip strength and intrinsic muscle function. X-rays were assessed for malunion. Thirty-two patients were entered the study and 15 in the Kirschner wire and 13 in the lag screw group were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 40 months. There was no significant difference in the functional recovery rates or in the pain scores for the two groups. X-rays showed similar rates of malunion and there were no statistically significant differences in range of movement or grip strength.

SO: Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume YR: 2005 VL: 87 performed a prospective, randomised study on 57 patients older than 60 years of age with unstable, extra-articular fractures of the distal radius to compare the outcome of immobilisation in a cast alone with that using supplementary, percutaneous pinning. Patients treated by percutaneous wires had a statistically significant improvement in dorsal angulation (mean 7 degrees), radial length (mean 3 mm) and radial inclination (mean 3 mm) at one year. However, there was no significant difference in functional outcome in terms of pain, range of movement, grip strength, activities of daily living and the SF-36 score except for an improved range of movement in ulnar deviation in the percutaneous wire group. One patient developed a pin-track infection which required removal of the wires at two weeks. We conclude that percutaneous pinning of unstable, extra-articular fractures of the distal radius provides only a marginal improvement in the radiological parameters compared with immobilisation in a cast alone. This does not correlate with an improved functional outcome in a low-demand, elderly population.

SO: Journal of oral and maxillofacial intention of this study was to compare the efficacy of eyelet wiring and direct interdental (Gilmer) wiring for achieving intermaxillary fixation (IMF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial. The study sample was derived from the population of patients who underwent IMF at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Sharad Pawar Dental College, Wardha, India, between October 2008 and September 2010. The time required for placement and removal (in minutes) was compared between the eyelet wiring and direct interdental wiring techniques. Postoperative stability after achieving IMF was analyzed in the 2 groups. The plaque accumulation in both groups was evaluated using the Turesky-Gilmore-Glickman modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index. Complications in the form of soft tissue injury, glove puncture, and trauma to the operator's finger were also recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistical software for Windows, version 8.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) using the ?(2) test and Student t test. RESULTS: The mean working time for placement and removal of eyelet wiring (group I) was 18.00 minutes and 9.67 minutes, respectively. For direct interdental wiring (group II), it was 30.50 minutes and 23.12 minutes, respectively. The mean plaque index values were 1.78 and 2.54 for groups I and II, respectively, which signifies a higher plaque deposition in group II. No occlusal disturbance was seen in either group. The incidences of glove perforation, soft tissue trauma, and trauma to the operator's finger were higher in group II. CONCLUSIONS: Eyelet wiring is preferable to direct interdental wiring as evidenced by fewer complications, and requires a shorter operating time in patients with minimally displaced fractures.

SO: Journal of orthopaedic trauma YR: 2006 VL: 20 The Royal Society of Medicine Library compare closed reduction and casting with closed reduction and external fixation with optional K-wire fixation for distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement but without joint incongruity. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Multicenter study at 3 University teaching hospitals. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 113 skeletally mature patients with distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement, but without joint incongruity, were randomized to receive 1 of 2 standardized treatment protocols. Patients were evaluated at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. INTERVENTION: Closed reduction and casting (n = 59) or closed reduction and external fixation (n = 54). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Upper extremity function was measured using upper extremity MFA domain scores, overall Jebsen Taylor scores, and pinch and grip strength tests. Global function and pain were measured using the SF-36. Radiographic evaluation and range of motion were documented. RESULTS: Upper extremity MFA scores, Jebsen Taylor scores, SF-36 bodily pain scores, and grip strength improved significantly during the first year for all patients. By 2 years, mean Jebsen Taylor scores and SF 36 bodily pain scores for patients in both groups were similar to scores for normal age- and gender-matched population controls. At all points, there was a trend for better function in the external fixation; however, this did not reach statistical significance. There was a trend for better length and palmar tilt restoration with external fixation. CONCLUSIONS: For distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement but with a congruous joint, there exists a trend for better functional, clinical, and radiographic outcomes when treated by immediate external fixation and optional K-wire fixation.

SO: Journal of hand surgery, European volume YR: of Medicine Library 28 DOI: 10.1016/j.jhse.2007.07.011 AB: The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical treatment of fractures of the little finger metacarpal neck, or \"Boxer's\" fractures, by transverse pinning and intramedullary pinning. Thirty-six patients with fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal were included in a prospective comparative randomised study. A palmar splint was applied for 1 week after both procedures. Patients began physiotherapy three times per week for 30 days. The patients were evaluated clinically six times after surgery, up to the 90th day, with X-ray assessment on days 8, 45 and 90. The study showed that intramedullary pinning gave better functional outcomes than transverse pinning, although the former was more technically demanding.

The additional cost of removing buried wires should be justified by a demonstrable reduction in the frequency and/or severity of infectious complications. We prospectively collected data on infective complications associated with K-wire use during the course of 1 year at our hand trauma unit. We observed seven (10%) infections in 70 patients where wires were left protruding and three (9%) infections in 34 patients where wires were buried. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of infectious complications. A cost analysis was performed, taking into account infectious complications and the cost of their management. Burying K-wires resulted in an extra cost of 235.51 per patient compared to 90.80 per patient for percutaneous K-wires. Thus, the use of buried K-wires results in a 144.71 increase in cost per patient.

SO: Journal of hand surgery, European 37 NO: 3 PG: 211-9 PM: PUBMED prospective study compared the treatment of trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis with a) trapeziectomy with no ligament reconstruction, no soft tissue interposition and no temporary Kirschner wire stabilization (Group T); b) trapeziectomy with flexor carpi radialis ligament reconstruction and interposition and temporary K-wire stabilization (Group T+LRTI). We followed 99 patients with 114 thumbs (59 T and 55 T+LRTI) for a mean of 6.2 (range, 4.2-8.1) years. There were no significant differences between the two treatments in any subjective or objective outcome measure at 6 year follow-up.

This intervention is usually with manipulation and Kirschner wires but advances in locking-plate technology have enabled surgeons to achieve anatomical reconstruction of complex fracture patterns, even in poor-quality osteoporotic bone.To ascertain if fixed-angle volar-locked plates confer a significant benefit over manipulation and Kirschner-wire stabilisation, we prospectively randomised 56 adult patients with isolated, closed,unilateral, unstable extra-articular fractures into two treatment groups, one fixed with K-wires and the other fixed with a volar locking plate.Functional outcomes were assessed using Gartland and Werley and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores. These were statistically better in the plate group at 3 and 6 months.Radiological assessment showed statistically better results at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, postoperatively.In the plate group, there was no significant loss of fracture reduction.

In contrast to the primary method of distraction osteogenesis, using Kirschner wire (K-wire) as an internal fixator is not common today. This study was conducted to evaluate distraction osteogenesis with and without K-wire. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 16 amputated fingers which were divided into two equal groups. While we used both orthofix M-100 and K-wire in the first group, only orthofix M-100 was implemented in the second group. The results were analyzed by t-test in SPSS<sub>11.5</sub>. RESULTS: Overall, 16 fingers of 8 male patients whose one or more fingers were cut due to hand trauma were evaluated in two random groups. The mean daily lengthening rates in Groups 1 and 2 were 0.44 + 0.17 mm and 0.4 + 0.11 mm, respectively (p = 0.59). The mean time required for 1 cm lengthening was 18.71 + 4.07 and 23.25 + 4.56 days in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.065). The mean value of overall lengthening was 16.25 + 8.05 mm in Group 1 and 16.69 + 4.89 mm in Group 2 (p = 0.89). Moreover, some minor complications occurred in 9 samples. CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. However, in the K-wire group, the time needed for 1 cm lengthening was clinically shorter. In addition, fewer complications, such as non-union and length loss, were observed in Group 1.

The series compared 42 patients treated by Kapandji's intrafocal pinning (Group I) and 46 patients treated by Py's isoelastic pinning (Group II). Secondary displacement was observed in 7 patients in group I and in 2 patients in Group II. Secondary displacement of K-wire was observed in 6 patients in group I and in no patient in group II. Functional results were analysed according to jakim's criteria. A significant difference was observed between the two groups, for global scores, objectives scores and radiological scores, with better results for Py's pinning. No significant difference was observed for subjective scores advantages of Py's pinning were: stability of isoelastic wires preventing posterior comminution and no need for radioscopic control. Kapandji's pinning is proposed in cases of lower and unstable fractures in teenagers without focal comminution and in T fractures. In the other cases of metaphyseal fractures with posterior displacement, Py's pinning could be proposed.

SO: Journal of hand ligament reconstruction and interposition improved the outcome of excision of the trapezium for the treatment of painful osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint. METHODS: 183 thumbs with trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis were randomized for treatment by either simple trapeziectomy, trapeziectomy with palmaris interposition, or trapeziectomy with of the flexor carpi radialis tendon. A K-wire was passed across the trapezial void during each of the 183 surgeries to hold the base of the thumb metacarpal at the level of the index carpometacarpal joint and was retained for 4 weeks in every case. All patients wore a thumb splint for 6 weeks. Each patient had subjective and objective assessments of thumb pain, stiffness, and strength before surgery and at 3 months and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: The 3 treatment groups were well matched for age, dominance, and presence of associated conditions. Complications were distributed evenly among the 3 groups and no cases of subluxation/dislocation of the pseudarthrosis were observed. Of the 183 thumbs 82% achieved good pain relief and 68% regained sufficient strength to allow normal activities of daily living at the 1-year follow-up evaluation. Neither of these subjective outcomes nor the range of thumb movement was influenced by the type of surgery performed. Thumb key-pinch strength improved significantly from 3.5 kg before surgery to 4.6 kg at 1 year but the improvement in strength was not influenced by the type of surgery performed. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of these 3 variations of trapeziectomy were very similar at 1-year follow-up evaluation. In the short term at least there appears to be no benefit to tendon interposition or ligament reconstruction.

A total of 280 consecutive patients were enrolled in a prospective database and 88 identified who met the inclusion criteria for surgery. They were randomised to receive either bridging external fixation with supplementary Kirschner-wire fixation or volar-locked plating with screws. Both groups were similar in terms of age, gender, hand dominance, fracture pattern, socio-economic status and medical co-morbidities. Although the patients treated by volar plating had a statistically significant early improvement in the range of movement of the wrist, this advantage diminished with time and in absolute terms the difference in range of movement was clinically unimportant. Radiologically, there were no clinically significant differences in the reductions, although more patients with AO/OTA (Orthopaedic Trauma Association) type C fractures were allocated to the external fixation group. The function at one year was similar in the two groups. No clear advantage could be demonstrated with either treatment but fewer re-operations were required in the external fixation group.

All children were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with Kirschner wires inserted from the radial side of the humerus. Postoperative follow-up at 12 and 18 weeks showed a significantly better elbow range of motion in the group with weekly physiotherapy, but there was no difference in elbow motion after 1 year.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 patients with non-union of humeral diaphyseal fractures were included in this study and were randomly allocated in two groups; group A had 20 cases treated with HIL and group B had 20 cases treated with LCP. Clinico-radiological assessments were done for each case up to 2-year follow-up period. Primary outcome measures (time to fracture union, union The Royal Society of Medicine Library 37 rate) and secondary outcome measures (functional outcome and complication such as infection, malunion, delayed union, implant failure, joint stiffness and iatrogenic radial nerve palsy) were compared between both the groups. Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scoring and Steward and Hundley's scoring system were used to assess functional outcome of the fracture fixation. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p = 0.12) in terms of mean fracture union time between group A (15.8 \u00b1 4.2 weeks) and group B (17.2 \u00b1 3.8 weeks). Group A had 95 % union rate and group B had 100 % union rate (p = 0.14). At the 2-year follow-up visit, there was no significant difference found between both the groups regarding range of motion of shoulder and elbow joint. There was no significant difference found in final functional outcomes between both the groups on comparing DASH score (p = 0.14) and Steward and Hundley's score (p = 0.08). In terms of complications, there was insignificant difference found between both the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that both the implants can be used in non-union of humeral shaft fractures with good functional outcomes and acceptable rate of complications.

A randomised, prospective study of bridging versus non-bridging external fixation. SO: Journal of bone and joint surgery. British volume YR: 1998 VL: A randomised, prospective study was carried out on 60 patients with unstable fractures of the distal radius to compare bridging with non-bridging external fixation using pins placed in the distal fragment of the radius. The radiological results showed significant improvement in the non-bridging group at all stages of review. In particular, normal volar tilt and carpal alignment were regained and maintained. The functional results at six weeks, three months, six months and one year showed statistically better grip strength and flexion in the non-bridging group at all stages of review. Other ranges of movement showed an early advantage in the non-bridging group. Non-bridging external fixation is the treatment of choice for unstable fractures of the distal radius which have sufficient space for the placement of pins in the distal fragment.

SO: Archives of orthopaedic and trauma continues to be the surgical treatment of choice for most long bone fractures. Performing distal interlocks can be a technical challenge. Free hand (FH) technique remains to be most popular. Radiation exposure, particularly to the surgeon still remains a concern with this technique. METHOD: A prospective randomized analysis of 20 patients undergoing operative fixation with long trochanteric fixation nailing for intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures was performed. The groups were randomized into (1) aiming arm group (AA) and (2) FH group by computer generated randomization technique. Two distal interlocking screws were placed in every case. Various parameters were analyzed including total operating time, distal interlocking time, total fluoroscopy time, distal fluoroscopy time and nail dimensions. The variables in two groups were compared to each other using Fischer's exact test. RESULT: The mean distal interlock time was 7.1 +/- 2.4 and 12.1 +/- 3.2 min for AA and FH techniques respectively. There was a 41.3% decrease in the distal interlock time with the device, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The distal interlock fluoroscopy time was 9.2 +/- 4.9 and 28.9 +/- 16.4 s with AA technique and the FH technique respectively. This 68.2% reduction in time taken for distal fluoroscopy was statistically significant (P < 0.001). However, the reduction in the total fluoroscopy time was statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: The AA is very efficient and user friendly and also reduces the radiation exposure.

SO: Journal of hand surgery YR: 2001 women with osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint were assessed prospectively. The patients were randomly allocated for treatment by either trapeziectomy alone (n = 26) or trapeziectomy with tendon interposition (n = 23) or ligament reconstruction (n = 24). A K-wire was passed through the thumb metacarpal base and across the trapezial space into the distal pole of the scaphoid in all procedures; this held the base of the metacarpal away from the scaphoid for 4 weeks. Standard thumb radiographs were used The Royal Society of Medicine Library 39 to calculate the trapezial space ratio before surgery and at 1-year follow-up examination. The trapezial space ratio decreased significantly from a preoperative mean of 0.40 (range, 0.20-0.56) to a mean of 0.18 (range, 0.08-0.30) trapeziectomy, 0.16 (range, 0.07-0.30) after tendon interposition, and 0.20 (range, 0.00-0.33) after trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction. There was no significant difference between these 1-year follow-up trapezial space ratios, suggesting that the placement of a K-wire across the trapezial void is as effective as tendon interposition or ligament reconstruction in creating a trapezial space in the short term at least. However, the need to create a trapezial space and maintain thumb length is questioned because the trapezial space height did not correlate with thumb strength at 1-year follow-up reduction internal fixation versus percutaneous pinning with external fixation of distal radius fractures: a prospective, randomized clinical trial. SO: Journal of hand YR: of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the functional outcomes of the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures, comparing treatment by external fixation and percutaneous pinning to open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a plate. METHODS: We randomized 53 patients with distal radius fractures that failed closed reduction and casting to ORIF (n = 27) or external fixation (n = 26). For pragmatic reasons, the choice of ORIF was left to the surgeon's discretion (early recruitment, dorsal plates [n = 9]; later recruitment, volar locked plates [n = 18]). Outcomes were measured before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, and 12 months and included the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; range of motion; grip strength; and serial radiographic analysis. Generalized linear modeling using repeated measures was used to identify differences in outcome scores between fixation types over time. Other continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t-test or one-way analysis of variance for multiple groups. RESULTS: There were no differences in the demographic characteristics or fracture severity between groups. Based on generalized linear modeling, on average, the ORIF group scored 11 points lower on the PRWE across all time points compared to the external fixation group. The PRWE detected higher pain and disability with external fixation before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 3 months. Using generalized linear modeling, a post hoc subgroup analysis identified significantly better (15-point advantage) PRWE scores averaged across all time points with volar locking plates compared to both external fixation and dorsal plating. CONCLUSIONS: The PRWE scores were significantly lower for patients treated with ORIF compared to those with external fixation, with the best outcomes observed with volar locking plates. These advantages were observed in the early postoperative period, and overall scores equalized at 1 year. A higher mean initial preoperative PRWE score was seen with external The Royal Society of Medicine Library 40 fixation, perhaps indicating a more severe initial injury. Given this difference, the interpretation of these results is not clear.

METHODS: We randomized 174 thumbs with trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis into 3 groups to undergo simple trapeziectomy, trapeziectomy with palmaris longus interposition, or trapeziectomy with of the flexor carpi radialis tendon. A K-wire was passed across the trapezial void and retained for 4 weeks, and a thumb spica was used for 6 weeks in all 3 groups. We reviewed 153 thumbs after a minimum of 5 years (median, 6 y; range, 5-18 y) after surgery with subjective and objective assessments of thumb pain, function, and strength. RESULTS: There was no difference in the pain relief achieved in the 3 treatment groups, with good results in 120 (78%) patients. Grip strength and key and tip pinch strengths did not differ among the 3 groups and range of movement of the thumb was similar. Few complications persisted after 5 years, and these were distributed evenly among the 3 groups. Compared with the results at 1 year in the same group of patients, the good pain relief achieved was maintained in the longer term, irrespective of the type of surgery. While improvements in grip strength achieved at 1 year after surgery were preserved, the key and tip pinch strengths deteriorated with time, but the type of surgery did not influence this. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of these 3 variations of trapeziectomy were similar after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. There appears to be no benefit to tendon interposition or ligament reconstruction in the longer term. extra-articular distal radial fractures. SO: Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, YR: 1999 treatment of extra-articular distal radial fractures by closed reduction and plaster application was compared with Kapandji-pinning. Closed reduction and plaster cast was used in 50 patients, Kapandji-pinning in 48 patients. According to the Cooney score, good and excellent results were found in the closed reduction and plaster cast group in 74%, compared with 75% in the Kapandji-pinning group. After measuring the maintenance of reduction as well as the functional outcome at 1 year follow-up, no statistically significant differences could be found between the two groups. We conclude that both techniques can be used in treating extra-articular fractures of the distal radius.

This database is included as part of the Cochrane Library but it's updated there quarterly. On CRD's own web site, this database is updated monthly. As results can be downloaded collectively, all citations from the final search set are listed below without any further assessment for relevancy (e.g. hand fractures only). 6 records of published or in progress health technology assessments: Record #1 TTL: Technology and Ageing I: safety alarm systems and counseling for housing adaption AUT: Wild C, Kirschner A XSO: Vienna: Institute of Technology Assessment (ITA) PUB: Institute of Technology Assessment (ITA) XYR: 1993 XPT: Report XST: This is a bibliographic record of a published health technology assessment from a member of INAHTA.

XAO: In high-income countries, 6% of all women will have sustained a fracture of the wrist (distal radius) by the age of 80 years and 9% by the age of 90 years. Advances in orthopaedic surgery have improved the outcome for patients: many such fractures can be treated in a plaster cast alone, but others require surgical fixation to hold the bone in place while they heal. The existing evidence suggests that modern locking-plate fixation provides improved functional outcomes, but costs more than traditional wire fixation. CO1: England KWO: Bone Plates; Bone Wires; Fracture http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=32011000690 In the United States, just over 677,000 patients underwent spinal operations (laminectomy and fusion) in 2010. For laminectomy and fusion, spinal surgeons implant various constructs such as rods, plates, and interbody cages, which are fastened together and stabilized by pedicle screws, wires, and pins. Traditional methods for guiding the instruments and implants are direct visualization of the spinal structures, and free hand techniques, serial radiography, real-time fluoroscopy, and computed tomographic image sets. The Royal Society of Medicine Library 82 Accurate placement of pedicle screws is paramount to the success of spinal surgery since they help to stabilize other spinal implants. Even when an experienced surgeon uses standard fluoroscopic guidance, screws can be misaligned medially in approximately 5% of cases, and inferolaterally in approximately 15% of cases, which can lead to neurovascular damage. Due to this and the time constraints and potential for exposure to radiation with traditional imaging methods, new technologies have been developed.

CO1: England KWO: Humans; Tibial One high-quality systematic review was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of intramedullary nails in comparison with extramedullary sliding hip screws for treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures. The following conclusions were reached: Based on high quality of evidence, there was no significant difference in reoperations among patients receiving intramedullary nails versus those receiving sliding hip screws. Based on high quality of evidence, there was no significant difference in mean mobility scores measured using the Parker-Palmer score between patients receiving intramedullary nails and those receiving sliding hip screws.
