Know the possible symptoms of COVID-19 in children and what you can do to protect your child. How likely is it for a child to become sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Children represent about 18% of all reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S. since the pandemic began. While children are as likely to get COVID-19 as adults, kids are less likely to become severely ill. Up to 50% of children and adolescents might have COVID-19 with no symptoms. However, some children with COVID-19 need to be hospitalized, treated in the intensive care unit or placed on a ventilator to help them breathe. Certain medical conditions might increase a child's risk of serious illness with COVID-19, including: - Obesity - Diabetes - Asthma - Congenital heart disease - Genetic conditions - Conditions affecting the nervous system or metabolism Research also suggests disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children than in non-Hispanic white children. How are babies affected by COVID-19? Babies under age 1 might be at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 than older children. Newborns can get COVID-19 during childbirth or by exposure to sick caregivers after delivery. If you have COVID-19 or are waiting for test results due to symptoms during your stay in the hospital after childbirth, wear a well-fitting face mask and have clean hands when caring for your newborn. Keeping your newborn's crib by your bed while you are in the hospital is OK, but maintain a reasonable distance from your baby when possible. When these steps are taken, the risk of a newborn getting COVID-19 is low. However, if you are severely ill with COVID-19, you might need to be temporarily separated from your newborn. Infants who have COVID-19 but no symptoms might be sent home from the hospital, depending on the circumstances. It's recommended that the baby's caregivers wear face masks and wash their hands to protect themselves. Frequent follow-up with the baby's health care professional is needed \u2014 by phone, virtual visits or in-office visits \u2014 for 14 days. Infants who test negative for COVID-19 can be sent home from the hospital. What are the symptoms of COVID-19 in children? Children with COVID-19 might have many symptoms, only a few symptoms or no symptoms. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are cough and fever. Possible signs and symptoms include: - Fever - Cough that becomes productive - Chest pain - New loss of taste or smell - Changes in the skin, such as discolored areas on the feet and hands - Sore throat - Nausea, vomiting, belly pain or diarrhea - Chills - Muscle aches and pain - Extreme fatigue - New severe headache - New nasal congestion COVID-19 symptoms appear on average about 6 days after a COVID-19 exposure. It can be hard to tell if your child has COVID-19 or another illness with similar symptoms, such as the flu or hay fever. If you think your child might have COVID-19: - Talk to your child's health care professional. - Keep your child at home and away from others, except to get medical care. If possible, have your child use a separate bedroom and bathroom. - Follow recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and your government regarding quarantine and isolation measures, as needed. - Focus on symptom relief. This might include rest, plenty of fluids and use of pain relievers. - Call the health care professional if your child keeps getting sicker. Emergency warning signs include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds \u2014 depending on your child's skin tone. Factors used to decide whether to test your child for COVID-19 may differ depending on where you live. In the U.S., a health care professional will determine whether to conduct diagnostic tests for COVID-19 based on your child's symptoms, as well as whether your child has had close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19. A health care professional may also consider testing if your child is at higher risk of serious illness. To test for COVID-19, a health care professional uses a long swab to take a sample from the back of the nose (nasopharyngeal swab). The sample is then sent to a lab for testing. If your child is coughing up phlegm (sputum), that may be sent for testing. Supporting Your Child During COVID-19 Nasal Swab Testing The purpose of this video is to prepare children for a COVID-19 nasal swab test, to help ease some of their potential fear and anxiety. When children are prepared to take a medical test, they become more cooperative and compliant, which creates a positive coping experience for them. This video has been made to be watched by children as young as 4 years old. Jennifer Rodemeyer, Child Life Program Manager, Mayo Clinic: Hi, I'm Jennifer and I am a child life specialist at Mayo Clinic. My job is to help kids like you prepare for medical tests. You may have heard there is a virus going around that can make people feel sick. A virus is a germ and it is so tiny you can't even see it. Some people who get this virus can have a fever or a cough and may feel achy and tired, while some people can have this virus and not feel sick at all. People may get this virus from touching things. That's why it's important to wash your hands often with soap and water. The virus also can spread through a cough or a sneeze. So it's important to always cover your cough or sneeze. Today, even though you may or may not be feeling sick, we will need to give you a test so we know how to best proceed with your medical care. This medical test will tell us if you have the virus. When you go to take your test, the health care provider will wear special protective clothing. They wear this clothing to keep themselves and you safe from getting germs. They will wear a mask to cover their nose and mouth and a clear plastic shield to protect their eyes. The most important thing you can do during your test is to sit perfectly still like a statue. To help make sure you don't move, your parent or caregiver will help keep you still and calm during your test. The health care provider needs to touch the inside of the back of your nose with a long, skinny Q-tip. To do this, you need to hold your chin up, then the health care provider will put the Q-tip in your nose for a short time to collect a sample. While this happens you may feel like you want to push the Q-tip away, but it's really important to stay as still as possible so the health care provider can finish the test. The Q-tip will be in and out of your nose in a few seconds. Some kids tell me that counting to 3 or taking a deep breath relaxes them before the test happens, and some tell me they like to hold on to their favorite stuffed animal or blanket. Maybe you have your own way to relax. Remember that during the test, the most important thing to do is to keep your body perfectly still. You may have many feelings seeing the health care provider wearing different clothing, but know this person is caring and wants to help you. Thank you for helping us get this test done, so we know how to proceed with your medical care. What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition in which some parts of the body \u2014 such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes \u2014 become severely inflamed. Evidence indicates that many of these children were infected with the COVID-19 virus in the past, as shown by positive antibody test results, suggesting that MIS-C is caused by an excessive immune response related to COVID-19. Possible signs and symptoms of MIS-C include: - Fever that lasts 24 hours or longer - Vomiting - Diarrhea - Pain in the stomach - Skin rash - Fast heartbeat - Rapid breathing - Red eyes - Redness or swelling of the lips and tongue - Feeling unusually tired - Redness or swelling of the hands or feet - Headache, dizziness or lightheadedness - Enlarged lymph nodes Emergency warning signs of MIS-C include: - Inability to wake up or stay awake - Difficulty breathing - New confusion - Pale, gray or blue-colored skin, lips or nail beds \u2014 depending on skin tone - Severe stomach pain If your child shows any emergency warning signs or is severely sick with other signs and symptoms, take your child to the nearest emergency department or call 911 or your local emergency number. If your child isn't severely ill but shows other signs or symptoms of MIS-C, contact your child's health care professional right away for advice. Can children who get COVID-19 experience long-term effects? Anyone who has had COVID-19 can develop a post-COVID-19 condition. Research suggests that children with both mild and severe COVID-19 have experienced long-term symptoms. The most common symptoms in children include: - Tiredness or fatigue - Headache - Trouble sleeping - Trouble concentrating - Muscle and joint pain - Cough These symptoms could affect your child's ability to attend school or do his or her usual activities. If your child is experiencing long-term symptoms, consider talking to your child's teachers about his or her needs. If children don't frequently experience severe illness with COVID-19, why do they need a COVID-19 vaccine? While rare, some children can become seriously ill with COVID-19 after getting the virus that causes COVID-19. A COVID-19 vaccine and booster, updated to the most common strain of the virus that causes COVID-19, might prevent your child from getting the virus that causes COVID-19. It also may prevent your child from becoming seriously ill or having to stay in the hospital due to the COVID-19 virus. What COVID-19 vaccines are available to kids in the U.S.? In the U.S., COVID-19 vaccines are available to children based on their age. The number of shots, also called doses, depends on the vaccine and the child's vaccine history. - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. For children between ages 6 months and 4 years, three shots of the vaccine brings them up to date. The three shots may be a mix of the original, called monovalent, vaccine and the currently available vaccine called an updated or bivalent vaccine. After the first dose, the second shot is given at least 3 to 8 weeks later. The third shot is given at least 8 weeks after that. If a child has had three shots of the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the child is eligible for one additional dose of the bivalent vaccine at least eight weeks after their last monovalent shot. People age 5 years and older who are unvaccinated need one shot to be considered up to date. Those who already had one dose of monovalent vaccine can get a bivalent shot at least eight weeks after the original dose. For people age 5 and older who have already had one dose of the bivalent vaccine, the CDC hasn't recommended more shots. - Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. For children between ages 6 months and 5 years, the series is two doses. After the first dose, the second is given at least 4 to 8 weeks later. For kids between ages 6 months and 5 years who previously got two shots of the monovalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, an additional dose of the currently available bivalent vaccine is recommended. That shot can be given at least eight weeks after the second monovalent vaccine. For people age 6 and older one shot will bring them up to date. For people in this age group who had one shot of the monovalent vaccine, an additional dose of the bivalent vaccine is recommended. This can be given at least eight weeks after the first shot. - Novavax vaccine. For people age 12 and older the series is two shots of the vaccine. The second shot is recommended 3 to 8 weeks after the first shot. The CDC recommends that people who get a Novavax vaccine series also get one shot of either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent vaccine at least eight weeks after their second Novavax shot. An eight-week interval between the first and second doses might be best for some people, especially males ages 12 to 39. A longer interval might give more protection against COVID-19 and lower the risk of rare heart problems, such as myocarditis and pericarditis. Also, if your child recently had COVID-19, you may talk to a health care professional about delaying vaccination by up to three months. What can I do to prevent my child from getting COVID-19? There are many steps you can take to prevent your child from getting the COVID-19 virus and spreading it to others. The CDC recommends: - Getting vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. A COVID-19 vaccine can be given to eligible children on the same day as other vaccines. - Wearing face masks. If you are in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital, the CDC recommends wearing a well-fitted mask indoors in public, whether or not you're vaccinated. Don't place a face mask on a child younger than age 2 or a child with a disability who can't safely wear a mask. - Keeping hands clean. Encourage frequent handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Have your child cover his or her mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Remind your child to avoid touching his or her eyes, nose and mouth. Teach your kids to keep washing their hands until they have sung the entire \"Happy Birthday\" song twice (about 20 seconds). - Cleaning and disinfecting your home. Clean high-touch surfaces and objects regularly and after you have visitors in your home. Also, regularly clean areas that easily get dirty, such as a baby's changing table, and surfaces and items that your child often touches. In addition, keep up with well-child visits and your child's other vaccines \u2014 especially if your child is under age 2. If your child is due for a checkup and you're concerned about exposure to COVID-19, talk to your child's doctor about safety steps being taken. Don't let fear of getting COVID-19 prevent your child from getting vaccines to prevent other serious illnesses. Following guidelines to protect against the COVID-19 virus can be difficult for kids. Stay patient. Be a good role model and your child will be more likely to follow your lead.
