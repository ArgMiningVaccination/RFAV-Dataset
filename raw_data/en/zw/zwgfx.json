To ensure you also create a healthy space, we discover some of the best ethical brands of natural & non-toxic candles. Since the times of castles, Hogwarts, Vikings, Incas and Mayas, every scene is lit by a flame. Candlelight has been used since ancient times and is a symbol of the mystical word. Candles are a romantic way to add soft and gentle natural light to an atmosphere... And why not? You can always re-create your Dumbledore room and make your wishes come true! From the top of your imagination, to every special moment... candles can change the whole vibe when you place them on a dinner table. You can enhance the romance by choosing candles with aromas. When you're caught taking a bath, on the yoga mat or self-care ritual, candles can change the whole aura and become your guiding light. In a nutshell, candles are not simply a stick of wax with a wick. Candles deliver the meaning in the exact way you choose to honour them with. How to find natural & non-toxic candles Now that we are convinced about candles, let's make sure we also understand why it is important that we choose to light our rooms with natural and non-toxic candles. Back when we interviewed Jennifer, founder at one of our favourite ethically-made candle brands [M&J London](https://ourgoodbrands.com/ethical-scented-candles-spark-holistic-aromas-mj-london/), she helped us realise that what goes into candles and its potential negative impact on the environment is rather important to take into account. Especially if we want to create a clean-burning experience where you would only breathe a lovely and healthy fragrance. When looking for natural and non toxic candles, here are some of the questions we need to ask to ensure they're ethically and sustainably made: - Are the candles 100% made out of soy, vegetable, coconut or beeswax? Avoid paraffin and petroleum derived candles as they're made of complex mixtures that can contain thousands of components including allergens, VOCs, and phthalates. Instead, look for natural options like soy wax, vegetable wax, coconut wax and beeswax. - How are the scents in candles formulated, and do they use good quality [organic essential oils](https://ourgoodbrands.com/ethically-made-organic-essential-oils-natural-healing/)or natural are to be avoided; because this could be a sign the product has been scented or blended with synthetic fragrances (which are derived from petroleum). Ultimately look for candles that have been scented with essential oils only. - What is the material used for the wick? Lead wicks were banned in 2003 as it was found that synthetic and problematic volatile organic compounds (including formaldehyde), could be released into the air while a candle burns. Therefore natural and non toxic candles will have a lead-free wick made of linen and/or cotton. Also check with the brand if the cotton or linen is \"unbleached\", otherwise it means the wick has gone through a chemical bleaching process. - Is the packaging glass, and/or can it be repurposed? We also learned that brands can choose to use recycled glass tumblers, which cost four times as much as standard virgin manufactured glasses. Those brands that do use recycled glass wins one point forward for the environment. - Where are the candles made? Is your brand local or does it come from overseas? Take into account the positive aspects of supporting your local economy, and observe where from the brand supplies the materials as well as where the candles are produced. - Who made your candles? Are the people involved in the whole process paid fairly and work under safe conditions? - Does the brand support back to a cause? Some brands choose to give a percentage of their benefits to reinvest back in causes. This is a common practice among [eco & social enterprises](https://ourgoodbrands.com/what-is-how-operates-social-enterprise/).
