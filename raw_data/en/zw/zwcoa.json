The Magic Is Happening Right Now Have a look at the 21st century with spiritual glasses and you might see this We are spiritual beings with a soul. I'm just so convinced of this fact that I often forget to say it out loud. We, humans, have a purpose. We have a soul's purpose. And if we shed the layers of so-called intellect and go to our wild core, we can feel it clearly. So, what is spiritual awakening? And are some people more awake than others? Is there a hierarchy in awakening? And how do we go about awakening? My friend [Lanu Pitan](https://medium.com/u/5e022e607335?source=post_page-----beec0fda072a--------------------------------) wrote: \" [Spiritual Awakening in the 21st Century](/spiritual-secrets/spiritual-awakening-in-the-21st-century-e2244b1ff1f6)\". And she inspired me big time with her story! Inspired me enough to give my views. I would love to hear your personal insights. And together achieve some kind of further awakening. Being awake is all there is. It's a journey. And let me tell you a little secret upfront. We're all students, learning from each other. No teachers here. No gurus. There are no enlightened beings on this Earth. My life partner [Mike always tells me](https://psiloveyou.xyz/how-the-universe-can-be-your-dating-agency-too-5e1ee0bc57b0) very clearly (and he is often more awake than I am): \"Full enlightenment only takes place in your coffin\" Of course, you can learn from people who walk a little ahead of you. But you have to do your own work. It's hard. It sometimes sucks. But o my, how rewarding it is when I have managed another mile on my journey. And then I celebrate with the people who are in my spiritual tribe. You don't have a tribe yet? Go, find one. It doesn't take much. Just be you. Authentic you. Kind you. And you'll attract your tribe. Some people are in there for a short period of time. Don't hold on to them. They are in your tribe just to teach you something. Or you are in their tribe to teach them. Others will be in there for life. The organism expands and contracts like breathing. And you are in the middle. Be the breath. Breathe! And live life to the full... Only YOU know what your life looks like and what you need in order to grow as a person on this planet. So, don't look... "}
