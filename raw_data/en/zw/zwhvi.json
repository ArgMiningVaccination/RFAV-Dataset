Call to Order and Roll Call Meeting called to ord er at 1:15 PM. Roll Call: Kevin Whittington , OptumRx Carl Jeffery , Mary Public Comment Shamim Nagy, Chair: Calls for public comment. March 24, 2016 Page 3 3 2. Administrative A. For Possible Action: Shamim Nagy, Chair : We need a motion for approval of the minutes from the last meeting. Review and a pprove meeting Minutes from December 3, 2015 Weldon Havins: So moved. Adam Zold: Second . Voting: Ayes across the board, the motion carries. B. Status Update by DHCFP 1. Public Comment Mary Griffith: Coleen Lawrence is working in the Director's office for the Director of Health and Human Services. Interim CPT chief is Marti Cote. We have a permanent person starting soon, Shannon Sprout. She has been with the State for a long time. From CMS on covered outpatient drugs as a result of the ACA, the biggest change is how we reimburse 340b providers. We are prohibited from exceeding the ceiling price, even though we don't know what it is. That is one of the things we are working through. We do have the WebEx up, so please talk clearly if you are going to give public comment. Weldon Havins: What is a 340b provider? Mary Griffith : A 340b provider is a federal program where certain clinics in Nevada get drug discounts from the manufacture. We don't collect rebates on these claims. It started to expand with ACA. It doesn't impact this group, but it does impact DHCFP. Shamim Nagy, Chair : Public comment? None. 3. Established Drug Classes A. Respiratory Long -Acting Anti- muscarinic/Long -Acting Beta -Agonist Combinations Shamim Nagy, Chair : Moving to the established class of drugs. The respiratory long- acting anti - muscarini c/long- acting beta-agonist combinations. March 24, 2016 Page 4 4 Carl Jeffery : We anticipated a new product on the market by the time of the meeting, but it is not yet available. We ask the chair to bypass this agenda topic. B. Acne Agents: Topical, Benzoyl Peroxide, Antibiotics and Combination Products Shamim Nagy, Chair: a cne agents. Any public comment? No. Carl Jeffery : We have a new product on the market in this class, generic dapsone, or Aczone is the trade name for it. The Duac CS is no longer on the market. We wanted to review this class with the Committee. I am not going to spend a lot of time on the clinical side with this class. Most of these have been on the market for a long time and are well known. The anti- infectives are well established in the guidelines in the treatment of acne, and it is not different with the dapsone. These are all categorized as anti -infectives. The guidelines recommend a dding benzoyl peroxide with the clindamycin and erythromycin so there is not as much drug resistance. The safety and efficacy is well known and are shown to be more effective than placebo. Sulfacetamide of note was available on the market before the 1962 FDA classification and was never sh own to be safe and effective. It is widely used, but it is not approved. Aczone was approved based on two studies. Shown to be safe and more effective over vehicle alone. Another study looked at adolescent females vs. adult females and it was shown it was more effective in the adults, but the researches were not sure why. There are several dosage forms available. Optum recommends the Committee consider these clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Adam Zold: I motion that they are therapeutically equivalent. Weldon Havins : Second . Voting: Ayes across the board, the motion carries. Carl Jeffery : We want to shuffle this around a little. Aczone we recommend be non- preferred, and move sulfacetamide to non-preferred since it is not FDA approved. T here are some new products, Onexton and Acanya are newer combination products to be preferred. A couple new aerosol products on the market. They shouldn't be first line, so we are recommending these be non-preferred. Evelyn Chu: I make a motion to accept the list as presented . Michael Hautekeet: Second . Voting: Ayes across the board, the motion carries. 4. Proposed New Drug Classes A. Ophthalmic Anti- infect ive/Anti- inflammatory Combinations Shamim Nagy, Chair : The next class, ophthalmic anti- infective/an ti-inflammatory combinations. March 24, 2016 Page 5 5 Public comment? None. Carl Jeffery : This is a new class we would like to propose adding to the PDL. We have the individual products on the list now, but would like to add the combinations. A couple newer product s, Pred G, Zylet, they are all combinations of well-known products that have been out for years. Most are available generically, just the Pred -G and the Zylet do not have generics. The Zylet has tobramycin and a newer steroid that is in Alrex. Optum recommends these be considered clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Weldon Havins : I move these drugs be considered clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Michael Hautekeet: Second . Voting: Ayes across the board, the motion carries. Carl Jeffery : Our re commendation is shown on the screen. The Pred-G and Zylet are the two brand names available as preferred. The Tobradex ointment, sulfa/prednisone and the Neo/Poly/Dexamethasone are all widely used. But the one that might get some pushback is the Tobradex suspension as it is widely used and this may not be a popular decision. Having Zylet which is the same ingredient, we are hoping to push some utilization to that medication. Weldon Havins: The Tobradex s uspension is also available as a generic. Carl Jeffery: Right, we have the generic listed as non -preferred as well. Weldon Havins: I think this is a commonly used medication, I hate to see it not available. I move that we move the generic T obramycin dexamethasone be move to preferred. And that the preferred drug list be accepted. Adam Zold: Second . Voting: Ayes across the board, B. Injectable Long -Acting Atypical Antipsychotics Shamim Nagy, Chair : class is long- acting injectable atypical antipsychotics. Optum wanted to make a comment before we open to public comment? Carl Jeffery : Thank you. I know there will be public comment for this class, to make sure everyone is on the same field. We have to cover them, but there are some limitations, on or before June 30, 2010. I understand the way this is interpreted is that if the product was on the market before June 30, 2010, the Committee cannot make them non-preferred. If the product came on the market after that date, the Committee has the option to make it non-preferred. Also, the exception criteria, recipients discharged from an acute mental health facility have up to 90 day to see a provider. They will be given an approval for 90 regardless if preferred or non-preferred. Th at is across the board and is how the oral atypical antipsychotics are being handled. March 24, 2016 Page 6 6 Mary Griffith : As of April, we will have a public hearing on some other changes, that 90 days will be increased to 6 months. Carl Jeffery : The other exclusion criteria, in order for a member to get a non- preferred medication, they only need to try one preferred. The other classes require two trials. I would like to make sure we keep the comments in line with our objective here and not get sidetracked with PA process or what the call center does. Shamim Nagy, Chair: Public comment? Samantha Min: My name is Samantha Min, I am a Pharm.D. with the Medical Affairs Department with Otsuka and I want to talk today about Abilify Maintena. I want to first review our position on open access. Reviews studies showing different medications work differently for different patients. Formulary restrictions more likely to be hospitalized and have higher costs. Otsuka supports open access to all medication. She presented indications and trials of Abilify Maintena , adverse events and black boxed warning. I ask for Abilify Maintena to be available unrestricted. MaryKay Queener : My name is MaryKay Queener, I'm a Pharm.D. with Johnson and Johnson. I also support open access and support Invega Trinza and Consta on the preferred drug list. Weldon Havins: So you are in favor of having these on the preferred drug list? Mary Kay Queener : I am . Robert Horne : I am Dr. Robert Horne. I was previously on the P&T. I'm asking today this class not be removed from the excluded list. He presented on two studies involving , fewer hospitalizations and readmissions with long- acting injectable antipsychotics. The problem is if you put all of these on, next year they don't have to be all preferred. If they continue to be excluded, then we don't have to worry about it becoming non-preferred at some point. We don't want to be in a position of having to use Haldol or Prolixin like some MCOs. I think it would be best for psychiatrists to use what is best for the individual patient, we know our patient's better. Please allow us to continue to use the best medication at the time for that patient by excluding these medications from the preferred drug list. Weldon Havins : Dr. Horne, is it your impression that all these drugs are on the excluded drug list. Robert Horne : I know there is some controversy about what is excluded, but I think these are all excluded. I don't think they should all be excluded. Weldon Havins : Do you think they should be moved to the excluded list? Robert Horne : Yes . Weldon Havins: Is it your understanding that if they are on the preferred drug list they have to fail on some other drug to use these? March 24, 2016 Page 7 7 Robert Horne: For the patient for one of the two MCO's, they have to fail Prolixin or Haldol. Mary Griffith : This criteria is for fee for service onl y, this will not affect MCO coverage. Robert Horne: I understand that, if it comes off the excluded list and added to the preferred drug list, it can be moved to non-preferred the following year. I don't want to see that happen and the only way I know to make sure it doesn't happen is if they all stay on the excluded list. Weldon Havins : But you are aware if they were on the preferred drug that psychiatrists could use these without any drug failure. Robert Horne : Right, for the next year, but what I'm saying is I have seen many times something that is preferred on the list and be non- preferred the next year. Weldon Havins: But to do that it would have to come before this Committee . Robert Horne : Yes, but it come s up every year. Weldon Havins : Potentially. Robert Horne: So I would just like to see it not to be able to happen for the benefit of my patients. Thank you. Dr. Gellifen: I'm the D irector of M ental H ealth. We sent a letter yesterday for the Committee , I just wanted to make sure the Committee saw the letter and ask for any questions. Carl Jeffery : He is referring to the letter from Dr. Gellifin, you should have a copy. Dr. Gellifin, I do not see any questions from the Committee at this time. Dr. Gell ifen: Thank you. I just want to request to not have any restriction to this class of medications as expressed in the letter. Shamim Nagy, Chair: Any other public comment? Carl Jeffery : We talked about the exclusion criteria and the Committee I think understands the ramification. We have the injectable atypical antipsychotics, they are all available orally as well and you can see the indications for each listed on the screen. What really separates these products is the half- life. On the screen lists th e number of days for the half- life. There have been a lot of trials showing they are safe and effective, they are used quite a bit. They are established in numerous trials. The clinical guidelines do not have a preference for one single agent. The Zypr exa is part of a limited distribution due to some special administration requirements and a black box warning. When looking at practice guidelines, they have not been updated for a while, they say these agents are good for patients having a hard time with compliance. That is really where they fall into therapy according to these guidelines. This slide shows the brand and generic names of each of the injectable product. Optum recommends these products be considered clinically and therapeutically equivalent. March 24, 2016 Page 8 8 Weldon Havins: The list you presented highlighted in yellow, are those currently part of the excluded list? Carl Jeffery : The initial screen showed that we wanted to make all the products preferred. Weldon Havins: That wasn't my questions, current ly are these on the list of excluded? Carl Jeffery : I don't know that excluded is the right word, they are not included in any category, so there is no PA restriction for preferred or non- preferred right now. Weldon Havins : So a psychiatrist writing for one of these currently does not have any restrictions? Carl Jeffery : Right, the only limitation is the DUR board added criteria for the Invega Trinza. It follows the approved labeling. Weldon Havins : Since we have had testimony for them to remain excluded, is there a compelling reason to move them to the preferred drug list? Carl Jeffery : It gives the Committee the ability down the road to evaluate new products and if there are some products that come on the market that are subpar or have some limitat ions in use then the Committee can drive utilization to other agents. As the Committee , your first priority is to make sure everything on the preferred side is clinically appropriate and is the best therapy. If there is a product released in the future that is substandard, the Committee can drive the utilization to the better agents. Weldon Havins: But we are not considering those drugs now, we are considering these currently available. Several clinical psychiatrists believe they should remain in the current status as they are now. Is there a compelling need to move them to the preferred drug? Carl Jeffery : It is in the interest of the state to have these on the PDL and down the road we can drive utilization. Weldon Havins: Couldn't we address that down the road. Carl Jeffery: Yes, for any changes we propose to the PDL needs to come to this Committee first. Mark Decerbo : For the exclusion criteria, is it the dosage form or the molecule? They don't appear like they meet the excluded list. Is this a u nique example or are there other examples around? Carl Jeffery : My understanding is it is by dosage form, so it would be the long- acting injectable agents. There are only three that were introduced after the date, the Invega Trinza, Aristada and Abilify Maintena. Mary Griffith: To clarify, there is not a list of drugs that are excluded. If there is a category that is not listed on the PDL, then they are not subject to the same criteria as a listed class. If we are adding the class to the PDL, there is going to be more scrutiny, and if listed as non- preferred it March 24, 2016 Page 9 9 will require a PA. So it isn't a list, it is just when something is added to the PDL. It is the Committee 's responsibility to decide what is preferred and non- preferred. Weldon Havins: I unde rstand, as I read the screen, I don't see where it lists the oral antipsychotic medications. I see \"antipsychotic medications\". Mary Griffith : We do have the drug class. Carl Jeffery : I don't have the orals listed . Weldon Havins : This is from the legislature, they did not distinguish between the injectables and oral agents. I move we keep them in the same class as they are now until there is a compelling reason to change their status. Mark Decerbo : Second. I work with USP along with CMS that works with the Part D formularies, there are six protected classes which antipsychotics are one. This is one category where I would endorse a protected status, while I do not have any issue with putting them all on the PDL, thinking for the future and different compositions of the Committee and what changes may come from that. That is my main hesitation. Mary Griffith : Did we do the therapeutic equivalency vote for this yet? Weldon Havins: No, but we don't have to go there if we are voting this way. We don't want them on the list at all. Beth Slamowitz: For clarification, is it still possible that if these are added as a class, that the DUR Board can make decisions for criteria to be placed on those products for safety reasons. The DUR Board can still add restrictions, so just by not adding this class, there could still be PA requirements from the DUR Board added. Weldon Havins: That is out of the scope of this Committee . Beth Slamowitz : Correct, I want to make sure that is understood by the public a s well. Voting: Ayes across the board, the motion carries. C. Oral Non -steroidal Anti- inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Shamim Nagy, Chair: Next is Oral Non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. Any public comment? Carl Jeffery : This is our last class. This is a new class of medications. This is the NSAIDS, these have been out for years. We are seeing manufacturers bringing new forms out after tweaking old formulation s a little. We would like to push utilization to the more well-known, established medicati ons in this class. Looking at the list, there really are not any new molecules. The literature available is old and there isn't really studies showing one is better than the other. March 24, 2016 Page 10 10 A few of the new agents compare to Celebrex and they are shown to be non -inferior. The advantage of the newer agents is it works just a little faster. The three new products are ground down to a very fine powder in theory absorbing a little faster. The other two I will point out is Duexis and Vimovo, they are combination products where the DUR Board has placed criteria on them. All the NSAIDS have a black -box warning. There is supposed to be a big study coming out later this year showing the results of cardiovascular effects. Optum recommends the products listed be consi dered clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Mark Decerbo: I move this list be accepted as clinically and therapeutically equivalent. Adam Zold: Second . Voting: Ayes across the board. Carl Jeffery: We came up with the preferred list by drawing a li ne between the brands and generics. We included the highly used medications. This gives the availability of the higher used products. Mark Decerbo: We didn't have this as a class before? Carl Jeffery : No, up until recently all the products were generic. Evelyn Chu: I make the motion we accept the list of preferred products as presented . Weldon Havins : Second . Voting: Ayes across the board, the motion carries. 5. Report by Optum Rx on New Drugs to Market, New Generic Drugs to Market, and New Line Extensi ons Carl Jeffery : Your binders have some new drug information. Hepatitis C agents are coming. Please let us know if there are other classes you think should be included in the future. Weldon Havins : Is there a list of HIV medications? Carl Jeffery: For prophylaxis? We are excluded from having HIV medications as a class on the PDL. 6. Closing Discussion Shamim Nagy, Chair: Any public comment? Date and location of the next meeting? Carl Jeffery : June 23 rd, does this location work? March 24, 2016 Page 11 11 Shamim Nagy, Ch air: Meeting adjourned. Meeting adjourned at 2:20 pm.

The long-ac ting opioids and their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications are outlined in Table 1.1-19 Previously, they were prescribed for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain; however, starting in March 2014, the FDA's required label changes were made for most of the agents, updating their indication.20 Currently, long- acting opioids are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which al ternative treatment opti ons are inadequate. This change was made for all long-acting opioids in an e ffort to help prescribers and patients make better decisions about who benefits from opioids and also to help prevent problems associated with their use. 20 In addition to indication changes, the long-acting opioid label must include statements that the long-acting opioid is not for \"as needed\" use, that it has an innate risk of addiction, abuse and misuse even at recommended doses, and finally it must include an update to the black box warning for increased risk of neonatal opioi d withdrawal sy ndrome (NOWS).20 Long-acting opioids are available in a variety of different dosage forms, and cu rrently several agents are available generically. Pain is one of the most common an d debilitating patient complaints , with persistent pain having the potentially to lead to functional impairment and disability, psychological distress, and sleep deprivation. Two broad categories of pain incl ude adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protec ting individuals from injury and/or promoting healing when injury has occurred. Maladaptive, or chronic pain, is pain as a disease and represents pathologic functioning of the nervous system. Various definitions of ch ronic pain currently exist and may be based on a specified duration of pain; however, in general, the condition can be defi ned as pain which lasts beyond the ordinary duration of time that an insult or injury to the body needs to heal. Pain can also be categorized as being either nociceptive or neu ropathic, and treatments for each are specific. Nociceptive pain is caused by damage to tissue and can further be divided into somatic (pain arising from injury to body tissues) and visc eral pain (pain arising from the internal organs). Visceral pain is often described as poorly localized, deep, dull, and cramping. In contrast, neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system. 21 Several mechanisms are thought to be involved in the promotion and/or facilitation of chronic pain, and include peripheral and centra l sensitization, ectopic excitability, structural reorganization/phenotypic switch of neurons, pr imary sensory degeneration, and disinhibition. Patients not responding to traditional pain treat ments may require individualized and supplemental conventional treatment approaches t hat target different mechanisms. 21 Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options are currently available for the management of chronic pain. Available treatment options make up six major categorie s: pharmacologic, physical medicine, behavioral medicine, neuromodulation, interventional, and surgic al approaches. As stated previously, some patients may require multiple treatment approaches in order to achieve adequate control of their chronic pain. Pharmacologic therapy should not be th e sole focus of pain treatment; however, it is the most widely utilized option to m anage chronic pain. Ma jor pharmacologic categories used in the management of pain include nonopioid tramadol, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists, and topical analgesics. Combining pharmacologic therapies may result in improved analgesia, and because lower doses of each agent can be used, patients may experience fewer treatment-emergent adverse events. Response to pharmacologi c therapies will vary between individual patients, and currently no one approach has been demonstrated to be appropriate for all patients. Treatment decisions are largely based on the type of pain (e.g., neuropathic, nociceptive), comorbidities, concurrent medi cations, pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic properties of the agent, and anticipated adverse events. 22 Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 2 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 For the treatment of neuropathic pain, generally accepted first line therapies include calcium channel utilized se cond line, and opioids should be considered as a second or third line option for most patients. Ideally, nociceptive pain is primarily managed with the use of non-opioid analgesics, with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs utilized first line in the management of mild to moderate pain. Opioids are associated with a risk of abuse and overdose, and the evidence for the effectiveness of long term opioid therapy in providing pain relief and improving functional outcomes is limited. Use of opioids in the management of chronic noncancer pain remains c ontroversial, and consideration for their use in this clinical setting should be weighed carefully. Opioids should be reserved for the treatment of pain of any severity not adequately controlled with non- opioid analgesics or antidepressants, more severe forms of acute pain, and cancer pain. If being consid ered for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, opioids should be further reserved for patients with m oderate to severe chronic pain that is adversely affecting patient function and/or quality of life.22 The long-acting opioid agents primarily produce in tense analgesia via their agonist actions at mu receptors, which are found in large numbers within the central nervous system. The binding of these agents to mu receptors produces a variety of other effects including bradycardia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Ke y safety concerns associated with the opioid analgesics include respiratory depression, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression. 22,23 All of the long-acting opioids are classified as Sc hedule II controlled substances by the FDA, with the exception of buprenorphine transdermal systems which are a Schedule III controlled substance. Buprenorphine is a partial opiate agonist, and the transdermal system is the first and only seven day transdermal opioid approved by the FDA. 1 On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for all long-acti ng opioids. The program requires companies who manufacture long-acting opioids to make training r egarding proper prescribing practices available for health care professionals who prescribe these agents, as well as distribute educational materials to both prescribers and patients on the safe use of th ese agents. The new REMS program is part of the national prescription drug abuse plan announced by the Obama Administration in 2011 to combat prescription drug misuse and abuse.24 According to the FDA abuse and misuse of prescr iption opioid products has created a serious and growing public health problem. The FDA consider s the development of abuse-deterrent products a priority. As outlined in their guidanc e for evaluation and labeling, \"abuse- deterrent properties\" are defined as those properties shown to meaningfully deter abuse , even if they do not fully prevent abuse. The FDA elected to use the term \"abuse-deterr ent\" rather than \"tamper-resistant\" because the latter term refers to, or is used in connection with, packaging requirements applicable to certain classes of drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Abuse-deterrent technologies should target known or expected routes of abuse relevant to the proposed product. The FDA has provided several categories for abuse-deterrent formulations. Categories include physical/chemical barriers, agonist/antagonist combinations, aversion ( adding a product that has an unpleasant effect if manipulated or is used at a higher than recommended do se), delivery systems, new molecular entities/prodrugs, a combination of these methods, or a novel approach (encompasses approaches or technologies not currently captured in previous categories).25 Buprenorphine buccal film is formulated using bioerodible mucoadhesive (BEMA \u00ae) technology. BEMA\u00ae is a film formulation that consists of a water-soluble polymer that adheres to the buccal mucosa. The film dissolves over approximately 30 minutes into the bu ccal mucosa, leaving behind no residual film. Delivery into the buccal mucosa enhances t he bioavailability of [ER]) tablets are resistant to crushing, breaking and dissolution using different solvents, and the tablets still retain some ER properties after tampering. Attempts to dissolve the tablets result in the form ation of a viscous gel, which may cause difficulty passing through a hypodermic needle.5 In addition, the tablets appear to be associated with less \"drug liking\" Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 3 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 based upon results reported from two unpublished clinic al abuse potential studies conducted in a small number of non-dependent recreational opioid users.26 There are currently two formulation of oxycodone ER which are considered abuse deterrent, OxyContin\u00ae and Xtampza ER\u00ae. OxyContin\u00ae utilizes the RESISTEC\u00ae technology that employs a combination of polymer and processing that gives tablet hardness, im parts viscosity when dissolved in aqueous solutions and resists increased drug release rate when mixed with alcoholic beverages.10 Results from trials support that, the reformulated oxycodone ER is abl e to resist crushing, breaking, extraction and dissolution in small volumes using a variety of tools and solvents.28-29 Xtampza ER\u00ae utilizes DETERx technology, which is designed to provide adequate pain control while maintaining its drug release profile after being subjected to common methods of manipulation, including chewing and crushing.30,31 Originally approved by the FDA in 2009, Embeda \u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) was voluntarily recalled from the mark et in March 2011 due to stabilit y issues with the manufacturing process.32 Subsequently, in November 2013, the FDA approved a manufacturing supplement for the product after the stability concer ns were addressed through the ma nufacturing proces s. The abuse deterrent formulation of Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydroc hloride) was granted FDA approval in October 2014, making it the third ER opioid anal gesic to obtain this designation and the morphine ER products.33 Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochl oride) consisting morphine sulfate with a sequestered co re of naltrexone hydrochloride at a ratio of 100:4.18 If morphine sulfate/ naltrexone hydrochloride is crus hed, chewed, or dissolved up to 100% of the sequestered naltrexone is released, reversing the effe cts of morphine, potentially precipitating withdrawal in opioid tolerant individuals, and incr easing the risk of overdose and death.33 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approv al of hydrocodone ER tablets (Hysingla ER \u00ae) was evaluated in an unpublished randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center, 12-week clinical trial in both opioid-experienced and opioid- na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. Patients received either hydrocodone ER 20 to 120 mg tablets or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. There was a statistically significant difference in the week ly average pain scores at week 12 between the hydrocodone ER and placebo groups with a least square mean (standard deviation [SD]) difference of -0.53 to -0.178; P=0.0016). There were also significant improvements in proportion of re sponders, and Patient's Global Impression of Change scores.5,36 The efficacy and safety of buprenorphine buccal film was evaluated in three phase III clinic al trials. However one of the clinical trials, which is cu rrently not published, did not show a significant difference between buprenorphine and placebo.1 The other two studies ev aluated patients who had a diagnosis of chronic low back pain in a randomized withdrawal design. The first study evaluated opioid-na\u00efve patients while the se cond study evaluated opioid-experi enced patients. The double-blind treatment phase for both studies was 12 weeks.1,38,39 In the first study, the increase in mean (standard deviation [SD]) pain intensity score s on the NRS from baseline to week 12 for buprenorphine buccal film (0.94 [1. 85]) was significantly lower than that of patients who received placebo (1.59 [2.04]; P=0.0012).38 The increase in mean (SD) pain intensity scores on the NRS from baseline to week 12 for buprenorphine buccal film was significantly less than that of placebo (0.88 [1.79] versus 1.92 [1.87], respectively; P<0.00001).39 The effectiveness of fentanyl in relieving pain appears to be similar to that of morphine sulfate sustained-release for the treatme nt of cancer and noncancer pain, and chronic lower back pain. Compared to morphine sulfate sustained-releas e, fentanyl transdermal systems appear to be associated with less constipation.49-51 A trial comparing hydrocodone ER capsules to plac ebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain demonstrated hydrocodone ER had a lower mean change from baseline in pain intensity scores compared to placebo at 12 weeks (P=0.008). In addition, t here was a significantly Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 7 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 higher amount of treatment responders in the hy drocodone ER group compared to the placebo group (P<0.001) at the end of treatment, and subject gl obal assessment of medication scores increased from baseline significantly in the hydroco done ER group compared to placebo (P<0.0001).52 In one trial, hydromorphone ER demonstrated greater efficacy in the treatment of lower back pain with regard to reducing pain intensity (P<0.001 ) and pain scores (P<0.01) compared to placebo.53 In a noninferiority analysis of a hydromorphone ER compared to oxycodone ER, two agents provided similar pain relief in the management of osteoarthritic pain.54 Methadone has demonstrated a greater efficacy over placebo for the treatment of nonmalignant neuropathic pain and similar efficacy compared to slow -release morphine sulfate for the treatment of cancer pain.58,59 A trial comparing different long-acting formulat ions of morphine sulfate for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain demon strated that both Avinza\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) and MS Contin\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) significantly reduced pain from baseline (P 0.05 for both). Both treatments also reduced overall arthritis pain intensity, and achieved comp arable improvements in physical functioning and stiffness. Each treatment signi ficantly improved certain sleep parameters compared to placebo.61 In a crossover trial, morphine sulfate (MS Contin\u00ae) was compared to fentanyl transdermal systems, and more patients preferred fentanyl transdermal syst ems (P<0.001), and reported on average, lower pain intensity scores than morphine sulfate phase (P<0.001).62 Clinical trial data evaluating the combination l ong acting opioid agent morphine/naltrexone is limited. As mentioned previously, this product was recalled by the manufacturer due to not meeting a pre- specified stability requirement durin g routine testing in March 2011.32 Morphine/naltrexone has demonstrated significantly better pain control compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis pain.65 Oxycodone ER (OxyContin\u00ae) has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of neuropathic pain and chronic refractory neck pain.66-68 For the treatment of cancer pain, no significant differences were observed between oxycodone ER and morphine sulfate ER in reducing pain intensity. The average number of rescue doses used within a 24 hour period was significantly less with morphine sulfate ER (P=0 .01), and the incidence of nausea and sedation were similar between treatments.69 The FDA-approval of oxycodone an enriched-enrollment, randomized-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel gr oup, study was conducted in patients with persistent, moderate- to-severe chronic lower back pain, with inadequate pain control from their prior therapy (n=740). Following t he titration phase, 389 subjects met the study randomization criteria of adequate analgesia and acceptable to lerability and enter ed the randomized, double-blind maintenance phase. Patients were rando mized at a ratio of 1:1 into a 12-week double- blind maintenance phase with their fixed stable dose of oxycodone ER (Xtampza ER\u00ae or matching placebo. There was a significant difference in pain reduction as assessed by average pain intensity favoring the oxycodone ER group when compared to placebo from randomization baseline to week 12 (0.29 vs. 1.85 ;P<0.0001). 71 Oxymorphone ER has produced similar mean daily pain intensity scores compared to both morphine sulfate and oxycodone ER for the tr eatment of chronic cancer pain. 72,73 The average scheduled daily dose of study drug and average total daily dose decreased after patients crossed over to oxymorphone ER from morphine sulfate or oxycodone ER. No significant changes were observed in visual analog pain scores, quality of life domains, or quality of sleep in any of the treatment groups.72 In another trial, oxymorphone ER demonstrated greate r efficacy for the relief of osteoarthritis pain compared to placebo.74 In a 12-week active comparator and placebo-controlle d trial, significant pain relief was achieved with tapentadol ER compared to placebo (least squares mean difference, - 0.7; 95% CI, -1.04 to -0.33) at week 12. The average pain intensity rating at endpoi nt with oxycodone ER was reduced significantly compared to placebo for the overall maintenance peri od (least squares mean difference vs placebo, - 0.3), but was not significantly lower at week 12 (l east squares mean, -0.3; P values not reported).76 In a, placebo-controlled and active comparator trial in adults with moderate to severe low back pain, improvements in average pain intensity scores occurred with tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER relative to placebo (P<0.001).77 Schwartz et al evaluated tapentadol ER among adults with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The least squares mean change in average pain intensity at week 12 Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 8 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 was 1.4 in the placebo group, indicating a worseni ng in pain intensity, and 0.0 in the tapentadol ER group, indicating no change in pain intensity, (leas t squares mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -1.70 to - 0.92; P<0.001).75 The combination product oxycodone/acetaminophen's efficacy was established in a clinical trial evaluating its effectiveness at treat ing pain over the 48 hours after su rgery. Singla et al concluded that pain, evaluated by the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) score, was significantly higher in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group (P<0.001) throu gh that time period. Mean total pain relief values for oxycodone/APAP XR and placebo from 0 to 48 hours were 91.3 a nd 70.9, respectively, resulting in a treatment difference of 20.5 (95% CI, 11.0 to 30.0; P<0.001). The median time to perceptible pain relief for oxycodone/APAP XR was 33.56 minutes vs 43.63 minutes for placebo (P=0.002). The median times to confirmed pai n relief and meaningful pain relief for the oxycodone/APAP XR group were 47.95 minutes and 92.25 minutes; however, neither of these metrics could be determined for the placebo group (P<0.001). The perc entage of patients reporting at least a 30% reduction in PI after 2 hours was 63.1% for oxyc odone/APAP XR versus 27.2% Methadone is the only long-acting narcotic that is Food and Dr ug Administration-approved for the management of opioid addiction; however, in one study slow-release morphine sulfate demonstrated noninferiority to methadone in terms of completion rate for the treatment of opioid addiction (51 vs 49%).84 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The current clinical guidelines regarding t he use of opioids recognize their established efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. None of the available agents are distinguished from the others in the class, and recommendations for treatment are made for the class as a whole.86-98 o Guidelines published by Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention's (CDC) opioid use in the management of chronic pain recommend physi cians start with immediate-release (IR) opioids and reserve ER formulations for seve re, continuous pain that IR opioids cannot treat.86 o Physicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose and carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering a dose of 50 morphine milligram equivale nts (MME) while avoiding increasing opioid doses to 90 MME unless justified.86 o Optimal analgesic selection w ill depend on the patient's pain inte nsity, any current analgesic therapy, and concomitant medical illness. ER pr oducts are generally similar and selection should be based on clinical or patient-specific factors.87 Other Key Facts:1-19 o Products currently available as a generic include fentanyl patches, hydromorphone ER tablets, methadone (all formulations), morphine ER (all formulations), oxycodone ER tablets and oxymorphone ER tablets. o There are currently several abuse deterrent ER opioids appro ved by the FDA. These ER\u00ae) and hydromorphone ER (Exalgo\u00ae) have also been formulated with abuse deterrent properties, howe ver they are classified as abuse deterrent by the FDA. o All long-acting opioids are pregnancy cat egory C, with the exception of oxycodone. o Only fentanyl transdermal system (age 2 to 17 years) and oxycodone ER tablets (age 11 and older) are approved for use in children o Tapentadol is contraindicated with monoami ne oxidase inhibitors; although, caution should be used when used in combinati on with any long-acting opioid. o Oxymorphone is severe hepatic disease. Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 9 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 o Methadone and buprenorphine have been implic ated in QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias, use caution in patients at increased risk of QT prolongation. o Frequency of dosing varies by agent: Buprenorphine patch: once every seven days and morphine/naltrexone (Embeda\u00ae): once or twice daily Morphine ER (MS Contin\u00ae) and all methadone formulations: twice or three times daily All remaining long-acting twice daily o Avinza\u00ae are the with a maximum daily dose. Avinza\u00ae (morphine): max dose of 1,600 mg/day due to the capsules being formulated with fumaric acid, which at that dose has not been shown to be safe and effective and may cause renal toxicity11 Xartemis XR (oxycodone/acetaminophen): ma x dose is limited to four tablets per day, and/or if taking other acetaminophen products, a maximum of 4,000 mg/day19 o Most solid, long-acting opioid formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules) should be swallowed whole and should not be broken, chewed, cut, crushed, or dissolved before swallowing.1-18 Morphine ER capsules (Avinza\u00ae, ER capsules (Xtampza ER\u00ae) can be opened and the pellets sprinkled on applesauce and then swallowed whole.11,12,15,18 Kadian\u00ae pellets can also be placed in water and used through a gastrostomy tube. Xtampza\u00ae may be opened and administered through a gastrostomy or nasogastric tube. Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, and Embeda\u00ae pellets should not be used thorough nasogastric tube.

It is the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved all-oral regimen for the HCV genotype 3 infection that does not require co-administration ribavirin.1 Technivie\u00ae (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ with ribavirin interferon- free Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dr ug for the treatment of HCV genotype 4 infection.7 HCV is an enveloped ribonucleic acid virus that is tr ansmitted through exposure with infected blood and is the most common bloodborne infection in the United States, with an estimated prevalence of 3.2 million people chronically infected. Chronic HCV develops in 70 to 85% of HCV-infected persons and is associated with significant morbidity (e.g., cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) and is the leading cause of liver transplantation. 10-12 The average annual incidence rate of HCC in the U.S. between 2001 and 2006 was 3.0 per 100,000 people, with 48% to cases attributed to HCV.11 These agents act via several different mechanisms of action to exert their therapeutic effect.1-9 Daclatasvir (Daklinza) binds to the N-terminus of NS5A, a nonstructural prot ein encoded by HCV, and inhibits both viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) replication and virion assembly.1 Similarly, sofosbuvir (Sovaldi\u00ae) inhibits HCV NS5B polymerase which also prevent s the replication of HCV host cells, however, it is active against multiple genotypes of HCV.3 The combination products that include direct acting hepatitis C in Viekira Pak\u00ae, is used as a boosting agent that increases the peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of paritaprevir along with overall drug exposure; it has no direct effect on the hepatitis C virus.4-8 Specific indications for each of the direct acting hepatitis C antiviral agents are listed in Table 1. Efficacy of these agents have been established in multiple clinical trials with nume rous clinical trials still underway. 13-47 Generally, therapy is determined by clin ical guidelines developed by the American Association for the St udy of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infe ctious Diseases Society of America and International Antiviral Society (IDSA) rather than the FDA-approved labels of these agents.48 The newer combination regimens that include direct hepatis C antivirals are preferr ed over older pegylated interferon-based regimens (including those containing older protease inhibitors) due to a higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rate, im proved side effects profile, and re duced pill burden. However, many different regimens with direct-acting agents or combi nations, which may or may not also include ribavirin or pegylated interferon, are recommended based on HCV genotype, previous treatment experience and certain special populations. Each of the direct HCV an tivirals is recommended as part of at least one first- line regimen. 48-50 Currently, there are no generic dire ct-acting antivirals available. Table 1.

The FDA approval of daclatasvir was based on t he results of ALLY-3, an ope n-label study evaluating 12 week regimen of daclatasvir 60 mg plus sofo sbuvir 400 mg in treatment-naive and treatment- experienced patients with chronic HCV genotype 3 infection. The pr imary endpoint was the SVR at post treatment week 12 (SVR12). High SVR12 rates were observed among patients without (73/75) and 94% (32/34) in treatment-na\u00efve respectively. In contrast, rates in patients much o An ongoing randomized phase III study is evaluat ing a combination of dac latasvir, sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 or 16 weeks to determine wh ether the addition of ribavirin or extending treatment duration improved SVR rates in ci rrhotic patients with HCV genotype 3 infection.34 The efficacy of simeprevir in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection was evaluated in several unpublished studies, including two phase III trials in treatment-na\u00ef ve patients (QUEST 1 and QUEST 2), one phase III trial in patients who relapsed after prior interferon- based therapy (PROMISE).2 o In the pooled analysis of QUEST 1 and QUEST 2, a greater proportion of patients in the simeprevir group achieved SVR at 12 weeks (SVR 12) compared to control group (80 vs 50%; P value not reported).2 The safety and efficacy of simeprevir in combinatio n with sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 was evaluated in the COSMOS trial. Cohort 1 included prior null responders with METAVIR scores F0 to F2 and Cohort 2 included prior null responders and treatment-na\u00efve patients with METAVIR scores F3 to F4.2,27 o SVR at 12 weeks post therapy (SVR12) was achieved in 92% of the patients in the the intention to treat (ITT) population. SSVR12 fo r Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were 90% (95% CI, 81 Therapeutic Class Overview: direct acting hepatitis C antivirals and combinations Page 3 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/12/2016 to 96) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98), respectively. The results were not significantly altered by use of ribavirin, duration of treatment, or treatment history (no P values reported). 20 The FDA approval of sofosbuvir was based on the result s of five phase III trials (N=1,724) in HCV mono-infected patients (g enotypes 1 to 6) and o ne unpublished phase III tria l (N=223) in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients (HCV genotype 1, 2 or 3).13,31,32 o All trials utilized SVR12 as the primary endpoi nt and overall, these studies showed that sofosbuvir provided a significant improvement in SVR12 compared with control in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced patients.13,31,32 o Sofosbuvir was not specifically studied in treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. According to the prescribing inform ation, the estimated response rate in patient who previously failed treatment with peginterfer on alfa and ribavirin is 71%. This is based on the observed response rate in patients from the NEUTRINO study.13 The FDA-approval of elbasvir/grazoprevir was based on two placebo-controlled trials and four uncontrolled phase II and III clinical trials in 1,401 patients with genotype HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 chronic HCV liver disease (C -EDGE TN, C-EDGE COINFECTION, C-SURFER, C- SCAPE, C-EDGE TE, and clinical trials evaluated SVR12 as the primary endpoint. Elbasvir/grazoprevir was administered once daily in all trials and ribavirin, if received, was dosed by weightd.4,14-20 o After 12 weeks to therapy, in 97.1% patients and 93.9% (231/ 246) of noncirrhotic patients.14 After weeks of cirrhotic patients. All 35 patients with ci rrhosis achieved SVR12.15 The SVR12 rate after 12 weeks of therapy in C-SURFER (chronic kidney disease) was 99.1%.16 The overall SVR12 rate in C-SALVAGE (genotype 1, previously failed 4 weeks of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin combined with 94.1% (32/34) in cirrhotic multicenter, op or wi thout ribavirin in different patient populations (20 arms total) with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. SVR12 rates ranged from 80% to 100%. 19,20 The FDA approval of combination ledipasvir/sofo sbuvir was based on the re sults of three phase III trials (N=1,518) in HCV mono-infected subjects wi th genotype 1 infection who had compensated liver disease. Treatment duration was fixed in each trial and was not guided by subjects' HCV RNA levels. 20,21,25 o ION-1 evaluated treatment-na\u00ef ve patients include patients wi th cirrhosis; ION-2 evaluated patients with or without cirrhosis who failed previous therapy with an interferon-based regimen including those containing an HCV prot ease inhibitor; ION-3 evaluated non-cirrhotic, treatment-na\u00efve studies showed that ledipasvir/sofosbuvir significantly improved SVR12 rate compared to control. 21,22,26 The FDA approval of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/rit onavir and dasabuvir was based on the results of six randomized, multicenter, clinical trials (N=2,308) in HCV patients with genotype 1, including one trial exclusively in patients with cirrhosis and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). All studies included at least one treatment arm with ribavirin, while several studies included treatment arms without ribavirin. 23-25,28,29 o Study populations for each of the studies include treatment-na\u00efve, non-cirrhotic adults alfa adults (TURQUOISE-II), noncirrhotic adults with HCV genotype 1 infection who either relapsed or were nonresponders to prior peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy lly, non-cirrhotic adults with HCV genotype 1b infection who either relapsed or were nonresponders to prior peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy (PEARL-II). 23-25,28,29 Therapeutic Class Overview: direct acting hepatitis C antivirals and combinations Page 4 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/12/2016 o Overall, SVR12 rates were high and significant ly improved compared with control after 12 weeks of therapy. 23-25,28,29 Only TURQUOISE-II evaluated patients beyond 12 weeks of therapy and found there was no difference betwe en 12 weeks of therapy compared with 24 weeks of therapy (P=0.09).25 The FDA-approval of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir in the treatment of HCV genotype 4 was based on the results of an open-label, r andomized, multicenter phase IIb PEARL-I study, which evaluated ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin and no ci rrhosis. Patients were either treatment-na\u00efve or treatment experienced (prior failure of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin). In treatment-naive patients, the SVR12s (42/42) ribavirin-containing regimen and 90.9% (40/44) in the ribavirin-fre e regimen. In the treatment-naive group without ribavirin, on- treatment virologic breakthrough was reported in one patient (2%), two patients (5%) experienced post-treatment relapse, and one patient (2%) was lost to follow-up. All 49 treatment-experienced patients in the ribavirin-containing group achieved SVR12.35 o AGATE-I is an ongoing phase III study evaluati ng ombitasvir/paritaprev ir/ritonavir with ribavirin for 12, 16 weeks in cirrhotic pat ients with HCV genotype 4 infection, including treatment-na\u00efve patients and those who have failed peginterferon alfa and ribavirin or sofosbuvir-containing regimens.36 o TURQUOISE-CPB is another ongoing phase III study evaluating ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribaviri n for 24 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 4 infection and decompensated cirrhosis.37 o Several other studies are planned or recruiting patients to evaluate ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or wit hout ribavirin in less well studied subpopulations with HCV genotype 4 infection, including seve re renal disease, children (three to 17 years old), and status post successful treatment of early st age hepatocellular carcinoma.38-41 The FDA-approval of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was based on the results of four phase III studies (ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2, ASTRAL-3, and ASTRAL-4) in patients with HCV genotype 1 through 6. o (N=706) was evaluating sofosbuvir/velpatasv ir 400 mg/100 mg once daily for 12 weeks in adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection. Overall, SVR12 rate in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group of 99% (618/624) was higher than the prespecified benchmark rate 42 o ASTRAL-2 open-label studies comparing sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400 mg/100 mg once daily for 12 weeks to sofosbuvir 400 mg plus weight-based riba virin for 12 weeks (ASTRAL-2) or 24 weeks (ASTRAL-3) in adult patients with chroni c HCV genotype 2 and HCV genotype 3 infections, respectively. Among patients with HCV genotype 2, the overall SVR12 rate in the 12-week group was 99% (133/134) as compared to 94% in the sofosbuvir/ribavirin (P=0.02). Among pat ients with HCV genotype 3, the rate in the 12-week group was 95% group (P<0.001).43 a r andomized, open-label study evaluating sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400 mg/100 mg once daily for 12 weeks (with or without ribavirin) or 24 weeks in adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, or 6 infection and decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B). and 86% sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 24 weeks, respectively.44 o Other trials are ongoing and full results have not been published. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir has been evaluated in treating HCV/HIV coinfecti on in patients with genotypes 1 through 4 (ASTRAL-5), in patients with genotypes 1 thr ough 3 and previous sofosbuvir/velpatasvir failures and in patients undergoing liver transplant.45-47 Key Points within the Medication Class American Association for the Study of Liver Dise ases, Infectious Diseases Society of America and International Antiviral Society-USA have incl uded all current treatments in their guideline.48 Therapeutic Class Overview: direct acting hepatitis C antivirals and combinations Page 5 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/12/2016 Old standards of therapy, including pegylated in terferon alfa and ribavirin dual therapy and pegylated interferon alfa, ribavirin along with a protease i nhibitor triple therapy are no longer recommended. Current, first-line therapies recommended in the new guidelines include all-oral combination therapies, each of which generally has at least one polymerase inhibitor and one other direct-acting agent that acts via a different mechanism of action. Each of the new HCV direct acting antivirals are recommended as part of a first-line regimen for at least one genotype and/or patient population.48 Depending on genotype, previous treatment-exp erience and special populations, the recommended regimens and durations of treatment vary due to diffe rences in efficacy provid ed by clinical trials. o For genotype 1, five regimens with simila r efficacy are recommended. Duration and addition of ribavirin depend on cirrhosis status and/or previous treatment failures.

They recommend treatment for at least 24 weeks with ribavirin, if not contraindicated.48 Other Key Facts: o There are also disparities between the FDA-approved indications and first-line recommendations according to the AASLD-IDSA guidelines.1-8,48 o Prior to initiating therapy with simeprevir (in co mbination with sofosbuvi r) in cirrhotic patients with genotype 1a, they should be screened for the presence of NS3 Q80K polymorphism. Alternative therapy should be considered if this is present.2 o When prescribing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir or ombitasvir/paritaprevir/riton avir/dasabuvir, screening for drugs that should not be coadministered is recommended due to many, often severe, drug interactions.5,6 o Dose of daclatasvir must be adjusted when giv en with strong CYP3A inhibitors (30 mg QD) and moderate CYP3A inducers (90 mg QD).1 o Testing for NS5A-associated resistance is re commended prior to treatment with sofosbuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, ledipasv ir/sofosbuvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for several [package insert].

Patients with PRMS also have a continuous decline in function while experiencing occasional attacks. Finally, SPMS begins as RRMS, but as time progresses the attack rate declines and patients experience a gradual deterioration.19 Table 1.

Glatopa \u00ae is considered a biosimilar to reference product Copaxone\u00ae Evidence-based Medicine The safety and efficacy of glat iramer acetate and interferon (IFN ) products are well established. Recent clinical trials have not produced clinically different results compar ed to trials published previously. The FDA-approval of daclizumab was based on the results of two randomized double-blind studies in adults with a diagnosis of relapsing MS (RMS). Both utilized the primary endpoint of annualized relapse rate (ARR). The first study evaluat ed 1,841 patients over 96 to 144 weeks who were randomized to either daclizumab 150 mg every four weeks or to IFN -1a 30 g weekly. Both groups received a placebo matching the other treatment arm. The ARR was significantly reduced in the daclizumab arm (0.216) compared with the IFN -1a group (0.393) representing a relative reduction of 45% (P<0.0001). 2,33 The second study, SELECT, evaluated a total of 621 patients over 52 weeks who were randomized to daclizumab 150 mg every four weeks, daclizumab 300 mg every four weeks or placebo. The ARR was significantly lower in both the daclizumab 150 mg group (0.21) and the daclizumab 300 mg group (0.23) compared to the placebo group (0.46; P<0.001 for both).2,34 In two large, randomized trials with dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily or three times daily compared to placebo, there were st atistically significant reductions in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) with both dimethyl fumarate regimens compared to placebo (P 0.001 for both).37,61 Fox et al also included an open-label glatiramer acetate comp arator group. In a post-hoc analysis, there were significant improvements favoring dimethyl fumarate over glatiramer acetate with regard to ARR (three times daily group only), new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions and new T1 hypointense lesions (three daily group only).61 In the 24-month, placebo-controlled FREEDOMS tria l, treatment with fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25 mg once daily significantly reduced ARR co mpared to placebo (54 and 60%, respectively; P<0.001 for both).38 The FREEDOMS II trial had similar results, with fingolimod providing a lower ARR over 24 months compared to placebo.87 In the 12-month TRANSFORMS trial, fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25 mg once-daily si gnificantly reduced ARR by 52 and 40%, respectively, to -1a 30 12-month TRANSFORMS , patients initially randomized to IM IFN -1a were switched to either dose of fingolimod for 12 additional months and experienced significant reductions in ARR compared to initial treatment with IM IFN -1a. 44 Therapeutic Class Overview: multiple sclerosis agents Page 3 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/3/2016 In the TEMSO trial, treatment with teriflunomide 7 or 14 mg was associated with significantly greater relative reductions in ARR compared to placebo (31.2 and 31.5%. respectively; P<0.001).56 In an unpublished extension study, ARR remained low afte r five years and the adverse event rates were similar to those reported in previous trials.57,58 The TOWER study showed that over one y ear teriflunomide had a lower ARR than placebo.88 The ComiRX trial, evaluat ed the combination of IFN and glatiramer acetate versus IFN -1a alone versus glatiramer acetate alone. A fter three years, the A RR of the combination was not statistically significantly improved to the better of the tw o single-agent arms when adjusting for baseline age. Glatiramer acetate provided statis tically significant greater reductio n in risk of exacerbation compared to interferon by 31%, and the combination group prov ided statistically significant greater reduction in risk of exacerbation compared to interfer on by 25% (P=0.027, P=0.022 respectively).89 Two phase III clinical trials evaluated treatment outcomes with IFN -1a 44 g SC three times weekly and alemtuzumab 12 mg. One trial evaluated a st udy population of treatment-experienced MS patients and the second study eval uated treatment outcomes in tr eatment-naive patients. In both trials, treatment with alemtuzumab resulted in a st atistically significant r eduction in the annualized relapse rate compared to treatment with IFN -1a. Time to onset of six- month disabilit y progression was only significantly delayed in treatment-experience patients.103,104 The safety and efficacy of peginterferon -1a, was established in a single, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Annualized relapse rate was 0.26 in the peginterferon -1a group compared to 0.40 with placebo (P=0.007). This ented a 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P=0.0003). The proportion of patients with a relapse was also significantly lower with the peginterferon -1a group compared to placebo (0.19 vs 0.29; P=0.003). 105 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The approach to treating MS includes: the management of symptoms, treatment of acute relapses, and utilization of dise ase-modifying therapies to redu ce the frequency and severity of relapses, and delay diseas e and disability progression.14,16,19,22 o IFN products or glatiramer acetate are recomme nded as first-line therapy in patients with RRMS.18,19 o The Association of British Neurologists also recommend either of the oral agents as potential first-line options.18 o Due to its adverse effect profile, fingolim od is sometimes recommended as a second-line option.19,20 NICE recommends use of fingolimod only if patients have an unchanged or increased relapse rate, or ongoing severe relaps es compared to the previous year despite treatment with IFN .20 o Consensus guidelines do not recommend a ch ange of therapy in patients positive for neutralizing antibodies who are responding to IF N therapy, noting that neutralizing antibodies disappear with continued treatment in the majority of patients.18,23-25 o A change of therapy may be considered in patients experiencing a suboptimal response or intolerable adverse effects.26,28,29 o Data suggests a significant reduction in re lapse rate and a delay in disease and disability progression in patients switching from IFN to glatiramer acetate therapy or vice versa due to poor response.26,28,29 Other Key Facts: o A biosimilar version of Copaxone\u00ae (glatiramer acetate 20 mg/mL) was recently approved by the FDA and is marked under the trade name Glatopa\u00ae. There are no other generic MS products available, including other strengths of glatiramer acetate.1-14 o The safety and efficacy of retreatment with alemtuzumab after the initial standard treatment cycles remains uncertain. There is no inform ation regarding retreatment in alemtuzumab's FDA-approved label.1 o comparing IFN -1b products (Betaseron\u00ae and Extavia\u00ae) and the drugs are not interchangeable despite Extavia\u00ae being approved with the same active ingredient and registration trials as Betaseron\u00ae.5,6 Therapeutic Class Overview: multiple sclerosis agents Page 4 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/3/2016 o Alemtuzumab must be administered by a healthcare professional. o Alemtuzumab and daclizumab are available only through restricted access programs. Both are associated with causing serious autoimmune disorders. In addition, alemtuzumab has been associated with life threatening infusion reactions as well as increased risk of malignancy. 1,2 References 1. Lemtrada\u00ae [package the Internet].

The skin and mucous membrane scabici des and pediculicides are approved to treat pediculosis and scabies.1-10 Pediculosis is a transmissible infection, which is caused by three different kinds of lice depending on the location: asymptomatic; occur due to hypersensitivity to lice saliva.11 Scabies is also a transmissible skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Mites burrow into the skin and lay eggs, which when hatched, will crawl to the skin's surface and begin to make new burrows . The most common clinical manifestation of scabies is itching, which is due to a hypersensit ivity reaction to the mite or mite excrement.12 When treating scabies and lice, the goal of therapy is to eradicate the parasite. Benzyl alcohol inhibits lice from closing their respiratory spiracle s, which causes the lice to asphyxiate.3 Crotamiton has scabicidal and antipruritic actions; however, the exact mechanism of action is unknown.4 Lindane is a central nervous system stimulant, which causes convulsions and death of the arthropod.1,2 Malathion is an organophosphate agent, which inhibits cholinesterase activity.5 Permethrin disrupts the sodium channel current, which leads to delayed repolarization and paralysis of the arthropod.1,2 Spinosad causes neuronal excitation, which leads to paralysis and death.6 The suspension also contains an unspecified amount of benzyl alcohol. Retreatment with benzyl alcohol and permethrin is required after seven to 10 days to eradicate the infestati on. The newest agent in the class ivermectin, is pediculicidal but not ovicidal and it is approved as a single application product Lindane, malathion, permethrin, spinosad, and while permethrin, and pipe ronyl butoxide and pyrethrins products are also available over- the-counter.

Evidence-based Medicine In two, randomized, active-control led trials in patients with an acti ve head lice infestation, a greater proportion of patients were lice-free 14 days fo llowing treatment with spinosad alone compared to patients who received permethrin plus nit combing (P<0.001 for both trials). 13 The combined results of two identical, vehicle- controlled trials (N=765) in patients six months and older with head lice showed that significantly more patients treated with ivermectin lotion were lice- free on day two (94.9 vs 31.3%), day eight (85.2 vs 20.8%) and remained lice-free through day 15 (73.8 vs 17.6%; P<0.001 for each day) compared to the vehicle group.14 In two studies comparing benzyl alcohol to its v ehicle, the absolute differe nce in treatment success rate in study one was 71.4% in favor of benzyl 31.1 to 62.0) in study two, agai n in favor of benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol was associated with a lower risk of treatment failure in both studies (P<0.001 for both).15 For the treatment of lice, permethrin has demonst rated a higher rate of treatment success compared to lindane, following a single application.16-19 Compared to the combination of pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide, permethrin was more efficaci ous several days following treatment; however, one study found the agents to be equally effective at 14 days following treatment (P>0.01).20,21 In multiple studies, malathion has been reported to be pediculicidal and ovicidal when compared to permethrin. 22,23 In studies comparing various topical agents for the treatment of scabies, a higher cure rate has been demonstrated with permethrin compared to crotamiton and lindane.24-29 In the largest study completed (N=467), Schultz et al reported that there was a trend towards a higher cure rate with permethrin treatment compared to lindane; however, the difference was not statistically significant.25 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Permethrin and pyrethrin products are recommended for treatment of scabies and lice, despite increasing resistance in the United States. These agents are available over-the- counter without a prescription.29,30 o Malathion 0.5% can be used in people who are 24 months of age when resistance to permethrin or pyrethrins is documented or wh en treatment with these products fails despite their correct use. Due to the high alcohol concent ration of the product it is highly flammable. 29,30 o Permethrin is the most studied pediculicide and is the least toxic to humans. Permethrin is less allergenic than pyrethrins and does not cause allergic reactions in individuals with plant allergies.30 o Lindane has low ovicidal activity (30 to 50% of eggs are not killed), and resistance has been reported worldwide for many years. For these reas ons, it should be used cautiously. The Food Therapeutic Class Overview: scabicides and pediculicides Page 3 of 4 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/18/2016 and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that in correct use of lindane can be neurotoxic and its use should be restricted to patients for w hom prior treatments have failed or in those patients who cannot tolerate safer medications. 29,30 o Lindane should not be used to treat pr emature infants, persons with the human immunodeficiency virus, seizure disorders, women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, persons who have very irritated skin or so res where the li ndane will be applied, infants, children, the elderly, and persons who weigh <110 pounds. 29,30 o Permethrin is the drug of choice for the treat ment of scabies. Two (or more) applications may be necessary to eliminate all mites, particularly when treating crusted (Norwegian) scabies. o Crotamiton is approved for the treatment of scabi es in adults but is frequently associated with treatment failure.31 o Lindane is not recommended as a first-line ther apy for the treatment of scabies due to its potential for toxicity with frequent or incorrec t use. Lindane should be restricted to patients who have failed recommended therapies or who cannot tolerate recommended treatments.31 Other Key Facts: o Several first-line therapies are available generi cally in at least one strength or formulation.1 o According to the manufacturer, spinosad is the first FDA-approved head lice treatment that does not require nit combing following treatment.33 o Ivermectin is approved for use as a singl e application only and is not indicated for retreatment.7 o Reasons for treatment failure with the topical scabicide and pediculicide products include misdiagnosis, noncompliance, failure to follow instructions correctly, not enough pediculicide applied, reinfestation, and resistance. If resistan ce is suspected, retreatment should be with a different chemical entity than initially used.34 References 1. Facts and Comparisons\u00ae eAnswers [database on the Internet].

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/27/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Phosphorus Depleters Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: Hyperphosphatemia, an important and inev itable clinical consequence of advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), requires appropriate management due to the risk for secondary hyperparathyroidism and cardio vascular disease. Persistent or chronic hyperphosphatemia, along with an elevated calcium times phosphorus (CaxP) product, is associated with an increased risk of vascular, valvular and other soft-tissue calcification in patients with CKD. The two principal modalities used to control serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD include restricting dietary phosphorus intake and the admin istration of phosphorus depleters). phorus levels, the administration of phosphorus binders is re commended. There are several different phosphorus binders that are currently ava ilable; however, the class can be divided into two subcategories: calcium- and non-calcium-containing PhosLo\u00ae, with higher serum calcium and lower serum parathyroid hormone levels compared to the non-calcium-containing products.5-7 Increased serum calcium levels leads to hypercalcemia and also increases the risk of vascular calcification and arterial disease in CKD patients.4 As a result, these products are typically avoided in CKD patients with hypercalcemia or severe vascular calcification.2-4 The available non-calcium-containing phosphorus binders include sevelamer, available in two salt forms and products typically reserved for use in CKD patients with hypercalcemia, or as adjunct to a regimen supplying the maximum a llotted dose of elemental calcium from calcium- containing phosphorus binders.1-4 The sevelamer hydrochloride salt was the initial sevelamer formulation developed; however, because of the inci dence of metabolic acidosis associated with its use, a new, buffered formulation was created. The newer, sevelame r carbonate formul ation will most likely be thought of as the preferred formulation of sevelamer because it does not lower a patient's bicarbonate level and does not result in the devel opment of metabolic acidosis. An advantage to the use of lanthanum carbonate is a decrease in the pill burden compared to other products.4 Table 1.

Tablet, chewable: 500 mg - *Generic available in at leas t one dosage form or strength. The safety and efficacy of sevelamer hydrochloride in chr onic kidney disease patients who are not on dialysis have not been studied. Evidence-based Medicine The available evidence supports the hypothesis that a ll of the phosphorus binders (or phosphorus depleters) are efficacious in cont rolling serum phosphorus levels. 13-54 In general, the true benefits of phosphorus lowering with respect to hard clinical outcomes have not been established, and most clinical trials evaluate surrogate endpoints. In addi tion, due to ethical concerns regarding a prolonged lack of appropriate treatment, most trials evaluat ing the newer phosphorus binders against placebo have been short term, with longer trials using calcium-containing binders as the comparator.1 No prospective trials have spec ifically examined the benefits of ta rgeting different phosphorus levels to determine the effect on patient-level endpoint s. Epidemiological data suggests that phosphorus levels above the normal range are associat ed with increased morbidity and mortality.1 The results of a recent Cochrane Systematic Review by Navaneethan and colleagues demonstrated that there was no statisti cally significant reduction in all-cause mortality when patients received sevelamer hydrochloride compared to those receivin g calcium-based phosphate binders (relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.16). No comparison of lanthanum carbonate to calcium- containing salts was made.47 Two meta-analyses have been published reviewing the clinical trials of the phosphate binders.48,49 Tonelli et al compared sevelamer pr oducts to any other therapy or placebo in patients with ESRD, on dialysis or who had had a kidney transplant. The pooled analysis showed that phosphate levels with sevelamer was similar or slightly higher than wi th calcium-based phosphate binders by 0.12 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.19). However, the overall weighted mean difference in serum calcium was significantly lower with sevelamer therapy (0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.07).48 Jamal et al evaluated all-cause mortality and compared calcium-based phosphate binders to non-calcium phosphate binders in patients with chronic kidney di sease. The results of th is meta-analysis showed that patients randomly assigned to non-calcium-based phosphate binders had a statistically significant 22% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with those randomly assigned to calcium- based phosphate binders (RR,0.78; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.98). When non-randomized trials were added to the pooled analysis, the reduction in all-cause mort ality was 13% (RR,0.87; 0.77 to 0.97) in favor of non-calcium-based ph osphate binders.49 The safety and efficacy of ferric citrate was established in two clinical trials.50,51 o The demonstrated reductions from baseline to week four in mean serum phosphorus were significantly greater with 6 and 8 grams/day t han with 1 gram/day enter a four-week, placebo-controlled withdr awal phase if they had been receiving ferric citrate during the 52-week study. During the place bo-controlled period, Therapeutic Class Overview: phosphorus depleters Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/27/2016 the serum phosphorus concentration rose by 2.2 mg/dL in patients receiving placebo compared to patients who remained on ferric ci trate (-0.24 mg/dL vs 1.79 mg/dL; and of sucroferric oxyhydroxide was demonstra ted in two randomized clinical trials, one six-week, open label, active controlle d dose-finding study and one 55-week, active controlled, parallel group, dose-titration and extension study.12,52-54 o In the phase II, dose-finding study, at six we eks, sucroferric oxyhydroxide decreased serum phosphorus compared to baseline in the 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 12.5 grams/ day arms but not the 1.25 grams/day arm (P 0.016). A similar decrease to sevelamer hydrochloride was seen in the 5.0 and 7.5 grams/day arms.1,52 o In the after the dose-titration study, seru m phosphorus control was maintained with both sucroferric oxyhydroxide and sevelamer thr oughout the extension st udy and the difference between groups was not statisti cally significant (P=0.14).53,54 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Currently available evidence supports the hy pothesis that all of t he phosphorus binders are efficacious in controlling serum phosphorus levels. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that no one product is effective and ac ceptable to every patient.2,3 o Although treatment guidelines recommend serum phosphorus levels to be maintained within or slightly above the normal range ( depending on chronic kidney disease [CKD] Stage), there is currently no evidence to demonstrate that lowering phosphorus to a specific target range results in improved clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. o It is still reasonable to use phosphorus binders to lower phosphorus levels in CKD patients with hyperphosphatemia to prevent the developm ent of secondary hyperparathyroidism and cardiovascular disease.1 o Combination therapy, with multiple binders, may also be an option in order to control serum phosphorus levels while minimizing the side effects associated with any specific binder.2,3 o Phosphorus binders should be utilized in patients with CKD Stages 3 to 5D who cannot adequately maintain serum phosphorus levels within the normal range with dietary phosphorus restriction.1-3 o Choice of product should take into account the Stage of CKD, the presence of other components of CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder, concomit ant therapies and adverse event profiles.1 Other Key Facts: o Currently, the calcium-co ntaining products (Eliphos\u00ae, PhosLo\u00ae) are available generically in tablet and capsule formulations. o Calcium acetate (Phoslyra\u00ae) is available as an oral solution, and sevelamer carbonate (Renvela\u00ae) is available as oral powder for suspension.7,10 o Lanthanum, and sevelamer carbonate/hydrochloride are contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction, while calcium acetate is contraindicated in hypercalcemia9-11 o Ferric citrate is contraindicated in iron Improving Global Outc omes (KDIGO) CKD-MBD Work Group.

[Epub ahead of print] Page 1 of 6 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/4/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Neurokinin-1 (NK1) Receptor Antagonists and Combinations Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: This review will focus on miscellaneous antiemetics, which includes doxylam ine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis\u00ae) as well as the neurokin-1 (NK 1) receptor antagonists/combinations. NK 1 antagonists are all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the prev ention of chemotherapy- induced is antagonist combination product currently av ailable, netupitant/ addition CINV, aprepitant is FDA-approved for the prevention of post- operative nausea and vomiting in adults.1-4 Differences in anti-emetic effect for the acute and delayed phases of CINV exist between NK 1 antagonists and are summarized in Table 2. Doxylamine/pyridoxine is FDA-approved for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.5 As the pathophysiology of CINV is not complete ly understood, the exact mechanisms by which NK 1 antagonists exert there antiemetic effects are not known. NK 1 is a broadly distributed receptor located in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. One proposed mechanism of NK 1 antagonists is by depressing the substance P mediated response in th e central nevous system by blocking activation of NK 1 in areas of the brain responsible for chemoreception. Decreased activation of NK 1 by substance P reduces the emetic reflex. A second proposed mechanism is the blockade of peripheral NK 1 receptors located on the vagal terminals of the gut. It is hypothesized that peripheral blockade may decrease the intensity of the signal transmitted to the central nervous system, thus decrea sing the overall emetic reflex. 1-4,6,7 Doxylamine competes with histamine for H1-r eceptor sites and blocks the chemoreceptor trigger zone thereby decreasing nausea and vomiting. Antihistamine agents also work indirectly on the vestibular system by decreasing stimulation of the vomiting center. Hypotheses to explain the antiemetic effects of pyridoxine include preventio n/treatment of vitamin B6 deficienc y, intrinsic antinausea properties, synergy with the antinaus ea properties of antihistamine. 5,8,9 Table 1.

Results of these trials are similar to those used by the FDA for approval.19-36 There are currently no clinic al trials that compare NK 1 antagonists to one-another. The approval of rolapitant (Varubi\u00ae) was based on the efficacy and safety in preventing CINV in patients receiving anthracycline combination therapy, MEC, or HEC with a cisplatin-based regimen in three clinical trials. The primary endpoint in both HEC studies was complete response (CR) in the delayed phase (defined as 25 to 120 hours post administration of chemotherapy ) of CINV. Results of the showed a greater proportion of individuals treat ed with the rolapitant arm had a statistically significant CR compared with the placebo contro l group in HEC-1: (192 [73%] compared to 153 statis compared to placebo control group [62%]; P=0.0426).39,40 In the third trial, the antiemetic effect of rolapitant was evaluated in MEC. The primary endpoint of CR in the delayed phase of CINV showed a greater proportion of individuals treated with the rolapi tant arm had a statistically significant CR compared with the placebo control group: (475 [71%] compared to 410 [62%]; P=0.0002).39,41 The approval of netupit ant/palonosetron (Akynzeo\u00ae) was based on the efficacy and safety in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC. Both trials were double-blind, randomized, double-dummy, multicenter, parallel-gr oup studies of netupitant/palonosetron given as a single oral dose 60 minutes before administration of chemothera py in combination with dexamethasone. CR in the delayed phase was statica lly significant in HEC and MEC for patients who received netupitant/palonosetron (P=0.0 32 single double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo -controlled study that evaluated 298 pregnant adult women with nausea and vomiting in the gestational age range of 7 to 14 weeks. Patients were randomized to 14 days of placebo or doxylamine/pyri doxine (two to four t ablets daily). Mean change from baseline was -4.8 points in the symptom domai n (Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis) score at day 15 in the doxylami ne/pyridoxine group compared to -3.9 points in the placebo group (P=0.006). For the Quality of Life domain, mean chan ge from baseline was 2.8 points at day 15 in the Therapeutic Class Overview: miscellaneous antiemetics Page 3 of 6 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/4/2016 doxylamine/pyridoxine group compared to -1.8 points in the placebo group (P=0.005).50 A second study compared a five-day course of low-dose on dansetron to low-dose doxylamine/pyridoxine. The study concluded that ondansetron provided a statistically significa nt reduction in the nausea and vomiting (P=0.019 and P=0.049, respectively).51 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o It is recommended that antiemetic therapy be initiated before the administration of chemotherapy and then continued throughout t he period when delayed emesis may occur. Choice of antiemetic regimen depends primarily on the emetogenic potential and the risk of delayed CINV associated with t he chemotherapy agents. The peri od of risk for CINV may be up to three days after administration of hi ghly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and at least two days after moderately em etogenic chemotherapy (MEC).10 o For the prevention of CINV post- HEC, triple therapy with a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a NK 1 receptor antagonist is recommended.10-11 o The updated 2015 National Comprehensive Ca ncer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not currently recommend one specific regimen over another.10 o For the prevention of CINV post-MEC, a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is recommended, with a NK 1 receptor antagonist being optional.10-12 o Guidelines generally recommend palonosetron as the preferred 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist for the prevention CINV associated with MEC. Adjunctive therapies include with lorazepam, an H2 receptor antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor.10-12 o The Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario in 2012 recommend aprepitant in combination with granisetron and dexamethasone in children 12 years of age or older who will be receiving HEC and in which the antineoplastics are not known to or suspected of interacting with aprepitant. Dual therapy with ondansetr on or granisetron and dexamethasone is recommended if the antineoplastic ag ents interact with aprepitant. 13 o Several guidelines have not yet been updated to include netupitant/palonosetron and/or rolapitant.11-13 o According to the Obstetrici an-Gynecologists Clinical Management Guideline for Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy, more severe cases should be treated with pyridoxine monotherapy first-line. If monotherapy is inadequate, guidelin es recommend pyridoxine in combination with doxylamine. If combination therapy failed, promethazine or dimenhydrinate can be substituted for doxylamine. Other third-line options include metoclopramide, ondansetron, trimethobenzamide or methylprednisolone. Facts: o Doxylamine/pyridoxine is the only FDA-approved agent for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. o All NK 1 antagonists are formulated as either an oral capsule or tablet, with the exception of fosaprepitant, which is an intravenous injection. Aprepitant is also formulated as an oral suspension.1-4 o For HEC, fosaprepitant, rolapitant, and netupitant/palonosetron are given only on day one as a single dose, while aprepitant is given for three days.1-4 o Doxylamine/pyridoxine is initially given onc e daily at bedtime (two tablets) but may be increased to twice daily (one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime). The maximum dose is two tablets in the morning and two tablets at bedtime (four tablets/day).5 o All NK 1 antagonists are associated with drug intera ctions to some extent. Of particular concern are drug interactions with agents t hat are either substrates of CYP3A4 or inhibit/induce CYP3A4. Dose adjustments and contraindications may apply based on the concurrent agent.1-4 o Aprepitant oral suspension and capsules are the only NK 1 antagonist currently approved by the FDA for use in pediatric patients.1-4 Therapeutic Class Overview: miscellaneous antiemetics Page 4 of 6 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/4/2016 o Both the FDA-approved label and clinical guidelines do not recommend aprepitant for patients less than 12 years of age, however, t he oral suspension has been shown to be safe and effective in patients 6 months of age and older.1,13 o Due to its co-formulation, netupitant/palo nosetron carries the associated warnings of palonosetron, including serotonin of JA, Refuerzo JS, Ramin SM.

Page 1 of 7 Copyright 2016 Completed on 06/20/2016 Therapeutic Class Review Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: A significant advancement in the manag ement of type 2 diabetes has been the development of incretin-based therapies. This novel therapeutic approach is important as type 2 diabetics have been shown to have an impaired incretin response.1 Currently, there are two classes of incretin-based therapies available: the dipeptidyl pepetidase-4 (DPP-4) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved as adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. Single-entity and combination agents containing alogliptin are available for use either as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents. The fixed-dose combination products are ava ilable for use when treatment with both drug components is appropriate. 2-12 The DPP-4 inhibitors reversibly block the DPP- 4 enzyme, which is responsible for the rapid degradation of endogenous incretin hormones. These hormones are produced by the gastrointestinal tract in response to meals and are involved in the regulation of insulin. The antidiabetic actions of endogenous incretin hormones include the enhance ment of meal-stimulated insulin secretion, decreased glucagon secretion, improvements in cell function, and slowing of gastric emptying. Through their effect on these hormones, the DPP-4 inhibitors primarily target post-prandial glucose and have also been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose.13,14 In general, the DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with a favorable side effect profile and also have a weight neutral effect compared to other antidiabetic agents commonly used in t he management of type 2 diabetes. Compared to sulfonylureas, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with the DPP-4 inhibitors is low due to the glucose-dependent nature of incretin hormone activi ty. In addition, the DPP-4 inhibitors have not been associated with the same increased risk of cardiovascular disease t hat has been observed with the use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs). The D PP-4 inhibitors improve the function of cells and although TZDs and metformin treat insulin resistan ce, these agents do not address the progressive decline in cell function that is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes.13-15 The DPP-4 inhibitors are available as fixed-dose combination products with metformin. Metformin, a biguanide, improves glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetics by lowering bot h basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Specifically, the actions of metform in result in decreased hepatic glucose production, decreased intestinal absorption of glucose, and im provement in insulin sensitivity via increased peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. 6-10 Additionally, alogliptin is available in a fixed-dose combination with pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is a receptor-gamma (PPAR ).11 PPAR receptors are found in adipose, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue and activation of these receptors modulates transcri ption of insulin response genes that control glucose and lipid metabolism, provid ing an overall effect of increasi ng insulin sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.2,11 Linagliptin is available as improves glycemic control by producing glucosuria. This is accomplished by inhibiting SGLT2 and increasing urinary glucose excretion.12 The net effect is an increase excretion of glucose from the body and normalizat ion of plasma glucose levels.12 Overall, the DPP-4 inhibitors are significantly more effective compared to pl acebo in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), fasting plasma glucose, and post-prandial glucose, with no major effect on body weight. Combination therapy with a DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin consistently de monstrates improved benefits in glycemic control over monotherapy with either a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin; limited within class head-to-head Therapeutic Class Overview: dipeptid yl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors Page 2 of 7 Copyright 2016 Completed on 06/20/2016 Two meta-analyses revealed that DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or cancer compared to placebo or other antidiabetic agents, respectively.37,61 However, a recent clinical trial suggested an increased risk of heart-failure with saxagliptin compared to placebo. 38 In April 2016, the FDA added heart failure warnings to the labeling of medications containing saxagliptin and alogliptin.65 With regards to the specific DPP-4 inhibitor age nts, all single-entity agents are available for once- daily dosing. (alogliptin/pioglitazone dosed daily.11 XR\u00ae] [Janumet XR\u00ae]), and because of the metformin ER component, these products are available for once-daily dosing.8,10 The fixed-dose combination product containing linagliptin also for once-daily dosing.12 Single-entity linagliptin is the only agent within t he class that does not require renal and hepatic dosing. 3 The fixed-dose combination of alogliptin/pioglitazone [Oseni\u00ae] carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of use in patients with congesti ve heart failure as the TZD component may cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients.11 Furthermore, because of the metformin component in certain fixed-dose combination prod ucts, caution is recommended with both renal and hepatic dysfunction.6-10 In addition, these products all have a boxed warning regarding the risk of lactic acidosis due to metformin accumulation.6-10 Currently, alogliptin, alogliptin/metformin, and alogliptin/pioglitazone are available generically.2,6,11 Table 1.

ER=extended-release, XR=extended-release Evidence-based Medicine Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes.16-63,65-68,76,77 Of note, there have been minimal clinical efficacy or safety trials conduc ted with any of the DPP-4 inhibitor fixed-dose combination products; bioequivalence of these products with co-adminis tration of the individual drug components has been demonstrated for all tablet strengths.6-12 Available trials evaluating t he fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin/metformin support its efficacy and safety in t he management of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, combination therapy was associated with significant ly improved glycemic control compared to metformin monotherapy.57 In studies, alogliptin was associated with significant decreases in HbA 1c from baseline as monotherapy compared to placebo. In addition, in st udies with metformin or pioglitazone combination therapy with alogliptin, si gnificant decreases in HbA 1c were observed and more patients reached specific HbA 1c goals compared to the monotherapy compar ator. As an add-on therapy in patients already being treated with metformin, pioglitazone, metformin/pioglitazone, glipizide or insulin therapy, the additions of alogliptin demon strated significant improvements in HbA 1c from baseline compared to placebo.16-23 Overall, linagliptin is more effectiv e compared to placebo in decreasing HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) as monotherapy or as add-on therap y to other antidiabetic agents in type 2 diabetics Therapeutic Class Overview: dipeptid yl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors Page 4 of 7 Copyright 2016 Completed on 06/20/2016 not achieving glycemic goals. In addition, more patients achieved glycemic goals (HbA 1c <7.0%) with linagliptin compared to placebo.24-27 Combination therapy with linagliptin and pioglitazone has been shown to be more efficacious in terms of reducing HbA 1c compared to pioglitazone monotherapy.53 Similar results were achieved with saxagliptin when compared to placebo. 29-36 In addition, combination therapy with saxagliptin and metformin was \"superior\" to monotherapy with either in HbA 1c, FPG, and post-prandial glucose ( PPG), and a significantly greater proportion of patients achieved glyc emic goals with combination therapy.55,56 Similar to the results of clinical trials evaluating ot her DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin is consistently more efficacious in improving glycemic control comp ared to placebo, and combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin is more efficaci ous than monotherapy with either agent.40-51 In a single head-to-head trial, ted non-inferiority to sitagliptin in reducing HbA 1c. However, a significantly greater pr oportion of patients achieved an HbA 1c 6.5% and achieved significant reductions in FPG with sitagliptin compared to saxagliptin.52 While the beneficial effects of the DPP-4 inhibitors in improving HbA 1c, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo are well established, observed improvements in body weight and cell function with these agents are not consistent.16-63,64 In general, meta-analyses and systematic reviews evaluating incretin-based therapies, including the DPP-4 inhibitors, support the results observed in randomized-controlled trials evaluating these agents.37,54,62-64,65-68 Two meta-analyses revealed that DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or canc er compared to placebo or other antidiabetic agents, respectively.37,61 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guideli nes for the management of type 2 diabetes:69-73,78-80 o Metformin remains the cornerstone of mo st antidiabetic treatment regimens. o Additionally, patients with a high HbA 1c will likely require combination or triple therapy in order to achieve glycemic goals. o At this time, uniform recommendations on the best agent to be combined with metformin cannot be made; therefore, advantages and disadv antages of specific antidiabetic agents for each patient should be considered. o The DPP-4 inhibitors are recommended as a potential second-line treatment option to be added in combination with metformin in patients not achieving glycemic goals. o Clinical guidelines note a lower rate of hypoglycemia and an established efficacy and safety profile when used in combination with metform in as advantages associated with the DPP-4 inhibitors compared to other cl asses of antidiabetic agents. o Patients who are not appropriate for initial therapy with metformin may be initiated on another oral antidiabetic agent, such as a sulfonylurea/glin ide, pioglitazone, or a DPP-4 inhibitor, and in occasional cases where weight loss is s een as an essential aspect of therapy, initial therapy with an incretin mimetic may be usef ul. Among all current clinical guidelines, preference of one DPP-4 inhibito r over another is not stated. Other Key Facts: o All single-entity agents are available for once-daily dosing.2-5 o Single-entity linagliptin is the only agent within the class that does not require renal and hepatic dosing.3 o The metformin component in certain fixed-dose combination products requires caution in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction.6-10 o The DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia and is weight neutral when used as monotherapy.2-12 o DPP-4 inhibitors improve the function of cells in the pancreas.1-13-15 References 1.

Specifically, and Drug Administration-appro ved as an adjunct therapy to diet and exercise to improve glycemic cont rol in adults with type 2 diabetes.1-5 This medication class was developed to mimic the effects of endogenous GLP-1, a hormone that maintains glucose homeostasis through several different mechanisms. T he incretin mimetics work by stimulating insulin secretion, inhibiting gluc agon secretion, improving cell responsiveness to glucose, delaying gastric emptying, and enhancing satiety. In addition, these agents increase insulin secretion from pancreatic cells in the presence of elevated glucose conc entrations. Therefore, due to the glucose-dependent manner in which the incretin mimetics work, the me dication class is associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia compared to other antidiabetic agents.6 The incretin mimetics are most commonly associated with gastrointes tinal-related adverse events and all agents are associated with the risk of developing pancreatitis. Only albiglutide, dulagl utide, exenatide extended- release, and liraglutide have boxed warnings regarding the risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. The incretin mimetics are available as subcutaneous injections. Albiglutide, dulaglut ide and exenatide ER is administered once-weekly (independent of meals), exenatide IR is administered twice-daily (60 minutes before meals) and liraglutide is administered once-daily (independent of meals).1-5 There are currently no generic incretin mimetics available.

Evidence-based Medicine In general, the incretin mimetics have been evaluated in clinical trials as add-on therapy to treatment regimens of established antidiabetic agents. Data co nsistently demonstrate that incretin mimetics are Therapeutic Class Overview: incretin mimetics Page 2 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/21/2016 associated with positive effects on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial glucose (PPG), and body weight. In addi tion, glycemic goals were consistently achieved when an incretin mimetic was added to existing treatment regimens.7-59 When antidiabetic agents (metfo rmin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, insulin therapy), efficacy dat a are not consistent, with the incretin mimetics achieving superiority or comparable benefits in glyc emic outcomes. However, in general, all incretin- based therapies, including the incret in mimetics, consistently demonst rate a beneficial effect on body weight compared to other antidiabetic agents.7-59 Safety and efficacy of dulaglutide has been evaluated in an extensive clinical trials program including monotherapy trials, add-on therapy to metformin, me tformin and sulfonylurea, pioglitazone and (with or without metformin).7-12 o The 52-week double-blind AWARD-3 study of patients inadequately treated with diet and exercise, or with diet and exercise and one anti-diabetic agent used at submaximal dose (N=807). At week 26, noninferiority in reduction of hemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c) was demonstrated between dulaglutide and metformin for both the 0.75 mg weekly and 1.5 mg weekly doses (-0.7% and -0.8% vs. -0.6%, respectively).7 o AWARD-1 was a 52-week placebo-controlled study that evaluated dulaglutide safety and efficacy as an add-on to maximally tolerated doses of metformin ( 1500 mg per day) and pioglitazone (up to 45 mg per day) (N=976). At 26 weeks, treatment with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA 1c compared to placebo (-0.8% and -1.1 placebo corrected difference, respectively; P<0.001 for both comparisons) and compared to exenatide (-0.3 % and -0.5 exenatide-corrected difference, respectively; P<0.001 for comparisons). 12 Albiglutide compared in a non-inferiority tria l with liraglutide. Albiglutide effectively reduced HbA 1c; however, based upon the prespeci ed non-inferiority parameters, t he criteria for non-inferiority of albiglutide were not met. The HbA 1c treatment goal of <7.0% was ac hieved by 42% of albiglutide- treated patients and 52% of liraglutide-treated patients (P=0.0023), while the goal of HbA 1c lower than 6.5% was achieved by 20% of al biglutide-treated patients and 28% of liraglutide-treated patients (P=0.0009).14 Few head-to-head clinical trials within the cl ass have been conducted. Compared to exenatide, exenatide extended-release significantly decreased HbA 1c, and achieved similar decreases in body weight.30,37 In a single trial, liragluti de significantly decreased HbA 1c compared to exenatide. Furthermore, liraglutide significantly decreased FPG exenat ide significantly decreased PPG.45 In a 26-week open-label trial, there was a significantly greater reduction from baseline in HbA 1c at 26 weeks for patients treated with liraglutide to liraglutide achieved an HbA 1c <7.0% with exenatide extended-release (60 vs 53%; P=0.0011). Reductions in bodyweight with liraglutide (-0.90 kg; 95% CI, -0.39 to -1.40).38 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Type 2 diabetes: 60-66 Metformin remains the cornerstone to most antidiabetic treatment regimens. Patients with high glycosylated hemoglobin will most likely require combination or triple therapy in order to achieve glycemic goals. The incretin mimetics are recommended as a potential second-line treatment option to be added to or used in combination with metformin in patients not achieving glycemic goals. A lower rate of hypoglycemia, established efficacy and safety profile when used in combination with metformin , demonstrated effectiveness in reducing post-prandial glucose, and the potential for weight loss are noted as advantages associated with the incretin mimetics compared to other classes of antidiabetic agents. 60-66 Therapeutic Class Overview: incretin mimetics Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/21/2016 No one incretin mimetic is recommended or preferred over another. 52-57 Other Key Facts: o Albiglutide, dulaglutide and exenatide administered o Exenatide IR is administered twic Liraglutide is administered e-daily (independent of meals).5 o No incretin mimetics [package insert].

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/18/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 Overview/Summary: Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT2 ) inhibitors are a class of oral antidiabetic agents approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic cont rol in adults with type 2 diabetes.1-7 The kidneys play a pivotal role in controlling plasma glucose concentration; reabsorbing nearly all plasma glucose in the proximal tubules and preventing glucose excretion in patients with normal glucose-tolerance. Approximately 90% of the filtered renal glucose is done in the ear ly convoluted segment of the proximal tubule and is facilitated by the SGLT2 transporter. The remaining 10% of filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the distal straight segment of the proximal tube by the SGLT1 transporter. In diabetic patients, the SGLT transporter system is often over whelmed and unable to reabsorb all filtered plasma glucose due to hyperglycemic conditions. Once this threshold c apacity is reached and surpassed, excess glucose that is not reabsorbed is excreted into the uri ne. In addition, a chronic elevated plasma glucose concentration provides the stimulus that ultimately leads to increased SGLT2 expression by the renal proximal tubular cells, resulting in an undesirable increase in renal capacity and threshold to reabsorb filtered glucose in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. 1,2 SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycemic control by producing glucosuria. This is accomp lished by inhibiting SGLT2 and increasing urinary glucose excretion. The net effect is an increase excretion of gluc ose from the body and normalizing plasma glucose levels. At this time, it is unknown if this mechanism of action serves to reduce the kidney's threshold capacity to reabsorb glucose, thus causing glucose excretion at lower plasma concentrations, or if the mechanism of action serves to prevent reabsorption of glucose load at all plasma glucose concentrations. SGLT2 inhibitors also have beneficial nonglycemic effects, such as weight loss observed during clinical trials and small decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 1,2 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine Each agent has been studied as monotherapy and dual and triple therapy compared to placebo and active controls and combinations of placebo and active controls. As monotherapy, patients randomized to canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg daily compared to patients randomized to placebo had a statistica lly significant improvement in HbA 1c. Both doses also resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA 1c <7.0%, significant reductions in FPG and post prandial glucose (PPG), and in percent body weight reduction compared to placebo. There were also small decreases from baseline in systolic blood pres sure relative to placebo (P values not reported).10 As monotherapy in treatment- na\u00efve patients, dapagliflozin was evaluated in two placebo-controlled trials. The first trial included 274 patients randomized to treatment with 2.5, 5 and 10 mg or placebo. At week 24, treatment with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg resulted in significant improvements in HbA 1c compared to placebo (-0.6, -0.8, -0.9 vs -0.2%, respectively; P<0.05 for 5 (-24.1 and -28.8 vs -4.1 mg/dL, resp ectively) from baseline was also significantly greater in the 5 and 10 mg groups compared to placebo (P<0.05 for both comparisons).12 There have been no clinical efficacy studies conducted with Xigduo XR\u00ae (dapagliflozin/metformin) combination tablets. FDA-approval of dapagliflo zin/metformin ER was based on previous studies conducted with the bioequi valent single-entity agents.7 Combination therapy with metformin who were treatment-na\u00efve led to signific antly greater reductions in HbA 1c compared to either monotherapy (dapagliflozin or metformin) study (-2.0 -1.4%, and -1.4%, respectively; P<0.0001). In the second study, treatment with 10 mg strength (as mono therapy) was also non-inferior to metformin (as monotherapy) for reduction of HbA 1c.14 The safety and efficacy of empagliflozin monothe rapy was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- controlled study of patients with type 2 DM (N=986). At week 24, empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c (-0.7% and vs. 12 mg/dL, respectively; P values not reported) and body weight (-2.8 kg and -3.2 kg vs. -0.4 kg, respectively; P values not reported) compared with placebo.15 There have been no clinical efficacy studies cond ucted with empagliflozin/metformin combination tablets. FDA-approval of empagliflozin/metformin ER was based on previous studies conducted with the bioequivalent single-entity agents.9 The safety and efficacy of empagliflozin added to metformin was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pati ents with type 2 DM inadequately controlled on at least 1,500 mg of metformin per day (N=637). At week 24, empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA 1c (-0.7% and -0.8% and -22 mg/dL vs. 6 mg/dL, respectively; P values not reported) and body weight (-2.5 kg and -2.9 kg vs. -0.5 kg, respectively; P<0.001 for both comparisons) compared with placebo.24 In addition, the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin was evaluated in an active-control study versus glimepiri de (in combination with metformin). The study was a double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiorit y design of patients with type 2 DM inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (N=1,545). At week 52, empagliflozin 25 mg daily meet the non-inferiority criteria for lowering HbA 1c compared to glimepiride (-0.7% vs. -0.7%). There was a greater reduction in FPG and body weight with empagliflozin 25 mg compared to glimepiride; Therapeutic Class Overview: sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/18/2016 however the significance was not reported (-19 mg/dL vs. -9 mg/dL and -3.9 kg vs. 2 kg; P values not reported).25 The safety and efficacy of empagliflozin added to lin agliptin was evaluated in a 52 week double-blind, active-control, randomized trial. Change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 24 was significantly improved in the combination groups compared with the individual component groups (P<0.001).32 When started as initial therapy, empagliflozin/linagliptin reduced HbA 1c from baseline significantly greater when compared with individual linagliptin and empagliflozi n 10 mg. Empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, however, did not show a statistically significant difference compared with empagliflozin alone (P=0.179).33 Similar results were observed when comparing s odium glucose co-transport 2 agents in combination for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.17-31 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines:34-41 o Metformin remains the cornerstone of most antidiabetic treatment regimens. o Patients with high glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) will likely require combination or triple therapy in order to achieve glycemic goals. Uniform recommendations on the best agent to be combined with metformin cannot be made; therefore, advantages and disadvantages of specific antidiabetic agents for each patient should be considered. The role of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are addressed in several available treatment guidelines and are recommended as a potential alternative to metformin in patients who cannot receive that agent or as a part of two- or three-drug regimens in combination wi th other antidiabetic agents in patients not achieving glycemic goals.35,38-39 Other Key Facts: o Canagliflozin is formulated with me tformin in a single tablet (Invokamet\u00ae). Empagliflozin is formulated with linagliptin in a single tablet (Glyxambi\u00ae) and with metformin in a single tablet (Synjardy\u00ae). Dapagliflozin is formulated with metfo rmin as a single extended-release tablet (Xigduo XR\u00ae).6-9 o All products are dosed once daily, with t he exception of canagliflozin/metformin and empagliflozin/metformin, which are dosed twice dialy.3-9 o Other effects observed in trials include wei ght loss and small decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. o Common adverse side effects associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use included increased incidence of female genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infection, and increased urination.

Page 1 of 4 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/02/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Ophthalmic Prostaglandin Analogues Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that causes gradual degeneration of the cells making up the optic nerve. It is the leading caus e of blindness and second leading cause of vision loss in the world.1 Four distinct types of glaucoma inclu de primary open-angle, acute angle-closure, secondary and congenital. Patients with open-angle glaucoma initially experience peripheral visual field loss, followed by central field loss, which may progress to irreversible blindness if untreated. The exact etiology of open-angle glaucoma is unknow n. Major risk factors for developing open-angle glaucoma include advanced age, African or Hispanic /Latino descent, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), family history of glaucoma or a centra l corneal thickness of le ss than 545 micrometers.2-3 Other possible risk factors that have been investigated include low ocular systolic perfusion pressure, low systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular di sease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism.1,3-6 IOP is the one major risk factor for glaucoma t hat is treatable. Available evidence suggests that lowering IOP inhibits or reduces the progression of optic nerve damage.1-3,7 Treatment may be initiated in patients with a raised IOP despite hav ing no visual field loss or optic nerve damage. An IOP greater than 22 mm Hg is generally consider ed to be elevated and would be treated by most clinicians; however, this number varies accord ing to screening methods, risk factors and disease progression.7 The target IOP should be individualized based on their response to therapy and disease progression. There is no consensus target IOP below which further visual loss and optic nerve damage will be prevented.2,3 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine Many clinical trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.18-59 Ophthalmic bimatoprost appears to have the greatest efficacy in reducing IOP; however, trials have not consistently demonstrated a difference in IOP reduction between ophthalmic travoprost and ophthalmic latanoprost.18,20,21,25,28,30,31,35,36 Therapeutic Class Overview: ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues Page 2 of 4 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 08/2/2016 Available trials suggest that ophthalmic tafluprost may have a similar IOP-lowering effect as ophthalmic latanoprost but less than ophthalmic travoprost.49-52 Results from one trial demonstrated a significantly lo wer incidence of ocular irritation/burning, tearing, itching, dry eye sensation and conj when switched from well as ophthalmic taflupros t also significantly reduced IOP compared to baseline treatment with ophthalmic lata noprost (16.4 vs 16.8 mm Hg; P=0.049).48 A meta-analysis of 11 randomized control trials showed significant reductions in IOP with ophthalmic compared to prostaglandin analogues have cons istently demonstrated comparable or greater efficacy when compared to combination therapy.33,34,39-42 The safety and efficacy of unoprostone isopropyl for lowering IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension was established in six, six-month ra ndomized controlled clinical studies. Patients had a mean baseline intraocular pressure of 23 mmHg, and unoprostone isopropyl lowered intraocular pressure by approximately 3 to 4 mmHg throug hout the day. Unoprostone isopropyl appeared to lower intraocular pressure without affecting cardiovascular or pulmonary function.14 A review of all clinical trial data suggests unoprostone may not be as efficacious as other prostanoids; however, it is effective for IOP reduction both as monotherapy an d adjunctive therapy with timolol. In addition, unoprostone has decreased affinity for the prostaglandin F2 receptor, which may explain its well tolerated ocular and systemic side effect profile compared with other prostanoids.59 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines:1-3,7,8 o The current treatment of glaucoma focuses on decreasing IOP by one of three methods: laser therapy, surgery or medical intervention. o Medical intervention is generally used as initial therapy prior to laser or surgical treatment. Medical intervention includes five classes of ophthalmic drugs used for the long-term management of glaucoma: o These treatments reduce IOP by either dec reasing the amount of aqueous humor produced by the ciliary body or by in creasing uveoscleral outflow. o Current guidelines by the American Academy of Ophthalmology and American Optometric Association recommend ophthalmic adrenergic antagonists and prostaglandin analogues as first-line pharmacologic therapy in patients with elevated IOP. Combination or monotherapy with agents from an alternat ive pharmacologic class is recommended for patients that experience intolerable adverse ev ents or who do not achieve the optimal IOP reduction with first-line agents. o Other Key Facts: o Latanoprost is the only ophthalmic prostaglandin analogue that is available generically.9 o Tafluprost is the only preservative-free ophthal mic prostaglandin product and is only available in single-use containers.13 o Bimatoprost and latanoprost are borate, so rbitol, propylene 1.

Page 1 of 4 Copyright 2014 Review Completed on 08/01/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Ophthalmic Fluoroquinolones Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: This review will focus on the ophthalmi c fluoroquinolone antibiotics. These agents are used for the treatment of bacterial conjun ctivitis and corneal ulcers caused by susceptible isolates. 1-8 Conjunctivitis occurs worldwide and affects all ages, social strata, and both genders. This infection rarely causes permanent visual loss or structural damage and mild cases may be self- limited, as many cases will resolve without treatment in immunocompetent individuals. The most common causative pathogens seen with bacterial conjunctivitis include Staphylococcus , Haemophilus influenza , and Moraxella catarrhalis .9 Major clinical features of bacterial conjunctivitis incl ude redness and discharge in one eye, although it can be bilateral. Patients eye(s) will often be \"stuck shut\" in the morning. Purulent discharge continues throughout the day and is thick, globular and may be yellow, white or green in color, which may help distinguish between viral and allergic conjunctivitis which usually has watery discharge. 9 Fluoroquinolone antibiotics act via direct inhibition of bacterial DNA synthesis, preventing the action of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which blocks DNA replicati on and eventually leads to damage to bacterial DNA and cell death.10 Currently, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gat ifloxacin and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and ofloxa cin. They are all indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.1-8 In addition, ciprofloxacin solution and ofloxacin have the indication to treat corneal ulcers caused by susceptible isolates.2,8 All medications are formulated as drops (either solution or suspension) with only ciprofloxacin hydrochloride being formulated as an ointment (Ciloxan\u00ae).3 Although generally considered equally effectiv e, differences in resistance exist, with fewer gram-positive cocci being resistant to gatiflo xacin and moxifloxacin hydrochloride than other fluoroquinolones.13 Frequency and duration of therapy varies depending on specific agents. Treatment for bacterial conjunctivi tis with besifloxacin and moxifloxacin hydrochloride is usually dosed twice or three times daily, while the others are generally prescribed ev ery two to four hours.1-8 Most ophthalmic quinolones are indicated for use in patients one year of age or older, however, moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Moxeza\u00ae) is indicated for use in children four months of age and older and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ointment is only indicated for use in children two years of age or older. 1-8 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine Clinical trials have demonstrated that ophthalmi c fluoroquinolones are effective in treating and providing relief of conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers in pediatric and adult patients.15-40 Several studies comparing ophthalmic fluoroquinolo nes to either placebo or vehicle have concluded that these medications resulted in significantly higher clinical resolution rates at days one through five.15-20 Head-to-head trials evaluating the efficacy of ophthalmic antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis have found that no one medication was inferior to another.21-30 In one trial, significantly more patients in the ophthalmic moxifloxacin group had complete resolution of ocular signs and symptoms at 48 hours wh en compared to patients treated with ophthalmic polymyxin B sulfate/trimethoprim (P=0.001).22 One study found levofloxacin 0.5% to have statistically greater microbial eradication in pediatric patients tw o to 11 years of age with bacterial conjunctivitis (P0.032) compared to ofloxacin 0.3% in, but not in any other pediatric age group..26 In a seven day trial, a higher percentage of patients receiving levofloxacin had microbi al eradication at the final visit compared to patients receiving oflo xacin (P=0.034);however, clinical cure rates were similar between the two treatments (P value not reported).27 In a small meta-analysis, moxifloxacin was found to be associated with fewer drop-outs for treatment failure (P=0.002) compared to ofloxacin.28 In patients with a diagnosis of corneal ulcer, op hthalmic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride was shown to be efficacious treatment options.31,32 Specifically, in one trial of patient s with a diagnosis of infectious keratitis ophthalmic ciprofloxacin had a shorter average time to healing as compared to ophthalmic cefazolin sodium fortified with gentamicin sulfat e, although this was not found to be significant (P value not reported).32 A number of studies consisted of patients wi th multiple diagnoses such as blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis and blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, or symptoms of surface ocular infections. These studies found that the ophthalmic formulations polymyxin were efficacious in resolving or curing multiple ocular infections. No significant differences were observed in any study with regard to cure rates, decline in ba cterial counts, bacterial er adication or reduction of bacteria, microbial improvem ent or overall improvement. 34-39 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Use of ophthalmic antibiotics is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission when compared to placebo. Therapy for severe conjunctivitis disease be based on culture and sensitivity, but if that is not available or if mild disease is present, empiric therapy is considered appropriate.9,11-13 o The selection of an ophthalmic antibiotics for bact erial conjunctivitis is typically empirical, and the most convenient or least expensive ophthalmic antibiotic is typically effective for most cases of conjunctivitis.11 o Although effective, ophthalmic quinolones are generally regarded as second-line agents for routine bacterial conjunctivitis because of resistance and cost concerns.9,11,12 o Ophthalmic quinolones are the considered the treatment of choice for corneal ulcers and for infections caused by pseudomonas.9,13 o The recommended ophthalmic antibiotics for treatment of keratitis vary depending on organism identified. Empiric therapy is often utilized and include s ophthalmic quinolones13 o Fewer gram-positive cocci are resistant to gatifloxacin moxifloxacin hydrochloride than other fluoroquinolones13 Therapeutic Class Overview: ophthalmic antibiotics Page 3 of 4 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/01/2016 o Single-drug therapy using an ophthalmic fluoro quinolone has been shown to be as effective as combination therapy with ophthalmic antibioti cs that are fortified by increasing their concentration over commercially available topical antibiotics.13 Other Key Facts: o Ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (solution) are available generically. o Only ciprofloxacin hydrochlori de is formulated as an ointment.3 o Moxeza\u00ae is dosed twice daily while besifloxacin and Vigamox\u00ae (moxifloxacin) are dosed three times a day. The remaining agents are dosed every tw o or every four hours while awake.1-8 o Most ophthalmic quinolones are indicated for use in patients one year of age or older; however, moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Moxeza\u00ae) is indicated for use in children four months of age and older and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride oint ment is only indicated for use in children two years of age or older.1-8 References 1.

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Inhaled Corticosteroids Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: The inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic being indicated for use in asthma patients who require systemic corticosteroid therapy. 1-11 These agents are effective in the treatment of asthma due to their wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells and eosinophils) and mediators (e.g., histamine and cytokines) involved in the asthmatic response. The ICSs exer t their anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors with a subsequent acti vation of genes involved in the anti-inflammatory processes as well as an inhibition of pro-inflammatory genes involved in the asthmatic response. Inflammation is also a component of chronic ob structive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis; however, no single-entity ICS has b een FDA-approved for use in COPD. 1-10 Although ICSs exert their therapeutic effects through identic al mechanisms of action, they differ in their potency, dosing schedules, and dosage form availab ility. Clinical trials comparing ICSs of varying potencies have shown that those of higher potencies do not demonstra te greater clinical efficacy than those of lower potencies when administered at equipotent doses and have not demonstrated any major differences in clinical efficacy between the available ICSs.12-67 Currently, only budesonide nebulizer suspension is available generically.

Evidence-based Medicine Numerous placebo controlled trials have demonstra ted the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroid agents in the treatment of asthma, and these agents are cons idered the most effective agents in the long-term management of the disease. The results of head- to-head trials directly comparing the inhaled corticosteroids products have not demonstrated one agent to be significantly more effective than another, regardless of the potency or dosage form of the inhaled corticosteroid agent used.12-67 FDA-approval for fluticasone furoate was based on the results of three dose-ranging trials and four confirmatory trials which incl uded a total of 3,611 patients aged 12 years with various asthma severities, FEV 1 of 40 to 90% predicted and varied (or no) previous ICS use.13-15,19-22 Pre-dose, pre- bronchodilator FEV 1 (primary endpoint) was significantly improved upon treatment with the FDA- approved doses of fluticasone furoate when compared to placebo in each of the seven clinical trials. o Fluticasone furoate also significantly impr oved percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods and although statistical significance could not be determined in some cases, fluticasone furoate also improved symptom-free 24-hour periods over the cour se of the studies.13-15,19-22 Therapeutic Class Overview: inhaled corticosteroids Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o ICSs are the most potent and consistently effective long-term controller medications for asthma patients of all ages. These agents are recommended as first-line therapy for long- term control of persistent asthma symptoms in all age groups. Although ICSs reduce both impairment and risk of asthma exacerbations, t hey do not appear to alter the progression or underlying severity of the disease. No ICS is recommended over another.68,71 The adverse effect on growth rate associated with these agents does appear to be dose dependant; however, it is not consider ed predictable. The effect on growth velocity appears to occur mainly in the first several months of treatment and is generally small and not progressive.68 o For COPD: In patients with an FEV 1 <60% of the predicted value, regular treatment with ICS improves symptoms, lung function and quality of life as well as reduces exacerbations. However, long term therapy ICS as monotherapy is not recommended.72 o ICSs should be used as adjunctive agents to long-acting bronchodilators to decrease exacerbation frequency in patients with an FEV 1 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations.73 Other Key Facts: o None of the inhaled corticosteroid prod ucts are indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm1-10 o Currently, budesonide suspension for nebulizati on is the only generic product available within the therapeutic class.

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/13/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Long-Acting Inhaled 2-Agonists (Single Entity) Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: Respiratory 2-agonists are primarily used to tr eat reversible airway disease. The long-acting 2-agonists (LABAs) are all Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA)-approved for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with some agents also being approved for asthma maintenance therapy and exercise-induced asthma/bronchospasm.1-7 Respiratory 2-agonists act preferentially on the 2-adrenergic receptors. Activation of t hese receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and an in crease in intracellular cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The increase in cyclic AMP leads to activation of protein kinase A and the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation resultin g in lower intracellular ionic calcium and smooth muscle relaxation. Increased cyclic AMP levels also inhibit the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways.1-6 The respiratory 2-agonists can be divided into two categories: short-acting and long- acting. Only the inhaled long-acting 2-agonists will be covered in this review and they arformoterol, formoterol, indacaterol salmeterol, and the 2- agonists elicit a similar biologic response in patients suffering from reversible airway disease, but differ in their dosing requirements, pharmacoki netic parameters and potential adverse events.1-6 Guidelines do not recommend one long-acting agent over another.8-11 In addition, head-to-head clinical trials have been inconclusive to determine \"superiority\" of any one agent .12-60 There are currently no generic formulations for the LABAs.

Dry powder inhaler only Twice-daily \u00a7Once-daily Evidence-based Medicine Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy long-acting 2-agonists in providin g relief from asthma, COPD exacerbations and exercise induced asthma .12-61 Salmeterol and formoterol have been found to improve FEV 1 in patients with mild to moderate asthma who require persistent use of SABAs. In a meta-analysis by Salpeter et al, salmeterol and formoterol both demonstrated an increase in severe exacerbatio ns that required hospita lization, life threatening exacerbations and asthma-related deaths in adults and children alike when compared to placebo.13 A systematic review concluded that in patients with COPD, there was no difference in rate of mild exacerbation between patients treated with an ICS or LABA (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 5.39) or in the rate of moder ate or severe COPD exac erbations (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.02).42 Overall, data from published clinical trials demonst rate that treatment with indacaterol consistently results in significantly higher mean trough FEV 1 after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, formoterol, salmeterol and tiotropium. Patients tr eated with indacaterol also achieved significant improvements in COPD symptoms, as well as health-related quality of life compared to those treated with placebo.42-52 The safety and efficacy of olodaterol were eval uated in eight unpublished placebo- and/or active- controlled confirmatory clinical trials in patient s with COPD. Results from four 48-week studies showed 5 \u00b5g olodaterol provided significant improvements in FEV 1 and FEV 1 AUC 0-3hr at weeks 12 and 24 when compared with placebo (no P value prov ided). In addition, four 6-week cross-over studies showed 1 AUC 0-12hr and FEV 1 AUC 12-24hr was significantly improved with olodaterol when compared with placebo at the conclusion of the studies (no P value provided). No data was provided showing the results of the active compar ators (formoterol and/or ti otropium) or whether the results were significantly different than olodaterol or not.4 Two replicate, double-blind, placebo-controll FEV 1 AUC 0-3 and trough FEV 1 after 12 weeks of therapy afte r adding olodaterol (via Respimat\u00ae inhaler) to COPD patients being treated with tiotropium 18 \u00b5g via HandiHaler\u00ae. There was a significant improvement in both FEV 1 AUC 0-3 and trough FEV 1 responses without a significant increase in side effects when olodaterol was added to tiotropium. The mean difference in FEV 1 AUC 0-3 in ANHELTO 1 and 2 respectively were 0.117 L and 0.106 L (P<0.001 for both). Mean difference in FEV 1 responses were 0.062 L and 0.040 L (P<0.001 and P=0.0029).57 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Short-acting 2-agonists are recommended for patients in all stages of asthma, for symptomatic relief of reversible airway di sease and for exercise-induced bronchospasm.8,9 o Short-acting 2-agonists should be used on an as-needed or \"rescue\" basis. 8,9 o In the chronic management of asthma, the long-acting 2-agonists should be used as add-on therapy in patients not adequately co ntrolled on an inhaled corticosteroid. 8,9 o Long-acting 2-agonists should not be used as monother apy for the long-term control of asthma. 8,9 o Long-acting 2-agonists can be used for exercise-induced bronchospasm and provide a longer period of coverage compared to short acting 2-agonists. 8,9 Therapeutic Class Overview: long-acting inhaled 2-agonists (single entity) Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/13/2016 o Long-acting 2-agonists have a role in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for patients who remain symptomatic ev en with current treatment with short-acting bronchodilators. 8,9 o Long-acting 2-agonists can be COPD treatment regimens, including an anticholinergic agent, in efforts to decrease exacerbations.10,11 Other Key Facts: o The role of the short- and long-acting respiratory 2-agonists in the treatment of asthma and COPD has been well established. o Studies have failed to consistently demonstra te significant differences between products. o None of the long-acting respiratory 2-agonists are currently available generically.

Respiratory 2-agonists act preferentially on the 2-adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and an increase in intracellular cyclic-3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The increase in cyclic AMP leads to activation of protein kinase A and the inhibition of myosin phosphorylati on resulting in lower intracellular ionic calcium and smooth muscle relaxation. Increased cyclic AMP levels also inhibit the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways. 1-15 The 2-agonists can be divided into two categories: short-acting a similar biologic response in patients suffering from reversible airway dise ase, but differ in their dosing requirements, pharmacokinetic parameters an d potential adverse events.1-15 As a result of the Clean Air Act and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplet e the Ozone Layer, the FDA made the decision to end production, marketing and sale of all albuterol metered dose inhalers (MDIs) containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as their propellant by December 31, 2008. These inhalers were replaced by MDIs which use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs). There is no difference in the safety or efficacy of the HFA inhalers compared to the CFC inhalers; however, there may small differences in taste and/or feel with the HFA inhalers. The deadline for removal of the pirbuterol (Maxair \u00ae) CFC inhaler is December 31, 2013.16 Table 1.

Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was significantly improved with albuterol dry powder inhaler compared with placebo (no P value reported).7 In clinical trials that comparing albuterol to levalbuterol, inconsistent results have been reported and have not consistently demonstrat ed improved outcomes with levalbuterol compared to albuterol. Moreover, studies have shown no significant diffe rences between the two agents in the peak change in FEV 1 or the number and incidence of adverse events.21-31 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Short-acting 2-agonists are recommended for patients in all stages of asthma, for symptomatic relief of reversible airway di sease and for exercise-induced bronchospasm.17-20 o Short-acting 2-agonists should be used on an as-needed or \"rescue\" basis. 17-20 Therapeutic Class Overview: short acting 2-agonists Page 3 of 4 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/15/2016 o Anticholinergics may also be used for th e treatment of acute exacerbations but are considered less e ffective than SABAs.17-20 o The addition of a systemic corticosteroid may be required if patients do not respond immediately to treatment with a SABA or if the exacerbation is severe.17-20 o The use of LABAs to treat acute sympto ms or exacerbations of asthma is not recommended.17 Other Key Facts: o Studies have failed to consistently demonstra te significant differences between products. o Albuterol oral solution, oral tablets, and solu tion for nebulization, levalbuterol solution for nebulization, metaproterenol oral solution and oral tablets, and terbuta line oral tablets and solution for injection are available generically. o There are currently branded al buterol hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA) inhalers and one dry-powder inhaler; however, no are available.

These agents are used al one or in combination for the treatment of opioid use disorder with several age nts used for the reversal of and Drug Administration (F DA)-approved for the tr eatment of opioid dependence.1-7 Naltrexone alcohol dependence.2,3 Naloxone (Evzio\u00ae, Narcan\u00ae) is used for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.8-10 Products which contain buprenorphine are classified as Schedule III controlled substances.11 Other formulations of buprenorphine, buccal transdermal patch (Butrans\u00ae) are FDA-approved for use in the management of pain and will not be discussed with in this review.12-14 Buprenorphine, are currently available as generic products. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist at the -opioid receptor (associated with analgesia and dependence) and an antagonist at the -opioid receptor (related to dysphoria).1,4-7 Compared to full opioid agonists, partial agonists bind to the -opioid receptor at a higher degree while activating the receptor to a lesser degree. Partial opioid agonist s reach a ceiling effect at higher doses and will displace full opioid agonists from the -opioid receptor. Although bupren orphine is associated with significant respiratory depression when used in travenously, or by pati ents with concomitant benzodiazepine or alcohol abuse, it is associated with a lower abuse potential, a lower level of physical dependence and is safer in overdose when compared to full opioid agonists.15 During buprenorphine administration, opioid-dependent patient s experience positive subjective opioid effects which are limited by ceiling effect.4-7 Naloxone and naltrexone are -opioid receptor antagonists.2-10 Naloxone has measurable blood levels following sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone administration, however, due to naloxone's low oral bioavailability, there are no significant physiolog ical or subjective diffe rences when compared to the administration of buprenorphine alone. Following intramuscular or intravenous administration, buprenorphine/naloxone is associat ed with symptoms of opioid withdrawal and dysphoria which is caused by a stronger affinity of naloxone fo r the opioid receptor co mpared to buprenorphine.4-7 Therefore, the addition of naloxone to buprenorphi ne results in a decreased risk of diversion compared to buprenorphine monotherapy.11 Similarly, when naloxone alone is administered to a patient via intravenous, intramuscular, nasal or subcutaneous routes, reversal of opioid-related effects is expected. This includes re spiratory and/or nevou s system depression.8-10 The United States Substance Abuse and Mental Service Clinical Guideline for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Opioid Addi ction recommends the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for the induction, stabilization and maintenance phases of opioid addiction treatment for most patients. This guideline also notes that bupren orphine alone should be used for pregnant patients and for the induction therapy of patients who are transitioning from methadone treatment. 15 Transitioning patients to buprenorphine/naloxone as early as poss ible to minimize potential diversion associated with buprenorphine monotherapy is also reccomended.15 Veterans Health Administration and American Psychiatric Association guidelines out line a similar strategy with methadone and buprenorphine first line.16-17 Only the American Psychiatric Association guidelines recommend naltrexone use as an alternative regimen.17 Naloxone is recommended as an appropriate emergency pharmacologic intervention for in stances of opioid overdose.16 Additionally, The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Amer ican Medical Association are among some of the prominent medical organizations and advocacy gro ups that recognize naloxone as standard care for pharmacologic treatment of opioid overdose.18,19 Therapeutic Class Overview: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 2 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/4/2016 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine Therapeutic Class Overview: Opioid Dependence Agents Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/4/2016 Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone significa ntly improve many different outcomes for patients with opioid dependence compared to pl acebo and no treatment, but are generally found to not be significantly different from one another.22-32,43-50 Buprenorphine has been compared to methadone in se veral clinical studies and reviewed in multiple meta-analyses. Overall, studies have demonstrated that buprenorphine-based therapy was as effective as methadone in the management of opioid dependence.24,33-40 A meta-analysis of 1,158 participants in 13 random ized trials compared oral naltrexone maintenance treatment to either placebo or non-medication. No difference was seen between the active and control groups in sustained abstinence or most other primary outcomes. o Considering only studies in which patient's adh erence were strictly enforced, there was a statistically significant difference in retention and abstinence with naltrexone over non therapy (relative risk [RR], 2.93; 95% CI, 1.66 to 5.18). 60 The safety of Vivitrol\u00ae (naltrexone extended-releas e) for opioid dependence was evaluated in a 24-week, placebo-controlled random ized control trial. The percentage of subjects achieving each observed percentage of opioid-fr ee weeks was greater in the naltrexone extended release group compared to the placebo group. Complete abstinence (opioid-free at all weekly visits) was sustained by 23% of subjects in the place bo group compared with 36% of subjects in the naltrexone extended release group from Week 5 to Week were FDA-approved via the 505(b)(2) pathway, which allows a manufacturer to compare a new product to a previous ly-approved drug (or drugs) and utilize data from studies that were performed on the reference drug. These medications have not been specifically studied in clinical trials evaluating their efficacy. Clinical and safety data for these medications is based on previously approved reference products.5,7,9,10,62 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The United States Substance Abuse and Mental Service Clinical Guideline for the Use of Buprenorphine in the Treatment of Op ioid Addiction recommends the use of buprenorphine/naloxone fo r the induction, stab ilization and maintenance phases of opioid addiction treatment for most patients.15 o This guideline also notes that buprenorphine alone should be used for pregnant patients and for the induction therapy of patients who are transitioning from methadone treatment.15 o Naloxone is recommended as an appropriate emergency pharmacologic intervention for instances of opioid overdose.16 o Naltrexone is generally reserved as an alter native regimen after buprenorphine-containing products and methadone.17 Other Key Facts: o Buprenorphine is available as a sublingual tablet; buprenorphine/nalox one is available as a film (Suboxone\u00ae) and buccal film is available as a tablet (ReVia\u00ae) and extended-release suspension for injection (Vivitrol\u00ae); and naloxone is (Narcan\u00ae) auto- injector (Evzio\u00ae)1-10 o According to the Drug Addicti on Treatment Act of 2000, the ab ility to prescrib e buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone for the maintenance or detoxification of opioid dependence is limited to physicians who have obtained a wa iver and a unique Drug Enforcement Agency number beginning with an X.20 o Naltrexone extended-release suspension for injecti on is injected intramuscularly in the gluteal muscle every 4 weeks by a healthcare provider.3 References 1.

The long-ac ting opioids and their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications are outlined in Table 1.1-19 Previously, they were prescribed for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain; however, starting in March 2014, the FDA's required label changes were made for most of the agents, updating their indication.20 Currently, long- acting opioids are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which al ternative treatment opti ons are inadequate. This change was made for all long-acting opioids in an e ffort to help prescribers and patients make better decisions about who benefits from opioids and also to help prevent problems associated with their use. 20 In addition to indication changes, the long-acting opioid label must include statements that the long-acting opioid is not for \"as needed\" use, that it has an innate risk of addiction, abuse and misuse even at recommended doses, and finally it must include an update to the black box warning for increased risk of neonatal opioi d withdrawal sy ndrome (NOWS).20 Long-acting opioids are available in a variety of different dosage forms, and cu rrently several agents are available generically. Pain is one of the most common an d debilitating patient complaints , with persistent pain having the potentially to lead to functional impairment and disability, psychological distress, and sleep deprivation. Two broad categories of pain incl ude adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive pain contributes to survival by protec ting individuals from injury and/or promoting healing when injury has occurred. Maladaptive, or chronic pain, is pain as a disease and represents pathologic functioning of the nervous system. Various definitions of ch ronic pain currently exist and may be based on a specified duration of pain; however, in general, the condition can be defi ned as pain which lasts beyond the ordinary duration of time that an insult or injury to the body needs to heal. Pain can also be categorized as being either nociceptive or neu ropathic, and treatments for each are specific. Nociceptive pain is caused by damage to tissue and can further be divided into somatic (pain arising from injury to body tissues) and visc eral pain (pain arising from the internal organs). Visceral pain is often described as poorly localized, deep, dull, and cramping. In contrast, neuropathic pain arises from abnormal neural activity secondary to disease, injury, or dysfunction of the nervous system. 21 Several mechanisms are thought to be involved in the promotion and/or facilitation of chronic pain, and include peripheral and centra l sensitization, ectopic excitability, structural reorganization/phenotypic switch of neurons, pr imary sensory degeneration, and disinhibition. Patients not responding to traditional pain treat ments may require individualized and supplemental conventional treatment approaches t hat target different mechanisms. 21 Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options are currently available for the management of chronic pain. Available treatment options make up six major categorie s: pharmacologic, physical medicine, behavioral medicine, neuromodulation, interventional, and surgic al approaches. As stated previously, some patients may require multiple treatment approaches in order to achieve adequate control of their chronic pain. Pharmacologic therapy should not be th e sole focus of pain treatment; however, it is the most widely utilized option to m anage chronic pain. Ma jor pharmacologic categories used in the management of pain include nonopioid tramadol, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists, and topical analgesics. Combining pharmacologic therapies may result in improved analgesia, and because lower doses of each agent can be used, patients may experience fewer treatment-emergent adverse events. Response to pharmacologi c therapies will vary between individual patients, and currently no one approach has been demonstrated to be appropriate for all patients. Treatment decisions are largely based on the type of pain (e.g., neuropathic, nociceptive), comorbidities, concurrent medi cations, pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic properties of the agent, and anticipated adverse events. 22 Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 2 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 For the treatment of neuropathic pain, generally accepted first line therapies include calcium channel utilized se cond line, and opioids should be considered as a second or third line option for most patients. Ideally, nociceptive pain is primarily managed with the use of non-opioid analgesics, with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs utilized first line in the management of mild to moderate pain. Opioids are associated with a risk of abuse and overdose, and the evidence for the effectiveness of long term opioid therapy in providing pain relief and improving functional outcomes is limited. Use of opioids in the management of chronic noncancer pain remains c ontroversial, and consideration for their use in this clinical setting should be weighed carefully. Opioids should be reserved for the treatment of pain of any severity not adequately controlled with non- opioid analgesics or antidepressants, more severe forms of acute pain, and cancer pain. If being consid ered for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, opioids should be further reserved for patients with m oderate to severe chronic pain that is adversely affecting patient function and/or quality of life.22 The long-acting opioid agents primarily produce in tense analgesia via their agonist actions at mu receptors, which are found in large numbers within the central nervous system. The binding of these agents to mu receptors produces a variety of other effects including bradycardia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Ke y safety concerns associated with the opioid analgesics include respiratory depression, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression. 22,23 All of the long-acting opioids are classified as Sc hedule II controlled substances by the FDA, with the exception of buprenorphine transdermal systems which are a Schedule III controlled substance. Buprenorphine is a partial opiate agonist, and the transdermal system is the first and only seven day transdermal opioid approved by the FDA. 1 On July 9, 2012, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for all long-acti ng opioids. The program requires companies who manufacture long-acting opioids to make training r egarding proper prescribing practices available for health care professionals who prescribe these agents, as well as distribute educational materials to both prescribers and patients on the safe use of th ese agents. The new REMS program is part of the national prescription drug abuse plan announced by the Obama Administration in 2011 to combat prescription drug misuse and abuse.24 According to the FDA abuse and misuse of prescr iption opioid products has created a serious and growing public health problem. The FDA consider s the development of abuse-deterrent products a priority. As outlined in their guidanc e for evaluation and labeling, \"abuse- deterrent properties\" are defined as those properties shown to meaningfully deter abuse , even if they do not fully prevent abuse. The FDA elected to use the term \"abuse-deterr ent\" rather than \"tamper-resistant\" because the latter term refers to, or is used in connection with, packaging requirements applicable to certain classes of drugs, devices, and cosmetics. Abuse-deterrent technologies should target known or expected routes of abuse relevant to the proposed product. The FDA has provided several categories for abuse-deterrent formulations. Categories include physical/chemical barriers, agonist/antagonist combinations, aversion ( adding a product that has an unpleasant effect if manipulated or is used at a higher than recommended do se), delivery systems, new molecular entities/prodrugs, a combination of these methods, or a novel approach (encompasses approaches or technologies not currently captured in previous categories).25 Buprenorphine buccal film is formulated using bioerodible mucoadhesive (BEMA \u00ae) technology. BEMA\u00ae is a film formulation that consists of a water-soluble polymer that adheres to the buccal mucosa. The film dissolves over approximately 30 minutes into the bu ccal mucosa, leaving behind no residual film. Delivery into the buccal mucosa enhances t he bioavailability of [ER]) tablets are resistant to crushing, breaking and dissolution using different solvents, and the tablets still retain some ER properties after tampering. Attempts to dissolve the tablets result in the form ation of a viscous gel, which may cause difficulty passing through a hypodermic needle.5 In addition, the tablets appear to be associated with less \"drug liking\" Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 3 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 based upon results reported from two unpublished clinic al abuse potential studies conducted in a small number of non-dependent recreational opioid users.26 There are currently two formulation of oxycodone ER which are considered abuse deterrent, OxyContin\u00ae and Xtampza ER\u00ae. OxyContin\u00ae utilizes the RESISTEC\u00ae technology that employs a combination of polymer and processing that gives tablet hardness, im parts viscosity when dissolved in aqueous solutions and resists increased drug release rate when mixed with alcoholic beverages.10 Results from trials support that, the reformulated oxycodone ER is abl e to resist crushing, breaking, extraction and dissolution in small volumes using a variety of tools and solvents.28-29 Xtampza ER\u00ae utilizes DETERx technology, which is designed to provide adequate pain control while maintaining its drug release profile after being subjected to common methods of manipulation, including chewing and crushing.30,31 Originally approved by the FDA in 2009, Embeda \u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochloride) was voluntarily recalled from the mark et in March 2011 due to stabilit y issues with the manufacturing process.32 Subsequently, in November 2013, the FDA approved a manufacturing supplement for the product after the stability concer ns were addressed through the ma nufacturing proces s. The abuse deterrent formulation of Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydroc hloride) was granted FDA approval in October 2014, making it the third ER opioid anal gesic to obtain this designation and the morphine ER products.33 Embeda\u00ae (morphine sulfate/naltrexone hydrochl oride) consisting morphine sulfate with a sequestered co re of naltrexone hydrochloride at a ratio of 100:4.18 If morphine sulfate/ naltrexone hydrochloride is crus hed, chewed, or dissolved up to 100% of the sequestered naltrexone is released, reversing the effe cts of morphine, potentially precipitating withdrawal in opioid tolerant individuals, and incr easing the risk of overdose and death.33 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approv al of hydrocodone ER tablets (Hysingla ER \u00ae) was evaluated in an unpublished randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center, 12-week clinical trial in both opioid-experienced and opioid- na\u00efve patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. Patients received either hydrocodone ER 20 to 120 mg tablets or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. There was a statistically significant difference in the week ly average pain scores at week 12 between the hydrocodone ER and placebo groups with a least square mean (standard deviation [SD]) difference of -0.53 to -0.178; P=0.0016). There were also significant improvements in proportion of re sponders, and Patient's Global Impression of Change scores.5,36 The efficacy and safety of buprenorphine buccal film was evaluated in three phase III clinic al trials. However one of the clinical trials, which is cu rrently not published, did not show a significant difference between buprenorphine and placebo.1 The other two studies ev aluated patients who had a diagnosis of chronic low back pain in a randomized withdrawal design. The first study evaluated opioid-na\u00efve patients while the se cond study evaluated opioid-experi enced patients. The double-blind treatment phase for both studies was 12 weeks.1,38,39 In the first study, the increase in mean (standard deviation [SD]) pain intensity score s on the NRS from baseline to week 12 for buprenorphine buccal film (0.94 [1. 85]) was significantly lower than that of patients who received placebo (1.59 [2.04]; P=0.0012).38 The increase in mean (SD) pain intensity scores on the NRS from baseline to week 12 for buprenorphine buccal film was significantly less than that of placebo (0.88 [1.79] versus 1.92 [1.87], respectively; P<0.00001).39 The effectiveness of fentanyl in relieving pain appears to be similar to that of morphine sulfate sustained-release for the treatme nt of cancer and noncancer pain, and chronic lower back pain. Compared to morphine sulfate sustained-releas e, fentanyl transdermal systems appear to be associated with less constipation.49-51 A trial comparing hydrocodone ER capsules to plac ebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain demonstrated hydrocodone ER had a lower mean change from baseline in pain intensity scores compared to placebo at 12 weeks (P=0.008). In addition, t here was a significantly Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 7 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 higher amount of treatment responders in the hy drocodone ER group compared to the placebo group (P<0.001) at the end of treatment, and subject gl obal assessment of medication scores increased from baseline significantly in the hydroco done ER group compared to placebo (P<0.0001).52 In one trial, hydromorphone ER demonstrated greater efficacy in the treatment of lower back pain with regard to reducing pain intensity (P<0.001 ) and pain scores (P<0.01) compared to placebo.53 In a noninferiority analysis of a hydromorphone ER compared to oxycodone ER, two agents provided similar pain relief in the management of osteoarthritic pain.54 Methadone has demonstrated a greater efficacy over placebo for the treatment of nonmalignant neuropathic pain and similar efficacy compared to slow -release morphine sulfate for the treatment of cancer pain.58,59 A trial comparing different long-acting formulat ions of morphine sulfate for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain demon strated that both Avinza\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) and MS Contin\u00ae (morphine sulfate ER) significantly reduced pain from baseline (P 0.05 for both). Both treatments also reduced overall arthritis pain intensity, and achieved comp arable improvements in physical functioning and stiffness. Each treatment signi ficantly improved certain sleep parameters compared to placebo.61 In a crossover trial, morphine sulfate (MS Contin\u00ae) was compared to fentanyl transdermal systems, and more patients preferred fentanyl transdermal syst ems (P<0.001), and reported on average, lower pain intensity scores than morphine sulfate phase (P<0.001).62 Clinical trial data evaluating the combination l ong acting opioid agent morphine/naltrexone is limited. As mentioned previously, this product was recalled by the manufacturer due to not meeting a pre- specified stability requirement durin g routine testing in March 2011.32 Morphine/naltrexone has demonstrated significantly better pain control compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis pain.65 Oxycodone ER (OxyContin\u00ae) has demonstrated significantly greater efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of neuropathic pain and chronic refractory neck pain.66-68 For the treatment of cancer pain, no significant differences were observed between oxycodone ER and morphine sulfate ER in reducing pain intensity. The average number of rescue doses used within a 24 hour period was significantly less with morphine sulfate ER (P=0 .01), and the incidence of nausea and sedation were similar between treatments.69 The FDA-approval of oxycodone an enriched-enrollment, randomized-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel gr oup, study was conducted in patients with persistent, moderate- to-severe chronic lower back pain, with inadequate pain control from their prior therapy (n=740). Following t he titration phase, 389 subjects met the study randomization criteria of adequate analgesia and acceptable to lerability and enter ed the randomized, double-blind maintenance phase. Patients were rando mized at a ratio of 1:1 into a 12-week double- blind maintenance phase with their fixed stable dose of oxycodone ER (Xtampza ER\u00ae or matching placebo. There was a significant difference in pain reduction as assessed by average pain intensity favoring the oxycodone ER group when compared to placebo from randomization baseline to week 12 (0.29 vs. 1.85 ;P<0.0001). 71 Oxymorphone ER has produced similar mean daily pain intensity scores compared to both morphine sulfate and oxycodone ER for the tr eatment of chronic cancer pain. 72,73 The average scheduled daily dose of study drug and average total daily dose decreased after patients crossed over to oxymorphone ER from morphine sulfate or oxycodone ER. No significant changes were observed in visual analog pain scores, quality of life domains, or quality of sleep in any of the treatment groups.72 In another trial, oxymorphone ER demonstrated greate r efficacy for the relief of osteoarthritis pain compared to placebo.74 In a 12-week active comparator and placebo-controlle d trial, significant pain relief was achieved with tapentadol ER compared to placebo (least squares mean difference, - 0.7; 95% CI, -1.04 to -0.33) at week 12. The average pain intensity rating at endpoi nt with oxycodone ER was reduced significantly compared to placebo for the overall maintenance peri od (least squares mean difference vs placebo, - 0.3), but was not significantly lower at week 12 (l east squares mean, -0.3; P values not reported).76 In a, placebo-controlled and active comparator trial in adults with moderate to severe low back pain, improvements in average pain intensity scores occurred with tapentadol ER and oxycodone ER relative to placebo (P<0.001).77 Schwartz et al evaluated tapentadol ER among adults with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The least squares mean change in average pain intensity at week 12 Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 8 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 was 1.4 in the placebo group, indicating a worseni ng in pain intensity, and 0.0 in the tapentadol ER group, indicating no change in pain intensity, (leas t squares mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -1.70 to - 0.92; P<0.001).75 The combination product oxycodone/acetaminophen's efficacy was established in a clinical trial evaluating its effectiveness at treat ing pain over the 48 hours after su rgery. Singla et al concluded that pain, evaluated by the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) score, was significantly higher in the oxycodone/acetaminophen group (P<0.001) throu gh that time period. Mean total pain relief values for oxycodone/APAP XR and placebo from 0 to 48 hours were 91.3 a nd 70.9, respectively, resulting in a treatment difference of 20.5 (95% CI, 11.0 to 30.0; P<0.001). The median time to perceptible pain relief for oxycodone/APAP XR was 33.56 minutes vs 43.63 minutes for placebo (P=0.002). The median times to confirmed pai n relief and meaningful pain relief for the oxycodone/APAP XR group were 47.95 minutes and 92.25 minutes; however, neither of these metrics could be determined for the placebo group (P<0.001). The perc entage of patients reporting at least a 30% reduction in PI after 2 hours was 63.1% for oxyc odone/APAP XR versus 27.2% Methadone is the only long-acting narcotic that is Food and Dr ug Administration-approved for the management of opioid addiction; however, in one study slow-release morphine sulfate demonstrated noninferiority to methadone in terms of completion rate for the treatment of opioid addiction (51 vs 49%).84 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The current clinical guidelines regarding t he use of opioids recognize their established efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. None of the available agents are distinguished from the others in the class, and recommendations for treatment are made for the class as a whole.86-98 o Guidelines published by Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention's (CDC) opioid use in the management of chronic pain recommend physi cians start with immediate-release (IR) opioids and reserve ER formulations for seve re, continuous pain that IR opioids cannot treat.86 o Physicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose and carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering a dose of 50 morphine milligram equivale nts (MME) while avoiding increasing opioid doses to 90 MME unless justified.86 o Optimal analgesic selection w ill depend on the patient's pain inte nsity, any current analgesic therapy, and concomitant medical illness. ER pr oducts are generally similar and selection should be based on clinical or patient-specific factors.87 Other Key Facts:1-19 o Products currently available as a generic include fentanyl patches, hydromorphone ER tablets, methadone (all formulations), morphine ER (all formulations), oxycodone ER tablets and oxymorphone ER tablets. o There are currently several abuse deterrent ER opioids appro ved by the FDA. These ER\u00ae) and hydromorphone ER (Exalgo\u00ae) have also been formulated with abuse deterrent properties, howe ver they are classified as abuse deterrent by the FDA. o All long-acting opioids are pregnancy cat egory C, with the exception of oxycodone. o Only fentanyl transdermal system (age 2 to 17 years) and oxycodone ER tablets (age 11 and older) are approved for use in children o Tapentadol is contraindicated with monoami ne oxidase inhibitors; although, caution should be used when used in combinati on with any long-acting opioid. o Oxymorphone is severe hepatic disease. Therapeutic Class Overview: opioids (long-acting) Page 9 of 12 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 8/2/2016 o Methadone and buprenorphine have been implic ated in QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias, use caution in patients at increased risk of QT prolongation. o Frequency of dosing varies by agent: Buprenorphine patch: once every seven days and morphine/naltrexone (Embeda\u00ae): once or twice daily Morphine ER (MS Contin\u00ae) and all methadone formulations: twice or three times daily All remaining long-acting twice daily o Avinza\u00ae are the with a maximum daily dose. Avinza\u00ae (morphine): max dose of 1,600 mg/day due to the capsules being formulated with fumaric acid, which at that dose has not been shown to be safe and effective and may cause renal toxicity11 Xartemis XR (oxycodone/acetaminophen): ma x dose is limited to four tablets per day, and/or if taking other acetaminophen products, a maximum of 4,000 mg/day19 o Most solid, long-acting opioid formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules) should be swallowed whole and should not be broken, chewed, cut, crushed, or dissolved before swallowing.1-18 Morphine ER capsules (Avinza\u00ae, ER capsules (Xtampza ER\u00ae) can be opened and the pellets sprinkled on applesauce and then swallowed whole.11,12,15,18 Kadian\u00ae pellets can also be placed in water and used through a gastrostomy tube. Xtampza\u00ae may be opened and administered through a gastrostomy or nasogastric tube. Avinza\u00ae, Kadian\u00ae, and Embeda\u00ae pellets should not be used thorough nasogastric tube.

Patients with PRMS also have a continuous decline in function while experiencing occasional attacks. Finally, SPMS begins as RRMS, but as time progresses the attack rate declines and patients experience a gradual deterioration.19 Table 1.

Glatopa \u00ae is considered a biosimilar to reference product Copaxone\u00ae Evidence-based Medicine The safety and efficacy of glat iramer acetate and interferon (IFN ) products are well established. Recent clinical trials have not produced clinically different results compar ed to trials published previously. The FDA-approval of daclizumab was based on the results of two randomized double-blind studies in adults with a diagnosis of relapsing MS (RMS). Both utilized the primary endpoint of annualized relapse rate (ARR). The first study evaluat ed 1,841 patients over 96 to 144 weeks who were randomized to either daclizumab 150 mg every four weeks or to IFN -1a 30 g weekly. Both groups received a placebo matching the other treatment arm. The ARR was significantly reduced in the daclizumab arm (0.216) compared with the IFN -1a group (0.393) representing a relative reduction of 45% (P<0.0001). 2,33 The second study, SELECT, evaluated a total of 621 patients over 52 weeks who were randomized to daclizumab 150 mg every four weeks, daclizumab 300 mg every four weeks or placebo. The ARR was significantly lower in both the daclizumab 150 mg group (0.21) and the daclizumab 300 mg group (0.23) compared to the placebo group (0.46; P<0.001 for both).2,34 In two large, randomized trials with dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily or three times daily compared to placebo, there were st atistically significant reductions in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) with both dimethyl fumarate regimens compared to placebo (P 0.001 for both).37,61 Fox et al also included an open-label glatiramer acetate comp arator group. In a post-hoc analysis, there were significant improvements favoring dimethyl fumarate over glatiramer acetate with regard to ARR (three times daily group only), new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions and new T1 hypointense lesions (three daily group only).61 In the 24-month, placebo-controlled FREEDOMS tria l, treatment with fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25 mg once daily significantly reduced ARR co mpared to placebo (54 and 60%, respectively; P<0.001 for both).38 The FREEDOMS II trial had similar results, with fingolimod providing a lower ARR over 24 months compared to placebo.87 In the 12-month TRANSFORMS trial, fingolimod 0.5 or 1.25 mg once-daily si gnificantly reduced ARR by 52 and 40%, respectively, to -1a 30 12-month TRANSFORMS , patients initially randomized to IM IFN -1a were switched to either dose of fingolimod for 12 additional months and experienced significant reductions in ARR compared to initial treatment with IM IFN -1a. 44 Therapeutic Class Overview: multiple sclerosis agents Page 3 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/3/2016 In the TEMSO trial, treatment with teriflunomide 7 or 14 mg was associated with significantly greater relative reductions in ARR compared to placebo (31.2 and 31.5%. respectively; P<0.001).56 In an unpublished extension study, ARR remained low afte r five years and the adverse event rates were similar to those reported in previous trials.57,58 The TOWER study showed that over one y ear teriflunomide had a lower ARR than placebo.88 The ComiRX trial, evaluat ed the combination of IFN and glatiramer acetate versus IFN -1a alone versus glatiramer acetate alone. A fter three years, the A RR of the combination was not statistically significantly improved to the better of the tw o single-agent arms when adjusting for baseline age. Glatiramer acetate provided statis tically significant greater reductio n in risk of exacerbation compared to interferon by 31%, and the combination group prov ided statistically significant greater reduction in risk of exacerbation compared to interfer on by 25% (P=0.027, P=0.022 respectively).89 Two phase III clinical trials evaluated treatment outcomes with IFN -1a 44 g SC three times weekly and alemtuzumab 12 mg. One trial evaluated a st udy population of treatment-experienced MS patients and the second study eval uated treatment outcomes in tr eatment-naive patients. In both trials, treatment with alemtuzumab resulted in a st atistically significant r eduction in the annualized relapse rate compared to treatment with IFN -1a. Time to onset of six- month disabilit y progression was only significantly delayed in treatment-experience patients.103,104 The safety and efficacy of peginterferon -1a, was established in a single, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Annualized relapse rate was 0.26 in the peginterferon -1a group compared to 0.40 with placebo (P=0.007). This ented a 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P=0.0003). The proportion of patients with a relapse was also significantly lower with the peginterferon -1a group compared to placebo (0.19 vs 0.29; P=0.003). 105 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The approach to treating MS includes: the management of symptoms, treatment of acute relapses, and utilization of dise ase-modifying therapies to redu ce the frequency and severity of relapses, and delay diseas e and disability progression.14,16,19,22 o IFN products or glatiramer acetate are recomme nded as first-line therapy in patients with RRMS.18,19 o The Association of British Neurologists also recommend either of the oral agents as potential first-line options.18 o Due to its adverse effect profile, fingolim od is sometimes recommended as a second-line option.19,20 NICE recommends use of fingolimod only if patients have an unchanged or increased relapse rate, or ongoing severe relaps es compared to the previous year despite treatment with IFN .20 o Consensus guidelines do not recommend a ch ange of therapy in patients positive for neutralizing antibodies who are responding to IF N therapy, noting that neutralizing antibodies disappear with continued treatment in the majority of patients.18,23-25 o A change of therapy may be considered in patients experiencing a suboptimal response or intolerable adverse effects.26,28,29 o Data suggests a significant reduction in re lapse rate and a delay in disease and disability progression in patients switching from IFN to glatiramer acetate therapy or vice versa due to poor response.26,28,29 Other Key Facts: o A biosimilar version of Copaxone\u00ae (glatiramer acetate 20 mg/mL) was recently approved by the FDA and is marked under the trade name Glatopa\u00ae. There are no other generic MS products available, including other strengths of glatiramer acetate.1-14 o The safety and efficacy of retreatment with alemtuzumab after the initial standard treatment cycles remains uncertain. There is no inform ation regarding retreatment in alemtuzumab's FDA-approved label.1 o comparing IFN -1b products (Betaseron\u00ae and Extavia\u00ae) and the drugs are not interchangeable despite Extavia\u00ae being approved with the same active ingredient and registration trials as Betaseron\u00ae.5,6 Therapeutic Class Overview: multiple sclerosis agents Page 4 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/3/2016 o Alemtuzumab must be administered by a healthcare professional. o Alemtuzumab and daclizumab are available only through restricted access programs. Both are associated with causing serious autoimmune disorders. In addition, alemtuzumab has been associated with life threatening infusion reactions as well as increased risk of malignancy. 1,2 References 1. Lemtrada\u00ae [package the Internet].

Page 1 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/31/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Fibric Acid Derivatives Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: The fibric acid derivatives are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR). Activation of PPAR increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein CIII. The resulting decrease in triglycerides (TG) produces an alteration in the size and composition of low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from small, de nse particles to large buoyant particles. There is also an increase in the synthesis of high-densi ty lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as apoprotein AI and AII.1-10 The major action of this class of medica tions is to reduce TG. The fibric acid derivatives can decrease TG by 20 to 50% and incr ease HDL-C by 10 to 35%. They also lower LDL- C by 5 to 20%; however, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C may increase with the use of fibric acid derivatives. 11 Several fenofibrate products are currently available, including micronized and non-micronized formulations. The different fenof ibrate formulations equi valent on a milligram-to-milligram basis. Micronized fenofibrate is more readily absorbed than non-micronized formulations, which allows for a lower daily dose. Fenofibrate (micr onized and non-micronized fo rmulations), fenofibric acid, and gemfibrozil are available generically in at least one dosage form and/or strength.12 Fenofibrate and fenofibric acid are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the adjunctive treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemias, as well as an adjunctive treatment for hypertriglyceridemia. Gemfibrozil is FDA-approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) in select patients.13 Gemfibrozil has demonstrated a reduction in the risk of fatal and no nfatal myocardial infarction (MI) for primary prevention, as well as a reduction in CHD death a nd nonfatal MI and stroke fo r secondary prevention. Clinical trial results demonstrating that the fibric ac id derivatives, as a class, reduce CHD incidence is less robust than that with statin therapy.11 Table 1.

Indicated for therapy in patients with triglycerides 500 mg/dL. Evidence-based Medicine In general, the fibric acid derivatives consistent ly demonstrate greater efficacy compared to placebo in the management of hypercholeste rolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. 14-18 The addition of fibric acid derivatives to other well established lipid lowering agents has been shown to be safe and resulted in additional improvements in lipid profile compared to each drug given as monotherapy.16-28 The five year, placebo-controlled FIELD trial (N=9,975) demonstrated that fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of the combined primary outcome of coronary events (CHD), death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with type 2 diabetes. When individual endpoints were analyzed, fenofibrate significantly reduced nonfatal MI by d ratio [HR], 0.76; P=0.010), CHD mort ality (HR, 1.19; P=0.22) was observed.29 Similar results were observed in the ACCORD trial (N=5,518) which eval uated the efficacy of f enofibrate on reducing the risk of major cardiovascular ev ents in high risk type 2 diabetics.30 In the five year, Helsiniki Heart Study (N=4,081), a primary prevention trial, gemfibrozil demonstrated a significant 34% (P<0.02) reduction in the inci dence of cardiac events but demonstrated no effect on all-cause mortality.31 After 8.5 years of follow up, all-cause mortality was numerically higher with gemfibrozil, but the increase did not meet significance.32 In a secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, there was no difference bet ween gemfibrozil and placebo in the incidence of fatal and nonfatal MI and cardiac death.33 A meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (N=36,489) evaluated fibric acid derivatives for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and demonstrated that treatment tended to increase all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; P=0.08) and was associated with a significant increase in noncardiovascular morta lity (OR, 1.16; P=0.004). No effect of fibric acid derivatives was observed for cardiovascular mortality (OR, 0.98; P= 0.68). When the individual fibric acid derivatives were analyzed, the odds of cardiovascular mortalit y were significantly lower with gemfibrozil (OR, 0.77; P=0.05).34 Therapeutic Class Overview: fibric acid derivatives Page 3 of 5 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 07/31/2016 A second meta-analysis of 18 randomized controll ed trials (N=45,058) demonstrated no effect on all- cause mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.00; P=0.918), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.97; P=0.582) or sudden death (RR, 0.89; P=0.190). An increased risk of noncardiovascular mortality was noted; however, this finding did not reach si gnificance (RR, 1.10; P=0.063).35 Fenofibric acid was added to rosuvastatin in pat ients with chronic kidney disease and it was shown that there was a significantly greater decrease in median percent TGs compared to rosuvastatin alone after eight weeks (P<0.001) and 16 weeks (P<0 .001) along with an increase in HDL-C over the same time periods (P<0.001).36 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Therapeutic lifestyle changes remain an es sential modality in the management of patients with hypercholesterolemia.37-46 o In general, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered first line therapy for decreasing low densit y lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. o Due to increased muscle side effects incl uding rhabdomyolysis, gemfibrozil is not recommended to be used in a combination with statins.43 o Fibric acid derivatives are typically reserved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, or for an is olated low high density lipoprotein cholesterol.37,40 o Fibric acid derivatives can be considered in patients with coronary heart disease who have low levels of LDL-C and atherogenic dyslipidemia, or in combination with a statin in patients who have elevated LDL-C and atherogenic dyslipidemia.37 Since the publication of these guidelines, the FD) requested the discontinuation of the marketing of Trilipix\u00ae indicated as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin to reduce TG and increase HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and CHD (coronary heart disease) or a CHD risk equivalent who are on optimal statin therapy to achi eve their LDL-C goal. This deci sions was based on the FDA's conclusion that the totality of the scientific evi dence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in TG and/or increase in HDL-C levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the ri sk of cardiovascular events. 47 o The National Institute for Health and Clinic al Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend non- routine use of fibrates if intolerant to st atins as monotherapy and recommend against the use of niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and omega-3 fatty acids or any combination of a stains plus either a fibrate, niacin, bile ac id sequestrants, or omega-3 fatty acids for primary or secondary prevention of coronary vascular disease due to lack of evidence.44 Other Key Facts: o Gemfibrozil (Lopid\u00ae) is the only fibric acid derivative approved for reducing the risk of developing coronary heart disease in select patients.10 o Currently, all fibric acid derivatives are av ailable generically in at least one dosage form and/or strength.12 References 1.

Page 1 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Treatments Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: The agents approved for the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) will be the focus of including, alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin, reduce smooth-muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck decreasing lower urinary tract sy mptoms (LUTS) secondary to tamsulosin are selective to the -adrenergic receptors located in the prostate and therefore are only Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) approved for BPH, whereas doxazosin and terazosin also inhibit -adrenergic receptors found in the vasc ular smooth muscle and are additionally indicated for hypertension.1-6 The 5- reductase inhibitors, dutasteride and finasteride, act by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and in turn suppr ess the growth of the prostate. making them appropriate treatment options for LUTS associated wi th overall prostatic enlargement.7,8 Jalyn\u00ae (dutasteride/tamsulosin) is a combination of both an -adrenergic blocker and a 5- reductase inhibitors.9 The final drug approved for use in BPH is t he phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, tadalafil. The exact mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms is unknown.10 Note that even though doxazosin and terazosin are FDA-approved for use in the treatment of hypertension, tadalafil is FDA-approved for use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and pu lmonary arterial hypertension, and finasteride is FDA-approved for alopecia, they are not included in this review. Jalyn\u00ae (dutasteride/tamsulosin) is a combination of both an -adrenergic blocker and a 5- reductase inhibitors.9 Another drug approved for use in BPH is the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibito r, tadalafil. The exact mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms is unknown.10 Although doxazosin and terazosin are FDA-approved for use in the treatment of hypertension, tadalafil is FDA-approved for use in the tr eatment of erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension, and finasteri de is FDA-approved for alopecia, they are not included in this review. Clinical manifestations of BPH include LUTS (fre quency of urination, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency, and weak urinary stream). The appearance and prog ression of symptoms is usually slow, over a couple of years, with a poor correlation between symptoms and the presence of an enlarged prostate on rectal exam. 11 Disease prevalence and the occurrenc e of symptoms are age dependent, with an initial onset of disease occurring patients greater than 50 years of age.11 Current treatment guidelines acknowledge that not all men with histological ev idence of BPH will develop bothersome LUTS and not all patients with BPH and LUTS actually have pr ostate enlargement, one of the main features of symptomatic disease. Additionally, prostate enlargement may exist in the absence of LUTS.12-13 Table 1.

In men with an enlarged prostate. Evidence-based Medicine 15-67 FDA-approval of silodosin was based on two clin ical trials where it was compared to placebo and demonstrated its efficacy in decreasing the In ternational Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and improving general quality of life scores. In a pooled analysis of these two clinical trials, the mean change in total IPSS at baseline was -6.40 (\u00b16.63) and -3.50 (\u00b15. 84) for the silodosin and placebo groups, respectively with an adjusted mean difference reported as -2.8 (P<0.0001). The maximum urinary flow rate (Q max) at endpoint was 2.6 mL/second (standard deviation [SD]\u00b14.43) in the silodosin group and 1.5 mL/ second (SD\u00b14.36) in the place bo group; corresponding to an adjusted mean group difference of 1.0 mL/ second (P=0.0007).16 The safety and efficacy of tadalafil for BPH has been evaluated in multiple studies. These studies. Tadalafil consistently showed si gnificantly better improvement in IPSS compared to placebo.18-25 One study evaluated men with BPH who had comorbid erec tile dysfunction. Tadal afil was associated with statistically significant improvement s in both internation index of erec tile function (IIEF) scores and total IPSS (P<0.001 for both).25 Studies comparing the -adrenergic blocking agents to each. Although some trials have suggested superiority one agent over another, most studies , have tended toward non-inferiority within the - blockers related to reducing IPSS.26-46 o A Cochrane review has evaluated tamsulosin in comparison to other -adrenergic blocking agents. It was concluded that tamsulosin was as effective as other -adrenergic blockers in improving LUTS and urinary flow rates. Dizzines s, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation occurred Therapeutic Class Overview: benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments Page 3 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 significantly more frequently than placebo and withdrawal was reported more often with higher doses of tamsulosin. Additionally, terazo sin use was associated with a higher rate of discontinuation than low dose tamsulosin.37 o A second Cochrane review evaluated terazosin to other blockers, finasteride alone or in combination with terazosin and placebo. Terazosin was comparable to tamsulosin in improving IPSS (40% vs and more vs 20%) placebo (38% vs 17%) in American Urol ogical Association Symptom Score (AUA-SS). Peak urinary flow rates were similar among blockers and higher with terazosin (22%) over finasteride (15%) and placebo (11%).38 o A of -adrenergic blocking agents tamsulosin, terazosin) in men with LUTS suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction did not identify any difference among agents in improving total urinary symptom scores or Q max. However, alfuzosin and tamsulosin were better tolerated than doxazosin and terazosin.39 Similar to the -blocking agents, the 5- reductase inhibitors have been compared to one another in a number of clinical trials, with mixed results. Dutast eride was shown to be non-inferior to finasteride for reducing prostate volume, post- void volume, and American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUA-SS).47-50 Head-to-head trials between 5- reductase inhibitors and blockers have also been conducted.51-62 o When compared to finasteride, tamsulosin showed comparable effect on urinary symptom scores at study end point (24 weeks and 1 year)51,52, however a benefit was found with tamsulosin at earlier assessment (4 weeks) in both IPSS and Q max.51 o Tamsulosin in combination with dutasteride has been found to be associated with a greater benefit in IPSS and Q max than each agent alone. As expected tamsulosin use resulted in a much lower decrease in prostate volume as compared to combination therapy (0.00%\u00b10.84% and 26.90%\u00b10.62%, respectively; P<0.001).53, o Four large, long-term trials comparing doxazosin, finasteride, each agent alone and in combination, and placebo.58-61 Rates of nocturia were signific antly reduced with monotherapy and combination treatment compared to placebo.59 o Men with moderate to enlarged prostate gland s benefited most from combination therapy (P<0.05), however doxazosin therapy alone was as effective as combination therapy for decreasing the risk of progression in men without an enlarged prostate.60 o Doxazosin monotherapy and in combination with finasteride was associated with significantly greater improvements in Q max and IPSS. Differences between finasteride al one and placebo did not reach statistical significane.61 o Terazosin use alone and in combination with finasteride was associated with significantly greater reductions in symptom sc ores and greater increases in Q max compared to finasteride monotherapy or placebo. Differences among combination therapy and terazosin monotherapy did not reach statistical signific ance, nor did difference between finasteride and placebo.62 Studies have been conducted evaluating the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with two agents from different classes.63-66 o A retrospective analysis showed that co mbination therapy with finasteride and an -blocking agent significantly improved IPSS in patient s with severe BPH symptoms, but was not statistically different from monot herapy in the same population.63 o A meta-analysis conducted by Gacci et al found that a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and blocker combinati on therapy significantly impr oved IPSS, IIEF score and Q max alone (P<0.05, P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively).64 o Tadalafil 5 mg once daily coadministered with finasteride 5 mg for 12 weeks resulted in an IPSS total score improvement that was signi ficantly better than finasteride/placebo (P=0.001).66 A systematic review of alfuzosin studies show ed a greater improvement in the primary outcome (IPSS) over placebo (weighted mean difference, -1.8 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.49 to other -blockers (doxazosin, tamsulosin), doxazosin use was associated with the most favor able change from baseline IPSS. Al fuzosin alone and in combination with finasteride showed a greater improvement in LUTS compared to finasteride alone. Therapeutic Class Overview: benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments Page 4 of 7 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines:12,13 o Watchful waiting is recommended for mild sy mptoms of BPH (AUA symptom score <8) and patients with moderate or severe symptoms (AUA symptom score 8) who are not bothered by their symptoms.12,13 o blockers are considered first line; their rapid onset of action, good efficacy, and low rate and severity of adverse events, followed by a 5- reductase inhibitor The older, less costly, generic -blockers remain reasonable treatment choices. o PDE-5 inhibitors reduce moderate-to-severe (storage and voiding) LUTS in men with or without erectile dysfunction.13. o Combination therapy is an appropriate and effective treatment for patients with LUTS associated with demonstrable prostatic enlargement based on volume measurement, prostate specific antigen level as a proxy fo r volume, and/or enlargement on digital rectal exam.12 Other currently available generically. o Finasteride (Propecia\u00ae) is also available as a 1 mg tabl et for the treatment of alopecia. Tadalafil (Adcirca\u00ae) is available as a 20 mg tablet for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.14 o 5- reductase inhibitors are pregnancy categor y X; women who are pregnant or who could be pregnant should avoid handling dutasteride and du tasteride/tamsulosin capsules along with tamsulosin should all be swallowed whole and not crushed, chewed, or cut. Doxazosin immediate-release, finaste ride, and tadalafil tablets may be crushed. Silodosin capsules can be opened and the powder sprinkled on applesauce. References 1.

Page 1 of 10 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/27/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Insulins Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: This review will focus on the antidiabet ic insulins, incl uding human insulin products and synthetic insulin analogs.1-18 Insulin products are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1 and type 2. DM is a group of metabolic disorders with types 1 and 2 being the broadest categories. All categories of DM ultimately results in hyperglycemia, but the etiol ogies for each are distinct and may include reduced insulin secretion, decreased gl ucose utilization, or increased glucose production. Due to the metabolic dysregulation of DM, secondary pathophysiol ogic changes in multiple organ systems occur. Examples of severe complications that may occur include end-stage renal disease (ESRD), nontraumatic lower extremity amputation, and adult bl indness. Additionally, it also predisposes the patient to cardiovascular disease.19 Overall, there are a variety of oral and injectable antidiabetic agents currently available to treat diabetes. Availabl e insulin products are summarized in Table 1. Insulin therapy is usually administered by subc utaneous injection, which allows for prolonged absorption and less pain compared to intramuscular injection. 1-18,20 Additionally, regular insulin is also formulated as an inhalation.4 At least one formulation of all insulin products are supplied in multidose vials, with the exception of insulin degludec.1-18 Inhaled insulin powder is formulated in disposable, single-use cartridges, known as Technosphere\u00ae which provided a more efficient inhalation device than what has been used in the past.4 Another inhaled formulation of regular insulin, Exubera\u00ae, was previously FDA-approved; however , this agent was removed from the market in 2007 due to low patient and provider acceptance.21 All insulin products have at least one formulation with a concentration of 100 units/mL (U-100). Severa l agents are also formulated with a higher concentration, regular insulin as 500 units/mL (U-500; Humulin\u00ae R (Humalog U- 200\u00ae).1-18 Table 1.

Generally, t hese agents have not been studied for the treatment of type 2 diabet es in pediatric patients. Additionally, some agents may carry an indica tion for use in pediatric pati ents, but have never been studie d in that population. Humulin \u00ae R U-500 only Evidence-based Medicine There are numerous clinical trials demonstrating t he safety and efficacy of insulin products in the management of diabetes type 1 and 2.22-157 Of note, only head-to-head or active-comparator trials have been included as insulin is a well-established treatment. The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec was eval uated in the BEGIN clinical trial program. This included multiple 26-week and 52-week clinical tria ls with several trials being extended to 78 or 104 weeks in order to gather additional long-term safety and efficacy data. Insulin degludec once-daily injection was evaluated in both insulin-na\u00efve and insulin-experienced adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes who had inadequate blood su gar control at trial entry.13,47-49,75-81 o Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction was in line wi th reductions achieved with insulin glargine and insulin detemir (-0.3 to -0.6% decrease from baseline in type 1 DM and -1.0% to -1.5% decrease from baseline in type 2 DM).13,47-49,75-81 o In addition, the agent was associated with a lo wer risk of hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine.13,47-49,75-81 o A meta-analysis of four of these trails dem onstrated a lower rate of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 and 2 DM.82 o A concentrated formulation of insulin deglud ec (200 units/mL) was compared to the standard formulation of insulin glargine with similar results.83 The safety and efficacy of inhaled regular insulin (Afrezza\u00ae) in both diabetes type 1 and type 2. Clinical trials were 24 weeks each.4,156,157 o For type 1 diabetes, inhaled regular insulin was non-inferior to insulin aspart for mean reduction in HbA 1c. However, it provided less HbA 1c reduction than insulin aspart (-0.4% vs - 0.21%). On the other hand, ther e was a reduction in the rate of hypoglycemia (9.8 vs 14.0 events per subject month; P<0. 0001) and ( 0.39 kg vs 0.93 kg; P=0.0102) with inhaled regular insulin. o For type 2 diabetes, mean reduction in HbA 1c was significantly greater in the insulin group compared to the placebo gr oup (-0.82% vs -0.42%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57 to and efficacy of insulin glargine U-300 (Toujeo\u00ae) was evaluated in four clinical trials. Each study compared insulin glargine U-300 to insulin glargine U-100 in an open label design over 26 weeks of therapy. o In all studies, insulin glargine U-300 was shown to be non-inferior to insulin glargine U-100. Additionally, the dose of basal glargine insulin required was higher in all studies for U-300 (requiring 11% to 17.5% more units). Generally, both U-100 and U-300 had similar rates of adverse events, including hypoglycemia and all three studies showed similar changes in weight. 12,84-86 Differences in safety and efficacy of insulin preparations are modest with slightly better improvement in in HbA 1c with the rapid-acting analogues compared to regular insulin. 45,46 Long-acting insulin analogs have been shown to be at least as effective as NPH insulin in HbA 1c reduction, with some studies showing a signific ant improvement associat ed with the long-acting insulin analogs compared with NPH insulin with similar rates of side effects.68,115,116,118 Therapeutic Class Overview: insulins Page 4 of 10 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/27/2016 When comparing the long-acting analogs head- to-head, several trials have demonstrated non- inferiority between the products in the same outcomes when used in the management of type 1 diabetes and as add-on therapy in type 2 diabetics.50,51,88-90 When comparing the long-acting analogs head- to-head, several trials have demonstrated non- inferiority between the products in the same outcomes when used in the management of type 1 diabetes and as add-on therapy in type 2 diabetics.50,51,88-90 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines:158-168 o The goal of treatment for both type 1 and type 2 DM is to control hyperglycemia and reduce the risk of long-term complications. o For patients with type 1 DM, insulin therapy is required due to pathogene sis of the disease. The standard approach to therapy is a regimen that includes long-acting basal insulin and rapid-acting prandial insulin tailored to the individual. o For type 2 DM, there are many more options fo r therapy, including the insulin products, oral antidiabetic agents, and other injectable antidiabetic agents. Metformin remains the cornerstone of most antidiabetic treatment regimens. Patients with a high HbA 1c will likely require combination or triple therapy in order to achieve glycemic goals. At this time, uniform recommendations on the best agent to be combined with metformin cannot be made; therefore, adv antages and disadvantages of specific antidiabetic agents for each patient should be considered. o For both conditions, the trend in treatment is toward a patient-centered approach focusing on patient needs, preferences and tolerances, individualized treatment, and flexibility in the choice of drugs, the over-ri ding goal being to improve glycemic control while minimizing adverse effects. Other Key Facts:1-18 o Insulin therapy is usually administered by s ubcutaneous injection. Regular insulin is also formulated as an inhalation. At least one formul ation of all insulin products are supplied in multidose vials with only regular insulin not being formulated in a prefilled pen or syringe.1-18 o All insulin products have at least one formulation with a concentration of 100 units/mL.1-18 o A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is required for this inhaled regular insulin and includes requirements for patient evaluation and testing prior to initiating therapy in order to ensure appropriate patient selection (e.g., avoiding this agent in patients with underlying chronic lung disease). o There are currently no generic formulations of insulin; however, there are several products available over-the-counter.

Page 1 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/16/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: The anticonvulsants class encompasses over 20 different chemical entities including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins , succinimides, and miscellaneous anticonvulsants. These agents are Food and Drug Administration (F DA)-approved for the prevention and/or treatment of various seizure disorders either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. The goals of epilepsy management are to control seizures, avoid treatment si de effects and maintain or restore patients' quality of life. Anticonvulsants work by va rious mechanisms of action to achiev e these treatment goals, often by stabilizing neuronal membranes in the brain to reduce seizure activity and to elevate the seizure threshold. Some anticonvulsants are also FDA-app roved for the prevention of migraines and the management of bipolar disorder, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, along with other non-seizure conditions. 1,2 The specific FDA-approved indications for each of these agents are outlined in Table 1.3-49 Seizure disorders can be organized into three major ca tegories: generalized seizures, focal seizures, and unknown. Generalized seizures are subdivided into tonic-clonic (in any combination), absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic, and atonic seizures types. Absence seizur es are further divided into typical, atypical, and absence with special features (myocl onic absence, eyelid myoclonia) while myoc lonic, myoclonic atonic, and mycolonic. Epileptic spasms fall into the unknown seizure category. However, based on FDA- approved labeling, seizures are more commonly referred to as partial (or fo cal) seizures and generalized tonic-clinical seizures.50 Pharmacologic management of epilepsy should be in dividualized, and focused on controlling seizures, avoiding treatment-related adverse events and maintaining or restoring quality of life. Prior to 1990, six major antiepileptic drugs were available for the tr eatment of various forms of epilepsy, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone (metabolized to phenobarbital) and valproic acid. Over the past two decades, many new chemical entities or formulations have become available in the United States. Some advantages of the newer antiepileptic drugs include more favorable adverse event profile, drug interact ion profiles and ability to treat without the requirement of serum concentration monitoring. 51-53 Anticonvulsants are primarily used for their FDA-approved indications; however, in instances of severe and refractory seiz ure disorders, anticonvulsants may be used off-label for seizure types that are non-FDA approved. Cu rrently there are several generic anticonvulsants available, and at least one generic agent is av ailable within each anticonvulsant subclass.1 Many anticonvulsants contained within this class review, such as pregabalin and lacosamide, are controlled substances. Anticonvulsants are available in a varity of formulations, which include: immediate release, delayed-release, and extended-release capsules or tablets; sprinkle ules; orally disintegrating tablets; solutions or suspensions; and injections.3-49 Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine The safety and efficacy of anticonvulsants, as monotherapy and as adjunct therapy, have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials for their resp ective FDA-approved indications. Selected trials have evaluated the use of anticonvuls ants for the treatment of various seizures disorders as well as non-seizure disorders.54-198 The safety and efficacy of Elepsia XR\u00ae (levetiracetam extended-releas e tablets) was established based on the clinical trials used to approve Keppra ER\u00ae (levetiracetam ext ended-release tablets).20,49 Hancock et al conducted a meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials which included infants and children with infantile spasms. Treatment wi th vigabatrin was associated with a complete cessation of spasms in 7/20 (35%) patients compar ed to 2/20 (10%) patients treated with placebo. A >70% reduction in the number of spasms was reported in 40% of patients treated with vigabatrin compared to 15% of patients treated with placebo.55 Another meta-analysis by Hancock et al included trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of felbamate, lamotrigine, rufinamide and topirama te in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). While all of these agents demonstrated some efficacy, the optimum treatment of LGS remained uncertain as no single drug was highly effi cacious. Felbamate, lamotrigine, rufinamide and topiramate may be helpful add-on therapy.145 The results of a study by Ng et al demonstrat ed that the mean percent reduction in weekly drop seizures was 41.2% with clobaza m 0.25 to 12.1% for placebo.125 In a study by Porter et al, treatment with ez ogabine 600, 900 and 1,200 mg reduced the total monthly seizure frequency from baseline by 23, 29 and 35% compared to 13% with placebo (P<0.001 for all).55 In a second study of patients with drug-resis tant partial epilepsy, ezogabine 1,200 mg daily reduced the total monthly seizure frequency from bas eline by 44.3% compared to 17.5% with placebo (P<0.001).70 Perampanel is approved as adjunctive therapy in patients with partial onset seizures. In one study perampanel 8 or 12 mg significantly reduced seizure frequency compared to placebo (P=0.0261 and P=0.0158 for 8 and 12 mg, respectively); however , there was no significant difference in the Therapeutic Class Overview: anticonvulsants Page 8 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/16/2016 proportion of patients who achieved a seizure redu ction >50% from baseline compared to the placebo group.87 Similar results were reported in a second study (P<0.001 and P=0.011 for 8 and 12 mg, respectively); however, more patients treated wi th perampanel 8 or 12 mg had a reduced seizure frequency >50% from baseline compared to placebo (P=0.002 and P<0.001 for 8 and 12 mg, respectively).88 In a third study, treatment with perampanel 4 or 8 mg significantly reduced seizure frequency compared to placebo (P=0.003 and P<0.001 for 4 mg and 8 mg, respectively). Moreover, a greater proportion of patients tr eated with perampanel 4 or 8 mg achieved a reduction in seizure frequency >50% from baseline compared to pl acebo (P=0.013 and P<0.001 for 4 and 8 mg, evaluated in three double-bli nd, multi-center, randomiz placebo-controlled trials. Each of these trials comp ared adjunctive treatment with eslicarbazepine to placebo in patients who were currently receiving one to three anti-epilept ic drugs. In the first and second published trials, the investigators compared eslic arbazepine at a dose of 400, 800 and 1,200 mg once daily to placebo for 12 weeks.64,65 In a pooled analysis of the three studies (third trial has not been published), the primary endpoint of seizure frequency per four weeks was 7.7 in the placebo group (N=406) compared to 7.3 with eslicarbazepine 400 mg (N=185; P=0.8136), 6.1 with 800 mg (N=375; P=0.0001) and 5.7 with 1,200 mg (N=352; P<0.0001 ). The proportion of patients who achieved a seizure reduction of at least 50% from baseline was 20.9% in the placebo group compared to 22.2% with eslicarbazepine 400 mg, 32.3% with 800 mg and mg.64-66 double-blind, trial compared adjunctive treatment with to placebo in patients who were currently receivi ng one to two anti-epileptic drugs. Investigators compared eslicarbazepine at a dose of 800 and 1,200 mg once daily to placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of seizure frequency per four we eks was 7.3 in the placebo group (N=88) compared to 5.7 with eslicarbazepine 800 mg (N=85; P=0.048 ) and 5.5 with 1,200 mg (N=80; P=0.021). The proportion of patients who achieved a seizure reduction of at least 50% from baseline was 22.6% in the placebo group compared to 34.5% with eslicarb azepine 800 mg (P=0.106) and 37.7% with 1,200 mg (P=0.020). 67 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o The 2012 National Institute for Clinical Ex cellence guideline recommends carbamazepine and lamotrigine as first-line treatment of ch ildren, young people, and adults with newly diagnosed focal seizures (partial seizures). Levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine or sodium valproate should be offered if first-line t herapies prove inadequate, and adjunctive therapy should be considered if a second well-tolerated antiepileptic also proves inadequate. Sodium valproate is recommended first-line for the tr eatment of children, young people, and adults with newly diagnosed generalized tonic-clonic focal seizures. Lamotrigine should be offered if sodium valproate proves inadequate, and carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine should tiracetam, sodium valproate, topiramate should be offered to all patients if first-line therapies are inadequate.199 o Vigabatrin (oral solution) is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the management of infantile spasm. According to the 2012 American Academy of Neurology medical management of infantile spasms guideline, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of agents other than adrenocorticotrop ic hormone and vigabatrin. Evidence suggests that adrenocorticotropic hormone may be pr management of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. Sodium va lproate is recognized as first-line, with lamotrigine recommended as adjunctive therapy if needed.199 o Treatment guidelines recommend valproat e and carbamazepine as potential beneficial options for the management of adults with a m anic or mixed bipolar episode. Lamotrigine, topiramate, or gabapentin are unlikely beneficial in this clinical situation and oxcarbazepine may be considered for treatment. With regard to bipolar depression in adults, lamotrigine should be considered as a potential first-line option, and patients who do not respond to initial monotherapy should receive comb ination therapy with lithium.201-205 Therapeutic Class Overview: anticonvulsants Page 9 of 15 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/16/2016 o Divalproex, topiramate and valproic acid ar e FDA-approved for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches, and all should be offered for migr aine prevention according to the 2012 guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology/American Headache Society. Furthermore, carbamazepine may be considered for migraine prevention as it is a possibly effective treatment, and lamotrigine is ineffective.206 o According to the American Academy of Neurol ogy, anticonvulsants, ant dinitrate spray, and lidocaine patch) are potential treatment options for painful di abetic neuropathy. If clinically appropriate, pregabalin should be offered for treatment. Gabapentin and sodium valproate are other anticonvulsants that should be considered for treatment.207 o According to the American Academy of Neurol ogy, first-line therapies for the management depressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and lidocaine. At this time the use of t hese therapies for long-term management remains uncertain.208 o The use of anticonvulsants in the management of fibromyalgia is not addressed in the European League Against Rheumatism guidelines.209 Other Key Facts: o The majority of anticonvulsants are available in a generic formulation, and there is at least one generic agent available with in each pharmacologic class. o Clobazam was approved by the FDA in 2011; however, this agent has been available internationally for several years for the treatment of anxiety and epilepsy. o Ezogabine has a unique mechanism of action in that it may act as an anticonvulsant by reducing excitability through the stabilization of neuronal potas sium channels \"open\" position.35 o Perampanel is a first-in-class anticonvulsant t hat works as a highly selective, non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist.210 o The most recently FDA-approved anticonvulsant, eslicarbazepine, provides for another treatment option for patients wi th partial-onset seizures.

These agents come from a variety of drug classes and are summarized in Table 1.1-27 ADHD is a common psychiatric disorder often diagnosed du ring childhood; however, children with ADHD may continue to manifest symptoms into adulthood.28,29 The core symptoms of ADHD utilized in the diagnosis of the disorder include hyperactiv ity, impulsivity and inattention. Th ere are three subtypes of ADHD, a predominantly inattentive subtype, a predominantly hy peractive-impulsive subtype and a combined subtype in which both symptoms are displayed.28,29 Untreated, or undertreated, ADHD is associated with adverse sequelae, including delinquent behavior, antisocial personality traits, substance abuse and other comorbidities29. There are several central nervou s system agents that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of ADHD, including the cerebral stimulants (amphetamines and to the potential for abuse, the cerebral stimulant agents are classified as Schedule II controlled substances.1-24 Atomoxetine, clonidine extended-release and gu anfacine substances.25-27 Clonidine and guanfacine extended-release fo rmulations are approved for use as both adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications and as monotherapy.26,27 Most ADHD agents and stimulants are currently available generically.

The selection of therapy should be based on comorbid conditions, adverse event profiles, compliance issues, risk of drug diversion and patient/parent preference.33 Stimulants, particularly methylphenidate, are recommended as first-line therapy in adult patients with ADHD.30,34 Consensus guidelines also list theses agents as options in the treatment of narcolepsy.35-37 Table 1.

Page 1 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Oral Atypical (Second-Generation) Antipsychotics Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary : This overview will focus on the atypical antipsychotics, which are also known as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs).1-16 While several atypical antipsychotics ar e formulated as long-acting injections, these formulations will not be cover ed in this review. Anti psychotic medications have been used for over fifty years to treat schizophrenia and a variety of other psychiatric disorders.17 Schizophrenia is believed to be caused by an increase in the cerebral activity of dopamine D 2 in the mesolimbic and/or mesocortical regions of the brain. Antipsychotic medicati ons exert their effect in part by blocking D 2 receptors. It is the blockade of these receptors in t he mesolimbic pathway that is believed to contribute to desired antipsychotic effects, especially improvement of positive symptoms associated with the disorder.18 In addition to blocking D 2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, FGAs also block D 2 receptors in the mesocortical, tuberoinfundibular, and nigrostriatal pathways.18 D2 blockade in these other pathways is thought to be responsible for the hy perprolactinemia and extr apyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with this class.19 FGAs may be characterized according to their affinity for the D 2 receptor. Low potency antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine, are more sedating and associated with a higher incidence of anticholinergic side effects. Fl uphenazine, ipsychotics that are less sedatin g but associated with a higher incidence of EPS. The medium potency antipsychotics (loxapine, molindone, and perphenazine) possess a moderate risk of EPS and anticholinergic side effects.20 With the exception of pimozide, all FGAs are indicated for use in the treatment of schizophrenia. FGAs are effective in the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whic h include agitation, aggression, delusions, and hallucinations. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia which include avolition, anhedonia, alogia, affective flattening, and social withdrawal, do not respond as we ll to this antipsychotic class.19 Pimozide is indicated only for the suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's disorder. The term \"atypical antipsychotic\" was introduced in 1989 when clozapine was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Originally, this te rm referred to an antipsychotic with a low risk of EPS. 18 As a class, SGAs or atypical antipsychotics are more selective in targeting the mesolimbic D 2 pathway. They also block or par tially block serotonin (5-HT) 2A and 5-HT 1A receptors and have a greater affinity for 5-HT 2 receptors than D 2 receptors.18,20 These differences in neuropharmacologic activity are associated with a lower risk of EPS and tardive dyskin esia; the risks vary with the specificity of each agent for D 2 and serotonin receptors.18,20 Atypical antipsychotics have a more favorable outcome in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.18 The SGAs are comprised of nine separate chemical entities, each with a unique neuropharma cologic and adverse event profile, mechanism of action, and chemical structure. The SGAs in some respects the SGAs are safer and better tolerated than t he FGAs, they are still associated with a number of serious risks and side effects. For this reason, the FDA has required various warnings to be inserted in the manufacturers' pr oduct information for these agents. All agents have a black box waring regarding an increased risk of death when used in the treatment of psychosis and behavioral problems in elderly patients with dementia. Most of the deaths that prompted the addition of the warning were due to cardiac-related events (e .g., heart failure or sudden death) or infection. 21 Of note, atypical antipsychotics are not FDA-approved for this indication. With the exception of pimavanserin, all atypical antipsychotics bear a warnin g that alerts prescribers and pati ents to brexpiprazole, lura sidone and quetiapine carry box warning regarding suicidality and antidepressant drugs.1,3,9,13,14 Ziprasidone also has a warning concerning QTc interval prolongation; however, all of the SGAs can increase the QTc interval to some degree.16 Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 2 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Due to the potential side-effect risks associated with these medications, any off-label use deserves close attention. Data published in peer-rev iewed journals and in national and international guidelines support the use of SGAs as a treatment option for certain o ff-label uses. In many of these scenarios, SGAs are reserved for patients who are refractory to ot her first-line treatment modalities, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and used in adjuncti on to mainstream therapies, as part of a multimodal approach. Over the past 20 years, antipsychotic use in child ren and adolescents has grown. In the United States, the frequency of prescribing an antipsychotic agent in creased from 8.6 per 1000 children in 1996 to 39.4 per 1000 children in 2002. According to a survey of na tional trends in the outpati ent use of antipsychotics in children and adolescents, only 14.2% of antipsych otic prescriptions in children were for patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders. 24 Indications commonly associated with antipsychotic prescribing in pediatric patients include psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, aggressive and disruptive behavior, and tic disorders. Off-label indications with limited avail able evidence for the use of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents include autistic spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. At this time, risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for the management of children and adolescents with autism ( aged 5 to 16 and 6 to 17 years, respectively). Moreover, the following agents are indicated for the treatment of schizo FDA-approved for the treat ment of manic or mixed bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents. None of the other available at ypical antipsychotic agents are currently indicated for use in pediatric patients. 1-16 Concerns have also been raised about the risks of combination therapy with the antipsychotics, which can multiply the risks of dangerous adverse events. The practice of polypharmacy is not supported by well-designed clinical trials published in the peer-revi ewed literature. However, national and international consensus guidelines consider this approach in patients with treatment-refractory illness. Table 1.

Evidence-based Medicine The Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE ) was a large, multi-center study initiated by the National Institut e of Mental Health to examine t he effectiveness of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) compared to first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in patients with chronic schizophrenia.48-50 Among the unexpected outcomes was the fi nding that, with the exception of clozapine, the SGAs did not separate out as robustly from the FGAs with respect to overall efficacy and times to treatment discontinuation. o Due to relatively high discontinuation rates across all treatment arms, potential biases regarding optimal dosing of individual drugs, and clear differences in treatment-emergent side effect profiles, the implications of CATIE are subject to interpretati on which may preclude definitive guidance in developing pharmacotherapy guidelines for patients with schizophrenia as a whole. The role of the SGAs has been clearly establis hed in the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (and, in the case of arip iprazole, quetiapine extended-release and olanzapine/fluoxetine combination therapy, treatment of majo r depressive disorder). Meta-analyses evaluating the roles of available atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia suggest that all agents are significantly more effective than placebo. 51-63,75-79 The trends for respective efficacy suggest that clozapine is the most effective agent in the class, followed by olanzapine and risperidone. Aripiprazole tended to exhibit lower effica cy than the other agents. 51- 63,75-79 Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 6 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 A meta-analysis in adult patients with bipolar disorder found risperidone to be the most effective treatment option (taking into accoun t both efficacy and tolerability).75 The next best treatment options, in order of decreased efficacy, were olanzapine, gabapentin were found to be less effective than placebo. In the management of major depressive disord er, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and risperidone augmentation therapies were associated with improved outcomes.84 The efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated by two pivotal multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled six week trials, VECTOR and BEACON.29,30 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PAN SS) scores were significantly improved with brexpiprazole when compared to placebo. Trea brexpiprazole 2 mg, 4 mg, and 4 mg respectively.29,30 The efficacy of cariprazine for the treatment of schizophrenia was established in three, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In each study, the primary endpoint was change from ba seline in PANSS total score at the end of week six.4,35,36 There was a significant improvement in PAN SS when each fixed-dose or flexable-dose range cariprazine group was compared to placebo (P value varies; all significant when reported).4,35,36 The efficacy of cariprazine in the acute treatment of bipolar mania was established in three, three- week placebo-controlled trials in patients with a di agnosis of bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features. In each study, the primary endpoint was decrease from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score at the end of week three.4,69,70 In the first study, there was a demonstrated improvement with cari prazine dose groups (3 to 6 mg/day or 6 to 12 mg/day) compared to placebo on the YMRS total sc ore (-P<0.05 for both comparisons). However, the 6 to 12 mg/day dose group showed no additional advantage.4,69 In the second study, there was a demonstrated improvement with cariprazine (3 to 12 mg/day) compared to placebo on the YMRS total score (15.0 vs. -8.9, respectively; P<0.05).4 In the third study, cariprazine (3 to 12 mg/day) was superior to placebo on the YMRS total scor e (19.6 vs. -15.3, respectively; P<0.05).4,70 The efficacy of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults has been evaluated in four, published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled, and active-controlled (haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine) ranging in duration from six weeks to one year31-34. The efficacy and safety of asenapine in the treatment of manic or mixed bipolar I disorder were evaluated in five placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (olanzapine) studies in adult patients, with or without psychotic features.64-68 o In a direct-comparison study, asenapine was less effective than olanzapine in terms of changes from baseline in PANSS and Clinical Global Impression-Severit y of Illness (CGI-S) scores.34 Study discontinuation due to inadequate ef ficacy was noted in 14% of patients receiving olanzapine compared to 25% of patient s in the asenapine group. Mean weight gain was 0.9 kg with asenapine and 4.2 kg with olanzapine.34 In another study, clinically significant weight gain was noted in 17% of patients rece iving risperidone and 9% of patients in the asenapine group.31 o In a pooled analysis of patients experiencing bipolar mania, asenapine and olanzapine were comparable in terms of reduction from baseli ne in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores at week-52 of therapy.68 o A meta-analysis of various antimanic ther apy options, found that asenapine was associated with a statistically signific ant improvement in YMRS scores from baseline compared to placebo (mean difference, -0.30; -0.53 to -0.07) , though it was to olanzapine (0.22; 0.08 to 0.37).75 Iloperidone has been studied as monotherapy for t he treatment of adult patients with an acute or subacute exacerbation of schizophrenia. o Three six-week, randomized, double-blind, pl and active comparator (risperidone and haloperidol)-controlled studies found iloperidone to be significantly more effective than placebo.39 Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 7 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 o One four-week, placebo- and active- compar ator (ziprasidone)-controlled found a significant improvement in PANSS scores with iloperidone therapy compared to placebo.38 Lurasidone has been investigated for the treatment of adult patients with acute and chronic symptoms of schizophrenia in two six-week, placebo-controlled studies and two 21-day studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of lurasidone 120 mg once daily with ziprasidone 80 mg twice daily.44-47 o Lurasidone and ziprasidone were comparable in terms of reduction in total PANSS, PANSS positive symptom, PANSS general symptom, CGI- S scores and several cognition scales.41-42 In addition, both drugs were comparable in term s of rates of discontinuation for any reason rate and discontinuation due to adverse events.45,46 Both therapies were associated with a small weight loss from baseline and neither therapy was associated with a clinically significant ECG abnormality. o Of note, lurasidone was more effective in improving negative symptom PANSS scores compared to ziprasidone ( P=0.046). 46 The safety and efficacy of pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis was established in a single, six-week, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial in 185 patients. Patients in the pima vanserin group experienced a greater decrease in Parkinson's Disease-Adapted Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms Scores compared to placebo (-5.79 and -2.73, respectively, 95% CI, -4 .91 to -1.20; P=0.001). Pimavanserin was well tolerated, with no worsening of motor f unction or significant safety concerns.12,291 Available evidence suggests that, except for clozapine, olanzapine is associated with greater weight gain compared to all other atypical antipsychotic agen ts. In contrast, ziprasidone is associated with a low incidence of weight gain.221 Data from the Food and Drug Administration Advers e Reporting System (AERS) indicates that the risk of experiencing a diabetes-related adverse ev ent is greatest with olanzapine, followed by risperidone, and least with ziprasidone and aripiprazole, across all age groups.250 Risperidone is associated with the high incidence of extrapyramidal adverse events.229 Quetiapine is associated with the least risk of extrapyramidal adverse events.229 The incidence of sexual dysfunction was noted to be higher with the use of olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine than with quetiapine, ziprasidone or aripiprazole.233 The Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (A HRQ) is the lead federal agency for research on healthcare quality, costs, outcomes and patient safety. In 2011, AHRQ had issued an update to a prior 2007 review of scientific evidence on the safe ty and effectiveness of at ypical antipsychotics for off-labeled use.85,196 o Indications associated with moderate/high ngth of evidence for the use of atypical general anxiety disord Refer IIa and IIb for additional details. The AHRQ had conducted a systematic review of literature on the sa fety and efficacy of antipsychotics in children and adolescents.102,103 For details, refer to Appendices IIIa and IIIB. o Indications associated with moderate strength evidence for the use of atypical antipsychotics included disruptive behavior diso rder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette's syndrome. o No significant differences between the differ ent atypical antipsychotics were noted in the identified head-to-head comparisons. o The risks of weight gain (weight gain: 4.6 kg ) and dyslipidemia were highest with olanzapine. Weight gain with ziprasidone was not significantly different from placebo. The other atypical antipsychotics were associated wi th intermediate weight gain. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 8 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 o Risperidone was associated with the greatest incidence of pr olactin-related adverse events (consistent with adult data). o Extrapyramidal adverse events were signif icantly more common with risperidone and aripiprazole compared to placebo. According to a systematic review by Safer et al, weight gain secondary to atypical antipsychotics is greater in children and adolescents than in adults.264 Key Points within the Medication Class According to Current Clinical Guidelines: o Antipsychotics are a mainstay in therapy for schizophrenia.314-316 o Lithium, valproate and/or antipsychotics ar e recommended as initial therapy of bipolar disorder.301-304 o The American Psychiatric Association guideline recommends the use of antipsychotics for the management of psychosis or agitation in patients with dementia.305 o For the treatment of anxiety disorders, sertraline is recommended as a first-line pharmacotherapeutic include serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs). Augmentation t herapy with antipsychotics is an option in treatment-refractory patients but the guidelines recommend that initiation of combination therapy be limited to specialists. o In major depressive disorder, first-line treatment options include SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion or mirtazapine.308-310 Antipsychotic augmentation therapy is an option for patients who have failed antidepressant monotherapy. o In obsessive compulsive disorder, SSRIs and cognitive behavioral therapy are recommended as first-line treatment options.311 Patients who have failed an SSRI trial may be offered augmentation therapy with an antipsychotic or cognitive behavioral therapy. Similarly, SSRIs and SNRIs are considered to be first-line treatment options for the treatm ent of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).312,313 o Atypical antipsychotics may be used as adjunct ive therapy for the management of treatment- refractory PTSD.312 o For the treatment of hallucinations and del usions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), guidelines recommend the us e of atypical antipsychotics, specifically clozapine or quetiapine, which have the most c linical data to support use. Both clinical guidelines recommend against the use of olanzapine for PDP due limited efficacy.317-318 o The European Society for the Study of Tour ette Syndrome guideline recommends risperidone as a first-line agent for the treatment of tics.329 Aripiprazole has a role in treatment-refractory patients. o The American Academy of Child and A dolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) guideline acknowledges that atypical antip sychotics are the most commonly prescribed class of drugs for the treatment of maladaptive aggression, regardless of diagnosis; yet emphasize that pharmacotherapy should not be used as the only intervention in children with oppositional defiant disorder.325 o Although the antipsychotics are not addressed in national and international insomnia treatment guidelines, the National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus and State-of-the- Science Statement on Manifestations and Managem ent of Chronic Insomnia in Adults state that due to the lack of evidence supporting the short and long term efficacy of antipsychotics, in addition to their significant risks, their use in the treatment of chronic insomnia cannot be recommended.331 o In a practice guideline on the use of atypic al antipsychotics in children and adolescents, issued by the AACAP in 2011, the panel recommends that prior to initiation of antipsychotic therapy patients should undergo a thorough diagnostic assessm ent, evaluation for comorbid medical conditions and concomitant medications.329 Furthermore, a multidisciplinary plan that includes education and psychotherapy should be established. The prescriber should also have a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of psychotropic medication. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 9 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 o Of the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone is recognized as an agent with the most substantial amount of methodologically stringent ev idence for use in pediatric patients.329 o There is almost no data to support the use of atypical antipsychotics in pre-school aged children.329 The guideline recommends a marked amount of caution before using these agents in pre-schoolers. o Given the risk of metabolic side-effects, pediat ric patients receiving at ypical antipsychotic therapy should be closely monitored for changes in weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose and lipid profile.329 Table 2.

Effect sizes were generally considered to be \"small\" Aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone have efficacy as treatment for behavioral symptoms of dementia. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 10 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Indication Strength of Evidence Findings Conclusions in magnitude. Psychosis -risperidone was superior to placebo, as measured by thepsychosis subscales of the BEHAVE-AD, BPRS, and NPI. Results for aripiprazole did not meet conventional levels of statistical significance. Agitation - Aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone were superior to placebo, as measured by the agitation subscales of the BEHAVE-AD, BPRS, NPI, and CMAI. Three head to head trials compared atypicals; none was found superior. Depression Augmentation of meta-analysis used \"response\" to treatment and remission as outcome. Pooling trials that reported the HAM-D as outcome, the relative risk of responding for participants taking quetiapine or risperidone was significantly higher than for placebo. Other trials reported MADRS scores; the relative risk of responding for participants taking aripiprazole was significantly higher than those taking placebo. Risperidone was included in two trials. These reported the drug superior to placebo. The relative risk of responding for participants taking aripiprazole was significantly higher than those taking placebo. Olanzapine had only two trials, so pooling was not performed; the trials reported olanzapine superior to placebo. In one available ziprasidone trial, the drug was superior to placebo in terms of MADRS scores. One trial compared ziprasidone at differing levels augmenting Aripiprazole, quetiapine, and risperidone have efficacy as augmentation to SSRIs/SNRIs for major depressive disorder. Olanzapine and ziprasidone may also have efficacy. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 11 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Indication Strength of Evidence Findings Conclusions sertraline to sertraline alone. This trial found a greater improvement in CGI-S and MADRS scores augmenting with ziprasidone at augmentation with ziprasidone at 80mg or sertraline alone. However, there was no significant difference in HAMD-17, CGI-I or HAM-A scores. Monotherapy Moderate Olanzapine alone was no better than placebo in improving symptoms at six or 12 weeks in three trials. Outc omes were too heterogeneous to allow pooling. In five PCTs, quetiapine was superior according to relative risk of both responding and remitted as measured by MADRS. Olanzapine does not have efficacy as monotherapy for major depressive disorder. Quetiapine has efficacy as monotherapy for major depressive disorder er Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Augmentation of SSRIs Moderate (risperidone) Low (olanzapine) The 2006 meta-analysis pooled results of nine trials of risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine as augmentation therapy in patients who were resistant to treatment with SSRI. Atypical antipsychotics had a clinically important benefit, (measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), when used as augmentation therapy. Relative risk of \"responding\" significant for augmentation with quetiapine and risperidone. The updated 2011 meta-analysis found risperidone superior to placebo, as measured by changes in the Y-BOCS. There were too few studies (two) of olanzapine augmentation to permit separate pooling of this drug. Both trials reported olanzapine superior to placebo. One new head to head trial found no difference in effect between olanzapine and risperidone as SSRI augmentation. One new head to head trial found Risperidone has efficacy in improving OCD symptoms when used as an adjunct to SSRI in treatment refractory patients. Olanzapine may have efficacy. Quetiapine is more efficacious than ziprasidone and clomipramine. e. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 12 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Indication Strength of Evidence Findings Conclusions quetiapine more effective than ziprasidone as SSRI augmentation. In one new trial, quetiapine produced a significant reduction in Y-BOCS score, while clomipramine did not. Augmentation of citalopram Low (quetiapine) Very low (risperidone) One trial of risperidone reported no differences between groups in achieving a response to therapy, but patients maintained on risperidone had a significantly longer period of time to relapse compared to placebo (102 vs 85 days). Two trials found quetiapine superior to placebo as augmentation for citalopram, according to Y-BOCS and CGI-I scores. Quetiapine and risperidone may be efficacious as augmentation to citalopram in OCD patients. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Moderate (risperidone) Low (Olanzapine) Very Low (Quetiapine) Three trials enrolled men with combat-related PTSD; these showed a benefit in sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and overall symptoms when risperidone or olanzapine was used to augment therapy with antidepressants or other psychotropic medication. Three trials of olanzapine or risperidone as monotherapy for abused women with PTSD were inconclusive regarding efficacy. One trial found a three-fold decline in PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores in patients treated with quetiapine monotherapy compared to placebo. There were too few olanzapine studies (two) to pool; one reported olanzapine superior to placebo, while one did not. A meta-analysis of risperidone, using CAPS scores as outcome, found risperidone to be superior to placebo. In a meta-analysis by condition, atypical antipsychotics were Risperidone is efficacious in reducing combat-related PTSD symptoms when used as an adjunct to primary medication. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 13 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Indication Strength of Evidence Findings Conclusions efficacious for combat-related PTSD but not PTSD in abused women. Personality Disorders Borderline Low (aripiprazole) Very low (quetiapine, olanzapine) Four trials provide evidence that olanzapine is superior to placebo and may be superior to fluoxetine. The benefit of adding olanzapine to dialectical therapy in one trial was small. Two trials of olanzapine found no difference from placebo in any outcomes compared to placebo. Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in one small trial. Another trial found aripiprazole superior to placebo in improving SCL-90, HAM-D, and HAM-A scores at 8 months and less self-injury at 18 months. A trial of ziprasidone found no significant difference in CGI-BPD, depressive, anxiety, psychotic or impulsive symptoms compared to placebo at 12 weeks. One trial found quetiapine to be superior to placebo on BPRS and PANSS scales. Due to heterogeneity of outcomes, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Olanzapine had mixed results in seven trials, aripiprazole was found efficacious in two trials, quetiapine was found efficacious in one trial, and ziprasidone was found not efficacious in one trial. Schizotypal Low Risperidone was superior to placebo in one small trial. In another trial risperidone was found to be no different from placebo on a cognitive assessment battery. Risperidone had mixed results when used to treat schizotypal personality disorder in two small trials. Tourette's Syndrome Low Risperidone was superior to placebo in one small trial, and it was at least as effective as pimozide or clonidine for eight to 12 weeks of therapy in the three other trials. One trial of ziprasidone showed variable efficacy compared to placebo. Risperidone is at least as efficacious as pimozide or clonidine for Tourette's syndrome. Anxiety Moderate Three placebo-controlled trials of quetiapine as monotherapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) could be pooled; relative Quetiapine has efficacy as treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 14 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Indication Strength of Evidence Findings Conclusions risk of responding on HAM-A favored the quetiapine group. One head to head trial showed no difference between risperidone and paroxetine on HAM-A score improvement. One trial each found quetiapine equally effective as paroxetine and escitalopram. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder No comorbidity Low One trial showed risperidone superior to placebo in reducing scores on the Children's Aggression Scale-Parent version (CAS-P). Risperidone may be efficacious in treating children with ADHD with no serious co-occurring disorders. Mental retardation Low One trial showed risperidone led to greater reduction in SNAP-IV (Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham teacher & parent rating scale) scores than methylphenidate. Risperidone may be superior to methylphenidate in treating ADHD symptoms in mentally retarded children. Bipolar Low Two trials of aripiprazole showed no effect on SNAP-IV (Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham teacher & parent rating scale) scores than placebo. Aripiprazole is inefficacious in reducing ADHD symptoms in children with bipolar disorder. Eating Disorders Moderate (olanzapine) Low (quetiapine) In a pooled analysis of three trials, there was no difference in change in BMI at either one or three months with olanzapine compared to placebo. One trial of quetiapine reported no statistical difference from placebo in BMI increase at three months. Olanzapine and quetiapine have no efficacy in increasing body mass in eating disorder patients. Insomnia Very Low In one small trial (N=13) of quetiapine, sleep outcomes were not statistically different from placebo. Quetiapine may be inefficacious in treating insomnia. Substance Abuse Alcohol Moderate (aripiprazole) Low (quetiapine) Two trials of aripiprazole and one of quetiapine reported percentage of patients completely abstinent during follow-up. In a pooled analysis, the effect vs placebo was insignificant. Aripiprazole is inefficacious in treating alcohol abuse/ dependence. Quetiapine may also be inefficacious. Cocaine Low Two trials of olanzapine and one of risperidone reported there was no difference in efficacy vs placebo as measured by the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Olanzapine is inefficacious in treating cocaine abuse /dependence. Risperidone may also be Therapeutic Class Overview: oral atypical antipsychotics Page 15 of 22 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 08/04/2016 Indication Strength of Evidence Findings Conclusions inefficacious. Meth- amphetamine Low One trial found aripiprazole inefficacious in reducing use of intravenous amphetamine, as measured by urinalysis. Another trial found aripiprazole inefficacious in reducing craving for Aripiprazole is inefficacious in treating methamphetamine abuse/ dependence. Methadone Low One trial of methadone-treated patients found no difference between risperidone and placebo in reduction of cocaine or heroin use. Risperidone is an inefficacious adjunct to methadone maintenance Psychiatric Rating II: Summary of Adverse Events of Atyp ical Antipsychotics for Off-Label Use (adopted from 2011 AHRQ systematic review) 196 Adverse Event Head-to-Head Studies Active Comparator Studies Placebo-Controlled Studies Weight Gain Elderly In one large trial (CATIE-AD) patients who were treated with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone averaged a monthly gain of 1.0, 0.7, and 0.4 lbs respectively, compared to a monthly weight loss of 0.9 lbs for placebo patients. More common in patients taking olanzapine than risperidone or conventional antipsychotics, particularly if their BMI was less than 25 at baseline, according to a large cohort study. According to the meta-analysis, more common in patients taking olanzapine and risperidone than placebo. Adults More common in olanzapine patients than ziprasidone patients in one trial. More common among patients taking olanzapine than patients taking conventional antipsychotics in three trials. More common in patients taking aripiprazole than patients taking conventional antipsychotics in one According to the meta- analysis, more common in patients taking aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone than placebo.

More common among patients taking olanzapine than patients taking mood stabilizers in two trials. Children/Adolescents No head to head studies No difference between clonidine and risperidone in one trial. More common in patients taking risperidone in two PCTs. No difference in one small PCT of ziprasidone. Mortality-in the elderly No difference between olanzapine and risperidone according to a meta- analysis of six trials of olanzapine published in 2006. Six large cohort studies compared mortality in elderly patients taking atypical and conventional antipsychotics. Four of these studies found a significantly higher rate of death with conventional antipsychotics, while two found no statistical difference in mortality between the drug classes. The difference in risk for death was small but statistically significant for atypicals, according to a 2006 meta-analysis which remains the best available estimate. Sensitivity analyses found no difference between drugs in the class. Patients taking atypicals had higher odds of mortality than those taking no antipsychotics in the two cohort studies that made that comparison. There are no trials or large observational studies of ziprasidone in this population. Endocrine Elderly No evidence reported No evidence reported No difference in endocrine events in risperidone patients in one PCT. Regarding diabetes, risk was elevated but not statistically significant in one industry-sponsored cohort study of olanzapine patients. Adults Diabetes more common in patients taking olanzapine than patients taking risperidone in one trial. No evidence reported Endocrine events more common in patients taking quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone in one PCT each. More common in olanzapine in two pooled PCTs.

More common in olanzapine patients in one PCT; the odds ratio of 5.14 was not statistically significant, with very wide confidence intervals (0.6 to 244). Lower odds of diabetes in risperidone patients in one large observational study. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) No evidence reported Hospitalization for CVA was increased in the first week after initiation of typical antipsychotics, but not for initiation of atypicals in a large cohort study. More common in risperidone patients than placebo according to four PCTs pooled by the manufacturer. In a meta- analysis of PCTs, risperidone was the only drug associated with an increase. More common in olanzapine than placebo according to five PCTs pooled by the manufacturer. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) Elderly More common in patients taking aripiprazole and risperidone patients than patients taking quetiapine in one large trial (CATIE- AD). No evidence reported More common in patients taking risperidone, according to the meta- analysis. Quetiapine and aripiprazole were not associated with an increase. More common in olanzapine in one PCT. Adults No evidence reported Less likely in patients taking quetiapine than mood stabilizers in one small trial. Less likely in patients taking olanzapine or aripiprazole than patients taking conventional More common in patients taking aripiprazole, quetiapine, and ziprasidone than placebo according to the meta-analysis.

Adults More common in patients taking quetiapine than risperidone in two trials. No difference in one trial of risperidone vs olanzapine. Olanzapine patients had higher odds than mood stabilizer patients in two trials. More common in olanzapine and quetiapine patients than SSRIs patients in three and two trials respectively. Olanzapine patients had lower odds than patients taking conventional antipsychotics in the pooled analysis of three trials. More common in patients taking aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone than placebo in the meta-analysis. Children/Adolescents No head-to-head trials No difference in one small trial of clonidine vs risperidone. More patients on haloperidol than risperidone reported sleep problems in one trial.

Page 1 of 6 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 Therapeutic Class Overview Inhaled Anticholinergics Therapeutic Class Overview/Summary: The inhaled anticholinergics are a class of bronchod ilators primarily used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , a condition characterized by progres sive airflow restrictions that are not fully reversible.1-3 Symptoms associated with COPD typically include dyspnea, cough, sputum production, wheezing and chest tightness. Specifically , inhaled anticholinergics work via the inhibition of acetylcholine at parasympathetic sites in bronchia l smooth muscle causing bronchodilation. Meaningful increases in lung function can be achieved with the use of inhaled anticholinergics in patients with COPD.1-3 The (DuoNeb).4-15 Ipratropium, a short-ac ting bronchodilator, has a duration of action of six to eight hours and requi res administration four times daily. Aclidinium, and umeclidinium are administered once daily. Ipratropium is available as a metered dose aerosol inhaler for oral inhalation as well solution for nebulization. Aclidinium, glycopyrrolate, tiotropium and umeclidinium are available as dry powder inhalers for oral inhalation, with tiotropium also aerosol.4-15 Aclidinium, glycopyrrolate, ipratropium and tiotropi um, are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the maintenance treatment of bronchospasm asso ciated with COPD, including chronic the only inhaled anticho linergic that is FDA-approved for reducing exacerbations tiotropium soft mist inhaler (Spiriva Respimat \u00ae) has been approved for the chronic management of asthma and updated guidelines recommend its use as add-on thereapy. 9,16 Ipratropium/albuterol is indicated for the treatment of bronchos pasms associated with COPD in patients who require one bronchod ilator.

Evidence-based Medicine In general, the inhaled anticholinergics have demon strated to improve lung function and/or exercise tolerance in patients with chronic ob structive pulmonary disease (COPD). 18-80 Few head-to-head trials have noted significant differences in improvemen ts in lung function favoring tiotropium over ipratropium.20,43,44 A meta-analysis evaluating tiotropium added to acting -agonist (LABA) therapy comp ared to ICS/LABA alone for the treatment of asthma did not demonstrate a significant difference be tween the groups in the primary endpoints of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, quality of life or serious adverse events.81 The efficacy of glycopyrrolate is based primarily on the dose-ranging trials in 471 subjects with COPD and two placebo-controlled confirmatory trials in 867 subjects with COPD. The primary efficacy endpoint from the two placebo-cont rolled confirmatory trials, GEM1 and GEM2, was the change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0 to 12 h following the morning dose at day 85 compared with placebo. In both trials, the glycopyrrolate group demon strated a larger increase in mean change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0 to 12 h compared to placebo. o In GEM1, the change from baseline least squares (LS) mean was 0.125 L in the glycopyrrolate group compared to -0.014 L in the placebo group (Treatment difference LS Mean, 0.139 L; 95% CI, 0.095 to 0.184; P values not reported). Therapeutic Class Overview: inhaled anticholinergics Page 3 of 6 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 06/15/2016 o For GEM2, the change from baseline LS mean was 0.115 L in the glycopyrrolate group compared to -0.008 L in the placebo group (Treat ment difference LS Mean, 0.123 L; 95% CI, 0.081 to 0.165; P values not reported).5,77,78 The efficacy of indacaterol/glyc opyrrolate was based primarily on the results of two 12-week efficacy studies (FLIGHT1 & 2).12,79 Both double-blinded, active-controlled, and parallel-group trials in with COPD. A total of 2,038 were mcg BID, or placebo BID. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h following the morning dose at Day 85 compared with placebo, glycopyrrolate 15.6 \u00b5g BID, and indacaterol 27.5 \u00b5g BID. o In both trials, Utibron Neohaler\u00ae (indacaterol/glycopyrrolate) demonstrated a larger increase in mean change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h compared to placebo, indacaterol 27.5 \u00b5g BID, and glycopyrrolate 15.6 \u00b5g BID (treatment difference: 10 3 mL and 88 mL vs indacaterol and glycopyrrolate, respectively, P<0.001). In addition, both indacaterol and glycopyrrolate monotherapies had a statistically greater response than placebo at week 12 in terms of FEV 1 AUC 0-12h (treatment difference: 143 mL and 158 mL, respectively, P<0.001).79 Key Points within the Medication Class According to the Global Initiative for Chro nic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines:1 o Inhaled bronchodilators are preferred for t he management of COPD. Regular use of long- acting 2-agonists or short- or long-acting antic holinergics improves health status and long- acting anticholinergics reduce the rate of CO PD exacerbations and improve the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. o The GOLD guidelines emphasize that the use of long-acting bronchodilato rs is more effective and convenient than the use of short-acting bronchodilators. According to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE):2 o Short-acting bronchodilators should be the in itial empiric treatment for the relief of breathlessness and exercise lim itation while long-acting bronchodilators should be used in patients who remain symptomatic with use of short-acting agents. o Once-daily, long-acting anticholinergic agents are preferred compared to four-times-daily short-acting anticholinergics in patients with stable COPD who remain symptomatic despite use of short-acting agents and in whom the decision has been made to begin regular maintenance therapy with an anticholinergic agent. According to the Global Initiative for As thma (GINA), tiotropium (Spiriva Respimat\u00ae) is an option for add-on therapy in patients 12 years and older in un controlled asthma at both steps 4 and 5 in the treatment algorithm.16 Other Asthma guidelines have not been updated since tiotropium has received this expanded indication.82 Other Key Facts: o Ipratropium and ipratropium/albuterol solutions for nebulization are the only inhaled anticholinergic products that are currently available generically.
