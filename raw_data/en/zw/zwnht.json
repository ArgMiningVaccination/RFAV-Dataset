Covid-19 gives one such opportunity to the pharmaceutical industry. Product innovation gives an opportunity to beat the pandemic. However, process innovation using the concept of co-opetition can help the pharmaceutical industry create a win-win for the market and the industry. This chapter covers co-opetition strategies that pharmaceutical sector can follow to help the customers and marketers win this game. The chapter looks at various co-operation-based strategies including co-operation by division of markets, co-operation by sharing of distribution, co-operation through patent waivers and co-operation with complementary goods manufacturers.
