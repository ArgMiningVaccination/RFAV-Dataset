A. Q. A. Q. A. INTRODUCTION AND QUALIFICATIONS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND BUSINESS ADDRESS . Page I of 11 My name is Richard Lampeter. My business address is 3 Mill & Main Place, Suite 250, Maynard, MA 01754. BY WHOM ARE YOU EMPLOYED AND IN WHAT CAPACITY? I am employed at Epsilon Associates , Inc. (\"Epsilon\"). I am an Associate at the company and manage the Acoustics Group. PLEASE DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND AND QUALIFICATIONS I have over 15 years of experience in conducting impact assessments for vanous developments across the United States. Prior to joining Epsilon, I graduated from Lyndon State College in Vermont with a B.S. in Environmen tal Science. While at Epsilon, I have been involved in approximately 90 wind energy projects evaluating potential impacts from sound and/or shadow flicker. The projects I have worked on ranged in size from 1.5 megawatts (\"MW\") to over 300 MW. I utilize the WindPRO software package to calculate shadow flicker durations in the vicinity of a project on both a worst-case and expected basis. As part of project evaluations, I have assisted in refinements in wind turbine layouts to minimize shadow flicker at residences, evaluated curtailment options, and analyzed the impact of existing vegetation to modeled shadow flicker durations. My other areas of expertise include the measurement of ambient sound levels, modeling sound levels from proposed developments, evaluation of conceptual mitigation , and compliance sound level measurements . I have conducted impact assessments for power generating facilities, commercial developments, industrial facilities, and transfer stations. In addition to conducting and/or managing the impact assessments, I have presented the results of the analyses at public meetings to county and township boards. Additiona l detail regarding my education, background and experience is contained in my curriculum vitae, which is attached as Exhibit RL-R-1. 0043711 2 Q. 3 4 A. 5 6 Q. 7 8 A. 9 10 Q. 11 A. Page 2 of 11 HAS THIS TESTIMONY BEEN PREPARED BY YOU OR UNDER YOUR DIRECT SUPERVISION? Yes. HA VE YOU PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED BEF'ORE THE SOUTH DAKOTA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION? No. PLEASE DESCRIBE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR REBUTTAL TESTIMONY. The purpose of my testimony is to respond to Staff witness David Hessler and the 12 Intervenors' proposed conditions as set forth in Staff witness Darren Kearney's Exhibit 13 DK-8. 14 15 16 Q. 17 18 19 20 A. SOUND STUDY STAFF WITNESS HESSLER'S TESTIMONY AT PAGE 3, LINES 11-22 ASSERTS THAT CROWNED RIDGE WIND, LLC (\"CRW\") SHOULD HAVE CONDUCTED A BASELINE SOUND SURVEY(S) TO INFORM THE DESIGN OF THE WIND PROJECT. DO YOU AGREE? I do not agree with Mr. Hessler that a baseline sound level of existing conditions should 21 have been conducted. The applicable sound level limits in the counties are based on 22 sound generated from wind turbines at either the property line or at a non-participating 23 structure (residence, business, or government building). Collecting baseline ambient 24 sound levels would be of minimal value as it is not applicable to these limits. This is 25 because to evaluate the limits one simply compares the modeling sound pressure level to 26 the sound level limit stated in the regulation. It would not involve combining the existing 27 sound levels with predicted future sound levels due to the wind turbines or calculating a 28 delta between total future sound levels (Project + Existing) and the existing ambient 29 sound levels. Therefore, sound level modeling is sufficient to evaluate these limits. In 30 addition, evaluating an increase over background limit is problematic as there are many 0043721 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Q. A. Page 3 of 11 factors which impact sound levels, making it difficult to assign one number as the background sound level. For example, sound levels will vary over time and will vary under differing wind conditions. In addition, ambient sound can be presented using different metrics, which in turn results in different sound levels. This type of limit, i.e., increase over background, leads to greater uncertainty for the devcloper\\owner\\operator as compared a static Project Only sound level limit. INFRASOUND THE INTERVENOR.S' PROPOSED CONDITIONS 6, 7, AND 23 (KEARN EY EXHIBIT DK-8) INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS FOR CRW TO MEASURE INFRASOUND. DO YOU AGREE INFRASOUND SHOULD BE MEASURED? I do not agree. Low frequency noise and infrasound arc present in the environment due to other sources besides wind turbines. For example, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines generate infrasound and low frequency sound, as do natural sources such as ocean waves. The frequency range of low frequency sound is generally from 20 hertz (\"Hz\") to 200 Hz, and the range below 20 Hz is often described as infrasound. However, audibility can extend to frequencies below 20 Hz if the energy is high enough. Since there is no sharp change in hearing at 20 Hz, the division between low frequency noise and infrasound should only be considered practical and conventional. The threshold of hearing is standardized for frequencies down to 20 Hz (Acoustics -Normal equal-loudness-level contours, International Standard ISO 226:2003, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland, (2003)). Also, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"MA DEP\") and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health commissioned an expert panel who found 0043731 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Page 4 of 11 that: \"Claims infrasound from wind turbines directly impacts the vestibular system have not been demonstrated scientifically. Available evidence shows that the infrasound levels near wind turbines cannot impact the vestibular system.\" (Wind Turbine Health Impact Study: Review of Independent Expert Panel, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and Massachusetts Department of Public Health, January 2012.) (attached as Exhibit RL-R-2). As noted in a report prepared for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (\"NARUC \") in 2011, \"the widespread belief that wind turbines produce elevated or even harmful levels of low frequency and infrasonic sound is utterly untrue as proven repeatedly and independently by numerous investigators ... \" (Assessing Sound Emissions from Proposed Wind Farms & Measuring the Performance of Completed Projects, NARUC, prepared by Hessler Associates, Inc., October 2011.) (attached as Exhibit RL-R-3). The findings presented in the peer reviewed journal article I co-authored (Low frequency noise and infrasoundfrom wind turbines, R. O'Neal et al, Noise Control Engineering J., 59(2), 2011.), which is attached as Exhibit RL-R-4, found for the wind turbines studied that there was no audible infrasound either outside or inside homes at 1,000 feet from a wind turbine. Additional findings included that sound levels met the American National Standards Institute (\"ANSI\") standard for low frequency noise in bedrooms, classrooms, and hospitals, met the ANSI standard for thresholds of annoyance from low frequenc y noise, and met the ANSI standard for vibration of light-wei ght walls or ceilings. In homes 004374Page 5 of I I 1 there may be slightly audible low frequency noise beginning at around 50 Ilz (depending 2 on other sources of low frequency noise); however, the levels arc below criteria and 3 recommendations for low frequency noise within homes. 4 5 6 Q. 7 8 9 10 11 A. SOUND MONITORI NG THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITION 6 (KEARNEY EXHIBIT DK-8) WOULD REQUIRE A PRECONSTRUCTION SOUND STUDY ANALYSIS, INCLUDING INFRASO UND, OF NON-PARTICIPATING PROPERTIES, OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE PRINCIPLE STRUCTURE TO BE CONDUCTED BY A THIRD-PARTY. DO YOU AGREE WITH SUCH AN APPROACH? A pre-construction sound study as described is not necessary. A pre-construct ion sound 12 study sufficient to address the regulatory requirements has already been conducted. That 13 study, submitted by CRW witness Jay IIalcy, modeled future operational sound levels 14 and compared those sound levels to each county's sound level limit. Since the sound 15 level limit in each county is a single sound pressure level and not individual limits for 16 particular frequencies, the collection of specific infrasound measurements is unnecessary 17 to evaluate compliance with respect to these sound level limits. 18 19 A p re-construction measurement program would not be needed for the reasons discussed 20 previously in the response to Hessler's comment regarding pre-construction sound level 21 measurements. 22 Q. 23 THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITION 7 (KEARN EY EXHIBIT DK-8) WOULD REQUIRE CRW TO CONDUCT SOUND MONITOIUNG, INCLUDING 0043751 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 A. Q. A. Page 6 of 11 INJ?RASOUND, DUIUNG CONSTRUCTIO N. DO YOU AGREE THAT SOUND MONITOIUNG, INCLUDING INFRASOUND, SHOULD BE COMPLETED DUIUNG CONSTR UCTION? I am unaware of any specific applicable state or county sound limit during construction. In my experience, sound level limits for the construction of wind energy facilities are atypical. Nonetheless, I understand that CR W witness Mark Thompson will address how CRW will implement measures to mitigate sound during construction. THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITION 7 (KEARNEY EXHIBIT DK-8) WOULD REQUIRE CRW TO CONDUCT SOUND MONITORING, INCLUDING INFRASOUND, DURING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. DO YOU AGREE THAT SOUND MONITOIUNG, INCLUDING MONITORING OF INFRASOUND, SHOULD BE COMPLETED DURING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE? I agree that a condition on post-construction sound monitoring of operating conditions would be appropriat e, but do not agree that a condition requiring sound monitoring during maintenance or that monitoring of infrasound is necessary or appropriate. The Commission's past permits require post-construction sound monitoring. For example, in Dakota Range I and II, Crocker Wind Farm, and most recently in Dakota Range III, the Commission ordered the following: \"The Project, exclusive of all unrelated background noise, shall not generate a long-term average sound pressure level ( equivalent continuous sound level, Leq), as measured over a period of at least two weeks, defined by Commission Staff, that includes all integer wind speeds from cut in to full power .... \" 0043762 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Q. A. Page 7 of 11 Inclusion of this condition in the facility permit for the CRW wind facility would address the monitorin g of sound during operation. Since the sound level limit in each county is a single sound pressure level and not individual limits for particular frequencies, the collection of specific infrasound measurements is unnecessary to evaluate compliance with respect to these sound level limits. Sound level limits are typically applied to standard operating conditions. Therefore, the sound limits, such as those presented in the county ordinances and implemented by the Commission in past cases, would not be applicable to limited and intermittent maintenance sounds that occur over the course of the project's life. THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITION 7 (KEARNEY EXHIBIT DK-8) WOULD REQUIRE CRW TO CONDUCT SOUND MONITOIUNG, INCLUDING INFRASOUND, DURING DECOMMISSIONING. DO YOU AGREE THAT SOUND MONITORING, INCLUDING INFRASOUND, SHOULD BE COMPLETED DURING DECOMMISSIONING? No, I do not. Similar to construction, I am unaware of any state or county limit on sound during decommi ssioning. Therefor e, the monitorin g of sound during this temporary condition would be unnecessary. 0043771 2 3 Q. POST CONSTRUCTION SOUND MONITORING METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING Page 8 of 11 THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITIONS 19, 20, AND 21 (KEARNEY 4 EXHIBIT DK-8) WOULD REQUIRE CRW TO MEASURE SOUND DBA AT Lio. 5 DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH? 6 J\\.. 7 8 I do not. Based on my experience, the Lcq, or equivalent sound level, is the most widely used metric in the United States and the appropria te sound level metric for evaluating sound level impacts from wind energy facilities. As I stated previously , three recent 9 permits in South Dakota have required post construction sound level monitoring using the 10 Leq metric. 11 12 In addition, the Leq is directly comparable to the model output of pre-construction 13 predictive models provided by CRW witness Jay Haley, as the modeling incorporates the 14 Leq sound power levels provided by the wind turbine manufacturers. 15 16 The Lio, or the sound level exceeded 10 percent of the time, is more susceptible to wind 17 gusts and other extraneous events than the Leq, which can result in elevated sound levels 18 unrelated to the operation of the wind turbines. 19 20 21 Q. THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITION 19 (KEARNEY EXHIBIT DK- 22 8) WOULD REQUIRE CRW TO ENGAGE A THIRD PARTY TO MEASURE 23 SOUND EVERY YEAR OUTSIDE AND INSIDE NON-PARTICIPATING 24 LANDOWNERS' HOMES WITHIN 2 MILES Ol? THE BOUNDARY 25 FOOTPRINT AND THE WAVERLY SCHOOL. DO YOU AGREE WITH 26 UTILIZING SUCH AN APPROACH? 27 A. No. A condition to require sound level measurements every year at all non-participating 28 homes is onerous and unnecessary. All compliance sound level evaluations are done at a 29 reasonable subset of possible monitoring locations considering distance, modeled sound 004378Page 9 or 11 levels, turbine types, and proximity to other monitoring locations in order to determin e 2 compliance for the facility as a whole. 3 4 As the sound level limits are exterior limits, there is no additional value in attempting to 5 collect sound levels within a residence, which would be more difficult to obtain, subject 6 to extraneous noise (conversations, television, etc.), and would be lower than sound 7 levels measured at the exterior of the home. In other words, Mr. Haley's modeling would 8 only indicate what would be experienced outdoors, and, therefore, the sound level 9 experienced indoors due to the wind turbines would be less due to the sound transmission 10 loss of the house itself. 11 12 Q. THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITION 19 (KEARNEY EXHIBIT DK- 13 8) WOULD REQUIRE CRW TO CONDUCT SOUND MONITOIUNG DUIUNG 14 EVEN NUMBERED YEARS IN THE SPRING AND FALL FOR 14 DAYS 24 15 HOURS CONTINUOUS. DURING THE ODD NUMBERED YEARS THE 16 MEASUREMENT WOULD BE IN THE SUMMER AND WINTER FOR 14 DAYS 17 24 HOURS CONTINUOUSLY. DO YOU AGREE WITH SUCH AN APPROACH? 18 A. 19 20 21 22 23 Q. I disagree with the approach proposed. One properly designed sound level measurement program of an adequate duration is sufficient to determine compliance with respect to sound at the wind energy facility. SOUND THRESHOLDS THE INTERVENORS' PROPOSED CONDITIONS 19, 20, AND 21 (KEARNEY 24 EXHIBIT DK-8) WOULD REQUIRE THAT NOISE NOT EXCEED 40 DBA Lio 25 AT THE PROPERTY LINE OF A NON-PARTICIPATING PROPERTY, 26 INCLUDING DUIUNG CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, OPERATION, AND 27 DECOMMISSIONING. THE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE ENFORCED IN ALL 28 AREAS WITHIN 2 MILES OF THE PROJECT BOUNDARY FOOTPIUNT AND 0043792 3 J\\. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Q. 17 /\\. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Q. 29 A. Page JO of II WITHIN 2 MILES OF A Y HAUL ROAD FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT. DO YOU AGREE WITH SUCH AN PROPOSAL? I disagree with the proposed sound level limit. This proposal is unnecessarily more restrictive on multiple levels as compared to either of the Grant or Codington county sound level requirements. Further, the lntervcnors have provided no support for lowering the sound limit to a 40 dl3A threshold for non-participant s at their property line. Also, this proposal incorporates the Lio sound level metric, which as described earlier, is not the preferred metric from a technical standpoint and is more restrictive. Thus, the Intervenors condition is not supported or appropriate. THE INTERVENOR.S' PROPOSED CONDITION 19 (KEARNEY EXHIBIT DK- 8) WOULD REQUIRE SOUND TO BE MEASURED AT 40 DBA Lio BY A THIRD PARTY EVERY YEAR OUTSIDE AND INSIDE NON-PARTICIPATING LANDOWNERS' HOMES WITHIN 2 MILES OF THE BOUNDARY FOOTPRINT AND THE WAVERLY SCHOOL. DO YOU AGREE WITH SUCH A PROPOSAL? 1 disagree with this proposed requirement. As stated previously, 40 dl3A and Lio arc inconsistent with the Grant and Codington county requirements, and there is no support provided by the Intcrvenors for imposing a 40 dl3A limit. Further, compliance sound level evaluations arc done at a reasonable subset of possible monitoring locations considering distance, modeled sound levels, turbine types, and proximity to other monitoring locations in order to determine compliance for the facility as a whole. Since the sound level limits arc exterior limits, there is no additional value in attempting to collect sound levels within a residence given that they are more difficult to obtain, subject to extraneous noise (conversations, tv, etc.), and would be lower than sound levels measured at the exterior of the home. Thus, I do not support the Intcrvcnor s' proposed condition. DOES THIS CONCLUDE YOUR TESTIMONY?

Identify and characterize attributes of concern (e.g., noise, infrasound, vibration, and light flicker) and identify any scientifically documented or potential connection between health impacts associated with wind energy turbines located on land or coastal tidelands that can impact land-based human receptors. 2. Evaluate and discuss information from peer-reviewed scientific studies, other reports, popular media, and public comments received by the MassDEP and/or in response to the Environmental Monitor Notice and/or by the MDPH on the nature and type of health complaints commonly reported by individuals who reside near existing wind farms. 3. Assess the magnitude and frequency of any potential impacts and risks to human health associated with the design and operation of wind energy turbines based on existing data. 4. For the attributes of concern, identify documented best practices that could reduce potential human health impacts. Include examples of such best practices (design, operation, maintenance, and management from published articles). The best practices could be used to inform public policy decisions by state, local, or regional governments concerning the siting of turbines. 5. Issue a report within 3 months of the evaluation, summarizing its findings . To meet its charge, the Panel conducted a literature review and met as a group a total of three times. In addition, calls were also held with Panel members to further clarify points of discussion. 004402WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-1 | Pa ge E xecutive Summary The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) convened a panel of independent experts to identify any documented or potential health impacts of risks that may be associated with exposure to wind turbines, and, specifically, to facilitate discussion of wind turbines and public health based on scientific findings. While the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has goals for increasing the use of wind energy from the current 40 MW to 2000 MW by the year 2020, MassDEP recognizes there are questions and concerns arising from harnessing wind energy. The scope of the Panel's effort was focused on health impacts of wind turbines per se. The panel was not charged with considering any possible benefits of avoiding adverse effects of other energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas as a result of switching to energy from wind turbines. Currently, \"regulation\" of wind turbines is done at the local level through local boards of health and zoning boards. Some members of the public have raised concerns that wind turbines may have health impacts related to noise, infrasound, vibrations, or shadow flickering generated by the turbines. The goal of the Panel's evaluation and report is to provide a review of the science that explores these concerns and provides useful information to MassDEP and MDPH and to local agencies that are often asked to respond to such concerns. The Panel consists of seven individuals with backgrounds in public health, epidemiology, toxicology, neurology and sleep medicine, neuroscience, and mechanical engineering. All of the Panel members are considered independent experts from academic institutions. In conducting their evaluation, the Panel conducted an extensive literature review of the scientific literature as well as other reports, popular media, and the public comments received by the MassDEP. 004403WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-2 | Pa ge E S 1.

Identify and characterize attributes of concern (e.g., noise, infrasound, vibration, and light flicker) and identify any scientifically documented or potential connection between health impacts associated with wind turbines located on land or coastal tidelands that can impact land-based human receptors. 2. Evaluate and discuss information from peer reviewed scientific studies, other reports, popular media, and public comments received by the MassDEP and/or in response to the Environmental Monitor Notice and/or by the MDPH on the nature and type of health complaints commonly reported by individuals who reside near existing wind farms. 3. Assess the magnitude and frequency of any potential impacts and risks to human health associated with the design and operation of wind energy turbines based on existing data. 4. For the attributes of concern, identify documented best practices that could reduce potential human health impacts. Include examples of such best practices (design, operation, maintenance, and management from published articles). The best practices could be used to inform public policy decisions by state, local, or regional governments concerning the siting of turbines. 5. Issue a report within 3 months of the evaluation, summarizing its findings . ES 2. Process To meet its charge, the Panel conducted an extensive literature review and met as a group a total of three times. In addition, calls were also held with Panel members to further clarify points of discussion. An independent facilitator supported the Panel's deliberations. Each Panel member provided written text based on the literature reviews and analyses. Draft versions of the report were reviewed by each Panel member and the Panel reached consensus for the final text and its findings. ES 3. Report Introduction and Description Many countries have turned to wind power as a clean energy source because it relies on the wind, which is indefinitely renewable; it is generated \"locally,\" thereby providing a measure of energy independence; and it produces no carbon dioxide emissions when operating. There is interest in pursuing wind energy both on-land and offshore. For this report, however, the focus is on land-based installations and all comments are focused on this technology. Land-based 004404WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-3 | Pa ge w ind turbines currently range from 100 kW to 3 MW (3000 kW). In Massachusetts, the largest turbine is currently 1.8 MW. The development of modern wind turbines has been an evolutionary design process, applying optimization at many levels. An overview of the characteristics of wind turbines, noise, and vibration is presented in Chapter 2 of the report. Acoustic and seismic measurements of noise and vibration from wind turbines provide a context for comparing measurements from epidemiological studies and for claims purported to be due to emissions from wind turbines. Appendices provide detailed descriptions and equations that allow a more in-depth understanding of wind energy, the structure of the turbines, wind turbine aerodynamics, installation, energy production, shadow flicker, ice throws, wind turbine noise, noise propagation, infrasound, and stall vs. pitch controlled turbines. Extensive literature searches and reviews were conducted to identify studies that specifically evaluate human population responses to turbines, as well as population and individual responses to the three primary characteristics or attributes of wind turbine operation: noise, vibration, and flicker. An emphasis of the Panel's efforts was to examine the biological plausibility or basis for health effects of turbines (noise, vibration, and flicker). Beyond traditional forms of scientific publications, the Panel also took great care to review other non- peer reviewed materials regarding the potential for health effects including information related to \"Wind Turbine Syndrome\" and provides a rigorous analysis as to whether there is scientific basis for it. Since the most commonly reported complaint by people living near turbines is sleep disruption, the Panel provides a robust review of the relationship between noise, vibration, and annoyance as well as sleep disturbance from noises and the potential impacts of the resulting sleep deprivation. In assessing the state of the evidence for health effects of wind turbines, the Panel followed accepted scientific principles and relied on several different types of studies. It considered human studies of the most important or primary value. These were either human epidemiological studies specifically relating to exposure to wind turbines or, where specific exposures resulting from wind turbines could be defined, the panel also considered human experimental data. Animal studies are critical to exploring biological plausibility and understanding potential biological mechanisms of different exposures, and for providing information about possible health effects when experimental research in humans is not ethically 004405WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-4 | Pa ge o r practically possible. As such, this literature was also reviewed with respect to wind turbine exposures. The non-peer reviewed material was considered part of the weight of evidence. In all cases, data quality was considered; at times, some studies were rejected because of lack of rigor or the interpretations were inconsistent with the scientific evidence. ES 4. Findings The findings in Chapter 4 are repeated here. Based on the detailed review of the scientific literature and other available reports and consideration of the strength of scientific evidence, the Panel presents findings relative to three factors associated with the operation of wind turbines: noise and vibration, shadow flicker, and ice throw. The findings that follow address specifics in each of these three areas. ES 4.1 Noise ES 4.1.a Production of Noise and Vibration by Wind Turbines 1. Wind turbines can produce unwanted sound (referred to as noise) during operation. The nature of the sound depends on the design of the wind turbine. Propagation of the sound is primarily a function of distance, but it can also be affected by the placement of the turbine, surrounding terrain, and atmospheric conditions. a. Upwind and downwind turbines have different sound characteristics, primarily due to the interaction of the blades with the zone of reduced wind speed behind the tower in the case of downwind turbines. b. Stall regulated and pitch controlled turbines exhibit differences in their dependence of noise generation on the wind speed c. Propagation of sound is affected by refraction of sound due to temperature gradients, reflection from hillsides, and atmospheric absorption. Propagation effects have been shown to lead to different experiences of noise by neighbors. d. The audible, amplitude-modulated noise from wind turbines (\"whooshing\") is perceived to increase in intensity at night (and sometimes becomes more of a \"thumping\") due to multiple effects: i) a stable atmosphere will have larger wind gradients, ii) a stable atmosphere may refract the sound downwards instead of upwards, iii) the ambient noise near the ground is lower both because of the stable atmosphere and because human generated noise is often lower at night. 004406WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-5 | Pa ge 2 . The sound power level of a typical modern utility scale wind turbine is on the order of 103 dB(A), but can be somewhat higher or lower depending on the details of the design and the rated power of the turbine. The perceived sound decreases rapidly with the distance from the wind turbines. Typically, at distances larger than 400 m, sound pressure levels for modern wind turbines are less than 40 dB(A), which is below the level associated with annoyance in the epidemiological studies reviewed. 3. Infrasound refers to vibrations with frequencies below 20 Hz. Infrasound at amplitudes over 100-110 dB can be heard and felt. Research has shown that vibrations below these amplitudes are not felt. The highest infrasound levels that have been measured near turbines and reported in the literature near turbines are under 90 dB at 5 Hz and lower at higher frequencies for locations as close as 100 m. 4. Infrasound from wind turbines is not related to nor does it cause a \"continuous whooshing.\" 5. Pressure waves at any frequency (audible or infrasonic) can cause vibration in another structure or substance. In order for vibration to occur, the amplitude (height) of the wave has to be high enough, and only structures or substances that have the ability to receive the wave (resonant frequency) will vibrate. ES 4.1.b Health Impacts of Noise and Vibration 1. Most epidemiologic literature on human response to wind turbines relates to self-reported \"annoyance,\" and this response appears to be a function of some combination of the sound itself, the sight of the turbine, and attitude towards the wind turbine project. a. There is limited epidemiologic evidence suggesting an association between exposure to wind turbines and annoyance. b. There is insufficient epidemiologic evidence to determine whether there is an association between noise from wind turbines and annoyance independent from the effects of seeing a wind turbine and vice versa. 004407WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-6 | Pa ge 2 . There is limited evidence from epidemiologic studies suggesting an association between noise from wind turbines and sleep disruption. In other words, it is possible that noise from some wind turbines can cause sleep disruption. 3. A very loud wind turbine could cause disrupted sleep, particularly in vulnerable populations, at a certain distance, while a very quiet wind turbine would not likely disrupt even the lightest of sleepers at that same distance. But there is not enough evidence to provide particular sound-pressure thresholds at which wind turbines cause sleep disruption. Further study would provide these levels. 4. Whether annoyance from wind turbines leads to sleep issues or stress has not been sufficiently quantified. While not based on evidence of wind turbines, there is evidence that sleep disruption can adversely affect mood, cognitive functioning, and overall sense of health and well-being. 5. There is insufficient evidence that the noise from wind turbines is directly (i.e., independent from an effect on annoyance or sleep) causing health problems or disease. 6. Claims that infrasound from wind turbines directly impacts the vestibular system have not been demonstrated scientifically. Available evidence shows that the infrasound levels near wind turbines cannot impact the vestibular system. a. The measured levels of infrasound produced by modern upwind wind turbines at distances as close as 68 m are well below that required for non-auditory perception (feeling of vibration in parts of the body, pressure in the chest, etc.). b. If infrasound couples into structures, then people inside the structure could feel a vibration. Such structural vibrations have been shown in other applications to lead to feelings of uneasiness and general annoyance. The measurements have shown no evidence of such coupling from modern upwind turbines. c. Seismic (ground-carried) measurements recorded near wind turbines and wind turbine farms are unlikely to couple into structures. d. A possible coupling mechanism between infrasound and the vestibular system (via the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) in the inner ear) has been proposed but is not yet fully u nderstood or sufficiently explained. Levels of infrasound near wind turbines have b een shown to be high enough to be sensed by the OHC. However, evidence does not 004408WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-7 | Pa ge e xist to demonstrate the influence of wind turbine-generated infrasound on vestibular- mediated effects in the brain. e. L imited evidence from rodent (rat) laboratory studies identifies short-lived biochemical alterations in cardiac and brain cells in response to short exposures to emissions at 16 Hz and 130 dB. These levels exceed measured infrasound levels from modern turbines by over 35 dB. 7. There is no evidence for a set of health effects, from exposure to wind turbines that could be characterized as a \"Wind Turbine Syndrome.\" 8. The strongest epidemiological study suggests that there is not an association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems. There were two smaller, weaker, studies: one did note an association, one did not. Therefore, we conclude the weight of the evidence suggests no association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems. 9. None of the limited epidemiological evidence reviewed suggests an association between noise from wind turbines and pain and stiffness, diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and headache/migraine. ES 4.2 Shadow Flicker ES 4.2.a Production of Shadow Flicker Shadow flicker results from the passage of the blades of a rotating wind turbine between the sun and the observer. 1. The occurrence of shadow flicker depends on the location of the observer relative to the turbine and the time of day and year. 2. Frequencies of shadow flicker elicited from turbines is proportional to the rotational speed of the rotor times the number of blades and is generally between 0.5 and 1.1 Hz for typical larger turbines. 3. Shadow flicker is only present at distances of less than 1400 m from the turbine. ES 4.2.b Health Impacts of Shadow Flicker 1. Scientific evidence suggests that shadow flicker does not pose a risk for eliciting seizures as a result of photic stimulation. 004409WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-8 | Pa ge 2 . There is limited scientific evidence of an association between annoyance from prolonged shadow flicker (exceeding 30 minutes per day) and potential transitory cognitive and physical health effects. ES 4.3 Ice Throw ES 4.3.a Production of Ice Throw Ice can fall or be thrown from a wind turbine during or after an event when ice forms or accumulates on the blades. 1. The distance that a piece of ice may travel from the turbine is a function of the wind speed, the operating conditions, and the shape of the ice. 2. In most cases, ice falls within a distance from the turbine equal to the tower height, and in any case, very seldom does the distance exceed twice the total height of the turbine (tower height plus blade length). ES 4.3.b Health Impacts of Ice Throw 1. There is sufficient evidence that falling ice is physically harmful and measures should be taken to ensure that the public is not likely to encounter such ice. ES 4.4 Other Considerations In addition to the specific findings stated above for noise and vibration, shadow flicker and ice throw, the Panel concludes the following: 1. Effective public participation in and direct benefits from wind energy projects (such as receiving electricity from the neighboring wind turbines) have been shown to result in less annoyance in general and better public acceptance overall. ES 5. Best Practices Regarding Human Health Effects of Wind Turbines The best practices presented in Chapter 5 are repeated here. Broadly speaking, the term \"best practice\" refers to policies, guidelines, or recommendations that have been developed for a specific situation. Implicit in the term is that the practice is based on the best information available at the time of its institution. A best practice may be refined as more information and studies become available. The panel recognizes that in countries which are dependent on wind energy and are protective of public health, best practices have been developed and adopted. 004410WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-9 | Pa ge I n some cases, the weight of evidence for a specific practice is stronger than it is in other cases. Accordingly, best practice* may be categorized in terms of the evidence available, as follows: Descriptions of Three Best Practice Categories Category Name Description 1 Research Validated Best Practice A program, activity, or strategy that has the highest degree of proven effectiveness supported by objective and comprehensive research and evaluation. 2 Field Tested Best Practice A program, activity, or strategy that has been shown to work effectively and produce successful outcomes and is supported to some degree by subjective and objective data sources. 3 Promising Practice A program, activity, or strategy that has worked within one organization and shows promise during its early stages for becoming a best practice with long-term sustainable impact. A promising practice must have some objective basis for claiming effectiveness and must have the potential for replication among other organizations. *These categories are based on those suggested in \"Identifying and Promoting Promising Practices.\" Federal Register, Vol. 68. No 131. 131. July 2003. www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ccf/about_ccf/gbk_pdf/pp_gb k.pdf ES 5.1 Noise Evidence regarding wind turbine noise and human health is limited. There is limited evidence of an association between wind turbine noise and both annoyance and sleep disruption, depending on the sound pressure level at the location of concern. However, there are no research-based sound pressure levels that correspond to human responses to noise. A number of countries that have more experience with wind energy and are protective of public health have developed guidelines to minimize the possible adverse effects of noise. These guidelines consider time of day, land use, and ambient wind speed. The table below summarizes the guidelines of Germany (in the categories of industrial, commercial and villages) and Denmark (in the categories of sparsely populated and residential). The sound levels shown in the table are 004411WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-10 | Pa ge f or nighttime and are assumed to be taken immediately outside of the residence or building of concern. In addition, the World Health Organization recommends a maximum nighttime sound pressure level of 40 dB(A) in residential areas. Recommended setbacks corresponding to these values may be calculated by software such as WindPro or similar software. Such calculations are normally to be done as part of feasibility studies. The Panel considers the guidelines shown below to be Promising Practices (Category 3) but to embody some aspects of Field Tested Best Practices (Category 2) as well. Promising Practices for Nighttime Sound Pressure Levels by Land Use Type Land Use Sound Pressure Level, dB(A) Nighttime Limits Industrial 70 Commercial 50 Villages, mixed usage 45 Sparsely populated areas, 8 m/s wind* 44 Sparsely populated areas, 6 m/s wind* 42 Residential areas, 8 m/s wind* 39 Residential areas, 6 m/s wind* 37 *measured at 10 m above ground, outside of residence or location of concern The time period over which these noise limits are measured or calculated also makes a difference. For instance, the often-cited World Health Organization recommended nighttime noise cap of 40 dB(A) is averaged over one year (and does not refer specifically to wind turbine noise). Denmark's noise limits in the table above are calculated over a 10-minute period. These limits are in line with the noise levels that the epidemiological studies connect with insignificant reports of annoyance. The Panel recommends that noise limits such as those presented in the table above be included as part of a statewide policy regarding new wind turbine installations. In addition, suitable ranges and procedures for cases when the noise levels may be greater than those values should also be considered. The considerations should take into account trade-offs between 004412WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-11 | Pa ge e nvironmental and health impacts of different energy sources, national and state goals for energy independence, potential extent of impacts, etc. The Panel also recommends that those involved in a wind turbine purchase become familiar with the noise specifications for the turbine and factors that affect noise production and noise control. Stall and pitch regulated turbines have different noise characteristics, especially in high winds. For certain turbines, it is possible to decrease noise at night through suitable control measures (e.g., reducing the rotational speed of the rotor). If noise control measures are to be considered, the wind turbine manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that such control is possible. The Panel recommends an ongoing program of monitoring and evaluating the sound produced by wind turbines that are installed in the Commonwealth. IEC 61400-11 provides the standard for making noise measurements of wind turbines (International Electrotechnical Commission, 2002). In general, more comprehensive assessment of wind turbine noise in populated areas is recommended. These assessments should be done with reference to the broader ongoing research in wind turbine noise production and its effects, which is taking place internationally. Such assessments would be useful for refining siting guidelines and for developing best practices of a higher category. Closer investigation near homes where outdoor measurements show A and C weighting differences of greater than 15 dB is recommended. ES 5.2 Shadow Flicker Based on the scientific evidence and field experience related to shadow flicker, Germany has adopted guidelines that specify the following: 1. Shadow flicker should be calculated based on the astronomical maximum values (i.e., not considering the effect of cloud cover, etc.). 2. Commercial software such as WindPro or similar software may be used for these calculations. Such calculations should be done as part of feasibility studies for new wind turbines. 3. Shadow flicker should not occur more than 30 minutes per day and not more than 30 hours per year at the point of concern (e.g., residences). 4. Shadow flicker can be kept to acceptable levels either by setback or by control of the wind turbine. In the latter case, the wind turbine manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that such control is possible. 004413WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-12 | Pa ge T he guidelines summarized above may be considered to be a Field Tested Best Practice (Category 2). Additional studies could be performed, specifically regarding the number of hours per year that shadow flicker should be allowed, that would allow them to be placed in Research Validated (Category 1) Best Practices. ES 5.3 Ice Throw Ice falling from a wind turbine could pose a danger to human health. It is also clear that the danger is limited to those times when icing occurs and is limited to relatively close proximity to the wind turbine. Accordingly, the following should be considered Category 1 Best Practices. 1. In areas where icing events are possible, warnings should be posted so that no one passes underneath a wind turbine during an icing event and until the ice has been shed. 2. Activities in the vicinity of a wind turbine should be restricted during and immediately after icing events in consideration of the following two limits (in meters). For a turbine that may not have ice control measures, it may be assumed that ice could fall within the following limit: ()H R xthrow + =2 5 . 1max, Where: R = rotor radius (m), H = hub height (m) For ice falling from a stationary turbine, the following limit should be used: ()15 /max, H R U xfall + = Where: U = maximum likely wind speed (m/s) The choice of maximum likely wind speed should be the expected one-year return maximum, found in accordance to the International Electrotechnical Commission's design standard for wind turbines, IEC 61400-1. Danger from falling ice may also be limited by ice control measures. If ice control measures are to be considered, the wind turbine manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that such control is possible. ES 5.4 Public Participation/Annoyance There is some evidence of an association between participation, economic or otherwise, in a wind turbine project and the annoyance (or lack thereof) that affected individuals may express. Accordingly, measures taken to directly involve residents who live in close proximity 004414WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY ES-13 | Pa ge t o a wind turbine project may also serve to reduce the level of annoyance. Such measures may be considered to be a Promising Practice (Category 3). ES 5.5 Regulations/Incentives/Public Education The evidence indicates that in those parts of the world where there are a significant number of wind turbines in relatively close proximity to where people live, there is a close coupling between the development of guidelines, provision of incentives, and educating the public. The Panel suggests that the public be engaged through such strategies as education, incentives for community-owned wind developments, compensations to those experiencing documented loss of property values, comprehensive setback guidelines, and public education related to renewable energy. These multi-faceted approaches may be considered to be a Promising Practice (Category 3). 004415WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 1 | Pa ge C hapter 1 Introduction to the Study The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), convened a panel of independent experts to identify any documented or potential health impacts or risks that may be associated with exposure to wind turbines, and, specifically, to facilitate discussion of wind turbines and public health based on sound science. While the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has goals for increasing the use of wind energy from the current 40 MW to 2000 MW by the year 2020, MassDEP recognizes there are questions and concerns arising from harnessing wind energy. Although fossil fuel non-renewable sources have negative environmental and health impacts, it should be noted that the scope of the Panel's effort was focused on wind turbines and is not meant to be a comparative analysis of the relative merits of wind energy vs. nonrenewable fossil fuel sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Currently, \"regulation\" of wind turbines is done at the local level through local boards of health and zoning boards. Some members of the public have raised concerns that wind turbines may have health impacts related to noise, infrasound, vibrations, or shadow flickering generated by the turbines. The goal of the Panel's evaluation and report is to provide a review of the science that explores these concerns and provides useful information to MassDEP and MDPH and to local agencies who are often asked to respond to such concerns. The overall context for this study is that the use of wind turbines results in positive effects on public health and environmental health. For example, wind turbines operating in Massachusetts produce electricity in the amount of approximately 2,100-2,900 MWh annually per rated MW, depending on the design of the turbine and the average wind speed at the installation site. Furthermore, the use of wind turbines for electricity production in the New England electrical grid will result in a significant decrease in the consumption of conventional fuels and a corresponding decrease in the production of CO 2 and oxides of nitrogen and sulfur (see Appendix A for details). Reductions in the production of these pollutants will have demonstrable and positive benefits on human and environmental health. However, local impacts of wind turbines, whether anticipated or demonstrated, have resulted in fewer turbines being installed than might otherwise have been expected. To the extent that these impacts can be 004416WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 2 | Pa ge a meliorated, it should be possible to take advantage of the indigenous wind energy resource more effectively. The Panel consists of seven individuals with backgrounds in public health, epidemiology, toxicology, neurology and sleep medicine, neuroscience, and mechanical engineering. With the exception of two individuals (Drs. Manwell and Mills), Panel members did not have any direct experience with wind turbines. The Panel did an extensive literature review of the scientific literature (see bibliography) as well as other reports, popular media, and the public comments received by the MassDEP. 004417WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 3 | Pa ge C hapter 2 Introduction to Wind Turbines This chapter provides an introduction to wind turbines so as to provide a context for the discussion that follows. More information on wind turbines may be found in the appendices, particularly in Appendix A. 2.1 Wind Turbine Anatomy and Operation Wind turbines utilize the wind, which originates from sunlight due to the differential heating of various parts of the earth. This differential heating produces zones of high and low pressure, resulting in air movement. The motion of the air is also affected by the earth's rotation. Many countries have turned to wind power as a clean energy source because it relies on the wind, which is indefinitely renewable; it is generated \"locally,\" thereby providing a measure of energy independence; and it produces no carbon dioxide emissions when operating. There is interest in pursuing wind energy both on-land and offshore. For this report, however, the focus is on land-based installations, and all comments will focus on this technology. The development of modern wind turbines has been an evolutionary design process, applying optimization at many levels. This section gives a brief overview of the characteristics of wind turbines with some mention of the optimization parameters of interest. Appendix A provides a detailed explanation of wind energy. The main features of modern wind turbines one notices are the very tall towers, which are no longer a lattice structure but a single cylindrical-like structure and the three upwind, very long, highly contoured turbine blades. The tower design has evolved partly because of biological impact factors as well as for other practical reasons. The early lattice towers were attractive nesting sites for birds. This led to an unnecessary impact of wind turbines on bird populations. The lattice structures also had to be climbed externally by turbine technicians. The tubular towers, which are now more common, are climbed internally. This reduces the health risks for maintenance crews. The power in the wind available to a wind turbine is related to the cube of the wind speed and the square of the radius of the rotor. Not all the available power in the wind can be captured by a wind turbine, however. Betz (van Kuik, 2007) showed that the maximum power that can be extracted is 16/27 times the available power (see Appendix A). In an attempt to extract the 004418WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 4 | Pa ge m aximum power from the wind, modern turbines have very large rotors and the towers are quite high. In this way the dependence on the radius is \"optimized,\" and the dependence on the wind speed is \"optimized.\" The wind speed is higher away from the ground due to boundary layer effects, and as such, the towers are made higher in order to capture the higher speed winds (more information about the wind profiles and variability is found in Appendix A). It is noted here that the rotor radius may increase again in the future, but currently the largest rotors used on land are around 100 m in diameter. This upper limit is currently a function of the radius of curvature of the roads on which the trucks that deliver the turbine blades must drive to the installation sites. Clearance under bridges is also a factor. The efficiency with which the wind's power is captured by a particular wind turbine (i.e., how close it comes to the Betz limit) is a function of the blade design, the gearbox, the electrical generator, and the control system. The aerodynamic forces on the rotor blade play a major role. The best design maximizes lift and minimizes drag at every blade section from hub to tip. The twisted and tapered shapes of modern blades attempt to meet this optimal condition. Other factors also must be taken into consideration such as structural strength, ease of manufacturing and transport, type of materials, cost, etc. Beyond these visual features, the number of blades and speed of the tips play a role in the optimization of the performance through what is called solidity. When setting tip speeds based on number of blades, however, trade-offs exist because of the influence of these parameters on weight, cost, and noise. For instance, higher tip speeds often results in more noise. The dominance of the 3-bladed upwind systems is both historic and evolutionary. The European manufacturers moved to 3-bladed systems and installed numerous turbines, both in Europe and abroad. Upwind systems are preferable to downwind systems for on-land installations because they are quieter. The downwind configuration has certain useful features but it suffers from the interaction noise created when the blades pass through the wake that forms behind the tower. The conversion of the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy is handled by the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA), which consists of the rotor, the drive train, and various ancillary components. The rotor grouping includes the blades, the hub, and the pitch control components. The drive train includes the shafts, bearings, gearbox (not necessary for direct drive generators), 004419WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 5 | Pa ge c ouplings, mechanical brake, and generator. A schematic of the RNA, together with more detail concerning the operation of the various parts, is in Appendix A. The rotors are controlled so as to generate electricity most effectively and as such must withstand continuously fluctuating forces during normal operation and extreme loads during storms. Accordingly, in general a wind turbine rotor does not operate at its own maximum power coefficient at all wind speeds. Because of this, the power output of a wind turbine is generally described by a relationship, known as a power curve. A typical power curve is shown in the appendix. Below the cut-in speed no power is produced. Between cut-in and rated wind speed the power increases significantly with wind speed. Above the rated speed, the power produced is constant, regardless of the wind speed, and above the cut-out speed the turbine is shut down often with use of the mechanical brake. Two main types of rotor control systems exist: pitch and stall. Stall controlled turbines have fixed blades and operate at a fixed speed. The aerodynamic design of the blades is such that the power is self-limiting, as long as the generator is connected to the electrical grid. Pitch regulated turbines have blades that can be rotated about their long axis. Such an arrangement allows more precise control. Pitch controlled turbines are also generally quieter than stall controlled turbines, especially at higher wind speeds. Until recently, many turbines used stall control. At present, most large turbines use pitch control. Appendices A and F provide more details on pitch and stall. The energy production of a wind turbine is usually considered annually. Estimates are usually obtained by calculating the expected energy that will be produced every hour of a representative year (by considering the turbine's power curve and the estimated wind resource) and then summing the energy from all the hours. Sometimes a normalized term known as the capacity factor (CF) is used to characterize the performance. This is the actual energy produced (or estimated to be produced) divided by the amount of energy that would be produced if the turbine were running at its rated output for the entire year. Appendix A gives more detail on these computations. 004420WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 6 | Pa ge 2 .2 Noise from Turbines Because of the concerns about the noise generated from wind turbines, a short summary of the sources of noise is provided here. A thorough description of the various noise sources from a wind turbine is given in the text by Wagner et al. (1996). A turbine produces noise mechanically and aerodynamically. Mechanical noise sources include the gearbox, generator, yaw drives, cooling fans, and auxiliary equipment such as hydraulics. Because the emitted sound is associated with the rotation of mechanical and electrical equipment, it is often tonal. For instance, it was found that noise associated with a 1500 kW turbine with a generator running at speeds between 1100 and 1800 rpm contained a tone between 20 and 30 Hz (Betke et al., 2004). The yaw system on the other hand might produce more of a grinding type of noise but only when the yaw mechanism is engaged. The transmission of mechanical noise can be either airborne or structure-borne as the associated vibrations can be transmitted into the hub and tower and then radiated into the surrounding space. Advances in gearboxes and yaw systems have decreased these noise sources over the years. Direct drive systems will improve this even more. In addition, utility scale wind turbines are usually insulated to prevent mechanical noise from proliferating outside the nacelle or tower (Alberts, 2006) Aerodynamic sound is generated due to complex fluid-structure interactions occurring on the blades. Wagner et al. (1996) break down the sources of aerodynamic sound as follows in Table 1. 004421WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 7 | Pa ge Table 1 Sources of Aerodynamic Sound from a Wind Turbine (Wagner et al., 1996 ). Noise Type Mechanism Characteristic Trailing-edge noise Interaction of boundary layer turbulence with blade trailing edge Broadband, main source of high frequency noise (770 Hz < f < 2 kHz) Tip noise Interaction of tip turbulence with blade tip surface Broadband Stall, separation noise Interaction of turbulence with blade surface Broadband Laminar boundary layer noise Non-linear boundary layer instabilities interacting with the blade surface Tonal Blunt trailing edge noise Vortex shedding at blunt trailing edge Tonal Noise from flow over holes, slits, and intrusions Unsteady shear flows over holes and slits, vortex shedding from intrusions Tonal Inflow turbulence noise Interaction of blade with atmospheric turbulence Broadband Steady thickness noise, steady loading noise Rotation of blades or rotation of lifting surface Low frequency related to blade passing frequency (outside of audible range) Unsteady loading noise Passage of blades through varying velocities, due to pitch change or blade altitude change as it rotates* For downwind turbines passage through tower shadow Whooshing or beating, amplitude modulation of audible broadband noise. For downwind turbines, impulsive noise at blade passing frequency *van den Berg 2004. 004422WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 8 | Pa ge O f these mechanisms, the most persistent and often strongest source of aerodynamic sound from modern wind turbines is the trailing edge noise. It is also the amplitude modulation of this noise source due to the presence of atmospheric effects and directional propagation effects that result in the whooshing or beating sound often reported (van den Berg, 2004). As a turbine blade rotates through a changing wind stream, the aerodynamics change, leading to differences in the boundary layer and thus to differences in the trailing edge noise (Oerlemans, 2009). Also, the direction in which the blade is pointing changes as it rotates, leading to differences in the directivity of the noise from the trailing edge. This noise source leads to what some people call the \"whooshing\" sound. Most modern turbines use pitch control for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that at higher wind speeds, when the control system has the greatest impact, the pitch controlled turbine is quieter than a comparable stall regulated turbine would be. Appendix E shows the difference in the noise from two such systems. When discussing noise from turbines, it is important to also consider propagation effects and multiple turbine effects. One propagation effect of interest is due to the dependence of the speed of sound on temperature. When there is a large temperature gradient (which may occur during the day due to surface warming or due to topography such as hills and valleys) the path a sound wave travels will be refracted. Normally this means that during a typical day sound is \"turned\" away from the earth's surface. However, at night the sound propagates at a constant height or even be \"turned\" down toward the earth's surface, making it more noticeable than it otherwise might be. The absorption of sound by vegetation and reflection of sound from hillsides are other propagation effects of interest. Several of these effects were shown to be influencing the sound field near a few homes in North Carolina that were impacted by a wind turbine installation (Kelley et al., 1985). A downwind 2-bladed, 2 MW turbine was installed on a mountaintop in North Carolina. It created high amplitude impulsive noise due to the interaction of the blades and the tower wakes. Some homes (10 in 1000) were adversely affected by this high amplitude impulsive noise. It is shown in the report by Kelley et al. (1985) that echoes and focusing due to refraction occurred at the location of the affected homes. In flat terrain, noise in the audible range will propagate along a flat terrain in a manner such that its amplitude will decay exactly as distance from the source (1/distance). Appendix E 004423WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 9 | Pa ge p rovides formulae for approximating the overall sound level at a given distance from a source. In the inaudible range, it has been noted that often the sound behaves as if the propagation was governed by a 1/(distance)1/2 (Shepherd & Hubbard, 1991). When one considers the noise from a wind farm in which multiple turbines are located close to each other, an estimate for the overall noise from the farm can be obtained. Appendix E describes the method for obtaining the estimate. All these estimates rely on information regarding the sound power generated by the turbine at the hub height. The power level for several modern turbines is given in Appendix D. 2.2.a Measurement and Reporting of Noise Turbines produce multiple types of sound as indicated previously, and the sound is characterized in several ways: tonal or broadband, constant amplitude or amplitude modulated, and audible or infrasonic. The first two characterization pairs have been mentioned previously. Audible refers to sound with frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The waves in the infrasonic range, less than 20 Hz, may actually be audible if the amplitude of the sound is high enough. Appendix D provides a brief primer on acoustics and the hearing threshold associated with the entire frequency spectrum. Sound is simply pressure fluctuations and as such, this is what a microphone measures. However, the amplitude of the fluctuations is reported not in units of pressure (such as Pascals) but on a decibel scale. The sound pressure level (SPL) is defined by SPL = 10 log 10 [p2/p2 ref] = 20 log 10(p/pref) the resulting number having the units of decibels (dB). The reference pressure p ref for airborne sound is 20 x 10-6 Pa (i.e., 20 \u00b5Pa or 20 micro Pascals). Some implications of the decibel scale are noted in Appendix D. When sound is broadband (contains multiple frequencies), it is useful to use averages that measure approximately the amplitude of the sound and its frequency content. Standard averaging methods such as octave and 1/3-octave band are described in Appendix D. In essence, the entire frequency range is broken into chunks, and the amplitude of the sound at frequencies in each chunk is averaged. An overall sound pressure value can be obtained by averaging all of the bands. 004424WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 10 | Pa ge W hen presenting the sound pressure it is common to also use a filter or weighting. The A-weighting is commonly used in wind turbine measurements. This filter takes into account the threshold of human hearing and gives the same decibel reading at different frequencies that would equate to equal loudness. This means that at low frequencies (where amplitudes have to be incredibly high for the sound to be heard by people) a large negative weight would be applied. C-weighting only filters the levels at frequencies below about 30 Hz and above 4 kHz and filters them only slightly between 0 and 30 Hz. The weight values for both the A and C weightings filters are shown in Appendix D, and an example with actual wind turbine data is presented. There are many other weighting methods. For instance, the day-night level filter penalizes nighttime noise between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. by adding an additional 10 dB to sound produced during these hours. When analyzing wind turbine and other anthropogenic sound there is a question as to what averaging period should be used. The World Health Organization uses a yearly average. Others argue though that especially for wind turbines, which respond to seasonal variations as well as diurnal variations, much shorter averages should be considered. 2.2.b Infrasound and Low-frequency Noise (IFLN) The term infrasound refers to pressure waves with frequencies less than 20 Hz. In the infrasonic range, the amplitude of the sound must be very high for it to be audible to humans. For instance, the hearing threshold below 20 Hz requires that the amplitude be above 80 dB for it to be heard and at 5 Hz it has to be above 103 dB (O'Neal, 2011; Watanabe & Moeller, 1990). This gives little room between the audible and the pain values for the infrasound range: 165 dB at 2 Hz and 145 dB at 20 Hz cause pain (Leventhal, 2006). The low frequency range is usually characterized as 20-200 Hz (Leventhal, 2006; O'Neal, 2011). This is within the audible range but again the threshold of hearing indicates that fairly high amplitude is required in this frequency range as well. The A-weighting of sound is based upon the threshold of human hearing such that it reports the measured values adjusted by - 50 dB at 20 Hz, -10 dB at 200 Hz, and + 1 dB at 1000 Hz. The A-weighting curve is shown in Appendix D. It is known that low frequency waves propagate with less attenuation than high-frequency waves. Measurements have shown that the amplitude for the airborne infrasonic waves can be cylindrical in nature, decaying at a rate inversely proportional to the square root of the distance 004425WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 11 | Pa ge f rom the source. Normally the decay of the amplitude of an acoustic wave is inversely proportional to the distance (Shepherd & Hubbard, 1991). It is difficult to find reliable and comparable infrasound and low frequency noise (ILFN) measurement data in the peer-reviewed literature. Table 2 provides some examples of such measurements from wind turbines. For each case, the reliability of the infrasonic data is not known (the infrasonic measurement technique is not described in each report), although it is assumed that the low frequency noise was captured accurately. The method for obtaining the sound pressure level is not described for each reported data set, and some may come from averages over many day/time/wind conditions while others may be just from a single day's measurement campaign. 004426WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 12 | Pa ge Table 2 Literature-based Measurements of Wind Turbines; dB alone refers to unweighted values Turbine Rating (kW) Distance (m) Frequency Sound Pressure Level Reference 500 200 5 55 dB(G)2 Jakobsen, 20053 20 35 dB(G)2 3200 68 4 72 20053 20 50 dB(G)2 1500 65 5 >70 dB(A) Leventhal, 2006 20 60 dB(A) 100 35 dB(A) 2000 (2) 100 5 95 dB van den Berg, 20043 20 65 dB 200 55 dB 1500 98 1 90 dB Jung, 20083 10 70 dB 20 68 dB 100 68 dB 200 60 dB - 450 10 75 dB Palmer, 2010 100 55 dB 200 40 dB 2300 305 5 73 dB(A) O'Neal, 20113 20 55 dB(A) - 95 100 50 dB(A) - 70 1dB alone refers to un-weighted values. 2G weighting reflects human response to infrasound. The curve is defined to have a gain of zero dB at 10 Hz. Between 1 Hz and 20 Hz the slope is approximately 12 dB per octave. The cut-off below 1 Hz has a slope of 24 dB per octave, and above 20 Hz the slope is -24 dB per octave. Humans can hear 95 dB(G). 3Indicates peer-reviewed article. When these recorded levels are taken at face value, one might conclude that the infrasonic regime levels are well below the audible threshold. In contrast, the low frequency regime becomes audible around 30 Hz. Such data have led many researchers to conclude that the infrasound and low frequency noise from wind turbines is not an issue (Leventhal, 2009; O'Neal, 2011; Bowdler, 2009). Others who have sought explanations for complaints from those living near wind turbines have pointed to ILFN as a problem (Pierpont, 2009; Branco & Alves- 004427WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 13 | Pa ge P ereira, 2004). Some have declared the low frequency range to be of greatest concern (Kamperman et al., 2008; Jung, 2008). It is important to make the clear distinction between amplitude-modulated noise from wind turbines and the ILFN from turbines. Amplitude modulation in wind turbines noise has been discussed at length by Oerlemans (2009) and van den Berg (2004). Amplitude modulation is what causes the whooshing sound referred to as swish-swish by van den Berg (that sometimes becomes a thumping sound). The whooshing noise created by modern wind turbines occurs because of variations in the trailing edge noise produced by a rotor blade as it sweeps through its path and the directionality of the noise because of the perceived pitch of the blade at different locations along its 360 \u00b0 rotation. The sound is produced in the audible range, and it is modulated so that it is quiet and then loud and then quiet again at a rate related to the blade passing frequency (rate blades pass the tower) which is often around 1 Hz. Van den Berg (2004) noted that the level of amplitude modulation is often greater at night because the difference between the wind speed at the top and bottom of the rotor disc can be much larger at night when there is a stable atmosphere than during the day when the wind profile is less severe. It is further argued that in a stable atmosphere there is little wind near the ground so wind noise does not mask the turbine noise for a listener near the ground. Finally, atmospheric effects can change the propagation of the sound refracting the noise towards the ground rather than away from the ground. The whooshing that is heard is NOT infrasound and much of its content is not at low frequency. Most of the sound is at higher frequency and as such it will be subject to higher atmospheric attenuation than the low frequency sound. An anecdotal finding that the whooshing sound carries farther when the atmosphere is stable does not imply that it is infrasound or heavy in low frequency content, it simply implies that the refraction of the sound is also different when the atmosphere is stable. It is important to note then that when a complaint is tied to the thumping or whooshing that is being heard, the complaint may not be about ILFN at all even if the complaint mentions low frequency noise. Kamperman et al. (2008) state that, \"It is not clear to us whether the complaints about \"low frequency\" noise are about the audible low frequency part of the \"swoosh-boom\" sound, the once-per-second amplitude modulation ... of the sound, or some combination of the two.\" 004428WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 14 | Pa ge C hapter 3 Health Effects 3.1 Introduction Chapter 3 reviews the evidence for human health effects of wind turbines. Extensive literature searches and reviews were conducted to identify studies that specifically evaluate population responses to turbines, as well as population and individual responses to noise, vibration, and flicker. The biological plausibility or basis for health effects of turbines (noise, vibration, and flicker) was examined. Beyond traditional forms of scientific publications, the Panel also reviewed other non-peer reviewed materials including information related to \"Wind Turbine Syndrome\" and provides a rigorous analysis of its scientific basis. Since the most commonly reported complaint by people living near turbines is sleep disruption, the Panel provides a robust review of the relationship between noise, vibration, annoyance as well as sleep disturbance from noises and the potential impacts of the resulting sleep deprivation. In assessing the state of the evidence for health effects of wind turbines, the Panel relied on several different types of studies. It considered human studies of primary value. These were either human epidemiological studies specifically relating to exposure to wind turbines or, where specific exposures resulting from wind turbines could be defined, the Panel also considered human experimental data. Animal studies are critical to exploring biological plausibility and understanding potential biological mechanisms of different exposures, and for providing information about possible health effects when experimental research in humans is not ethically or practically possible (National Research Council (NRC), 1991). As such, this literature was also reviewed with respect to wind turbine exposures. In all cases, data quality is considered. At times some studies were rejected because of lack of rigor or the interpretations were inconsistent with the scientific evidence. These are identified in the discussion below. In the specific case of the possibility of ice being thrown from wind turbine blades, the Panel discusses the physics of such ice throw in order to provide the basis of the extent of the potential for injury from thrown ice (see Chapter 2). 004429WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 15 | Pa ge 3 .2 Human Exposures to Wind Turbines Epidemiologic study designs differ in their ability to provide evidence of an association (Ellwood, 1998). Typical study designs include randomized trials, cohort studies, and case- control studies and can include elements of prospective follow-up, retrospective assessments, or cross-sectional analysis where exposure and outcome data are essentially concurrent. Each of these designs has strengths and weaknesses and thus can provide varying levels of strength of evidence for causal associations between exposures and outcomes, which can also be affected by analytic choices. Thus, this literature needs to be examined in detail, regardless of study type, to determine strength of evidence for causality. Review of this literature began with a PubMed search for \"wind turbine\" or \"wind turbines\" to identify peer-reviewed literature pertaining to health effects of wind turbines. Titles and abstracts of identified papers were then read to make a first pass determination of whether the paper was a study on health effects of exposure to wind turbines or might possibly contain relevant references to such studies. Because the peer-reviewed literature so identified was relatively limited, we also examined several non-peer reviewed papers, reports, and books that discussed health effects of wind turbines. All of this literature was examined for additional relevant references, but for the purposes of determining strength of evidence, we only considered such publications if they described studies of some sort in sufficient detail to assess the validity of the findings. This process identified four studies that generated peer-reviewed papers on health effects of wind turbines. A few other non-peer reviewed documents described data of sufficient relevance to merit consideration and are discussed below as well. 3.3 Epidemiological Studies of Exposure to Wind Turbines The four studies that generated peer-reviewed papers on health effects of wind turbines included two from Sweden (E. Pedersen et al., 2007; E. Pedersen & Waye, 2004), one from the Netherlands (E. Pedersen et al., 2009), and one from New Zealand (Shepherd at al., 2011). The primary outcome assessed in the first three of these studies is annoyance. Annoyance per se is not a biological disease, but has been defined in different ways. For example, as \"a feeling of resentment, displeasure, discomfort, dissatisfaction, or offence which occurs when noise interferes with someone's thoughts, feelings or daily activities\" (Passchier-Vermeer, 1993); or \"a mental state characterized by distress and aversion, which if maintained, can lead to a deterioration of health and well-being\" (Shepherd et al., 2010). Annoyance is usually assessed 004430WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 16 | Pa ge w ith questionnaires, and this is the case for the three studies mentioned above. There is consistent evidence for annoyance in populations exposed for more than one year to sound levels of 37 dB(A), and severe annoyance at about 42 dB(A) (Concha-Barrientos et al., 2004). In each of those studies annoyance was assessed by questionnaire, and the respondent was asked to indicate annoyance to a number of items (including wind turbines) on a five-point scale (do not notice, notice but not annoyed, slightly annoyed, rather annoyed, very annoyed). While annoyance as such is certainly not to be dismissed, in assessing global burden of disease the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken the approach of excluding annoyance as an outcome because it is not a formally defined health outcome per se (Concha-Barrientos et al., 2004). Rather, to the extent annoyance may cause other health outcomes, those other outcomes could be considered directly. Nonetheless, because of a paucity of literature on the association between wind turbines and other health outcomes, we consider here the literature on wind turbines and annoyance. 3.3.a Swedish Studies Both Swedish studies were cross sectional and involved mailed questionnaires to potential participants. For the first Swedish study, 627 households were identified in one of five areas of Sweden chosen to have enough dwellings at varying distances from wind turbines and of comparable geographical, cultural, and topographical structure (E. Pedersen & Waye, 2004). There were 16 wind turbines in the study area and of these, 14 had a power of 600-650 kW, and the other 2 turbines had 500 kW and 150 kW. The towers were between 47 and 50 m in height. Of the turbines, 13 were WindWorld machines, 2 were Enercon, and 1 was a Vestas turbine. Questionnaires were to be filled out by one person per household who was between the ages of 18 and 75. If there was more than one such person, the one whose birthday was closest to May 20th was chosen. It is not clear how the specific 627 households were chosen, and of the 627, only 513 potential participants were identified, although it is not clear why the other households did not have potential participants. Of the 513 potential participants, 351 (68.4%) responded. The purpose of the questionnaire was masked by querying the participant about living conditions in general, some questions on which were related to wind turbines. However, a later section of the questionnaire focused more specifically on wind turbines, and so the degree to which the respondent was unaware about the focus on wind turbines is unclear. A-weighted sound levels were determined at each respondent's dwelling, and these levels were grouped into 004431WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 17 | Pa ge 6 categories (in dB(A): <30, 30-32.5, 32.5-35, 35-37.5, 37.5-40, and >40). Ninety-three percent of respondents could see a wind turbine from their dwelling. The main results of this study were that there was a significant association between noise level and annoyance. This association was attenuated when adjusted for the respondent's attitude towards the visual impact of the turbines, which itself was a strong predictor of annoyance levels, but the association with noise still persisted. Further adjustment for noise sensitivity and attitude towards wind turbines in general did not change the results. The authors indicated that the reporting of sleep disturbances went up with higher noise categories, but did not report on the significance of this association. Nor did the authors report on associations with other health-related questions that were apparently on the questionnaire (such as headache, undue tiredness, pain and stiffness in the back, neck or shoulders, or feeling tensed/stressed, or irritable). The 68% response rate in this study is reasonably good, but it is somewhat disconcerting that the response rate appeared to be higher in the two highest noise level categories (76% and 78% vs. 60-69%). It is not implausible that those who were annoyed by the turbines were more inclined to return the questionnaire. In the lowest two sound categories (<32.5 dB(A)) nobody reported being more than slightly annoyed, whereas in the highest two categories 28% (37.5-40 dB(A)) and 44% (>40 dB(A)) reported being more than slightly annoyed (unadjusted percentages). Assuming annoyance would drive returning the questionnaires, this would suggest that the percentages in the highest categories may be somewhat inflated. The limited description of the selection process in this study is a limitation as well, as is the cross sectional nature of the study. Cross-sectional studies lack the ability to determine the temporality of cause and effect; in the case of these kinds of studies, we cannot know whether the annoyance level was present before the wind turbines were operational from a cross sectional study design. Furthermore, despite efforts to blind the respondent to the emphasis on wind turbines, it is not clear to what degree this was successful. The second Swedish study (E. Pedersen & Persson Waye, 2007) took a similar approach to the first, but in this study the selection procedures were explained in more detail and were clearly rigorous. Specific details on the wind turbines in the area were not provided, but it was noted that areas were sought with wind turbines that had a nominal power of more than 500 kW, although some of the areas also contained turbines with lower power. A later publication by 004432WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 18 | Pa ge t hese authors (Pedersen et al., 2009) indicates that the turbines in this study were up to 1.5 MW and up to 65 m high. In the areas chosen, either all households were recruited or a random sample was used. In this study 1,309 questionnaires were sent out and 754 (57.6%) were returned. The response rate by noise category level, however, was not reported. There was a clear association between noise level and hearing turbine noise, with the percentage of those hearing turbine noise steadily increasing across the noise level categories. However, despite a significant unadjusted association between noise levels and annoyance (dichotomized as more than slightly annoyed or not), and after adjusting for attitude towards wind turbines or visual aspects of the turbines (e.g., visual angle on the horizon, an indicator of how prominent the turbines are in the field of view), each of which was strongly associated with annoyance, the association with noise level category was lost. The model from which this conclusion was drawn, however, imposed a linear relation on the association between noise level category and annoyance. But in the crude percentages of people annoyed across noise level categories, it appeared that the relation might not be linear, but rather most prevalent in the highest noise. The percentage of those in the highest noise level category (>40 dB(A)) reporting annoyance (~15%) appeared to be higher than among people in the lower noise categories (<5%). Given the more rigorous description of the selection process in this study, it has to be considered stronger than the first Swedish study. While 58% is pretty good for a questionnaire response rate, the non-response levels still leave room for bias. The authors do not report the response rate by noise level categories, but if the pattern is similar to the first Swedish study, it could suggest that the percentage annoyed in the highest noise category could be inflated. The cross sectional nature of the study is also a limitation and complicates interpretation of the effects on the noise-annoyance association of adjustment for the other factors. Regarding the loss of the association after adjustment for attitude, if one assumes that the noise levels caused a negative attitude towards wind turbines, then the loss of association between noise and annoyance after adjusting for attitude does not argue against annoyance being caused by increasing turbine noise, but rather that that is the path by which noise causes annoyance (louder noise\u0001negative attitude \u0001annoyance). If, on the other hand, the attitude towards turbines was not caused by the noise, then the results would suggest that noise levels did not cause the annoyance. Visual angle, however, clearly does not cause the noise level; thus, the lack of association between noise and annoyance in analyses adjusted for visual angle more strongly 004433WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 19 | Pa ge s uggest that the turbine noise level is not causing the annoyance, but perhaps the visual intrusion instead. This is similar to the conclusion of an earlier Danish report (T. H. Pedersen & Nielsen, 1994). Either way, however, the data still suggest that there may be an association between turbine noise and annoyance when the noise levels are >40 dB(A). A more intricate statistical model of the association between turbine noise levels and annoyance that used the data from both Swedish studies was reported separately (Pedersen & Larsman, 2008). The authors used structural equation models (SEMs) to simultaneously account for several aspects of visual attitude towards the turbines and general attitude towards the turbines. These analyses suggested a significant association between noise levels and annoyance even after considering other factors. 3.3.b Dutch Study The Dutch study aimed to recruit households that reflected general wind turbine exposure conditions over a range of background sound levels. All areas within the Netherlands that were characterized by one of three clearly defined land-use types\u2014built-up area, rural area with a main road, and rural area without a main road\u2014and that had at least two wind turbines of at least 500 kW within 500 meters of each other were selected for the study. Sites dominated by industry or business were excluded. All addresses within these areas were obtained and classified into one of five wind turbine noise categories (<30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, and >45 dB(A)) based on characteristics of nearby wind turbines, measurements of sound from those turbines, and the International Standards Organization (ISO) standard model of wind turbine noise propagation. Individual households were randomly selected for recruitment within noise/land type categories, except for the highest noise level for which all households were selected because of the small number exposed at the wind turbine noise levels of the highest category. As with the Swedish studies, the Dutch study was cross sectional and involved a mailed questionnaire modeled on the one used in the Swedish studies. Of 1,948 mailed surveys, 725 (37%) were returned. There was only minor variation in response rate by turbine noise category, although unlike the Swedish studies, the response rate was slightly lower in the higher noise categories. A random sample of 200 non-responders was sent an abbreviated questionnaire asking only two questions about annoyance from wind turbine noise. There was no difference in 004434WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 20 | Pa ge t he distribution of answers to these questions among these non-responders and those who responded to the full questionnaire. One of the more dramatic findings of this study was that among people who benefited economically from the turbines (n=100; 14%)\u2014who were much more commonly in the higher noise categories\u2014there was virtually no annoyance (3%) despite the same pattern of noticing the noise as those who did not benefit economically. It is possible that this is because attitude towards turbines drives annoyance, but it was also suggested that those who benefit economically are able to turn off the turbines when they become annoying. However, it is not clear how many of those who benefited economically actually had that level of control over the turbines. Similarly, there was very little annoyance among people who could not see a wind turbine from their residence even when those people were in higher noise categories (although none were in the highest category). In models that adjusted for visibility of wind turbines and economic benefit, sound level was still a significant predictor of annoyance. However, because of the way in which sound and visibility were modeled in this analysis, the association between higher noise levels and higher annoyance could have been driven entirely by those who could see a wind turbine, while there could still have been no association between wind turbine noise level and annoyance among those who could not see a wind turbine. Thus, this study has to be considered inconclusive with respect to an association between wind turbine sound level and annoyance independent of the effect of seeing a wind turbine (and vice versa). The Dutch study has the limitation of being cross sectional as were the Swedish studies, and the non-response in the Dutch study was much larger than in the Swedish studies. The results of the limited assessment of a subset of non-responders mitigate somewhat against the concerns raised by the low response rate, but not completely. 3.3.c New Zealand Study The New Zealand study recruited participants from what the authors refer to as two demographically matched neighborhoods (an exposed group living near wind turbines and a control group living far from turbines), although supporting data for this are not presented. The area with the turbines is described as being characterized by hilly terrain, with long ridges running 250-450 m above sea level, on which 66 125 m high wind turbines are positioned. The power of the turbines is not provided. For the exposed group, participants were drawn from 004435WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 21 | Pa ge t hose 18 years and older living in 56 houses located within 2 km of a wind turbine, and for the control group participants were drawn from those 18 years and older living in 250 houses located at least 8 km from the wind turbines. It is unclear how many participants per household were recruited, but the final study sample included 39 people in the exposed group and 158 in the control group. Response rates of 34% for the exposed group and 32% for the control group are given. The outcome assessed was response to the abbreviated version of the WHO's quality of life (QOL)-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)\u2014a health-related QOL questionnaire. These questions were embedded within a larger questionnaire with various facets designed to mask the focus on wind turbines. Although there were no statistically significant demographic differences between the two groups, 43.6% of those in the exposed group had a university education while only 34.2% in the control group did. The exposed group was found to have significantly worse physical QOL (in particular the sleep and energy level items of this scale) and worse environmental QOL (in particular ratings of how healthy the environment is and satisfaction with the conditions of their living space). The groups did not differ in scores on the social or psychological scales. The mean ratings for an overall QOL item was significantly lower in the exposed group. All of these analyses were adjusted for length of residence, but for no other variables. As with the other studies discussed, this study has the limitation of being cross sectional. As with the Dutch study, the response rate in the present study is rather low, and unfortunately, there are no data in the New Zealand study on non-participants. This raises concern that self- selection into the study could differ by important factors in some way between the two groups. The difference seen in education level between the groups exacerbates this concern. It is also unclear whether appropriate statistical analysis methods were used given that there may have been multiple respondents from the same household, which is not stated but would have needed to have been accounted for in the analysis. The lack of control for other variables that may be related to reporting of QOL is also a limitation. In this regard it is important to note that a lack of a statistically significant difference in factors between groups does not rule out the possibility of those factors potentially accounting for some of the difference in outcome scores between groups, particularly when the sample size is small like in this study. Whether participants could see wind turbines was not assessed, but it is likely that most if not all in the exposed group could and most if not all in the control group could not, given their locations. Given the findings in the 004436WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 22 | Pa ge S wedish and Dutch studies, this means that even if the difference in QOL scores seen are due to wind turbines, it is possible that it is driven by seeing the turbines rather than sound from the turbines. Overall, the level of evidence from this study for a causal association between wind turbines and reported QOL is limited. 3.3.d Additional Non-Peer Reviewed Documents Papers that appear in the peer-reviewed literature have by definition undergone a level of review external to the study team by not only the editors of the journal, but also two to three (usually) scientists familiar with the field of the study and the methodology used. These hurdles provide an opportunity to identify problems with the paper\u2014from methodology to interpretation of the results\u2014and either provide the opportunity to address problems or reject the paper if the problems are considered fatal to the interpretation of the results. Non-peer reviewed literature is not subject to this external review scrutiny. This does not mean that all peer-reviewed literature is of high quality nor that non-peered reviewed literature is necessarily inferior to peer-reviewed literature, but it does mean that non-peered reviewed literature does not need to undergo any review process to appear. Indeed, at times studies appear in non-peer reviewed outlets precisely because they did not meet the bar of quality necessary to appear in the peer-reviewed literature. Thus, non-peer reviewed literature needs to be scrutinized with this in mind. Four such non- peer-reviewed reports are described below. In addition to those four, a few early reports of annoyance from wind turbines generally found a weak relationship between annoyance and the equivalent A-weighted SPL, although those studies were mainly based on studies of smaller turbines of less than 500 kW (T. H. Pedersen & Nielsen, 1994; Rand & Clarke, 1990; Wolsink et al., 1993). Project WINDFARMperception: Visual and acoustic impact of wind turbine farms on residents (van den Berg et al., 2008). This report describes the study upon which the Dutch paper summarized above (E. Pedersen et al., 2009) is based. The characteristics of the wind turbines are thus as described above. In addition to the data that appeared in the peer-reviewed literature, this report describes analyses of additional data that was collected. These additional data relate to health effects and turbine noise exposure. The questionnaire assessed stress levels with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a validated scale that has been widely used in such studies and which assesses symptoms felt over the past several weeks. In models adjusted for age, economic benefit from the turbines, and sex, there was no association between sound 004437WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 23 | Pa ge l evels and stress. In contrast, there was a significant association between sound levels and interrupted sleep (at least once a month), even when further adjusting for background noise levels. This was most obvious at turbine noise levels >45 dB(A), but there appeared to be an increasing trend in occurrence of interrupted sleep with increasing noise categories even across the lower noise categories. This study also asked participants about chronic health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and migraine. Although no associations were seen between wind turbine noise and these outcomes in adjusted analyses, the chronic nature of these outcomes and the lack of data on timing of onset with respect to when the wind turbines were introduced make interpreting these negative findings difficult. Report to the commission related to Moturimu wind farm, New Zealand (Phipps, 2007). This report to a commission in New Zealand related to the Moturimu wind farm describes a survey conducted by Robyn Phipps to investigate the visual and acoustical effects experienced by residents living at least 2 km from existing wind farms in the Manawatu and Tararua regions of New Zealand. Most respondents were within 3 km, although a few lived further away, as far as 15 km. The characteristics and number of wind turbines was not provided. Although this work does not appear to have come out in the peer-reviewed literature, reasonable details about the methodology are provided. Roughly 1,100 surveys were delivered to postal addresses and 614 (56%) were returned. Participants were asked to rate on a scale of 1-5 their agreement with different statements related to their perceptions of the wind turbines. When these questions dealt with visual issues, they were framed both positively and negatively (e.g., \"I think the turbines spoil the view,\" and \"I think the turbines are quite attractive\"). This apparently was not the case with other questions (e.g., \"Watching the turbines can create an unpleasant physical sensation in my body\"). Overall, 9% of respondents endorsed being \"affected\" by the flicker of the wind turbines; 15% were sufficiently bothered by the visual and noise effects of the turbines to consider complaining, and 10% actually had complained. While 56% is a relatively good response rate for a mailed survey, the reasons for non-response of nearly half of potential participants must be considered. It is possible that non-respondents did not care enough about the effects of the wind turbines to bother responding, which presumably would lower the overall percentages that were \"affected\" by the turbines. On the other hand, it is not clear how long the turbines were in 004438WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 24 | Pa ge o peration prior to the survey, and it is conceivable that some more affected people may have moved out of the area before the time of the survey. A further drawback to the reported survey was that there was not a determination of how the percentage of \"affected\" respondents related to distance from the turbines, the ability to see the turbines, or noise levels experienced from the turbines. The report cites a lot of literature on noise and health effects, and while such effects have been reported in the literature, they are almost uniformly at sound levels above what is usually found for people living near turbines (and most certainly higher than those usually reported for people living more than 2 km from a turbine). A WHO report provides a good review of this literature (WHO, 2009). The lowest threshold levels for seeing any effect are about 35 dB(A) (maximum per event or L Amax) for some physiological sleep responses (e.g., EEG, or duration of sleep stages), but these thresholds are for levels inside the house near the sleeper, which will be much lower than what is experienced outside the house. The lowest threshold level for complaints of well-being were estimated at 35 dB(A) as a yearly average outside the house at night (L night, outside). But for health outcomes the thresholds for any effect are much higher, for example 50 dB(A) (L night, outside) for hypertension or myocardial infarction. \"Wind Turbine Syndrome\" (Pierpont, 2009) : This book describes several people who suffer health symptoms that they attribute to wind turbines. Such descriptions can be informative in describing phenomena and raising suggestions for possible follow-up with more rigorous study designs, but generally are not considered evidence for causality. In this particular case, though, there are elements that go beyond the most basic symptom descriptions and so warrant consideration as a study. But limitations to the design employed make it impossible for this work to contribute any evidence to the question of whether there is a causal association between wind turbine exposure and health effects. Given this, the very term \"Wind Turbine Syndrome\" is misleading as it implies a causal role for wind turbines in the described health symptoms. The book describes health symptoms experienced among 38 people from 10 different families who lived near wind turbines and subsequently either moved away from the turbines or spent significant periods of time away. The participants ranged in age from less than 1 to 75 years old, with 13 (34%) younger than 16 years and 17 (45%) younger than 22. The participants were queried about their health symptoms before exposure to turbines (presumably before the 004439WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 25 | Pa ge t urbines were operational), during exposure to turbines, and after moving away. There is an impressive detailed description of the extent and severity of health symptoms experienced by this group, with a core group of symptoms centered around vibratory responses and termed Visceral Vibratory Vestibular Disturbance (VVVD) by Pierpont. While these symptoms for the most part are attributed to exposure to the wind turbines by the participants\u2014either because they appeared once the turbines were operational or because they seemed to diminish after going away from the turbines\u2014the way in which these participants were recruited makes it impossible to draw any conclusions about attributing causality to the turbines. The most critical problem with respect to inferring causality from Pierpont's findings lies in how the families were identified for participation. To be included in the study, among other criteria, at least one family member had to have severe symptoms and reside near a recently erected wind turbine. In epidemiological terms this is selecting participants based on both exposure and outcome, which guarantees a biased (non-causal) association between wind turbines and symptoms. While it could be argued that other family members may not have had severe symptoms\u2014and so would not be selected based on outcome\u2014it is hard to consider other family members as truly independent observations, as their reporting of symptoms, or indeed their experiencing of symptoms, could be influenced by the more severely affected family member. This is particularly so when the symptoms are in the realm of anxiety, sleep disturbance, memory, and concentration; and the severely affected family members are reporting increased irritability, anger, and shouting. Although not always, several of the participants reported an improvement of symptoms after moving away from the wind turbines. While this is suggestive and should not be discounted as something to explore further, the highly selective nature of the interviewed group as a whole makes the evidence for causality from these data per se weak. There are also many factors that change when moving, making it difficult to attribute changes to any specific difference with certainty. Additional factors that contribute to the inability to infer causality from these data include the small sample size, lack of detail on the larger population that could have been considered for inclusion in the study, and lack of detail on precisely how the actual participants were recruited. In addition, while the clinical history was extensive, the symptom data were all self-reported. Another complication is that there are no precise data on distance to turbines, and noise levels or infrasound vibration levels at the participants' homes. 004440WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 26 | Pa ge \" Adverse health effects of industrial wind turbines: a preliminary report\" (Nissenbaum et al., 2011) : This report describes a study involving questionnaire assessment of mental and physical health (SF-36), sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) among residents near one of two wind farms in Maine (Vinalhaven & Mars Hill). The Mars Hill site is a linear arrangement of 28 General Electric 1.5 MW turbines, sited on a ridgeline. The Vinalhaven site is a cluster of three similar turbines, sited on a flat, tree-covered island. All residents within 1.5 km of one of the turbines were identified, and all those older than 18 years and non-demented were considered eligible for the study. A set of households from an area of similar socioeconomic makeup but 3-7 km from wind turbines were also recruited. The recruitment process involved house-to-house visits up to three times to recruit participants. Among those within at most 1.5 km from the nearest turbine, 65 adults were identified and 38 (58%; 22 male, 16 female) participated from 23 unique households. Among those 3-7 km from the nearest turbine, houses were visited until a similar number of participants were recruited. This process successfully recruited 41 adults (18 male, 23 female) from 33 unique households. No information was given on the number of homes or people approached so the participation rate cannot be determined. Analyses adjusted for age, sex, and site (the two different wind farms) found that those living within 1.5 km of a wind turbine had worse sleep quality and mental health scores and higher ratings of sleepiness than those living 3-7 km from a turbine. Physical health scores did not differ between the groups. Similar associations were found when distance to the nearest turbine was analyzed as a continuous variable. This study is somewhat limited by its size\u2014much smaller than the Swedish or Dutch studies described above\u2014but nonetheless suggests relevant potential health impacts of living near wind turbines. There are, however, critical details left out of the report that make it difficult to fully assess the strength of this evidence. In particular, critical details of the group living 3-7 km from wind turbines is left out. It is stated that the area is of similar socioeconomic makeup, and while this may be the case, no data to back this up are presented\u2014either on an area level or on an individual participant level. In addition, while the selection process for these participants is described as random, the process of recruiting these participants by going home to home until a certain number of participants are reached is not random. Given this, details of how homes were identified, how many homes/people were approached, and differences between those who 004441WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 27 | Pa ge d id and did not participate are important to know. Without this, attributing any of the observed associations to the wind turbines (either noise from them or the sight of them) is premature. 3.3.e Summary of Epidemiological Data There is only a limited literature of epidemiological studies on health effects of wind turbines. Furthermore, existing studies are limited by their cross sectional design, self-reported symptoms, limited ability to control for other factors, and to varying degrees of non-response rates. The study that accounted most extensively for other factors that could affect reported symptoms had a very low response rate (E. Pedersen et al., 2009; van den Berg, et al., 2008). All four peer-reviewed papers discussed above suggested an association between increasing sound levels from wind turbines and increasing annoyance. Such an association was also suggested by two of the non-peer reviewed reports that met at least basic criteria to be considered studies. The only two papers to consider the influence of seeing a wind turbine (each one of the peer-reviewed papers) both found a strong association between seeing a turbine and annoyance. Furthermore, in the studies with available data, the influence of either sound from a turbine or seeing a turbine was reduced\u2014if not eliminated, as was the case for sound in one study\u2014when both of these factors were considered together. However, this precise relation cannot be disentangled from the existing literature because the published analyses do not properly account for both seeing and hearing wind turbines given the relation between these two that the data seem to suggest. Specifically, the possibility that there may be an association between either of those factors and annoyance, but possibly only for those who both see and hear sound from a turbine, and not for those who either do not hear sound from or do not see a turbine. Furthermore, in the one study to consider whether individuals benefit economically from the turbines in question, there appeared to be virtually no annoyance regardless of whether those people could see or hear a turbine. Even if one considers the data just for those who could see a wind turbine and did not benefit economically from the turbines, defining at what noise levels the percentage of those annoyed becomes more dramatic is difficult. Higher percentages of annoyance did appear to be more consistent above 40 dB(A). Roughly 27% were annoyed (at least 4 on a 1-5 point scale of annoyance; 5 being the worst), while roughly 18% were very annoyed (5 on a 1-5 scale). The equivalent levels of annoyed and very annoyed for 35-40 dB(A) were roughly 15% and 6%, respectively. These percentages, however, should be considered upper bounds for a specific relation with noise levels because, with respect to 004442WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 28 | Pa ge e stimating direct effects of noise, they are likely inflated as a result of both selective participation in the studies and the fact that the percentages do not take into account the effect of seeing a turbine. Thus, in considering simply exposure to wind turbines in general, while all seem to suggest an association with annoyance, because even the peer-reviewed papers have weaknesses, including the cross sectional designs and sometimes quite low response rates, the Panel concludes that there is limited evidence suggesting an association between exposure to wind turbines and annoyance . However, only two of the studies considered both seeing and hearing wind turbines, and even in these the possible contributions of seeing and hearing a wind turbine were not properly disentangled. Therefore, the Panel concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is an association between noise from wind turbines and annoyance independent from the effects of seeing a wind turbine and vice versa . Even these conclusions must be considered in light of the possibility suggested from one of the peer- reviewed studies that there is extremely low annoyance\u2014regardless of seeing or hearing sound from a wind turbine\u2014among people who benefit economically from the turbines. There was also the suggestion that poorer sleep was related to wind turbine noise levels. While it intuitively makes sense that more noise would lead to more sleep disruption, there is limited data to inform whether this is occurring at the noise levels produced from wind turbines. An association was indicated in the New Zealand study, suggested without presenting details in one of the Swedish studies, and found in two non-peer-reviewed studies. Therefore, the Panel concludes that there is limited evidence suggesting an association between noise from wind turbines and sleep disruption and that further study would quantify precise sound levels from wind turbines that disrupt sleep . The strongest epidemiological study to examine the association between noise and psychological health suggests there is not an association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems. There were two smaller, weaker, studies: one did note an association, one did not. Therefore, the Panel concludes the weight of the evidence suggests no association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems. One Swedish study apparently collected data on headache, undue tiredness, pain and stiffness in the back, neck, or shoulders, or feeling tensed/stressed and irritable, but did not report 004443WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 29 | Pa ge o n analyses of these data. The Dutch study found no association between noise from wind turbines and diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and migraine, although this was not reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, the Panel concludes that none of the limited epidemiological evidence reviewed suggests an association between noise from wind turbines and pain and stiffness, diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and headache/migraine. These conclusions align with those presented in the peer-reviewed article by Knopper and Ollson (2011). They write \"Conclusions of the peer reviewed literature differ in some ways from those in the popular literature. In peer reviewed studies, wind turbine annoyance has been statistically associated with wind turbine noise, but found to be more strongly related to visual impact, attitude to wind turbines and sensitivity to noise. ... it is acknowledged that noise from wind turbines can be annoying to some and associated with some reported health effects (e.g., sleep disturbance), especially when found at sound pressure levels greater than 40 db(A).\" 3.4 Exposures from Wind Turbines: Noise, Vibration, Shadow Flicker, and Ice Throw In addition to the human epidemiologic study literature on exposure to wind turbines and health effects described in the section above, the Panel assessed literature that could shed light on specific exposures resulting from wind turbines and possible health effects. The exposures covered here include noise and vibration, shadow flicker, and ice throw. Each of these exposures is addressed separately in light of their documented and potential health effects. When health effects are described in the popular media, these claims are discussed. 3.4.a Potential Health Effects Associated with Noise and Vibration The epidemiologic studies discussed above point to noise from wind turbines as a source of annoyance. The studies also noted that some respondents note sleep disruption due to the turbine noise. In this section, the characteristics of audible and inaudible noise from turbines are discussed in light of our understanding of their impacts on human health. It is clear that when sound levels get too high, the sound can cause hearing loss (Concha- Barrientos et al., 2004). These sound levels, however, are outside the range of what one would experience from a wind turbine. There is evidence that levels of audible noise below levels that cause hearing loss can have a variety of health effects or indicators. Detail about the evidence for such health effects have been well summarized in a WHO report that came to several relevant conclusions (WHO, 2009). First, there is sufficient evidence for biological effects of noise 004444WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 30 | Pa ge d uring sleep: increase in heart rate, arousals, sleep stage changes and awakening; second, there is limited evidence that noise at night causes hormone level changes and clinical conditions such as cardiovascular illness, depression, and other mental illness. What the WHO report also details is observable noise threshold levels for these potential effects. For such health effects, where data are sufficient to estimate a threshold level, that level is never below 40 dB(A)\u2014as a yearly average\u2014for noise outside (ambient noise) at night\u2014and these estimates take into account sleeping with windows slightly open. One difficulty with the WHO threshold estimate is that a yearly average can mask the particular quality of turbine noise that leads survey respondents to note annoyance or sleep disruption. For instance, the pulsatile nature of wind turbine noise has been shown to lead to respondents claiming annoyance at a lower averaged sound level than for road noise (E. Pederson, 2004). Yearly averaging of sound eliminates (or smooths) the fluctuations in the sound and ignores differences between day and night levels. Regulations may or may not take this into account. Health conditions caused by intense vibration are documented in the literature. These are the types of exposures that result from jackhammers, vibrating hand tools, pneumatic tools, etc. In these cases, the vibration is called arm-body or whole-body vibration. Vibration can cause changes in tendons, muscles, bones and joints, and can affect the nervous system. Collectively, these effects are known as Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS). Guidelines and interventions are intended to protect workers from these vibration-induced effects (reviewed by European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2008; (NIOSH 1989). OSHA does not have standards concerning vibration exposure. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has developed Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for vibration exposure to hand-held tools. The exposure limits are given as frequency-weighted acceleration (NIOSH, 1989). 3.4.a.i Impact of Noise from Wind Turbines on Sleep The epidemiological studies indicate that noise and/or vibration from wind turbines has been noted as causing sleep disruption. In this section sleep and sleep disruption are discussed. In addition, suggestions are provided for more definitively evaluating the impact of wind turbines on sleep. 004445WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 31 | Pa ge A ll sounds have the potential to disrupt sleep. Since wind turbines produce sounds, they might cause sleep disruption. A very loud wind turbine at close distance would likely disrupt sleep, particularly in vulnerable populations (such as those with insomnia or mood disorders, aging populations, or \"light sleepers\"), while a relatively quiet wind turbine would not be expected to disrupt even the lightest of sleepers, particularly if it were placed at considerable distance. There is insufficient evidence to provide very specific information about how likely particular sound-pressure thresholds of wind turbines are at disrupting sleep. Physiologic studies of noises from wind turbines introduced to sleeping people would provide these specific levels. Borrowing existing data (e.g., Basner, 2011) and guidelines (e.g., WHO) about noises at night, beyond wind turbines, might help provide reasonable judgment about noise limits at night. But it would be optimal to have specific data about the particular influence that wind turbines have on sleep. In this section we introduce broad concepts about sleep, the interaction of sleep and noises, and the potential for wind turbines to cause that disruption. Sleep Sleep is a naturally occurring state of altered consciousness and reduced physical activity that interacts with all aspects of our physiology and contributes daily to our health and well- being. Measurements of sleep in people are typically performed with recordings that include electroencephalography (EEG). This can be performed in a laboratory or home, and for clinical or experimental purposes. Other physiological parameters are also commonly measured, including muscle movements, lung, and heart function. While the precise amount of sleep that a person requires is not known, and likely varies across different people and different ages, there are numerous consequences of reduced sleep (i.e., sleep deprivation). Deficiencies of sleep can take numerous forms, including the inability to initiate sleep; the inability to maintain sleep; abnormal composition of sleep itself, such as too little deep sleep (sometimes called slow-wave sleep, or stage N3); or frequent brief disruptions of sleep, called arousals. Sources of sleep deprivation can be voluntary (desirable or undesirable) or involuntary. Voluntary sources include staying awake late at night or awakening early. These can be for 004446WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 32 | Pa ge w ork or school, or while engaging in some personal activities during normal sleep times. Sleep deprivation can also be caused by myriad involuntary and undesired problems (including those internal to the body such as pain, anxiety, mood disorders) and frequent need to urinate, or by numerous sleep disorders (including insomnia, sleep apnea, circadian disorders, parasomnias, sleep-related movement disorders, etc), or simply by the lightening of sleep depth in normal aging. Finally, sleep deprivation can be caused by numerous external factors, such as noises or other sensory information in the sleeper's environment. Sleep is conventionally categorized into rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Within the non-REM sleep are several stages of sleep ranging from light sleep to deep sleep. Beyond these traditional sleep categories, the EEG signal can be analyzed in a more detailed and sophisticated way, including looking at the frequency composition of the signals. This is important in sleep, as we now know that certain signatures in the brain waves (i.e., EEG) disclose information about who is vulnerable to noise-induced sleep disruption, and what moments within sleep are most vulnerable (Dang-Vu et al., 2010; McKinney et al., 2011). Insomnia can be characterized by a person having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep that is not better explained by another condition (such as pain or another sleep disorder) (see ICSD, 2nd Edition for details of the diagnostic criteria for insomnia). Approximately 25% of the general population experience occasional sleep deprivation or insomnia. Sleep deprivation is defined by reduced quantity or quality of sleep, and it can result in excessive daytime sleepiness as well as problems including those associated with mood and cognitive function (Roth et al., 2001; Rogers, 2007; Walker, 2008). As might be expected, the severity of the sleep deprivation has an impact on the level of cognitive functioning, and real-life consequences can include driving accidents, impulsive behaviors, errors in attention, and mood problems (Rogers, 2007; Killgore, 2010). Loss of sleep appears to be cumulative, meaning it adds up night after night. This can result in subtle impairments in reaction times, decision-making ability, attentional vigilance, and integration of information that is sometimes only apparent to the sleep-deprived individual after an accident or error occurs, and sometimes not perceived by the sleep-deprived person at all (Rogers, 2007; van Dongen 2003). Sleep and Wind Turbines Given the effects of sleep deprivation on health and well-being, including problems with mood and cognition, it is possible that cognitive and mood complaints and other medical or 004447WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 33 | Pa ge p sychological issues associated with sleep loss can stem from living in immediate proximity to wind turbines, if the turbines disrupt sleep. Existing data, however, on the relationship between wind turbines and sleep are inadequate. Numerous factors determine whether a sound disrupts sleep. Broadly speaking, they are derived from factors about the sleeper and factors about the sound. Case reports of subjective complaints about sleep, particularly those not critically and objectively appraised in the normal scientific manner, are the lowest level of evidence, not simply because they lack any objective measurements, but also because they lack the level of scrutiny considered satisfactory for making even crude claims about cause and effect. For instance, consider the case of a person who sleeps poorly at home (near a wind turbine), and sleeps better when on vacation (away from a wind turbine). One might conclude from this case that wind turbines cause sleep disruption for this person, and even generalize that information to other people. But there are numerous factors that might make it more likely that a person can sleep well on vacation, having nothing to do with the wind turbine. Furthermore, given the enormous prevalence of sleep disorders, such as insomnia, and the potentially larger prevalence of disorders that impinge on sleep, such as depression, it is crucial that these factors be taken into consideration when weighing the evidence pointing to a causal effect of wind turbines on sleep disruption for the general population. It is also important to obtain objective measurements of sleep, in addition to subjective complaints. Subjective reports of sleeping well or sleeping poorly can be misleading or even inaccurate. People can underestimate or overestimate the quality of their sleep. Future studies should examine the acoustic properties of wind turbines when assessing the elements that might disrupt sleep. There are unique properties of the noises wind turbines make, and there are some acoustic properties in common with other noises (such as trucks or trains or airplanes). It is important to make these distinctions when assessing the effects of wind turbines on noise, by using data from other noises. Without this physiologic, objective information, the effects of wind turbines on sleep might be over- or underestimated. It should be noted that not all sounds impair the ability to fall asleep or maintain sleep. To the contrary, people commonly use sound-masking techniques by introducing sounds in the environment that hinder the perception of undesirable noises. Colloquially, this is sometimes called \"white noise,\" and there are certain key acoustic properties to these kinds of sounds that 004448WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 34 | Pa ge m ake them more effective than other sounds. Different noises can affect people differently. The emotional valence that is ascribed by an individual to a particular sound can have a major influence on the ability to initiate or maintain sleep. Certain aspects of sounds are particularly alerting and therefore would be more likely to disrupt sleep at lower sound pressure levels. But among those that are not, there is a wide range of responses to these sounds, depending partly on the emotional valence ascribed to them. A noise, for instance, that is associated with a distressing object, is more likely to impede sleep onset. Finally, characteristics of sleep physiology change across a given night of sleep\u2014and across the life cycle of a person\u2014and are different for different people, including the effects of noise on sleep (e.g., Dang-Vu et al., 2010; McKinney et al., 2011). And some people might initially have difficulty with noises at night, but habituate to them with repeated exposure (Basner, 2011). In summary, sleep is a complex biological state, important for health and well-being across a wide range of physiologic functions. To date, no study has adequately examined the influence of wind turbines on sleep. Future directions: The precise effects of noise-induced sleep disruption from wind turbines may benefit from further study that examines sound-pressure levels near the sleeper, while simultaneously measuring sleep physiology to determine responses of sleep to a variety of levels of noise produced by wind turbines. The purpose would be to understand the precise sound-pressure levels that are least likely to disturb sleep. It would also be helpful to examine whether sleepers might habituate to these noises, making the impact of a given sound less and less over time. Finally, it would be helpful to study these effects in susceptible populations, including those with insomnia or mood disorders or in aging populations, in addition to the general population. Summary of Sleep Data In summary, sleep is a complex biological state, important for health and well-being across a wide range of physiologic functions. To date, no study has adequately examined the influence of wind turbines and their effects on sleep. 3.4.b Shadow Flicker Considerations and Potential Health Effects Shadow flicker is caused when changes in light intensity occur from rotating wind turbine blades that cast shadows (see Appendix B for more details on the physics of the 004449WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 35 | Pa ge p henomenon.) These shadows move on the ground and on buildings and structures and vary in terms of frequency rate and intensity. Shadow flicker is reported to be less of a problem in the United States than in Northern Europe due to higher latitudes and lower sun angles in Europe. Nonetheless, it can still be a considerable nuisance to individuals exposed to shadow flicker for considerable amounts of time per day or year in the United States as well. Shadow flicker can vary significantly by wind speed and duration, geographic location of the sunlight, and the distance from the turbine blades to any relevant structures or buildings. In general, shadow flicker branches out from the wind turbine in a declining butterfly wing characteristic geographic area with higher amounts of flicker being closer to the turbine and less flicker in the outer parts of the geographic area (New England Wind Energy Education Project (NEWEEP), 2011; Smedley et al., 2010). Shadow flicker is present up until approximately 1400 m, but the strongest flicker is up to 400 m from the turbine when it occurs (NEWEEP, 2011). In addition, shadow flicker usually occurs in the morning and evening close to sunrise and sunset when shadows are the longest. Furthermore, shadow flicker can fluctuate in different seasons of the year depending on the geographic location of the turbine such that some sites will only report flicker during the winter months while others will report it during summer months. Other factors that determine shadow flicker rates and intensity include objects in the landscape (i.e., trees and other existing shadows) and weather patterns. For instance, there is no shadow flicker on cloudy days without sun as compared with sunny days. Also, shadow flicker speed (shadows passing per second) increases with the rotor speed (NRC, 2007). In addition, when several turbines are located relatively close to one another there can be combined flicker from the different blades of the different turbines and conversely, if situated on different geographic areas around structures, shadow flicker can occur at different times of the day at the same site from the different turbines so pre-planning of siting location is very important (Harding et al., 2008). General consensus in Germany resulted in the guidance of 30 hours per year and 30 minutes per day (based on astronomical, clear sky calculations) as acceptable limits for shadow flicker from wind turbines (NRC, 2007). This is similar to the Denmark guidance of 10 hours per year based on actual conditions. 3.4.b.i Potential Health Effects of Flicker Because some individuals are predisposed to have seizures when exposed to certain types of flashing lights, there has been concern that wind turbines had the potential to cause seizures in 004450WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 36 | P a geth ese vulnerable individuals. In fact, seizures caused by visual or photic stimuli are typically observed in people with certain types of epilepsy (Guerrini & Genton, 2004), particularly generalized epilepsy. While it is not precisely known how many people have photosensitivity that causes seizures, it appears to be approximately 5% of people with epilepsy, amounting to about 100,000 people in the United States. And many of these people will already be treated with antiepileptic medications thus reducing this risk further. Fortunately, not all flashing light will elicit a seizure, even in untreated people with known photosensitivity. There are several key factors that likely need to simultaneously occur in order for the stimulus to induce a seizure, even among the fraction of people with photosensitive seizures. The frequency of the stimulus is important as is the stimulus area and pattern (See below) (http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/aboutepilepsy/seiz u res/photosensitivity/gerba.cfm ). Frequencies above 10 Hz are more likely to cause epileptic seizures in vulnerable individuals, and seizures caused by photic stimulation are generally produced at frequencies ranging from greater than 5 Hz. However, shadow flicker frequencies from wind turbines are related to the rotor frequency and this usually results in 0.3-1.0 Hz, which is outside of the range of seizure thresholds according to the National Resource Council and the Epilepsy Foundation (NRC, 2007). In fact, studies performed by Harding et al. (2008) initially concluded that because light flicker can affect the entire retina, and even if the eyes are closed that intermittent light can get in the retina, suggested that 4 km would be a safe distance to avoid seizure risk based on shadow flicker (Harding et al., 2008). However, a follow-up analysis considering different meteorological conditions and shadow flicker rates concluded that there appeared to be no risk for seizures unless a vulnerable individual was closer than 1.2 times the total turbine height on land and 2.8 times the total turbine height in the water, which could potentially result in frequencies of greater than 5 Hz (Smedley et al., 2010). Although some individuals have complained of additional health complaints including migraines, nausea, dizziness, or disorientation from shadow flicker, only one government- sponsored study from Germany (Pohl et al., 1999) was identified for review. This German study was performed by the Institute of Psychology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) and supported by the Office of Biology, Energy, and Environment of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), and on behalf of the State Environmental Agency of Schleswig. The purpose of this 004451WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 37 | Pa ge g overnment-sponsored study was to determine whether periodic shadow with a duration of more than 30 minutes created significant stress-related health effects. The shadows were created by a projection system, which simulated the flicker from actual wind turbines. Two groups of different aged individuals were studied. The first group consisted of 32 students (average age 23 years). The second group included 25 professionals (average age 47 years). Both men and women were included. The subjects were each randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups, so there was a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group was exposed to 60 minutes of simulated flicker. For the control group lighting conditions were the same as in the experimental group, but without periodic shadow. The main part of the study consisted of a series of six test and measurement phases, two before the light was turned on, three each at intervals of 20 minutes while the simulated shadow flickering was taking place, and one more after the flicker light was turned off. Among the variables measured were general performance indicators of stress (arithmetic, visual search tasks) and those of mental and physical well-being, cognitive processing, and stress in the autonomic nervous system (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and finger temperature). Systematic effects due to the simulated flicker could be detected in comparable ways in both exposure groups studied. Both physical and cognitive effects were found in this exposure scenario for shadow flicker. It appears clear that shadow flicker can be a significant annoyance or nuisance to some individuals, particularly if they are wind project non-participants (people who do not benefit economically or receive electricity from the turbine) whose land abuts the property where the turbine is located. In addition, flashing (a phenomenon closely related to shadow flicker, but due to the reflection of sunlight - see Appendix B) can be a problem if turbines are sited too close to highways or other roadways. This could cause dangerous conditions for drivers. Accordingly, turbine siting near highways should be planned so as to reduce flashing as much as possible to protect drivers. However, use of low reflective turbine blades is commonly employed to reduce this potential flashing problem. Provisions to avoid many of these potential health and annoyance problems appear to be employed as current practice in many pre-planning sites with the use of computer programs such as WindPro. These programs can accurately determine shadow flicker rates based on input of accurate analysis area, planned turbine location, the turbine design (height, length, hub height, rotor diameter, and blade width), and residence or 004452WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 38 | Pa ge r oadway locations. Many of these computer programs can then create maps indicating the location and incidence of shadow flicker. Such programs may also provide estimates of daily minutes and hours per year of expected shadow flicker that can then be used for wind turbine planning and siting or for mitigation efforts. Several states require these analyses to be performed before any new turbine projects can be implemented. 3.4.b.ii Summary of Impacts of Flicker Collectively, although shadow flicker can be a considerable nuisance particularly to wind turbine project non-participants, the evidence suggests that there is no risk of seizure from shadow flicker caused by wind turbines. In addition, there is limited evidence primarily from a German government-sponsored study (Pohl et al., 1999) that prolonged shadow flicker (more than 30 minutes) can result in transient stress-related effects on cognition (concentration, attention) and autonomic nervous system functioning (heart rate, blood pressure). There was insufficient documentation to evaluate other than anecdotal reports of additional health effects including migraines or nausea, dizziness or disorientation. There are documented mitigation methods for addressing shadow flicker from wind turbines and these methods are presented in Appendix B. 3.4.c Ice Throw and its Potential Health Effects Under certain weather conditions ice may form on the surface of wind turbine blades. Normally, wind turbines intended for use in locations where ice may form are designed to shut down when there is a significant amount of ice on the blades. The means to prevent operation when ice is present may include ice sensor and vibration sensors. Ice sensors are used on most wind turbines in cold climates. Vibration sensors are used on nearly all wind turbines. They would cause the turbine to shut down, for example, if ice buildup on the blades resulted in an imbalance of the rotor and hence detectable vibrations in the structure. Ice built up on blades normally falls off while the turbine is stationary. If that occurs during high winds, the ice could be blown by the wind some distance from the tower. In addition, it is conceivable that ice could be thrown from a moving wind turbine blade under some circumstances, although that would most likely occur only during startup (while the rotational speed is still relatively low) or as a result of the failure of the control system. It is therefore worth considering the maximum plausible distance that a piece of ice could land from the turbine under two \"worst case\" circumstances: 1) ice falls from a stopped turbine during very 004453WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 39 | Pa ge h igh winds, and 2) ice is suddenly released from a blade when the rotor is rotating at its normal operating speed. Ice is a physical hazard, that depending on the mass, velocity, and the angle of throw can result in a wide range of effects to humans: alarm and surprise to abrasions, organ damage, concussions, and perhaps death. Avoidance of ice throw is critical. More detail on ice throw and options for mitigation are presented in Appendix C. 3.5 Effects of Noise and Vibration in Animal Models Domestic animals such as cats and dogs can serve as sentinels of problematic environmental conditions. The Panel searched for literature that might point to non-laboratory animal studies or well-documented cases of animals impacted by wind turbines. Anecdotal reports in the press of goat deaths (UK), premature births and adverse effects in cows (Japan, US) provide circumstantial evidence, but lack specifics regarding background rates of illness or extent of impact. Laboratory-based animal models are often used to predict and to develop mechanistic explanations of the causes of disease by external factors, such as noise or chemicals in humans. In the absence of robust epidemiological data, animal models can provide clues to complex biological responses. However, the limitations of relying on animal models are well documented, particularly for endpoints that involve the brain. The benefits of using an animal model include ease of experimental manipulation such as multiple exposures, typically well- controlled experimental conditions, and genetically identical groups of animals. Evaluation of biological plausibility for the multitude of reported health effects of wind turbines requires a suitable animal model documented with data that demonstrate cause and effect. Review of this literature began with a PubMed and ToxNet search for \"wind turbine\" or \"animal\" or \"mammal\" to identify peer-reviewed studies in which laboratory animals were exposed to noise or vibration intended to mimic that of wind turbines. Titles and abstracts of identified papers were read to make a first pass determination of whether the paper was a study on effects in mammals or might contain relevant references to other relevant studies. The searches yielded several studies, many of which were not peer-reviewed, were not whole-animal mammalian or were not experimental, but were reviews in which animal studies were mentioned or experiments conducted in dissected cochlea. The literature review yielded eight peer-reviewed studies, all relying on the laboratory 004454WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 40 | Pa ge r at as the model. The studies fall into two groups\u2014those conducted in the 1970's and early 1980's and those conducted in 2007-2010. The most recent studies are conducted in China and are funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Table AG.1 (in Appendix G) provides a summary of the studies. There is no general agreement about the specific biological activity of infrasound on rodents, although at high doses it appears to negatively affect the cardiovascular, brain, and respiratory systems (Sienkiewicz, 2007). Early studies lacked the ability to document the doses of infrasound given the rats, did not report general pathologies associated with the exposures and lacked suitable controls. Since then, researchers have focused on the brain and cardiac systems as sensitive targets of infrasound. Experimental conditions in these studies lack a documented rationale for the selection and the use of infrasound of 5-15 Hz at 130 dB. While this appears to be standard practice, the relevance of these frequencies and pressures is unclear\u2014both to the rat and more importantly to the human. The exposures are acute\u2014short-term, high dose. Researchers do not document rat behaviors (including startle responses), pathologies, frank toxicities, and outcomes due to these exposures. Therefore, interpretation of all of the animal model data for infrasound outcomes must be with the lens of any high-dose, short-term exposure in toxicology, specifically questioning whether the observations are readily translatable to low- dose, chronic exposures. Pei et al., (2007 and 2009) examine changes in cardiac ultrastructure and function in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 5 Hz at 130 dB for 2 hours for 1, 7, or 14 successive days. Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated from the adult left ventricular hearts after sacrifice. Whole cell patch-clamp techniques were employed to measure whole cell L-Type Ca2+ currents. The objective of these studies was to determine whether there was a cumulative effect of insult as measured by influx of calcium into cardiomyocytes. After infrasound exposure, rats in the 7- and 14-day exposure groups demonstrated statistically significant changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes as demonstrated by electrochemical stimulation of the cells, molecular identification of specific heart-protein levels, and calcium transport measurements. Several studies examine the effects of infrasound on behavioral performance in rats. The first of these studies was conducted under primitive acoustic conditions compared with those of today (Petounis et al., 1977). In this study the researchers examined the behavior of adult female rats (undisclosed strain) exposed to increasing infrasound (2 Hz, 104 dB; 7 Hz, 122 dB; and 16 004455WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 41 | Pa ge H z, 124 dB) for increasing time (5-minute increments for up to 120 minutes). Decreased activity levels (sleeping more) and exploratory behavior were documented as dose and duration of exposure increased. The authors fail to mention that frank toxicity including pain is associated with these behaviors, raising the question of relevance of high dose exposures. In response to this and similar studies that identify increase in sleep, increase in avoidance behaviors and suppression of locomotor activity, Spyraki et al., (1977) hypothesized that these responses are mediated by norepinephrine levels in the brain and as such, exposed adult male Wistar rats to increasing doses of infrasound for one hour. Using homogenized brain tissue, norepinephrine concentrations were measured using fluorometric methods. Researchers demonstrated a dose- dependent decrease in norepinephrine levels in brain tissue from infrasound-treated rats, beginning at a dose of 7 Hz and 122 dB for one hour. No observations of frank toxicity were recorded. Liu et al., (2010) hypothesized that since infrasound could affect the brain, it potentially could increase cell proliferation (neurogenesis) in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus, specifically a region that continues to generate new neurons in the adult male Sprague-Dawley rat. Using a slightly longer exposure period of 2 hours/day for 7 days at 16 Hz and 130 dB, the data suggest that infrasound exposure inhibits cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, yet has no affect on early migration and differentiation. This study lacks suitable positive and negative controls that allow these conclusions to be drawn. Several unpublished or non-peer reviewed studies reported behavioral responses as relevant endpoints of infrasound exposure. These data are not discussed, yet are the basis for several recent studies. In one more recent peer-reviewed behavioral rat study, adult male Wistar rats were classified as \"superior endurance\" and those as \"inferior endurance\" using the Rota-rod Treadmill (Yamamura et al., 1990). A range of frequencies and pressures were used to expose the rats for 60\u2014150 minutes. Comparison of the pre-exposure endurance time on the Rota-Rod Treadmill with endurance after exposure to infrasound showed that the endurance time of the superior group after exposure to 16 Hz, 105 dB was not reduced. The endurance of the inferior group was reduced by exposure to 16 Hz, 105 dB after 10 minutes, to 16 Hz, 95 dB after 70 minutes, and to 16 Hz, 85 dB after 150 minutes. Of most relevance is the identification of a subset of rats that may be more responsive to infrasound due to their genetic makeup. There has been no follow-up regarding intra-strain susceptibility since this study. 004456WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 42 | Pa ge M ore recent studies have focused on the mechanisms by which infrasound may disrupt normal brain function. As stated above, the infrasound exposures are acute\u2014short-term, high dose. At the very least, researchers should document rat behaviors, pathologies, frank toxicities, and outcomes due to these high dose exposures in addition to measuring specific subcellular effects. Some of the biological stress literature suggests that microglial activation can occur with heightened stress, but it appears to be short-lived and transitory affecting the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine system, resulting in multiple reported effects. To investigate the effect of infrasound on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, Yuan et al. (2009) measure cognitive abilities and activation of molecular signaling pathways in order to determine the role of the neuronal signaling transduction pathway, BDNF-TRkB, in infrasound-induced impairment of memory and learning in the rat. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to infrasound of 16 Hz and 130 dB for 2 hours daily for 14 days. The acoustic conditions appeared to be well monitored and documented. The Morris water maze was used to determine spatial learning and retention, and molecular techniques were used to measure cell proliferation and concentrations of signaling pathway proteins. Using these semi-quantitative methods, rats exposed to infrasound demonstrated impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning acquisition and retention performance in the maze scheme compared with unexposed control rats, demonstrable downregulation of the BDNF-TRkB pathway, and decreased BrdU-labeled cell proliferation in the dentatel gyrus. In another study, Du et al. (2010) hypothesize that microglial cells may be responsible for infrasound-induced stress. To test this hypothesis, 60 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed in an infrasonic chamber to 16 Hz at 130 dB for 2 hours. Brains were removed and sectioned and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) examined. Primary microglial cells were isolated from whole brains of neonatal rats and grown in culture before they were exposed to infrasound under the same conditions as the whole animals. Molecular methods were used to identify the presence and levels of proteins indicative of biological stress (corticotrophin- releasing hormone (CRH) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (CRH type 1 receptor) in areas of the brain that control the stress response. Specifically, studies were done to determine whether microglial cells are involved in infrasound-response, changes in microglial activation, and CRH-R1 expression in vivo in the PVN and in vitro at time points after the two-hour 004457WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 43 | Pa ge i nfrasound exposure. The data show that the exposures resulted in microglial activation, beginning at 0.5 hours post exposure, and up-regulation of CRH-R1 expression. The magnitude of the response increased significantly from the control to 6 hours post exposure, returning to control levels, generally by 24 hours post-exposure. This study is well controlled, and while it does rely on a specific antagonist for dissecting the relative involvement of the neurons and the microglial cells, the data suggest that infrasound as administered in this study to rats can activate microglial cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for infrasound-induced \"stress\" or nuisance at a physical level (i.e., proinflammatory cytokines causing sickness response behaviors). In summary, there are no studies in which laboratory animals are subjected to exposures that mimic wind turbines. There is insufficient evidence from laboratory animal studies of effects of low frequency noise on the respiratory system. There is limited evidence that rats are a robust model for human infrasound exposure and effects. The reader is referred to Appendix G for specific study conditions. In any case, the infrasound levels and exposure conditions to which the rodents are exposed are adequate to cause pain to the rodents. When exposed to these levels of infrasound, there is some evidence of reversible molecular effects including short-lived biochemical alterations in cardiac and brain cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for high- dose, infrasound-induced effects in rats. 3.6 Health Impact Claims Associated with Noise and Vibration Exposure The popular media contain a large number of articles that claim the noise and vibration from wind turbines adversely affect human health. In this section the Panel examines the physical and biological basis for these assertions. Additionally, the scientific articles from which these assertions are made are examined in light of the methods used and their limitations. Pierpont (2009) has been cited as offering evidence of the physical effects of ILFN, referring to \"Wind Turbine Syndrome\" and its impact on the vestibular system\u2014by disturbed sensory input to eyes, inner ears, and stretch and pressure receptors in a variety of body locations. The basis for the syndrome relies on data from research carried out for reasons (e.g., space missions) other than assessment of wind turbines on health. Such research can be valuable to understanding new conditions, however, when the presentation of data is incomplete, it can lead to inaccurate conclusions. A few such cases are mentioned here: Pierpont (2009) notes that von Dirke and Parker (1994) show that the abdominal area resonates between 4 and 6 Hz and that wind turbines can produce infrasound within this range 004458WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 44 | Pa ge ( due to the blade rotation rate). However, the von Dirke paper states that our bodies have evolved to be tolerant of the 4-6 Hz abdominal motion range: this range coincides with jogging and running. The paper also reveals that motion sickness (which was the focus of the study) only occurred when the vibrations to which people were subjected were between 0.01 and 0.5 Hz. The study exposed people to vibration from positive to negative 1 G forces. Subjects were also rotated around various axes to achieve the vibration levels and frequencies of interest in the study. Interpretation of these data may allow one to conclude that while the abdominal area has a resonance in a region at which there is infrasound being emitted by wind turbines, there will be no impact. Further, the infrasound emitted by wind turbines in the range of frequencies at which subjects did note motion sickness is orders of magnitude less than the level that induced motion sickness (see Table 2). So while a connection is made, the evidence at this point is not sufficient to draw a conclusion that a person's abdominal area or stretch point can be excited by turbine infrasound. If it were, this might lead to symptoms of motion sickness. Pierpont (2009) points to a study by Todd et al. (2008) as potential proof that the inner ear may be playing a role in creating the symptoms of \"Wind Turbine Syndrome.\" Todd et al. (2008) show that the vestibular system shows a best frequency response around 100 Hz. This is a fact, but again it is unclear how it relates to low frequency noise from wind turbines. The best frequency response was assessed by moving subjects' heads (knocking the side of the head) in a very specific direction because the portion of the inner ear that is being discussed acts as a gravitational sensor or an accelerometer; therefore, it responds to motion. A physical mechanism by which the audible sound produced by a wind turbine at 100 Hz would couple to the human body in a way to create the necessary motion to which this portion of the inner ear would respond is unknown. More recently, Salt and Hullar (2010) have looked for something physical about the ear that could be responding to infrasonic frequencies. They describe how the outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells of the cochlea respond to different types of stimuli: the IHC responding to velocity and OHC responding to displacement. They discuss how the OHC respond to lower frequencies than the IHC, and how the OHC acts as an amplifier for the IHC. They state that it is known that low frequencies present in a sound signal can mask the higher frequencies\u2014 presumably because the OHC is not amplifying the higher frequency correctly when the OHC is responding to low frequency disturbances. However, they emphatically state that \"although 004459WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 45 | Pa ge v estibular hair cells are maximally sensitive to low frequencies they typically do not respond to airborne infrasound. Rather, they normally respond to mechanical inputs resulting from head movements and positional changes with their output controlling muscle reflexes to maintain posture and eye position.\" It is completely unknown how the very few neural paths from the OHC to the brain respond, if they do at all (95% of the connections are between the IHC and the brain). So at this moment, inner ear experts have not found a method for airborne infrasound to impact the inner ear. The potential exists such that the OHC respond to infrasound, but that the functional role of the connection between the OHC and the brain remains unknown. Further, the modulation of the sound received at the IHC itself has not been shown to cause nausea, headaches, or dizziness. In the discussion of amplitude-modulated noise, it was already noted that wind turbines produce audible sound in the low frequency regime (20-200Hz). It has been shown that the sound levels in this range from some turbines are above the levels for which subjects in a Korean study have complained of psychological effects (Jung & Cheung, 2008). O'Neal (2011) also shows that the sound pressure level for frequencies between 30 and 200 Hz from two modern wind turbines at roughly 310 m are above the threshold of hearing but below the criterion for creating window rattle or other perceptible vibrations. The issue of vibration is discussed more in the next section. It is noted that the amplitude-modulated noise is most likely at the heart of annoyance complaints. In addition, amplitude-modulated noise may be a source of sleep disturbance noted by survey respondents. However, direct health impacts have not been demonstrated. 3.6.a Vibration Vibroacoustics disease (VAD) has been identified as a potential health impact of wind turbines in the Pierpont book. Most of the literature around VAD is attributed to Branco and Alves-Pereira. Related citations attributed to Takahashi (2001), Hedge and Rasmussen (1982) though are also provided. These studies all required very clear coupling to large vibration sources such as jackhammers and heavy equipment. The latter references focus on high levels of low frequency vibrations and noise. In particular, Rasmussen studied the response of people to vibrating floors and chairs. The vibration displacements in the study were on the order of 0.01 cm (or 1000 times larger than the motion found 100 m from a wind farm in a seismic study (Styles et al., 2005). Takahashi used loud speakers placed 2 m from subjects' bodies, only 004460WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 46 | Pa ge t esting audible frequencies 20-50 Hz, using pressure levels on the order of 100-110 dB (roughly 30 dB higher than any sound measured from a wind turbine in this frequency range) to induce vibrations at various points on the body. The Hedge source is not a study but a bulleted list of points that seem to go along with a lecture in an ergonomics class for which no citations are provided. Branco's work is slightly different in that she considered very long-term exposures to moderately intense vibration inputs. While there may be possible connection to wind turbines, at present, the connection is not substantiated given the very low levels of vibration and airborne ILFN that have been measured from wind turbines. While vibroacoustic disease may not be substantiated, vibration levels that lead to annoyance or feelings of uneasiness may be more plausible. Evidence for these responses is discussed below. Pierpont refers to a paper by Findeis and Peters (2004). This reference describes a situation in Germany where complaints of disturbing sound and vibration were investigated through the measurement of the vibration and acoustics within the dwelling, noting that people complained about vibrations that were not audible. The one figure provided in the text shows that people were disturbed by what was determined to be structure-borne sound that was radiated by walls and floors at levels equivalent to 65 dB at 10 Hz and 40 dB at 100 Hz. The 10 Hz level is just below audible. The level reported at 100 Hz, however, is just above the hearing threshold. The authors concluded that the disturbances were due to a component of the HVAC system that coupled directly to the building. The Findeis and Peters (2004), report is reminiscent of papers related to investigations of \"haunted\" spaces (Tandy, 1998, 1999). In these studies room frequencies around 18 Hz were found. The studies hypothesized that apparitions were the result of eye vibrations (the eye is sensitive to 18 Hz) induced by the room vibration field. In one of these studies, a ceiling fan was found to be the source of the vibration. In the other, the source was not identified. When the source was identified in the previously mentioned studies, there appears to be an obvious physical coupling mechanism. In other situations it has been estimated that airborne disturbances have influenced structures. A NASA report from 1982 gives a figure that estimates the necessary sound pressure level at various frequencies to force vibrations in windows, walls, and floors of typical buildings (Stephens, 1982). The figure on page 14 of that report shows infrasound levels of 70-80 dB can induce wall and floor vibrations. On page 39 the report also 004461WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 47 | Pa ge s hows some floor vibration levels that were associated with a wind turbine. On the graph these were the lowest levels of vibration when compared to vibrations from aircraft noise and sonic booms. Another figure on page 43 shows vibrations and perception across the infrasonic frequency range. Again, wind turbine data are shown, and they are below the perception line. A second technical report (Kelley, 1985) from that timeframe describes disturbances from the MOD-1 wind turbine in Boone, North Carolina. This was a downwind turbine mounted on a truss tower. Out of 1000 homes within about 2 km, 10 homes experienced room vibrations under certain wind conditions. A careful measurement campaign showed that indeed these few homes had room vibrations related to the impulsive noise unique to downwind turbines. The report contains several findings including the following: 1) the disturbances inside the homes were linked to the impulsive sound generated by the turbine (due to tower wake/blade interaction) and not seismic waves, 2) the impulsive signal was feeding energy into the vibrational modes of the rooms, floors, and walls where the floor/wall modes were the only modes in the infrasonic range, 3) people felt the disturbance more than they heard it, 4) peak vibration values were measured in the frequency range 10-20 Hz (floor/wall resonances) and it was deduced that the wall facing the turbine was being excited, 5) the fact that only 10 homes out of 1000 (scattered in various directions around the turbine) were affected was shown to be related to complicated sound propagation paths, and 6) while the shape of the impulse itself was given much attention and was shown to be a driving force in the coupling to the structural vibrations, comments were made in the report to the effect that nonimpulsive signals with energy at the right frequency could couple into the structure. The report describes a situation in Oregon where resonances in the flow through an exhaust stack of a gas-run turbine plant had an associated slow modulation of the sound leading to annoyance near the plant. Again it was found that structural modes in nearby homes were being excited but this time by an acoustic field that was not impulsive in nature. This is an important point because modern wind turbines do not create impulsive noise with strong content around 20 Hz like the downwind turbine in North Carolina. Instead, they generate amplitude-modulated sound around 1 kHz as well as broadband infrasound (van den Berg, 2004). The broadband infrasound that also existed for the North Carolina turbine was not shown to be responsible for the disturbances. As well, the amplitude- modulated noise that existed was not shown to be responsible for the disturbances. So, while there are comparisons made to the gas turbine power plant and to the HVAC system component 004462WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 48 | Pa ge w here the impulsiveness of the sound was not the same, direct comment on the effect of modern turbines on the vibration of homes is not possible. A recent paper by Bolin et al. (2011), surveys much of the low frequency literature pertinent to modern wind turbines and notes that all measurements of indoor and outdoor levels of sound simultaneously do not show the same amplification and ringing of frequencies associated with structural resonances similar to what was found in North Carolina. Instead the sound inside is normally less than the sound outside the structure. Bolin et al. (2011) note that measurements indicate that the indoor ILFN from wind turbines typically comply with national guidelines (such as the Danish guideline for 44 dB(A) outside a dwelling). However, this does not preclude a situation where levels would be found to be higher than the standards. They propose that further investigations of an individual dwelling should be conducted if the measured difference between C-weighted and A-weighted sound pressure level of outdoor exposure is greater than 15 dB. A similar criterion is noted in the non-peer reviewed report by Kamperman et al. (2008). Related to room vibration is window rattle. This topic is described in the NASA reports, discussed above (Stephens, 1982) and discussed in the articles by Jung and Cheung (2008) and O'Neal (2011). In these articles it has been noted that window rattle is often induced by vibrations between 5 and 9 Hz, and measurements from wind turbines show that there can be enough energy in this range to induce window rattle. Whether the window rattle then generates its own sound field inside a room at an amplitude great enough to disturb the human body is unknown. Seismic transmission of vibration at the North Carolina site was considered. In that study the seismic waves were ruled out as too low of amplitude to induce the room vibrations that were generated. Related are two sets of measurements that were taken near wind farms to assess the potential impact of seismic activity on extremely sensitive seismic measurement stations (Styles, 2005, Schofield, 2010). One study considered both waves traveling in the ground and the coupling of airborne infrasound to the ground, showing that the dominant source of seismic motion is the Rayleigh waves in the ground transmitted directly by the tower, and that the airborne infrasound is not playing a role in creating measurable seismic motion. The two reports indicate that at 100 meters from a wind turbine farm (>6 turbines) the maximum motion that is induced is 120 nanometers (at about 1 Hz). A nanometer is 10-9 m. So this is 1.2 x 10-7 m of 004463WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 49 | Pa ge g round displacement. Extremely sensitive measuring devices have been used to detect this slight motion. To put the motion in perspective, the diameter of a human hair is on the order of 10-6 m. These findings indicate that seismic motion induced from one or two turbines is so small that it would be difficult to induce any physical or structural response. Hessler and Hessler, (2010) reviewed various state noise limits and discussed them in connection with wind turbines. The article contains a few comments related to low frequency noise. It is stated that, \"a link between health complaints and turbine noise has only been asserted based on what is essentially anecdotal evidence without any valid epidemiological studies or scientific proof of any kind.\" The article states that if a metric for low frequency noise is needed, then a limit of 65 dB(C) could be used. This proposed criterion is not flexible for use in different environments such as rural vs. city. In this sense, Bolin et als' suggestion of checking for a difference between C-weighted and A-weighted sound pressure level of outdoor exposure greater than 15 dB is more appropriate. This value of 15 dB, was based on past complaints associated with combustion turbines. The Bolin article, however, also cautions that obtaining accurate low frequency measurements for wind turbines is difficult because of the presence of wind. Even sophisticated windscreens cannot eliminate the ambient low frequency wind noise. Leventhal (2006) notes that when hearing and deaf subjects are tested simultaneously, the subjects' chests would resonate with sounds in the range of 50-80 Hz. However, the amplitude of the sound had to be 40-50 dB higher than the human hearing threshold for the deaf subjects to report the chest vibration. This leads one to conclude that chest resonance in isolation should not be associated with inaudible sound. If a room is vibrating due to a structural resonance, such levels may be obtained. Again, this effect has never been measured associated with a modern wind turbine. The stimulation of house resonances and self-reported ill-effects due to a modern wind turbine appear in a report by independent consultants that describes pressure measurements taken inside and outside of a home in Falmouth Massachusetts in the spring of 2011 (Ambrose & Rand, 2011). The measurements were taken at roughly 500 meters from a single 1.65 MW stall- regulated turbine when the wind speeds were relatively high: 20-30 m/s at hub height. The authors noted feeling ill when the dB(A) levels indoors were between 18 and 24 (with a corresponding dB(G) level of 51-64). They report that they felt effects both inside and outside 004464WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 50 | Pa ge but preferred to be outside where the dB(A) levels ranged from 41-46 (with corresponding dB(G) levels from 54-65.) This is curious because weighted measurements account for human response and the weighted values were higher outside. However, the actual dB(L) levels were higher inside. The authors present some data indicating that the G-weighted value of the pressure signal is often greater than 60 dB(G), the averaged threshold value proposed by Salt and Hullar (2011) for OHC activation. However, the method used to obtain the data is not presented, and the time scale over which the data are presented (< 0.015 seconds or 66 Hz) is too short to properly capture the low frequency content. The data analysis differed from the common standard of practice in an attempt to highlight weaknesses in the standard measurement approach associated with the capture of amplitude modulation and ILFN. This departure from the standard is a useful step in defining a measurement technique such as that called for in a report by HGC Engineering (HGC, 2010), that notes policy making entities should \"consider adopting or endorsing a proven measurement procedure that could be used to quantify noise at infrasonic frequencies.\" The measurements by Ambrose and Rand (2011) show a difference in A and C weighted outdoor sound levels of around 15 dB at the high wind speeds (which is Bolin et. al.'s recommended value for triggering further interior investigations). The simultaneous indoor and outdoor measurements indicate that at very low frequencies (2-6 Hz) the indoor pressure levels are greater than those outdoors. It is useful to note that the structural forcing at the blade- passage-frequency, the time delay and the subsequent ringing that was present in the Boone homes (Kelley, 1985) is not demonstrated by Ambrose and Rand (2011). This indicates that the structural coupling is not forced by the amplitude modulation and is due to a much subtler process. Importantly, while there is an amplification at these lower frequencies, the indoor levels (unweighted) are still far lower than any levels that have ever been shown to cause a physical response (including the activation of the OHC) in humans. The measurements did reveal a 22.9 Hz tone that was amplitude modulated at approximately the blade passage frequency. The source of the tone was not identified, and no indication as to whether the tone varied with wind speed was provided, a useful step to help determine whether the tone is aerodynamically generated. The level of this tone is shown to be higher than the OHC activation threshold. The 22.9 Hz tone did not couple to the structure and 004465WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 51 | Pa ge showed the normal attenuation from outside to inside the structure. In order to determine if the results that show potential tonal activation of the OHC are generalizable, it is necessary to identify the source of this tone which could be unique to stall-regulated turbines or even unique to this specific brand of turbine. Finally, the measurements shown in the report are atypical within the wind turbine measurement literature and the data analysis is not fully described. Also, the report offers no plausible coupling mechanism of the sound waves to the body beyond that proposed by Salt and Hullar (2011). Because of this, the results are suggestive but require corroboration of the measurements and scientifically based mechanisms for human health impact. 3.6.b Summary of Claimed Health Impacts In this section, the potential health impacts due to noise and vibration from wind turbines was discussed. Both the infrasonic and low frequency noise ranges were considered. Assertions that infrasound and low frequency noise from turbines affect the vestibular system either through airborne coupling to humans are not empirically supported. In the multitude of citations given in the popular media as to methods in which the vestibular system is influenced, all refer to situations in which there is direct vibration coupling to the body or when the wave amplitudes are orders of magnitudes greater than those produced by wind turbines. Recent research has found one potential path in the auditory system, the OHC, in which infrasound might be sensed. There is no evidence, however, that when the OHC sense infrasound, it then leads to any of the symptoms reported by complainants. That the infrasound and low frequency noise couple to humans through the forcing of structural vibration is plausible but has not been demonstrated for modern wind turbines. In addition, should it be shown that such a coupling occurs, research indicates that the coupling would be transient and highly dependent on wind conditions and localized to very few homes surrounding a turbine. Seismic activity near a turbine due to vibrations transmitted down the tower has been measured, and the levels are too low to produce vibrations in humans. The audible noise from wind turbines, in particular the amplitude modulated trailing edge noise, does exist, changes level based on atmospheric conditions, can change character from swish to thump-based on atmospheric effects, and can be perceived from home to home differently based on propagation effects. This audible sound has been noted by complainants as a source of annoyance and a cause for sleep disruption. Some authors have proposed nighttime 004466WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 52 | Pa ge n oise regulations and regulations based on shorter time averages (vs. annual averages) as a means to reduce annoyance from this noise source. Some have conjectured that the low frequency content of the amplitude-modulated noise is responsible for the annoyance. They have proposed that the difference between the measured outdoor A- and C- weighted sound pressure levels could be used to identify situations in which the low frequency content is playing a larger role. Further, they note that this difference might be used as part of a regulation as a means to reduce annoyance. 004467WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 53 | Pa ge C hapter 4 Findings Based on the detailed review of the scientific literature and other available reports and consideration of the strength of scientific evidence, the Panel presents findings relative to three factors associated with the operation of wind turbines: noise and vibration, shadow flicker, and ice throw. The findings that follow address specifics in each of these three areas. 4.1 Noise 4.1.a Production of Noise and Vibration by Wind Turbines 1. Wind turbines can produce unwanted sound (referred to as noise) during operation. The nature of the sound depends on the design of the wind turbine. Propagation of the sound is primarily a function of distance, but it can also be affected by the placement of the turbine, surrounding terrain, and atmospheric conditions. a. Upwind and downwind turbines have different sound characteristics, primarily due to the interaction of the blades with the zone of reduced wind speed behind the tower in the case of downwind turbines. b. Stall regulated and pitch controlled turbines exhibit differences in their dependence of noise generation on the wind speed c. Propagation of sound is affected by refraction of sound due to temperature gradients, reflection from hillsides, and atmospheric absorption. Propagation effects have been shown to lead to different experiences of noise by neighbors. d. The audible, amplitude-modulated noise from wind turbines (\"whooshing\") is perceived to increase in intensity at night (and sometimes becomes more of a \"thumping\") due to multiple effects: i) a stable atmosphere will have larger wind gradients, ii) a stable atmosphere may refract the sound downwards instead of upwards, iii) the ambient noise near the ground is lower both because of the stable atmosphere and because human generated noise is often lower at night. 2. The sound power level of a typical modern utility scale wind turbine is on the order of 103 dB(A), but can be somewhat higher or lower depending on the details of the design and the rated power of the turbine. The perceived sound decreases rapidly with the distance from the wind turbines. Typically, at distances larger than 400 m, sound 004468WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 54 | Pa ge p ressure levels for modern wind turbines are less than 40 dB(A), which is below the level associated with annoyance in the epidemiological studies reviewed. 3. Infrasound refers to vibrations with frequencies below 20 Hz. Infrasound at amplitudes over 100-110 dB can be heard and felt. Research has shown that vibrations below these amplitudes are not felt. The highest infrasound levels that have been measured near turbines and reported in the literature near turbines are under 90 dB at 5 Hz and lower at higher frequencies for locations as close as 100 m. 4. Infrasound from wind turbines is not related to nor does it cause a \"continuous whooshing.\" 5. Pressure waves at any frequency (audible or infrasonic) can cause vibration in another structure or substance. In order for vibration to occur, the amplitude (height) of the wave has to be high enough, and only structures or substances that have the ability to receive the wave (resonant frequency) will vibrate. 4.1.b Health Impacts of Noise and Vibration 1. Most epidemiologic literature on human response to wind turbines relates to self-reported \"annoyance,\" and this response appears to be a function of some combination of the sound itself, the sight of the turbine, and attitude towards the wind turbine project. a. There is limited epidemiologic evidence suggesting an association between exposure to wind turbines and annoyance. b. There is insufficient epidemiologic evidence to determine whether there is an association between noise from wind turbines and annoyance independent from the effects of seeing a wind turbine and vice versa. 2. There is limited evidence from epidemiologic studies suggesting an association between noise from wind turbines and sleep disruption. In other words, it is possible that noise from some wind turbines can cause sleep disruption. 3. A very loud wind turbine could cause disrupted sleep, particularly in vulnerable populations, at a certain distance, while a very quiet wind turbine would not likely disrupt even the lightest of sleepers at that same distance. But there is not enough evidence to 004469WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 55 | Pa ge p rovide particular sound-pressure thresholds at which wind turbines cause sleep disruption. Further study would provide these levels. 4. Whether annoyance from wind turbines leads to sleep issues or stress has not been sufficiently quantified. While not based on evidence of wind turbines, there is evidence that sleep disruption can adversely affect mood, cognitive functioning, and overall sense of health and well-being. 5. There is insufficient evidence that the noise from wind turbines is directly (i.e., independent from an effect on annoyance or sleep) causing health problems or disease. 6. Claims that infrasound from wind turbines directly impacts the vestibular system have not been demonstrated scientifically. Available evidence shows that the infrasound levels near wind turbines cannot impact the vestibular system. a. The measured levels of infrasound produced by modern upwind wind turbines at distances as close as 68 m are well below that required for non-auditory perception (feeling of vibration in parts of the body, pressure in the chest, etc.). b. If infrasound couples into structures, then people inside the structure could feel a vibration. Such structural vibrations have been shown in other applications to lead to feelings of uneasiness and general annoyance. The measurements have shown no evidence of such coupling from modern upwind turbines. c. Seismic (ground-carried) measurements recorded near wind turbines and wind turbine farms are unlikely to couple into structures. d. A possible coupling mechanism between infrasound and the vestibular system (via the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) in the inner ear) has been proposed but is not yet f ully understood or sufficiently explained. Levels of infrasound near wind t urbines have been shown to be high enough to be sensed by the OHC. However, e vidence does not exist to demonstrate the influence of wind turbine-generated infrasound on vestibular-mediated effects in the brain. e. L imited evidence from rodent (rat) laboratory studies identifies short-lived biochemical alterations in cardiac and brain cells in response to short exposures to emissions at 16 Hz and 130 dB. These levels exceed measured infrasound levels from modern turbines by over 35 dB. 004470WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 56 | Pa ge 7 . There is no evidence for a set of health effects, from exposure to wind turbines, that could be characterized as a \"Wind Turbine Syndrome.\" 8. The strongest epidemiological study suggests that there is not an association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems. There were two smaller, weaker, studies: one did note an association, one did not. Therefore, we conclude the weight of the evidence suggests no association between noise from wind turbines and measures of psychological distress or mental health problems. 9. None of the limited epidemiological evidence reviewed suggests an association between noise from wind turbines and pain and stiffness, diabetes, high blood pressure, tinnitus, hearing impairment, cardiovascular disease, and headache/migraine. 4.2 Shadow Flicker 4.2.a Production of Shadow Flicker Shadow flicker results from the passage of the blades of a rotating wind turbine between the sun and the observer. 1. The occurrence of shadow flicker depends on the location of the observer relative to the turbine and the time of day and year. 2. Frequencies of shadow flicker elicited from turbines is proportional to the rotational speed of the rotor times the number of blades and is generally between 0.5 and 1.1 Hz for typical larger turbines. 3. Shadow flicker is only present at distances of less than 1400 m from the turbine. 4.2.b Health Impacts of Shadow Flicker 1. Scientific evidence suggests that shadow flicker does not pose a risk for eliciting seizures as a result of photic stimulation. 2. There is limited scientific evidence of an association between annoyance from prolonged shadow flicker (exceeding 30 minutes per day) and potential transitory cognitive and physical health effects. 004471WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 57 | Pa ge 4 .3 Ice Throw 4.3.a Production of Ice Throw Ice can fall or be thrown from a wind turbine during or after an event when ice forms or accumulates on the blades. 1. The distance that a piece of ice may travel from the turbine is a function of the wind speed, the operating conditions, and the shape of the ice. 2. In most cases, ice falls within a distance from the turbine equal to the tower height, and in any case, very seldom does the distance exceed twice the total height of the turbine (tower height plus blade length). 4.3.b Health Impacts of Ice Throw 1. There is sufficient evidence that falling ice is physically harmful and measures should be taken to ensure that the public is not likely to encounter such ice. 4.4 Other Considerations In addition to the specific findings stated above for noise and vibration, shadow flicker and ice throw, the Panel concludes the following: 1. Effective public participation in and direct benefits from wind energy projects (such as receiving electricity from the neighboring wind turbines) have been shown to result in less annoyance in general and better public acceptance overall. 004472WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 58 | Pa ge C hapter 5 Best Practices Regarding Human Health Effects Of Wind Turbines Broadly speaking, the term \"best practice\" refers to policies, guidelines, or recommendations that have been developed for a specific situation. Implicit in the term is that the practice is based on the best information available at the time of its institution. A best practice may be refined as more information and studies become available. The panel recognizes that in countries which are dependent on wind energy and are protective of public health, best practices have been developed and adopted. In some cases, the weight of evidence for a specific practice is stronger than it is in other cases. Accordingly, best practice* may be categorized in terms of the evidence available, as shown in Table 3: 004473WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 59 | Pa ge T able 3 Descriptions of Three Best Practice Categories Category Name Description 1 Research Validated Best Practice A program, activity, or strategy that has the highest degree of proven effectiveness supported by objective and comprehensive research and evaluation. 2 Field Tested Best Practice A program, activity, or strategy that has been shown to work effectively and produce successful outcomes and is supported to some degree by subjective and objective data sources. 3 Promising Practice A program, activity, or strategy that has worked within one organization and shows promise during its early stages for becoming a best practice with long-term sustainable impact. A promising practice must have some objective basis for claiming effectiveness and must have the potential for replication among other organizations. *These categories are based on those suggested in \"Identifying and Promoting Promising Practices.\" Federal Register, Vol. 68. No 131. 131. July 2003. www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ccf/about_ccf/gbk_pdf/pp_gb k.pdf 5.1 Noise Evidence regarding wind turbine noise and human health is limited. There is limited evidence of an association between wind turbine noise and both annoyance and sleep disruption, depending on the sound pressure level at the location of concern. However, there are no research-based sound pressure levels that correspond to human responses to noise. A number of countries that have more experience with wind energy and are protective of public health have developed guidelines to minimize the possible adverse effects of noise. These guidelines consider time of day, land use, and ambient wind speed. Table 4 summarizes the guidelines of Germany (in the categories of industrial, commercial and villages) and Denmark (in the categories of sparsely populated and residential). The sound levels shown in the table are for nighttime and are assumed to be taken immediately outside of the residence or building of concern. In addition, the World Health Organization recommends a maximum nighttime sound pressure level of 40 dB(A) in residential areas. Recommended setbacks corresponding to these values may be calculated by software such as WindPro or similar software. Such calculations are normally to be done as part of feasibility studies. The Panel considers the guidelines shown 004474WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 60 | Pa ge b elow to be Promising Practices (Category 3) but to embody some aspects of Field Tested Best Practices (Category 2) as well. Table 4 Promising Practices for Nighttime Sound Pressure Levels by Land Use Type Land Use Sound Pressure Level, dB(A) Nighttime Limits Industrial 70 Commercial 50 Villages, mixed usage 45 Sparsely populated areas, 8 m/s wind* 44 Sparsely populated areas, 6 m/s wind* 42 Residential areas, 8 m/s wind* 39 Residential areas, 6 m/s wind* 37 *measured at 10 m above ground, outside of residence or location of concern The time period over which these noise limits are measured or calculated also makes a difference. For instance, the often-cited World Health Organization recommended nighttime noise cap of 40 dB(A) is averaged over one year (and does not refer specifically to wind turbine noise). Denmark's noise limits in the table above are calculated over a 10-minute period. These limits are in line with the noise levels that the epidemiological studies connect with insignificant reports of annoyance. The Panel recommends that noise limits such as those presented in the table above be included as part of a statewide policy regarding new wind turbine installations. In addition, suitable ranges and procedures for cases when the noise levels may be greater than those values should also be considered. The considerations should take into account trade-offs between environmental and health impacts of different energy sources, national and state goals for energy independence, potential extent of impacts, etc. The Panel also recommends that those involved in a wind turbine purchase become familiar with the noise specifications for the turbine and factors that affect noise production and noise control. Stall and pitch regulated turbines have different noise characteristics, especially in high winds. For certain turbines, it is possible to decrease noise at night through suitable control measures (e.g., reducing the rotational speed of the rotor). If noise control measures are to be 004475WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 61 | Pa ge c onsidered, the wind turbine manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that such control is possible. The Panel recommends an ongoing program of monitoring and evaluating the sound produced by wind turbines that are installed in the Commonwealth. IEC 61400-11 provides the standard for making noise measurements of wind turbines (International Electrotechnical Commission, 2002). In general, more comprehensive assessment of wind turbine noise in populated areas is recommended. These assessments should be done with reference to the broader ongoing research in wind turbine noise production and its effects, which is taking place internationally. Such assessments would be useful for refining siting guidelines and for developing best practices of a higher category. Closer investigation near homes where outdoor measurements show A and C weighting differences of greater than 15 dB is recommended. 5.2 Shadow Flicker Based on the scientific evidence and field experience related to shadow flicker, Germany has adopted guidelines that specify the following: 1. Shadow flicker should be calculated based on the astronomical maximum values (i.e., not considering the effect of cloud cover, etc.). 2. Commercial software such as WindPro or similar software may be used for these calculations. Such calculations should be done as part of feasibility studies for new wind turbines. 3. Shadow flicker should not occur more than 30 minutes per day and not more than 30 hours per year at the point of concern (e.g., residences). 4. Shadow flicker can be kept to acceptable levels either by setback or by control of the wind turbine. In the latter case, the wind turbine manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that such control is possible. The guidelines summarized above may be considered to be a Field Tested Best Practice (Category 2). Additional studies could be performed, specifically regarding the number of hours per year that shadow flicker should be allowed, that would allow them to be placed in Research Validated (Category 1) Best Practices. 004476WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 62 | Pa ge 5 .3 Ice Throw Ice falling from a wind turbine could pose a danger to human health. It is also clear that the danger is limited to those times when icing occurs and is limited to relatively close proximity to the wind turbine. Accordingly, the following should be considered Category 1 Best Practices. 1. In areas where icing events are possible, warnings should be posted so that no one passes underneath a wind turbine during an icing event and until the ice has been shed. 2. Activities in the vicinity of a wind turbine should be restricted during and immediately after icing events in consideration of the following two limits (in meters). For a turbine that may not have ice control measures, it may be assumed that ice could fall within the following limit: ()H R xthrow + =2 5 . 1max, Where: R = rotor radius (m), H = hub height (m) For ice falling from a stationary turbine, the following limit should be used: ()15 /max, H R U xfall + = Where: U = maximum likely wind speed (m/s) The choice of maximum likely wind speed should be the expected one-year return maximum, found in accordance to the International Electrotechnical Commission's design standard for wind turbines, IEC 61400-1. Danger from falling ice may also be limited by ice control measures. If ice control measures are to be considered, the wind turbine manufacturer must be able to demonstrate that such control is possible. 5.4 Public Participation/Annoyance There is some evidence of an association between participation, economic or otherwise, in a wind turbine project and the annoyance (or lack thereof) that affected individuals may express. Accordingly, measures taken to directly involve residents who live in close proximity to a wind turbine project may also serve to reduce the level of annoyance. Such measures may be considered to be a Promising Practice (Category 3). 5.5 Regulations/Incentives/Public Education The evidence indicates that in those parts of the world where there are a significant number of wind turbines in relatively close proximity to where people live, there is a close 004477WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY 63 | Pa ge c oupling between the development of guidelines, provision of incentives, and educating the public. The Panel suggests that the public be engaged through such strategies as education, incentives for community-owned wind developments, compensations to those experiencing documented loss of property values, comprehensive setback guidelines, and public education related to renewable energy. These multi-faceted approaches may be considered to be a Promising Practice (Category 3). 004478WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-1 | P a ge A ppendix A: Wind Turbines - Introduction to Wind Energy Although wind energy for bulk supply of electricity is a relatively new technology, the historical precedents for it go back a long way. They are descendents of mechanical windmills that first appeared in Persia as early as the 7th century (Vowles, 1932) and then re-appeared in northern Europe in the Middle Ages. They were considerably developed during the 18th and 19th centuries, and then formed the basis for the first electricity generating wind turbine in the late 19th century. Development continued sporadically through the mid 20th century, with modern turbines beginning to emerge in the 1970's. It was the introduction of other technologies, such as electronics, computers, control theory, composite materials, and computer-based simulation capability that led to the successful development of the large scale, autonomously operating wind turbines that have become so widely deployed over the past twenty years. The wind is the most important external factor in wind energy. It can be thought of as the \"fuel\" of the wind turbine, even though it is not consumed in the process. The wind determines the amount of energy that is produced, and is therefore referred to as the resource. The wind resource can vary significantly, depending on the location and the nature of the surface. In the United States, the Great Plains have a relatively energetic wind resource. In Massachusetts, winds tend to be relatively low inland, except for mountaintops and ridges. The winds tend to be higher close to the coast and then increase offshore. Average offshore wind speeds generally increase with distance from shore as well. The wind resource of Massachusetts is illustrated in 004479WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-2 | P a ge Figure AA.1: Map of the Massachusetts Wind Resource (From National Renewable Energy Laboratory , http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/images/windmaps/ma _50m_800.jpg ) This section summarizes the basic characteristics of the wind in so far as they relate to w ind turbine power production. Much more detail on this topic is provided in (Manwell et al., 2009). The wind will also affect the design of the wind turbines, and for this purpose it is referred to as an \"external design condition.\" This aspect of the wind is discussed in more detail in a later section. 42\" 72\" The annual wind power estimales for llils map were produced by TrueWJnd Solutions using lhefr Mesomap system and histoncal 'Nealher dala.

This differential heating produces zones of high and low pressure, resulting in air movement. The motion of the air is also affected by earth's rotation. Considerations regarding the wind insofar as it relates to wind turbine operation include the following: (i) the winds aloft (geostrophic wind), (ii) atmospheric boundary layer meteorology, (iii) the variation of wind speed with height, (iv) surface roughness, and (v) turbulence. The geostrophic wind is the wind in the upper atmosphere, which results from the combined effects of the pressure gradient and the earth's rotation (via the Coriolis force). The gradient wind can be thought of as an extension of the geostrophic wind, the difference in this case being that centrifugal effects are included. These result from curved isobars (lines of constant pressure) in the atmosphere. It is these upper atmosphere winds that are the source of most of the energy that eventually impinges on wind turbines. The energy in the upper atmosphere is transferred down closer to the surface via a variety of mechanisms, most notably turbulence, which is generated mechanically (via surface roughness) and thermally (via the rising of warm air and falling of cooler air). Although driven by higher altitude winds, the wind near the surface is affected by the surrounding topography (such as mountains and ridges) and surface conditions (such as tree cover or presence of buildings). AA.2 Variability of the Wind One of the singular characteristics of the wind is its variability, both temporal and spatial. The temporal variability includes: (i) short term (gusts and turbulence), (ii) moderately short term (e.g., hr to hr means), (iii) diurnal (variations over a day), (iv) seasonal, and (v) inter-annual (year to year). The wind may vary spatially as well, both from one location to another or with height above ground. 004481WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-4 | P a ge F igure AA.2 illustrates the variability of the hourly average wind speeds for one year at one location. Figure AA.2: Typical hourly wind speeds over a year As can be seen, the hourly average wind speed in this example varies significantly over the year, ranging from zero to nearly 30 m/s. Figure AA.3 illustrates wind speed at another location recorded twice per second over a 23-hour period. There is significant variability here as well. Much of this variability in this figure is associated with short-term fluctuations, or turbulence. Turbulence has some effect on power generation, but it has a more significant effect on the design of wind turbines, due to the material fatigue that it tends to engender. Turbulence is discussed in more detail in a later section. 051015202530Wind Speed, m/s Hour 004482WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-5 | P a ge Figure AA.3: Typical wind data, sampled at 2 Hz for a 23-hr period I n spite of the variability in the wind time series, summary characteristics have much less variability. For example, the annual mean wind speed at a given location is generally within +/- 10% of the long-term mean at that site. Furthermore, the distribution of wind speeds, that is to say the frequency of occurrence of winds in various wind speed ranges, also tends to be similar from year. The general shape of such distributions is also similar from one location to another, even if the means are different. In fact, statistical models such as the Weibull distribution can be used to model the occurrences of various wind speeds in most locations on the earth. For example, the number of occurrences of wind speed in various ranges from the data set illustrated in Figure AA.2 are shown in Figure AA.4, together with the those occurrences as modeled by the Weibull distribution.

First of all, the energy per unit mass of a particle of air is given simply by \u00bd times the square of the velocity, U (m/s). The mass flow rate of the air (kg/s) through a given area A (m2) perpendicular to the direction of the wind is AU m=& , where is the density of the air (kg/m3). The power in the wind per unit area, P/A, (W/m2) is then: ( )3 2 21 21/ / U U A m A P= =& (4) AA.4 Wind Shear Wind shear is the variation of wind speed with height. Wind shear has relevance to power generation, to turbine design, and to noise generation. The variation of wind speed with height is typically modeled with a power law as follows: [] 1 2 1 2/h h U U = (5) Where U1 = speed at reference height h1, U2 is the wind speed to be estimated at height h2 and is the power law exponent. Values of the exponent typically range from a 0.1 for smooth surfaces to 0.4 for very rough surfaces (such as forests or built-up areas.) Wind shear can also be affected by the stability of the atmosphere. Equations have been developed that allow the incorporation of stability parameters in the analysis, but these too are outside the scope of this overview. AA.5 Wind and Wind Turbine Structural Issues As discussed previously, the wind is of particular interest in wind turbine applications, since it is the source of the energy. It is also the source of significant structural loads that the turbine must be able to withstand. Some of these loads occur when the turbine is operating; others occur when it is stopped. Extreme winds, for example, are likely to affect a turbine when it is stopped. High winds with sudden directional change during operation can also induce high loads. Turbulence during normal operation results in fatigue. The following is a summary of the key aspects of the wind that affect the design of wind turbines. More details may be found in (Manwell et al., 2009). 004485WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-8 | P a ge A A.5.a Turbulence Turbulence in the wind can have significant effect on the structure of a wind turbine as well as its operation, and so it must be considered in the design process. The term \"turbulence\" refers to the short-term variations in the speed and direction of the wind. It manifests itself as apparently random fluctuations superimposed upon a relatively steady mean flow. Turbulence is not actually random, however. It has some very distinct characteristics, at least in a statistical sense. Turbulence is characterized by a number of measures. These include: (i) turbulence intensity, (ii) turbulence probability density functions (pdf), (iii) autocorrelations, (iv) integral time scales and length scales, and (v) power spectral density functions. Discussion of the physics of turbulence is outside the scope of this overview. AA.5.b Gusts A gust is discrete increase and then decrease in wind speed, possibly associated with a change in wind direction, which can be of significance to the design of a wind turbine. Gusts are typically associated with turbulence. AA.5.c Extreme Winds Extreme winds need to be considered for the design of a wind turbine. Extreme winds are normally associated with storms. They occur relatively rarely, but often enough that the possibility of their occurring cannot be ignored. Statistical models, such as the Gumbel distribution (Gumbel, 1958), are used to predict the likelihood of such winds occurring at least once every 50 or 100 years. Such intervals are called return periods. AA.5.d Soils Soils are also important for the design and installation of a wind turbine. In particular, the nature of the soil will affect the design of the wind turbine foundations. Discussion of soils is outside the scope of this overview. AA.6 Wind Turbine Aerodynamics The heart of the wind turbine is the rotor. This is a device that extracts the kinetic energy from the wind and converts it into a mechanical form. Below is a summary of wind turbine rotor aerodynamics. More details may be found in (Manwell et al., 2009). A wind turbine rotor is comprised of blades that are attached to a hub. The hub is in turn attached to a shaft (the main shaft) which transfers the energy through the remainder of the drive 004486WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-9 | P a ge t rain to the generator where is it converted to electricity. The maximum power that a rotor can extract from the wind is first of all limited by the power in the wind, which passes through an area defined by the passage of the rotor. At the present time, most wind turbines utilize a rotor with a horizontal axis. That is, the axis of rotation is (nominally) parallel to the earth's surface. Accordingly, the area that is swept out by the rotor is circular. Assuming a rotor radius of R (m), the maximum power P (W) available in the wind is: 3 2 21U R P= (6) Early in the 20th century, it was shown by Betz (among others, see [4]) that the maximum power that could be extracted was less than the power in the wind; in fact, it was 16/27 times that value. Betz' work led to the definition of a power coefficient, Cp, which expresses the ratio of the actual power extracted by a rotor to the power in the wind. When considering efficiencies of other components in the drive train, as expressed by the , the total power out a wind turbine, PWT, would be given by: 3 2 21U R C Pp WT = (7) The maximum value of the power coefficient, known as the Betz limit, is thus 16/27. Betz' original analysis was based on the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics including linear momentum theory. It also included the following assumptions: (i) homogenous, incompressible, steady state fluid flow; (ii) no frictional drag; (iii) a rotor with an infinite number of (very small) blades; (iv) uniform thrust over the rotor area; (v) a non-rotating wake; and (vi) the static pressure far upstream and far downstream of the rotor that is equal to the undisturbed ambient static pressure. A real rotor operating on a horizontal axis will result in a rotating wake. Some of the energy in the wind will go into that rotation and will not be available for conversion into mechanical power. The result is that the maximum power coefficient will actually be less than the Betz limit. The derivation of the maximum power coefficient for the rotating wake case use a number of terms: (i) the rotational speed of turbine rotor, , in radians/sec; (ii) tip speed ratio, = R/U; (iii) local speed ratio, r = r/R; (iv) rotational speed of wake, ; (v) an axial induction factor, a, which relates the free stream wind speed to the wind speed at the rotor and 004487WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-1 0 | P a ge th e wind speed in the far wake ( ()stream free rotor U a U =1 and ()stream free wake U a U 2 1 = ); and (vi) a n angular induction factor, a' = /2 . According to this analysis, the maximum possible power coefficient is given by: ( ) = 03 2 max , 1 '8 r r P d a a C (8) The maximum power coefficient for a rotor with a rotating wake and the Betz limit are il lustrated in Figure AA.5. Figure AA.5: Maximum theoretical power coefficients for rotating and non-rotating wakes N either of the analyses summarized above gives any indication as to what the blades of the rotor actually look like. For this purpose, a method called blade element momentum (BEM) theory was developed. This approach assumes that the blades incorporate an airfoil cross section. Figure AA.6 shows a typical airfoil, including some of the nomenclature. 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00Cp 109876543210 Tip Speed Ratio Betz - Without Wake AA-1 1 | P a ge Figure AA.6: Airfoil nomenclature T he BEM method equates the forces on the blades associated with air flowing over the airfoil with forces associated with the change in momentum of the air passing through the rotor. The starting point for this analysis is the assessment of the lift force on an airfoil. Lift is a force perpendicular to the flow. It is given by 2 21~cU C FL L= (9) Where: LF~ = force per unit length, N/m CL = lift coefficient, - c = chord length (distance from leading edge to trailing edge of airfoil, m) Thin airfoil theory predicts that for a very thin, ideal airfoil the lift coefficient is given by sin 2=LC ( 11) where is the angle of attack, which is the angle between the flow and the chord line of the airfoil. The lift coefficient for real airfoils typically includes a constant term but the slope, at least for low angles of attack, is similar to that for an ideal airfoil. For greater angles of attack (above 10-15 degrees) the lift coefficient begins to decrease, eventually approaching zero. This is known as stall. A typical lift coefficient vs. angle of attack curve is illustrated in Figure AA.7. angle of mean camber line (hallwaV between top and bottom) -----_j_attack ..-------~----- Uwnd / leading edge chord line 004489WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-1 2 | P a ge Figure AA.7: Typical airfoil lift vs. angle of attack T here is always some drag force associated with fluid flow. This is a force is in line with the flow. Drag force (per unit length) is given by: 2 21~cU C FD D= (12) Where CD = drag coefficient When designing blades for a wind turbine, it is generally desired to minimize the drag to lift ratio at the design point. This generally results in a lift coefficient in the vicinity of 1.0 and a drag coefficient of approximately 0.006, although these values can differ depending on the airfoil. Blade element momentum theory, as noted above, relates the blade shape to its performance. The following approach is used. The blade is divided into elements and the rotor is divided into annuli. Two simultaneous equations are developed: one expresses the lift and drag coefficient (and thus forces) on the blade elements as a function of airfoil data and the wind's angle of attack. The other expresses forces on the annuli as a function of the wind through the rotor, rotor characteristics, and changes in momentum. Some of the key assumptions are: (i) the forces on blade elements are determined solely by lift/drag characteristics of the airfoil, (ii) there is no flow along the blade, (iii) lift and drag force are perpendicular and parallel respectively to a \"relative wind,\" and (iv) forces are resolved into components perpendicular to the rotor (\"thrust\") and tangential to it (\"torque\"). Using BEM theory, it may be shown for an ideal rotor that the angle of relative wind, , as a function of tip speed ratio and radial position on the blade is given by: 1.4 c 1.2 Q) \u00b7;:; Ii= 1.0 Q) 0 u <ii 0.8 C 0 \u00b7.;; 0.6 C Q) E 0.4 '5 C: 0 0.2 z 0.0 0 4 8 12 16 Anqle of attack. deqrees 004490WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-1 3 | P a ge ()()r 1 tan1 32= (13) Similarly, the chord length is given by: ( )cos 18 = LBCrc ( 14) Where B = the number of blades There are some useful observations to be drawn out of the above equations. First of all, in the ideal case the blade will be twisted. In fact, the twist angle will differ from the angle of relative wind by the angle of attack and a reference pitch angle p as follows: p T = ( 15) It may also be noted that the twist angle will at first increase slowly when moving from th e tip inward and then increase more rapidly. Second, the chord of the blade will also increase upon moving from the tip inward, at first slowly and then more rapidly. In the ideal case then, a wind turbine blade is both significantly twisted and tapered. Real blades, however, are designed with a less than optimal shape for a variety of practical reasons. Another important observation has to do with the total area of the blades in comparison to the swept area. The ratio of the projected blade area is known as the solidity, . For a given angle of attack, the solidity will decrease with increasing tip speed ratio. For example, assuming a lift coefficient CL of 1.0, the solidity of an optimum rotor designed to operate at a tip speed ratio of 2.0 is 0.43 whereas an optimum rotor designed to operate at a tip speed ratio of 6.0 would have a solidity of 0.088. It is therefore apparent that in order to keep blade material (and thus cost) to a minimum, it is desirable to design for a tip speed ratio as high as possible. There are other considerations in selecting a design tip speed ratio for a turbine other than the solidity, however. On the one hand, higher tip speed ratios will result in gearboxes with a lower speed up ratio for a given turbine. On the other hand, the effect of drag and surface roughness of the blade surface may become more significant for a higher tip speed ratio rotor. This effect could result in decreased performance. Another concern is material strength. The total forces on the rotor are nearly the same on the rotor regardless of the solidity. Thus the stresses would be higher. A final consideration is noise. Higher tip speed ratios generally result in more noise produced by the blades. I I 004491WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-14 | P a ge T here are numerous other considerations regarding the design of a wind turbine rotor, including tip losses, type of airfoil to be used, ease of manufacturing and transport, type of control used, selection of materials, etc. These are all outside the scope of this overview, however. Real wind turbine rotors are designed taking into account many factors, including but not only their aerodynamic performance. In addition, the rotor must be controlled so as to generate electricity most effectively and so as to withstand continuously fluctuating forces during normal operation and extreme loads during storms. Accordingly, a wind turbine rotor does not in general operate at its own maximum power coefficient at all wind speeds. Because of this, the power output of a wind turbine is generally described by curve, known as a power curve, rather than an equation such as the one for PWT which given earlier. Figure AA.8 illustrates a typical power curve. As shown there, below the cut-in speed (3 m/s in the example) no power is produced. Between cut-in and rated wind speed (14.5 m/s in this example), the power increases significantly with wind speed. Above the rated speed, the power produced is constant, regardless of the wind speed, and above the cut-out speed (25 m/s in the example), the turbine is shut down. Figure AA.8: Typical wind turbine power curve AA.7 Wind Turbine Mechanics and Dynamics Earlier we discussed the aerodynamic aspects of a wind turbine, and how that related to its design, performance, and appearance. The next major consideration has to do with the turbine's survivability. This topic includes its ability to withstand the forces to which the turbine 0100020003000400050006000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40Power, kW Wind speed, m/s 004492WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-15 | P a ge w ill be subjected, deflections of various components, and vibrations that may result during operations. Issues that need to be considered include: (i) ultimate strength, (ii) relative motion of components, (iii) vibrations, (iv) loads, (v) responses, (vi) stresses, (vii) unsteady motion, resulting in fatigue, and (viii) material properties. The types of loads that a turbine may be subjected to are as follows: static (non-rotating), steady (rotating), cyclic, transient, impulsive, stochastic, or resonance-induced. Sources of loads may include aerodynamics, gravity, dynamic interactions, or mechanical control. To understand the various loads that a wind turbine may experience, the reader may wish to review the fundamentals of statics (no motion), dynamics (motion), Newton's second law, the various rotational relations (kinematics), strength of materials (including Hooke's law and finding stresses from moments and geometry), gyroscopic forces/moments, and vibrations. Among other topics, the cantilevered beam is particularly important, since rotor blades as well as towers have similar characteristics. Wind turbines are frequently both the source of and are subject to vibrations. Although the topic can become quite complicated, it is worthwhile to recall that the natural frequency of simple oscillating mass, m, and spring, with spring constant, k, and is given by: m k/= (16) Similarly, rotational natural frequency about an axis of rotation is given by: J k/= (17) Where k is the rotational spring constant and J is the mass moment of inertia A continuous body, such as a wind turbine blade, will actually have an infinite number of natural frequencies (although only the first few are important), and associated with each natural frequency will be a mode shape that characterizes it deflection. The vibration of a uniform cantilevered beam can be described relatively simply through the use of Euler's equation (see Manwell et al., 2009). Non-uniform elements require more complex methods for their analysis. AA.7.a Rotor Motions There is a variety of motions that occur in the rotor that can be significant to the design or operation of the turbine. These include those in the flapwise, edgewise, and torsional directions. 004493WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-16 | P a ge F lapwise motions are those that are perpendicular to plane of the rotor, and are considered positive in the direction of the thrust. Flapwise forces are the source of the highest aerodynamic bending moments, and accordingly the most significant stresses. Lead-lag, or edgewise, motions are in plane of rotor and are considered positive when in the direction of the torque. Fluctuating motions in this direction are reflected in the power. Torsion refers to the twisting of blade about its long axis. Torsional moments in the blades must be accounted for in the design of pitch control mechanisms. The most important rotor load is the thrust. This is the total force on the rotor in the direction of the wind (flapwise). It is associated with the conversion of the kinetic energy of the wind to mechanical energy. The thrust, T, (N) is given by: 2 2 21U R C TT = (18) Where CT is the thrust coefficient. For the ideal rotor in which the axial induction factor, a, is equal to 1/3 (corresponding to the Betz limit), it is easy to show that the thrust coefficient is equal to 8/9. For the same rotor, the thrust coefficient may be as high as 1.0, but this would not occur at Cp = Cp,Betz. This thrust gives rise to flapwise bending moments at the root of the blade. For example, for the ideal rotor when a = 1/3, and assuming a very small hub, it may be shown that the flapwise bending moment M at the root of the blade would be given by: RBTM32= (19) Where B = number of blades From the bending moment, it is straightforward to find the maximum bending stress in the blade. For example, suppose that a blade is 2 t m thick at the root, has a symmetrical airfoil, and that the thrust force is perpendicular to the chord line. Then the bending stress would be: bIt M =max , (20) (Note that for a real blade, the asymmetry and the angles would complicate the calculation, but the principle is the same.) 004494WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-1 7 | P a ge An other important load is torque, Q (Nm). Torque is given by: 2 2 21U R C QQ = (21) Where CQ = the torque coefficient, which also equal to Cp/. Note that torque is also given by: =/P Q ( 22) Where P = power (W) The dynamics of a wind turbine rotor are quite complicated and do not lend themselves to simple illustrations. There is one approach, however, due to Stoddard (Eggleston and Stoddard, 1987) and summarized by (Manwell et al., 2009) which is relatively tractable, but will not be discussed here. In general, the dynamic response of wind turbine rotors must be simulated by numerical models, such as the FAST code (Jonkman, 2005) developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. AA.7.b Fatigue Fatigue is an important phenomenon in all wind turbines. The term refers to the degradation of materials due to fluctuating stresses. Such stresses occur constantly in wind turbines due to the inherent variability of the wind, the rotation of the rotor and the yawing of the rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) to follow the wind as its direction changes. Fatigue results in shortened life of many materials and must be accounted for in the design. Figure AA.9 illustrates a typical time history of bending moment that would give rise to fluctuating stresses of similar appearance. - 004495WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-1 8 | P a ge Figure AA.9: Typical wind turbine blade bending moment T he ability of a material to withstand stress fluctuations of various magnitudes is typically illustrated in an S-N curve. In such curves the stress level is shown on the y axis and is plotted against the number of cycles to failure. As is apparent from the figure above, stress fluctuations of a variety of magnitudes are likely. The effect of a number of cycles of different ranges is accounted for by the damage due to each cycle using \"Miner's Rule.\" In this case, an amount of damage, d, due to n cycles, where the stress is such that N cycles will result in damage is found as follows: N n d/= (23) Miner's Rule states that the sum of all the damage, D, from cycles of all magnitudes must be less than 1.0, or failure is to be expected imminently: = 1 /i iN n D ( 24) Miner's Rule works best when the cycling is relatively simple. When cycles of varying a mplitude follow each other, an algorithm called \"rainflow\" cycle counting\" (Downing and Socie, 1982) is used. 1500 -500 0 2 I 3 Time, seconds 4 5 004496WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-19 | P a ge A A.8 Components of Wind Turbines Wind turbines consist of two main subsystems, the rotor nacelle assembly and the support structure, and each of these is comprised of many components. The following provides some more description of these subsystems. More details, particularly on the rotor nacelle assembly may be found in (Manwell et al., 2009). AA.8.a Rotor Nacelle Assembly The rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) includes the majority of the components associated with the conversion of the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy. There are two major component groupings in the RNA as well as a number of ancillary components. The main groupings are the rotor and the drive train. The rotor includes the blades, the hub, and pitch control components. The drive train includes shafts, bearings, gearbox (if any), couplings, mechanical brake, and generator. Other components include the bedplate, yaw bearing and yaw drive, oil cooling system, climate control, other electrical components, and parts of the control system. An example of a typical rotor nacelle assembly is illustrated in Figure AA.10. 004497WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-2 0 | P a ge Figure AA.10: Typical Rotor Nacelle Assembly (From Vestas http://re.emsd.gov.hk/english/wind/large/large_to.html) AA.8.b Rotor T he primary components of the rotor are the blades. At the present time, most wind turbines have three blades, and they are oriented so as to operate upwind of the tower. It is to be expected that in the future some wind turbines, particularly those intended for use offshore, will have two blades and will be oriented downwind of the tower, however. For a variety of reasons (including that downwind turbines tend to be noisier) it is less likely that they will be used on land, particularly in populated areas. The general shape of the blades is chosen in accordance with the principles discussed previously. The other major factor is the required strength of the blades. For this reason, it is often the case that thicker airfoils are used nearer the root than are used closer to the tip. Blades Technical STUDY AA-21 | P a ge f or most modern wind turbines are constructed of composites. The laminates are primarily fiberglass with some carbon fiber for additional strength. The binders are polyester or epoxy. At the root of the blades the composite material is attached to a steel root, which can then be subsequently bolted to the hub. Most utility scale wind turbines at present include blade pitch control, so there is a mechanism present at the interface of the hub and the blades that will both secure the blades and facilitate their rotation about their long axis. The hub of the wind turbine rotor is constructed from steel. It is designed so as to attach to the main shaft of the drive train as well as to connect with the blades. AA.8.c Drive train The drive train consists of a number of components, including shafts, couplings, a gearbox (usually), a generator, and a brake. AA.8.d Shafts The main shaft of the drive train is designed to transmit the torque from the rotor to the gearbox (if there is one) or directly to the generator if there is no gearbox. This shaft may also be required to carry some or all of the weight of the rotor. The applied torque will vary with the amount of power being produced, but in general it is given by the power divided by the rotational speed. As discussed previously, a primary consideration in the aerodynamic design of a wind turbine rotor is the tip speed ratio. A typical design tip speed ratio is 7. Consider a wind turbine with a diameter of 80 m, designed for most efficient operation at a wind speed 12 m/s. The rotational speed of the rotor and thus the main shaft under these conditions would be 20 rpm. AA.8.e Gearbox Wind turbines are intended to generate electricity, but most conventional generators are designed to turn at higher speeds than do wind turbine rotors (see below). Therefore, a gearbox is commonly used to increase the speed of the shaft that drives the generator relative to that of the main shaft. Gearboxes consist of a housing, gears, bearings, multiple shafts, seals, and lubricants. Gearboxes for wind turbines are typically either of the parallel shaft or planetary type. Frequently a gearbox incorporates multiple stages, since the maximum allowed ratio per stage is usually well under 10:1. There are trade-offs in the selection of gearbox. Parallel shaft gearboxes are generally less expensive than planetary ones but they are also heavier. Gearboxes are generally quite efficient. Thus the power out is very nearly equal to the power in. The torque in the shafts is then equal to the power divided by the speed of the shaft. 004499WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-22 | P a ge A A.8.f Brake Nearly all wind turbines incorporate a mechanical brake somewhere on the drive train. This brake is normally designed to stop the rotor under all foreseeable conditions, although in some cases it might only serve as a parking brake for the rotor. Mechanical brakes on utility scale wind turbines are mostly of the caliper/disc type although other types are possible. Brakes may be placed on either the low speed or the high speed side of the gearbox. The advantage of placing it on the high speed side is that less braking torque is required to stop the rotor. On the other hand, the braking torque must then pass through the gearbox, possibly leading to premature failure of the gearbox. In either case, the brake must be designed to absorb all of the rotational energy in the rotor, which is converted into heat as the rotor stops. AA.8.g Generator Electrical generators operate via the rotation of a coil of wire in a magnetic field. The magnetic field is created by one or more pairs of magnetic poles situated opposite each other across the axis of rotation. The magnetic field may be created either by electromagnets (as in conventional synchronous generators), by induction in the rotor (as in induction generators,) or with permanent magnets. In alternating current systems the number of pairs of poles and the grid frequency determine the nominal operating speed of the generator. For example, in a 60 Hz AC system, such as the United States, a generator with two pairs of poles would have a nominal operating speed of 1800 rpm. In most AC generators, the field rotates and while the current is generated in a stationary armature (the stator). The majority of utility scale wind turbines today use wound rotor induction generators (WRIG). This type of generator can function over a relatively wide range of speeds (on the order of 2:1). Wound rotor induction generators are employed together with a power electronic converter in the rotor circuit. In such an arrangement approximately 2/3 of the power is produced on the stator in the usual way. The other third of the power is produced on the rotor and converted to AC of the correct frequency by the power electronic converter. In this configuration the WRIG is often referred to as a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). A number of wind turbines use permanent magnet generators. Such generators often have multiple pole pairs as well. This can allow the generator to have the same nominal speed as the wind turbine rotor so the main shaft can be connected directly to the generator without the use of a gearbox. Most permanent magnet generators are designed to operate together with 004500WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-23 | P a ge p ower electronic converters. These converters facilitate variable speed operation of the turbine, while ensuring that the electricity that is produced is of constant frequency and compatible with the electrical grid to which the turbine is connected. AA.8.h Bedplate The bedplate is a steel frame to which components of the drive train and other components of the RNA are attached. It ensures that all the components are properly aligned. AA.8.i Yaw System Most wind turbines today include a yaw system. This system facilitates orienting the RNA into the wind as the wind direction changes. First of all, there is a slewing bearing that connects the top of the tower to the RNA, allowing the latter to rotate with respect to the former. Also attached to the top of the tower, and often to the outside perimeter of the slewing bearing, is a large diameter bull gear. A yaw motor connected to a smaller gear is attached to the bedplate. When the yaw motor is energized, the small gear engages the bull gear, causing the RNA to move relative to the tower. A yaw controller ensures that the motion is in the proper direction and that it continues until the RNA is aligned with the wind. A yaw brake holds the RNA fixed in position until the yaw controller commands a new orientation. AA.8.j Control System A wind turbine will have a control system that ensures the proper operation of the turbine at all times. The control system has two main functions: supervisory control and dynamic control. The supervisory control continuously monitors the external conditions and the operating parameters of the turbine, and starts it up or shuts it down as necessary. The dynamic control system ensures smooth operation of various controllable components, such the pitch of the blades or the electrical torque of the generator. The control system may also be integrated with or at least be in communication with a condition monitoring system that watches over the condition of various key components. AA.8.k Support Structure The support structure of a wind turbine is any part of the turbine that is below the main bearing. The support structure for land-based wind turbines may be conceptually divided into two main parts: the tower and the foundation. The tower of a wind turbine is normally constructed of tapered steel tubes. The tubes are bolted together on site to form a single structure of the desired height. The foundation of a wind turbine is the part of the support structure, which 004501WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-24 | P a ge i s in contact with the ground. Foundations are typically constructed of reinforced concrete. When turbines are installed on rock, the foundations may be attached to the rock with rods, which are grouted into predrilled holes. AA.8.l Materials for Wind Turbines The primary types of materials used in the various components of wind turbines are steel, copper, composites, and concrete. AA.9 Installation Installation of wind turbines may be a significant undertaking. It involves the following: Complete assessment of site conditions Detailed preparing for the installation Constructing the foundation Delivering the components to the site Assembling the components into sub-assemblies Lifting the sub-assemblies into place with a crane Installing the electrical equipment Final testing More details may be found in (Manwell et al., 2009). AA.10 Energy Production The purpose of wind turbines is to produce energy. Energy production is usually considered annually. The amount of energy that a wind turbine will produce in a year, Ey, is a function of the wind resource at the site where it is installed and the power curve of the wind turbine. Estimates are usually done by calculating the expected energy that will be produced every hour of a representative year and then summing the energy from all of those hours as shown below: ( ) = =8760 1ii WT y t U P E (25) Where Ui is the wind speed in the ith hour of the year, PWT(Ui) is the average power (based on the power curve) during the ith hour and t is the length of the time period of interest (here, one hr). The units of energy are Wh, but the amount of energy production is frequently expressed in either kWh or MWh for the sake of convenience. 004502WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-25 | P a ge I t is sometimes cumbersome to characterize the performance of a wind turbine by its actual energy production. Accordingly, a normalized term known as the capacity factor, CF, is used. This is the given by the actual energy that is produced (or estimated to be produced) divided by the amount of energy that would be produced if the turbine were running at is rated output, PR, for the entire year. It is found from the following equation: Ry PECF8760= (26) AA.11 Unsteady Aspects of Wind Turbine Operation There are a number of unsteady aspects of wind turbine operation that are significant to the discussion of public reaction to wind turbines. These in particular include the variations in the wind field that can change the nature of the sound emitted from the rotor during operation. These unsteady effects include the following: 1. Wind shear - Wind shear refers to the variation of wind speed across some spatial dimension. Wind shear is most commonly thought of as a vertical phenomenon, that is to say, the increase of wind speed with height. Wind shear can also occur laterally across the rotor under some circumstances. Vertical wind shear is often modeled by a power law as discussed earlier. There are some situations, however, in which such a model is not applicable. One example has to with highly stable atmosphere, such that the wind near the ground is relatively light, but at the height of the rotor the wind is high enough that turbine may be operating. Under such conditions there may be sound emanating from the rotor, but relatively little wind induced sound near the ground to mask that from the rotor. Wind shear may also result in a cyclically varying aspect to the sound produced by the blades as they rotate. This occurs due to the changing magnitude and direction of the relative wind as the blades pass through zones of different wind speed. 2. Tower shadow or blockage - The wind flow near the tower is inevitably somewhat different from where there is no tower. The effect is much more pronounced on wind turbines with downwind rotors, but it still occurs with up-wind rotors. This tower effect can result in a distinct change in sound once per revolution of each blade. 004503WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-26 | P a ge 3 . Turbulence - Turbulence refers to changes in magnitude and direction of the wind at varying time scales and length scales. The presence of turbulence can affect the nature of the sound. 4. Changes in wind direction - Wind turbines are designed to yaw in response to changes in wind direction. The yawing process takes a finite amount of time and during that time the wind impinging on the rotor will do so at a different direction than it will when the yawing process is complete. Sound produced during the yawing process may have a somewhat different character than after it is complete. 5. Stall - Under some conditions part or all of the airfoils on the blades may be in stall. That is, the angle of relative wind is high enough that the airfoil begins to lose lift. Additional turbulence may also be generated. Again, the nature of the sound produced by the rotor may be different than during an unstalled state. It may also be noted that some turbines intentionally take advantage of stall to limit power in high winds. Under such conditions there may also be a change in sound in comparison to normal operation. AA.11.a Periodicity of Unsteady Aspects of Wind Turbine Operation Due to the rotation of the rotor and the nature of the wind, there tend to be certain features of the turbine's operation that are periodic in nature. The most dominant of these have frequencies associated with the rotational speed of the rotor and the blade passage frequency, which is simply the rotational speed times the number of blades. For example, the dominant frequencies in a 3-blade wind turbine rotating at 20 rpm would be 0.33 Hz and 1 Hz. Other significant frequencies may be the first few harmonics of the rotational frequency and blade passage frequency. AA.12 Wind Turbines and Avoided Pollutants Wind turbines have a positive impact on human health via avoiding emission of pollutants that would result if the electricity that they generate were produced instead by other generators. While the average emissions of various pollutants per MWh produced from conventional generators is relatively easy to estimate, it is harder to estimate the actual impact of wind turbine generation. This is because the electricity distributed by the electrical grid is produced by different types of generators, and the operation of these generators will be affected differently as a result of the supply of part of the total electrical demand by the wind turbines. 004504WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-27 | P a ge I n general, electricity in any large utility network comes from three types of generators: base load, intermediate load, and peaking plants. The fuel or energy source supplying these generators is likely to be coal, fuel oil, natural gas, uranium (nuclear plants), or water (hydroelectric plants). Base load plants are typically coal fired or nuclear plants. Intermediate load plants often use fuel oil or natural gas. Peaking plants are normally natural gas or hydroelectric. There are a considerable number of plants that may be operating at any given time. Which plants are actually operating is determined by the system operator in accordance with what the near term forecasted load is expected to be and the estimated (bid) cost per MWh from all the plant operators in the system. For thermal plants the bid cost is close to that projected fuel cost/MWh. This in turn is found from heat rate of the fuel (kg/MWh) for the plant in question times the unit cost of the fuel ($/kg). Less efficient plants or those with higher unit fuel costs tend to have relatively high bid costs. (Note on the other hand, that wind turbines would have bid costs of zero, since they do not use fuel.) If a large number of wind turbines are operating such that they are contributing a significant amount of electricity to the total load, the mix of generators may well be different than it would be if the turbines were not present. If only a small number of wind turbines are present, then the mix of generators may not change. However, certain of the plants would be curtailed so as to produce less energy and thus consume less fuel. The emissions of pollutants from all the operating plants could be calculated and so could the projected emissions that would have resulted if the wind turbines were not present. The difference in amount of pollutants produced could then be assigned to the wind turbine as the avoided emissions. To do such an analysis properly involves estimating the actual impact of wind turbine generation on the mix of generators and the operating level of those generators for every hour of the year. This is a non-trivial exercise, but it has been done for an offshore wind farm that was proposed for the town of Hull, MA. That project was to have included four 3.6 MW turbines, for a total capacity of 14.4 MW. The pollutants considered in the study were CO 2, NOX, and SO X. The results of that study are described in detail in (Rached, 2008). The results of that study are summarized in Table AA.1. The results in the table are normalized for a 1 MW (rated) wind turbine and use the medium estimated wind speed for the site. (Note under the assumptions of Rached's study, a one MW (rated) wind turbine in the medium wind speed scenario at the site would generate 2,580 MWh/yr). 004505WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AA-28 | P a ge Table AA.1: Avoided emissions of pollutants for 14.4 MW wind project (based on Rached, 2008) CO 2 SO X (kg/MWyr) NO X (kg/MWyr) 1,970,000 3,480 1,490 A simpler but less accurate way to estimate the avoided emissions is to use the marginal rates for pollutants as specified by the Massachusetts Greenhouse Gas policy (MEPA, 2007). Applying this method Rached calculated avoided emissions per MW (rated) for the three pollutants for one year of 1,320,000 kg CO 2, 2,080 kg of SO 2, and 701 kg of NO x. In the analysis summarized above the majority of the avoidance of pollutant production would be due to reduced consumption of natural gas. If a larger fraction of Massachusetts' energy were to be produced by wind energy, there could be significant reductions of the consumption of fuel oil and coal as well. This should result in larger amounts of avoided pollution per unit of wind turbine production 004506WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AB-1 | Pa ge A ppendix B Wind Turbines - Shadow Flicker AB.1 Shadow Flicker and Flashing Shadow flicker occurs when the moving blades of a wind turbine rotor cast moving shadows that cause a flickering effect. This flicker could annoy people living close to the turbine. Similarly, it is possible for sunlight to be reflected from gloss-surfaced turbine blades and cause a \"flashing\" effect. This phenomenon will occur during a limited amount of time in a year, depending on the altitude of the sun, s; the height of the turbine, H, the radius of the rotor, R, and the height, direction and distance to the viewing point. At any given time the maximum distance from a turbine that a flickering shadow will extend is given by: ( )()s view shadow h R H x tan /max , + = (27) Where hview is the height of the viewing point. The solar altitude depends on the latitude, the day of the year, and the time as given in the following equations (Duffie and Beckman, 2006) ()()() [ ] sin sin cos ) cos( ) cos( cos 901+ \u00b0 = s (28) Where = declination of the earth's axis, \u00f8 = latitude and = the hour angle The declination is found from the following equation: ) 365 / ) 284 ( 360 sin( 45 . 23n+ = (29) Where n = day of the year The hour angle is found from the hours from noon (solar time, negative before noon, positive after noon), divided by 15 to convert to degrees. Another relevant angle is the solar azimuth. This indicates the angle of the sun with respect to certain reference direction (usually north) at a particular time. For example, the sun is always in the south at solar noon, so its azimuth is 180\u00b0 at that time. The solar azimuth is important since it determines the angle of the wind turbine's shadow with respect to the tower. See Duffie and Beckman (2006) for details on calculating the solar azimuth. 004507WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AB-2 | Pa ge For example, consider a location 1 (day 60) and the time is 3:00 in the afternoon. Also assume that the turbine has a tower height of 80 m and a radius of 30 m and that the viewing he solar altitude is 24.4\u00b0, and the solar azimuth is 50.2\u00b0 W of S. The maximum extent of the shadow is 238 m from the turbine. The angle of the shadow is 50.2\u00b0 E of N. Sites are typically characterized by charts su location in Denmark (EWEA, 2004). The chart gives the number of hours per year of flicker shadow as a function of direction and distance (measured in units of hub height). In the example shown, two viewing poin ts are considered.

This planning can be site-specific in order to avoid potential problems with specific sites based on geographical location or weather patterns. In terms of safe distances to reduce shadow flicker, these are often project-specific because it depends on whether there are residences or roadways present and what the geographic layout is. This could be particularly important in areas with more forestry and existing shadow, which could reduce nuisance from turbine produced shadow flicker or whether it is an otherwise open land area such as farmland that would be more susceptible to the annoyance of shadow flicker. A general estimate for modeling a shadow flicker risk zone includes 10 times the rotor diameter such that a 90-meter diameter would be equivalent to a 900-meter impact area. However, only certain portions of this zone are actually likely to experience shadow flicker for a significant amount of time. Other modeling considerations include when at least 20% of the sun is covered by the blade and whether to include the blade width in estimates as well. In terms of distance, 2,000 meters is the WindPro computer program default distance (NEWEEP, 2011) for calculations of wind turbine produced shadow flicker. Finally, due to atmospheric effects, 1400 m is the maximum distance from a turbine within which shadow flicker is likely to be significant. In terms of existing regulations regarding shadow flicker rates, there are no current shadow flicker regulations in Massachusetts (or many other New England states, but there are statewide and local guidelines that have been implemented. These guidelines were provided by the Department of Energy Resources in March 2009 and state that, \"wind turbines shall be sited in a manner that minimizes shadowing or flicker impacts\" and, \"the applicant has the burden of proving that this effect does not have significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses.\" Local Massachusetts regulations include the Worcester, MA zoning ordinance, which requires, \"The facility owner and operator shall make reasonable efforts to minimize shadow flicker to any occupied building on a non-participating landowner's property.\" Also, a shadow flicker assessment report is required as is a plan showing the \"area of estimated wind turbine shadow flicker.\" Similarly, the Newburyport, MA regulations require that wind turbines do not result in significant shadow or flicker impacts and an analysis is required for planned projects (NEWEEP, 2011). The Maine model wind energy facility ordinance states that wind turbines should, \"avoid unreasonable adverse shadow flicker effect at any occupied building located on a non- 004509WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AB-4 | Pa ge p articipating landowner's property.\" They do not state any specific limit to shadow flicker other than these guidelines. However, the New Hampshire Model Small Wind Energy Systems Ordinance states that wind turbines, \"shall be sited in a manner that does not result in significant shadow flicker impacts...significant shadow flicker is defined as more than 30 hours per year on abutting occupied buildings.\" Similar to Maine, several states in the US have adopted the German model of 30 hours per year of allowed shadow flicker that was primarily based on the government-sponsored study summarized above. However, other states or localities including Hutchinson, Minnesota have enacted stricter guidelines including no shadow flicker to be allowed at an existing residential structure, and up to 30 hours per year of shadow flicker allowed on roadways or residentially zoned properties and a computer analysis is required for project approval (NEWEEP, 2011). In addition, computer programs such as WindPro are also recommended by most states and localities for use in all new planned installations to reduce this potential nuisance of shadow flicker on residential properties or potential health hazards to drivers on busy highways or roadways. 004510WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AC-1 | Pa ge A ppendix C Wind Turbines - Ice Throw AC.1 Ice Falling or Thrown from Wind Turbines Under certain weather conditions ice may form on the surface of wind turbine blades. Normally, wind turbines intended for use in locations where ice may form are designed to shut down when there is a significant amount of ice on the blades. The means to prevent operation when ice is present may include ice sensor and vibration sensors. Ice sensors are used on most wind turbines in cold climates. Vibration sensors are used on nearly all wind turbines. They would cause the turbine to shut down, for example, if ice buildup on the blades resulted in an imbalance of the rotor and hence detectable vibrations in the structure. Ice built up on blades normally falls off while the turbine is stationary. If that occurs during high winds, the ice could be blown by the wind some distance from the tower. In addition, it is conceivable that ice could be thrown from a moving wind turbine blade under some circumstances, although that would most likely occur only during startup (while the rotational speed is still relatively low) or as a result of the failure of the control system. It is therefore worth considering what the maximum plausible distance that a piece of ice could land from the turbine under two \"worst case\" circumstances: 1) ice falls from a stopped turbine during very high winds, and 2) ice is suddenly released from a blade when the rotor is rotating at its normal operating speed. In both cases, the distance that the ice may travel is governed by Newton's laws and the principles of fluid mechanics. Calculations are quite simple when the effect of the air (and the wind) is ignored. For example, in that case if a piece of ice falls from a turbine, it will land directly below where it is released. The situation is a little more complex, but still readily solvable if the piece of ice is moving when it is released. For example, suppose that the ice is initially on the tip of a blade, and the blade is pointing vertically upward. Once the ice is released it will continue moving horizontally at the speed it had when it was still attached to the blade. But it will also begin to fall towards the ground, so the piece of ice will have two components of velocity until the ice hits the ground. The time tg (s) it takes for the ice to reach the ground (assuming a horizontal surface) is g h tg/ 2= where h = height (m) at which the ice is released 004511WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AC-2 | Pa ge a nd g = acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s2). The distance x (m) that the ice would travel is R t xg = where is the rotational speed of the rotor (rad/s) and R is the length of the blade (m). Such an analysis is overly simplified, however. It would underestimate the distance that the ice would travel if it fell from a stationary turbine in a high wind, and it would overestimate the distance that the ice would travel if it were suddenly released from a moving blade. It is necessary to consider the effect of the air and the force that it will impart upon the falling ice. For motion in the vertical ( z) direction the equation of motion is the following: z zma F= (30) where Fz is the net force (N), m is the mass (kg), and az is the acceleration (m/s2). The force includes two main components. One is the weight, W (N). It is due to gravity and acts in the negative z direction. The other one is due to the drag of the air and it acts opposite to the direction of the velocity. It is found from: 2 21 z D D V A C F= (31) where is the density of air (1.225 kg/m2 under standard conditions), A is the projected area (m2) of the piece of ice, CD is the drag coefficient of the ice and Vz is the velocity of the ice (m/s) in the z direction. Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity, so we can rewrite the equation of motion for the vertical direction as follows: ( ) m V A C V sign WdtdV z D zz/212 = (32) Where sign (...) indicates the direction of motion along the z axis. For the general case, the piece of ice may leave the blade with initial speed R at an arbitrary angle with respect to the horizontal. Accordingly, there will be two components of the velocity, one in the z direction (as before) Vz, the other in the x direction, Vx. This assumes that the x axis is horizontal, is also in the plane of the rotor, and is positive in the direction of the tip of the blade at its apogee. 004512WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AC-3 | Pa ge Th ese velocities are initially: ()sin0 Vz = ( 33) ()cos0 ,R Vx = ( 34) The equation of motion for the x direction is: ( ) m V A C V signdtdV x D zx/21 2 = (35) The above equations are a bit difficult to solve analytically, but they can be solved n umerically fairly easily. Similar equations may also be developed for the case of a particle of ice falling from a stationary turbine. Some data from actual ice throw has been compiled by Seifert et al. (2003). Figure AC.1, taken from that report is shown below. Figure AC.1: Observed throwing distance of ice (from Seifert et al., 2003) fl+-----------------------------,--------- Q !(; 15 JD 4D Radluslnm 004513WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AC-4 | Pa ge A s may be seen in the figure, the maximum distance that ice was observed to fall from a turbine with a diameter of 20 m during operation was approximately 100 m. Based on the observed data, Seifert et al. suggest the following simplified formula for the maximum throwing distance: ()H R xthrow + =2 5 . 1max, (36) Where xmax,throw = maximum throwing distance (m), R = rotor diameter (m) and H = hub height (m). By way of illustration, Equation 36 was used to predict the maximum throwing distance of a piece of ice from a turbine with a rotor radius of 20 m installed on a tower 50 m high. That distance was 135 m. The theoretical equations given previously were also used to calculate throwing distance. The following assumptions were made: spherically shaped piece of ice, drag coefficient of 1.2, air density of 1.225 kg/m3, ice density of 700 kg/m3, rotor speed of 40 rpm (corresponding to a tip speed ratio of 7 at a wind speed of 12 m/s), angle of release of 45\u00b0, and instantaneous release of the ice. The equations predict a maximum throwing distance of 226 m or somewhat less than twice that predicted from the empirical equation. The difference is deemed to be reasonable, especially considering the idealized shape of the particle. Real pieces of ice would actually be highly non-spherical in shape and experience considerably more drag. It may also be noted that it was reported in Cattin et al. (2007) that ice did not fall as far from a wind turbine in the Swiss Alps as would be predicted from Equation 36. In that case the maximum observed distance from a turbine with radius of 20 m and a tower height of 50 m was 92 m. As noted above, Equation 36 predicts 135 m. Seifert et al. also considered data regarding ice thrown from stationary turbines. Based on the available data they proposed a simple equation for predicted ice fall. That equation is ()15 /max, H R U xfall + = (37) Where U = wind speed at hub height in m/s, xmax,fall = maximum falling distance (m), R = rotor radius (m), H = hub height (m). Using Equation 37, the predicted maximum distance for a turbine with a radius of 20 m, a tower height of 50 m, and a wind speed of 20 m/s is 120 m. By way of comparison, the fall distance was predicted from the theoretical equations given above for the same situation. The 004514WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AC-5 | Pa ge r esults are highly dependent on the size of the piece of ice and hence the surface to volume ratio. To take one example, a piece of ice that was assumed to be spherical and to have a weight of 10 g would land 110 m from the tower. In the examples discussed by Seifert et al., all the pieces of ice landed less than 100 m from the tower. AC.2 Summary of Ice Throw Discussion As noted above, there are two plausible scenarios in which ice may fall from a wind turbine and may land at some distance from the tower. In the first scenario, ice that falls from a stationary turbine is blown some distance from the tower. In the second scenario, ice is thrown from the blade of an operating turbine during a failure of the control system. In the first case, ice may land 100 m or more from the tower in high winds, depending on the wind speed, the height from which the ice falls, and the dimensions of the ice. In the second case, the ice could land even further from the turbine. Just how far would depend on the actual speed of the rotor when the ice was shed, the height of the tower, the length of the blade, the angular position of the blade when the ice was released, and the size and shape of the ice. In general, it appears that ice is unlikely to land farther from the turbine than its maximum vertical extent (tower height plus the radius.) 004515WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-1 | P a ge A ppendix D Wind Turbine - Noise Introduction Noise is defined simply as unwanted sound. Sound is defined as the sensation produced by stimulation of the organs of hearing by vibrations transmitted through the air or other medium. In air, the transmission is due to a repeating cycle of compressed and expanded air. The frequency of the sound is the number of times per second, Hertz (Hz), that the cycle repeats. Sound at a single frequency is called a tone while sound that is a combination of many frequencies is called broadband. The human ear is capable of responding over a frequency range from approximately 20 Hz to 20 kHz (Hz: Hertz = 1 cycle/second; Middle C on a piano is a frequency of 262 Hz). AD.1 Sound Pressure Level Sound is characterized by both its frequency and its amplitude. Sound pressure is measured in micro Pascals ( \u00b5Pa). Because sound pressure can vary over a wide range of magnitudes a logarithmic scale is used to convert micro Pascals to decibels. Thus sound pressure level (SPL) is defined by SPL = 10 log 10 [p2/p2 ref] = 20 log 10(p/pref) with the resulting number having the units of decibels (dB). The reference pressure p ref for airborne sound is 20 X 10-6 Pa (i.e., 20\u00b5Pa or 20 micro Pascals). This means that SPL of 0 dB corresponds to a sound wave with amplitude 20 \u00b5Pa. 140 dB is considered the threshold of pain and corresponds to 20,000,000 \u00b5Pa. Doubling the amplitude of the sound wave increases the SPL by 6 dB. Therefore, a 40 \u00b5Pa amplitude sound wave would have an SPL of about 6 dB. When it is stated that there is a large frequency range over which humans can hear, it is also noted that the ear does not hear each frequency similarly. In fact, there is a frequency- dependent threshold of hearing (lower limit) and threshold of pain (higher limit). Experiments have been performed to determine these thresholds. The threshold of hearing curves show that one can hear a tone at 3 kHz (3000 Hz) with an SPL < 0 dB while at 100 Hz one does not hear the tone until its SPL is about 30 dB. Curves showing the thresholds can be easily found in textbooks and online (one online example is at http://www.santafevisions.com/csf/html/lectures/007_ hearing_II.htm ). Experiments have also been conducted to determine equal loudness level contours. These contours indicate when two tones of dissimilar frequencies appear to be equally loud. 004516WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-2 | P a ge S ome characteristics of human response to sound include: Changes in sound level <1 dB cannot be perceived Doubling the magnitude of the acoustic pressure leads to a 6 dB increase in SPL A 5 dB SPL change will result in a noticeable community response A 10 dB SPL change is subjectively heard as an approximate doubling in loudness AD.2 Frequency Bands Most sounds in our environment contain multiple frequencies and are variable in that successive identical experiments cannot result in the exact same plot or tabulation of pressure vs. time. Therefore, it is common to use averages that measure approximately the amplitude of the sound and its frequency content. Common averaging methods rely on the principle of octaves, such as 1/10, 1/3, and single octave bands. This means that the entire frequency range is broken into chunks such that the relation between the starting and ending frequencies of each chunk, f 1 and f2 respectfully, are related by f 2 = 21/Nf1 where N = 1 for a single octave band and 3 for a 1/3 octave band. Because the bands can be constructed based on any starting frequency, a standardized set of bands have been specified. They are usually described by the center frequency of each band. The standard octave-bands are given in Table AD.1 (measured in Hz): 004517WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-3 | P a ge Table AD.1: Octave bands. Values given in Hz. Center Frequency Lower Band limit Upper Band Limit 16 11 22 31.5 22 44 63 44 88 125 88 177 250 177 355 500 355 710 1000 similar set of bands can be written for the 1/3 octaves. For each octave band there are 3-1/3 octave bands. Many text and online resources specify the 1/3 octave bands such as (http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/octave-bands-frequ ency-limits-d_1602.html ). The 1/10 octave band is a narrow-band filter and is used when the sound contains important tones. AD.3 Weightings Noise data are often presented as 1/3 octave band measurements. Again, this means that the sound in each frequency band has been averaged over that frequency range. Noise levels are also often reported as weighted values. The most common weighting is A weighting. It was originally intended to be such that sounds of different frequencies giving the same decibel reading with A weighting would be equally loud. The weighting of the octave band centered at 31.5 Hz requires one to subtract 39.4 dB from the actual SPL. The octave bands with centers from 1000 to 8000 where human hearing is most sensitive are corrected by only about +/- 1 dB. When considered together with the threshold of hearing, it is clear that the A-weighting is most 004518WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-4 | P a ge a pplicable for sounds of small amplitude. C-weighting on the other hand subtracts only a few dB from the very highest and very lowest frequency bands. It is therefore more applicable for higher levels of sound. The figure below shows these two weightings. When weighted, the sound pressure level is reported as dBA or dBC respectively. Figure AD.1: Weighting values for reporting sound pressure levels . Noise levels change several times per day. To account for these differences other environmental noise measures are often used as shown in Table AD1. 004519WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-5 | P a ge Table AD 2: A set of visual examples for these measures can be found at (http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/noise_education/web/ENG_EP D_HTML/m2/types_3.html ) Indicator Meaning Lmax The measured L10, L50, L90 The A-weighted sound level that is exceeded n%, of the time, where n is 10, 50, and 90 respectively.

The average A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day after addition of 10 dB to levels measured in the night between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. AD.4 Sound Power Sound intensity and sound power are also often reported. Sound intensity is a measure of the energy transported per unit area and time in a certain direction. It can be shown that the intensity (I) perpendicular to the direction of sound propagation is related to the amplitude of the pressure wave squared, the density of the air (), and the speed of sound (c), I ~ p2/c. The sound power, P, is the total intensity passing through a surface around a sound source. Intensity has units of Watts per square meter (W/m2) and Power is measured in Watts (W). Both of these quantities are normally reported in dB where the intensity level is calculated as L I = 10 log 10 (|I|/Iref) and the power level is calculated as L W = 10 log 10(P/Pref). The reference intensity level is related to the threshold of hearing at 1000 Hz such that I ref = 10-12 W/m2. The reference power value is P ref = 10-12 W (1 picowatt). Here a doubling of the power leads to a 3 dB increase in the sound power level (PWL). 004520WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-6 | P a ge AD .5 Example Data Analysis This is an example of the type of analysis done on sound measurements from a wind turbine. First, the actual signal might look something like what is shown in Figure AD.2. Figure AD.2: Pressure signal from a wind turbine . ( From(van den Berg, 2011), related to Rheine wind turbine farm). Left in Pascals, right as SPL in dB . In Figure AD.2, just the acoustic pressure is shown, which means that atmospheric p ressure, which is about 103,000 Pa, has been subtracted and the fluctuations then appear around 0 Pa. These data can easily be presented as SPL by transforming the pressure from Pa to dB. In order to analyze the pressure signal for low frequency content, a much longer time signal must be obtained. The frequency content of a long time signal is analyzed by performing a Fourier Transform. A typical transform of data from a wind turbine is shown in Figure AD.3. 0.15 80 0.1 70 cc e,. 60 ~ :::, \"' ici' 50 \"' ~ ~ C. ...J -~ ~ 40 rii :::, 0 \" <( 20 -0.1 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 seconds seconds 004521WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-7 | P a ge Figure AD.3: Frequency content of typical wind turbine measurement.

A D.6 Wind Turbine Noise from Some Turbines What is known about aerodynamically generated noise from wind turbines is that it nominally increases with increasing wind speed until the max power is obtained, and it increases with increasing rotor tip speed. A report out of the Netherlands by (van den Berg et al., 2008) reports a vast amount of noise data related to wind turbines. The tables in Appendices B and C from the report clearly show these trends. Some of the data are reproduced here. Only measurements that were made by third parties (not specified by the wind turbine company) are reproduced here. ~ 30 ::S. 251----,C-~-,.-4~+--'-;_;_....;--;-'-:- +--;_~ ...J Cl..

The sound level measured at a single position at the base of the turbine can easily be 50 dB lower (Lawrence rep.). AD.7 Definition of Infrasound Discussion of the aerodynamic source of sound known as thickness noise or self-noise requires one to define low frequency sound and infrasound. By definition, infrasound is a pressure wave that is not audible. Nominally this means waves with frequency less than 20 Hz. It is noted though that waves with high enough amplitude below 20 Hz may still be audible. Low frequency sound is characterized as having a frequency between 20 and 200 Hz. As mentioned earlier, some mechanical noise sources contribute to the low frequency range, and clearly some of the aerodynamic sources of broadband sound will contribute to noise in the low frequency range. Thickness noise, if present, would have an associated frequency equal to the 004524WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AD-10 | P a ge b lade passing frequency. Hence, a turbine with 3-bladed rotor turning at 20 rpm might generate thickness noise at a frequency of 1 Hz, which is clearly in the infrasonic range. Downwind rotors produce slightly stronger infrasound at the blade passing frequency because the blades interact directly with the wake behind the tower. The levels of the thickness noise generated by modern upwind turbines are not perceptible by the human auditory system. Any impulsive noise that is audible, which seems to have a frequency equivalent to the blade passing frequency, is actually the broadband noise generated by the other mechanisms being modified by differences in the flow that occur on a once-per-rev basis as discussed above. The frequencies of this pulsating sound are all in the audible range, and thus this sound is not infrasound. 004525WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AE-1 | P a ge A ppendix E Wind Turbine - Sound Power Level Estimates and Noise Propagation AE.1 Approximate Wind Turbine Sound Power Level Prediction Models The following are some approximate equations that are sometimes used to estimate the A-weighted sound power level, LWA, from a typical wind turbine. The first equation gives the estimate in terms of the rated power of the turbine, PWT (W). The second gives the estimate in terms of the diameter, D (m). The third gives it in terms of both the tip speed, VTip (m/s), and diameter. These equations should only be used when test data is not available. 50 ) log ( 1010+ =WT WA P L (38) 72 log ( 2210+ = D LWA (39) 4 ) (log 10 ) log ( 5010 10 + = D V LTip WA (40) AE.2 Sound Power Levels due to Multiple Wind Turbines When multiple wind turbines are located close to each other, the total sound power can be estimated by applying logarithmic relations. For example, for two turbines with sound power levels L W 1 and LW2, the total sound power is: ) ( L/ L / L total10 10 102 110 10 log 10+ = (41) For N turbines, the corresponding relation is: ==N i/ L totaliL 110 1010 log 10 (42) where Lwi is the sound power level of the ith turbine. For turbines that are some distance away from each other the mathematics is more complicated, and the relations of interest (actually the sound pressure level) take into account the relative position of the turbines and the location of the observer as described below. 004526WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AE-2 | P a ge A E.3 Noise Propagation from Wind Turbines The sound pressure level will decrease with distance from a turbine. For estimation purposes, a simple model based on hemispherical noise propagation over a reflective surface, including air absorption, is given as: R )R ( L LW p =2 102 log 10 (43) where Lp is the sound pressure level (dB) a distance R from a noise source radiating at a power level LW (dB) and is the frequency-dependent sound absorption coefficient. For broadband estimates the absorption coefficient is often approximated by a constant value of 0.005 dB(A)/m. Figure AE.1 (from Materialien 63) indicates the sound pressure level as a function of distance from a single wind turbine with a sound power level of 103 dB(A). Figure AE.1: Typical sound pressure level vs. distance from a single wind turbine (From Materialien 63) 004527WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AE-3 | P a ge T he results are summarized in Table AE-1. Table AE-1 Sound pressure level vs. distance Sound Pressure, dB(A) Distance, m 45 280 40 410 35 620 It may be seen that Equation 43, using the broadband absorption coefficient, predicts results close to those in the table (270 m, 435 m, and 675 m respectively). AE.4 Noise Propagation from Multiple Wind Turbines The sound perceived at a distance from multiple wind turbines is a function of the sound power level from each wind turbine and the distance to that turbine. The perceived value can be approximated by the following equation: ( ) = = N i iR L pRLi i W 1210 / 10 / 10210log 10, (44) Where Ri is the distance to the ith turbine. Figure AE-2 illustrates the sound pressure level at various distances and directions from a line of seven wind turbines, each of which is operating at a sound power level of 103 dB(A). 004528WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AE-4 | P a ge Figure AE.2: Sound pressure level due to a line of seven wind turbines, each operating at a sound p ower level of 103 dB(A) (from Materialien 63 + LwA = 103 dB + 103 + 103 dB + ~VA= 103 dB + 004529WIND TURBINE HEALTH IMPACT STUDY AE-5 | P a ge T he results are summarized in the Table AE-2.

This is particularly the case at higher wind speeds. This appendix illustrates the difference, based on one source. AF.1 Typical Noise from Pitch Regulated Wind Turbine The figure below illustrates sound pressure level as a function of wind speed from a pitch regulated wind turbine (The data was taken at an unspecified distance from the turbine). As can be seen, the noise level increases with wind speed up to a certain wind speed, here 9 m/s. After that wind speed is reached the blade pitch regulates the power and the noise level remains constant.

Essentially everything about it is unique and specialized techniques need to be employed in order to rationally assess potential impacts from proposed projects a nd to accurately measure the sound emissions from newly operational projects. Existing ISO 1,2, and ANSI3,4 standards that are perfectly appropriate for evaluating and measuring noise from conventional power gene ration and industrial f acilities were not written with wind turbines in mind and co ntain certain provisions that make them unsuitable for application to wind turbines. For example, most test standards, quite sensibly, allow valid measurements only unde r low wind or calm conditions in order to preclude, or at l east minimize, wind-induced directional effects, am ong other things. At a conventional power plant, which may operate around the clock, this requirement simply implies a wait for appropriate weather condit ions. At a wind turbine project, however, there is nothing to measure during calm wind conditions, since the project is normally idle. Significant noise generation largel y occurs during wind conditions that are generally above the permissible limit. At the present time, a lone standard, IEC 61400- 115 exists for evaluating wind turbine sound levels, but only for the specific purpose of measuring the sound power level of a single unit. Sound power level is an arcane, intangible, derived quantity that is used as an input to analytical noise models and has little relevance to the sound level a wind farm is producing at someone's home. Consequently, this highly specialized test ca nnot be used or even adapted to serve as a way of determining whether a new multi-unit project is in compliance with a noise ordinance, for instance. What all this suggests is that the standards and methodologies that exist for assessing and measuring noise from conventional industrial noise sources cannot be applied wholesale to wind turbine noise and completely diffe rent assessment and field measurement methodologies are required that are tailor ed to, and take into account, the unique circumstances and technical challenges su rrounding their noise emissions. These guidelines seek to address this situation by describi ng suggested assessment and measurement techniques that have been de veloped over the past decade through field experience on roughly 70 wind projects, primarily in the Midwest and Eastern United States, nearly all of which were located in rural, yet moderately populated areas. Without question many mistakes were made in the early going into this unch arted field of study and many na\u00efve assumptions about wind turbine noi se were found to be incorrect. It is hoped that what was learned from this experience and what is summarized in these guidelines can help others circ umvent this learning curve. After a brief discussion on the nature of wind turbine noise, the following principal topics are discussed: 1 004564 Suggested design goals for new projects Evaluating potential noise impacts fr om proposed projects through noise modeling and field surveys of existing conditions Measuring the noise emissions from opera tional projects to determine compliance with design goals or regulatory limits 1.1 Executive Summary Wind turbine noise differs fundamentally from the noise produced by other power generation and industrial sour ces in how it is produced, ho w it propagates and how it is perceived by neighbors. Because existing sound measurement standards were never written with wind turbines in mind they are largely unsuitable for use in wind turbine analyses, if only because measurements both prior to and after construction essentially must be performed in the windy conditions necessary for the project to operate - conditions that are prohibited by virtually all current test standards. Consequently, new and unique evaluation and measur ement techniques must be used that are adapted to the special circumstances germane to wind turbines . These guidelines are intended to help remedy this situation by suggesting desi gn goals for proposed project, outlining a methodology for evaluating potential impacts fr om new projects and describing how to accurately measure the noise emissions from operating projects. Studies and field surveys of the reaction to operating wind projects both in Europe and the United States generally suggest that the threshold between what it is normally regarded as acceptable noise from a project and what is unacceptable to some is a project sound level that falls in a gray area ranging from about 35 to 45 dBA. Below that range the project is so quiet in absolute terms that almost no advers e reaction is usually observed and when the mean project sound level exceeds 45 dBA a certain number of complaints are almost inevitable. In view of this, it would be easy to avoid any negative impact by simply limiting the sound level from a proposed wind project to 35 dBA at all residences, but the reality is that such a stringent noise limit cannot normally be met even in sparsely populated areas and it would have the effect of preventing noise impacts by making it virtually impossible to permit and bu ild most projects. In fairness then, any noise limit on a new project must try to strike a balance th at reasonably protects the public from exposure to a legitimate noise nui sance while not completely standing in the way of economic development a nd project viability. It is important to realize that regulatory limits for other power generation a nd industrial facilities never seek or demand inaudibility but rather they endeavor to limit noise from the source to a reasonably acceptable level in terms of either an absolute limit or an allowable increase relative to the background level. Based on the observed reaction to typical projec ts in United States, it would be advisable for any new project to attempt to maintain a mean sound level of 40 dBA or less outside all residences as an ideal design goal. Where this is not possible, and even that level is frequently difficult to achieve even in sparse ly populated areas, a mean sound level of up to 45 dBA might be considered acceptable as long as the number of homes within the 40 to 45 dBA range is relatively small. Under no circumstances, however, should turbines 2 004565 be located in places where mean levels higher than 45 dBA are predicted by pre- construction modeling at residences. It is im portant to note that a project sound level of 40 dBA does not mean that the project would be inaudible or completely insignificant, only that its noise would generally be low enough that it would probably not be considered objectionable by the vast majority of neighbors. Noise impact assessments for proposed projects can be absolute or relative in nature. In an absolute analysis the sound level contours from the pr oject are plotted over a map of the turbine layout and the surrounding pote ntially sensitive receptors, normally permanent residences, and the sound levels are evaluated re lative to the 40 and 45 dBA criteria discussed above. A relative assessment involves, as a first step, a field survey of the existing soundscape at the si te followed by a noise modeli ng analysis. The potential impact of the project is evaluated in te rms of the differential between the existing background sound level and the calculated proj ect-only sound level, importantly, under identical wind conditions. As a general rule of thumb, an increase of up to 5 dBA above the pre-existing L A90 sound level is usually found to be acceptable whereas greater increases should be avoided. This design approach only holds for background levels of about 35 dBA or above. When lower backgr ound sound levels are found a design goal of 40 dBA or less at all residences should be sought. Commercially available software packages based on ISO 9613-2 are suggested for noise modeling analyses. Recomme nded modeling procedures woul d consist of the following steps. Begin with a base map showing the turbin e locations and all potentially sensitive receptors in and around the project area (residences, schools, churches, etc.) Build up the topography of the site in th e noise model if the terrain features consist of hills and valleys with a total elevation difference of more than about 100 ft. - otherwise flat terrain can be assumed Locate point sources at the hub height of each turbine (typically 80 m) Use the maximum octave band sound power level spectrum, measured per IEC 61400-11, for the planned turbine model or the loudest model of those being considered Assume a ground absorption coefficient (A g from ISO 9613-2) appropriate to the site area (a moderate value of 0.5 generally works well as an annual average for rural farmland) Assume ISO \"standard day\" temperature a nd relative humidity values of 10 deg. C/70% RH unless the prevai ling conditions at the site are substantially and consistently different than that Plot the sound contours from the project assuming an omni-directional wind out to a level of 35 dBA Evaluate the potential impact of the project at residences relati ve to the suggested 40 and 45 dBA thresholds A relative impact analysis is recommended whenever unusually high or low background levels are suspected at a site, the project is la rge or controversial, or when there is simply 3 004566 a desire to carry out a thorough analysis. The baseline field survey of existing environmental sound levels should: Use 6 to 14 measurement positions depending on the complexity of the site Select positions at residences (to the extent possible) th at are representative of all the distinct settings that may be present within the site area, such as sheltered valleys, exposed hilltops, wooded areas, near major roadways, remote and secluded, etc. Monitor in continuous 10 minute intervals for a period of at least 14 days to capture a wide variety of wind and weather conditions Record a number of statistical paramete rs, giving precedence to the relatively conservative L A90 measure Use Type 1 or 2 integrating sound level me ters fitted with oversize (7\" diameter, or greater) windscreens Mount the microphones approximately 1 m a bove ground level, where feasible, to minimize self-induced wind noise Use one or more temporary weather st ations at the most open and exposed measurement positions to record wind speed at microphone height and other parameters, such as rainfall. Apply a correction, if necessary, to the A-weighted sound levels for wind- induced, self-noise based on the micr ophone height anemometer readings Evaluate the L A90 results for consistency over the various measurement positions, segregating the results for different sett ings if there are clear and consistent differences Normalize the wind speed measured by the highest anemometers on all on-site met towers to a standard height of 10 m per Eqn. (7) of IEC 61400-11 Correlate the design site-wide or individual setting background levels to the normalized wind speed to determine the mean value as a function of wind velocity Use the 6 m/s result as the critical de sign wind speed or determine the site- specific critical wind speed from a comp arison between the tu rbine sound power and background levels Use the mean L A90 background level at the critical wind speed as a baseline for evaluating the modeled sound emissions of the project under those same conditions The accurate measurement of noise from an operational project requires a determination of the concurrent background sound level pres ent at the time each sample of operational noise is measured so that the wind and atmospheric conditions are consistent. Background levels measured at a different ti me and under inevitably different conditions are not suitable for use in corre cting operational sound measurements. The objective of an operational survey is to quantify the project-only sound level exclusive of background noise, which can easily be comparable to the project level at typical set back distances. Ignoring this background component will normally result in an overestimate of the proj ect's actual sound levels. 4 004567 A methodology is outlined in these guidelines for estimating the simultaneous background sound level by monitoring at a number of positions outside of the site area in locations and settings that are similar in nature to the on-site positions but remote from all turbine noise. In general, an operational surv ey to determine the sound emissions exclusively due to the project should: Use 6 to 10 on-site measurement positions depending on the complexity of the site and focused on the residences w ith maximum exposure to turbine noise (irrespective of their part icipation in the project) Set up 3 to 4 off-site background measurement positions at positions at least 1.5 miles from the project perimeter in diametrically opposed directions. These positions should be similar in setting and character to the on-site positions but removed from any exposure to project noise Monitor in continuous 10 minute intervals for a period of at least 14 days to capture a wide variety of wind and weather conditions Record a number of statistical pa rameters, giving precedence to the L A90 measure Use Type 1 or 2 integrating sound level me ters fitted with oversize (7\" diameter, or greater) windscreens Mount the microphones approximately 1 m a bove ground level, where feasible, to minimize self-induced wind noise Use one or more temporary weather st ations at the most open and exposed measurement positions to record wind speed at microphone height and other parameters, such as rainfall. Apply a correction, if necessary, to the A-weighted sound levels for wind- induced, self-noise based on the micr ophone height anemometer readings Evaluate the off-site L A90 results for consistency over the various measurement positions, segregating the results for diffe rent settings if there are clear and consistent differences. Develop one or mo re design background levels to be used to correct the on-site levels. Subtract the appropriate design background le vel from the total measured level at each on-site receptor to derive the proj ect-only sound level at each receptor position Normalize the wind speed measured by the highest anemometers on all on-site met towers to a standard height of 10 m per Eqn. (7) of IEC 61400-11 Plot the derived project-only sound levels as a function of time or wind speed. Exclude all data points measured during ca lm conditions when the project was not operating Exclude all data points that appear to be associated with local contaminating noises; i.e. noise spikes , usually occurring at only one position, that are not accompanied by a simultaneous spike in wind speed Evaluate the final results with respect to the applicable design goal or ordinance limit. If the measured levels are lower than the design target at least 95% of the time the project can be considered in compliance. 5 004568 2.0 Characteristics of Wind Turbine Noise The magnitude and nature of wind turbine no ise is entirely dependent on time-varying wind and atmospheric conditions, whereas a conventional fossil-fueled power station operates, often continuously and steadily, in a manner that is completely independent of the local environment. Conse quently, a combustion turbine plant, for example, is most apt to be perceptible and a potential noise problem dur ing calm and still weather conditions while a wind turbine project w ould, under most normal circumstances, not make any noise at all under those same c onditions. During moderately windy conditions increased background noise would tend to diminish the perceptibility of the fossil fueled plant while the wind project would generally be at its loudest relative to the background level. At very high wind speeds background no ise often becomes dominant to the extent it can obscure both sources. In addition to simply being dependent on prevailing wind and atmospheric conditions, wind turbine noise usually has a distinctive, id entifiable character to it that makes it more readily perceptible than other industrial sources of comparable magnitude 6, ,78. The fundamental noise generation mechanism, the turbulent interaction of airflow over the moving blades, is dependent on the characteris tics of the air mass flowing into the rotor plane. For example, when the airflow is fa irly constant and steady in velocity over the swept area noise is generally at a minimum. While such ideal, laminar flow conditions may exist much of the time, particularly duri ng the day, they do not occur all of the time, and the reality is that the wind often blows in the form of intermittent gusts separated by short periods of relative calm rather than as a smooth continuous stream of constant velocity. In addition, the flow may contain turbulent eddies, may be unstable in direction and the mean velocity may vary considerably over the vertical diameter of the rotor, which is typically in the 77 to 112 m (250 to 370 ft.) range on the utility scale turbines now in common use. These uneven and unstabl e airflow conditions generally cause more noise to be generated - and it is generated sporadically as each gust sweep s past and as the wind varies amorphously in speed or dir ection over the rotor plane. Such unstable conditions can lead to sound levels that change very noticeably in the short-term not only in general volume but also in character. Qualitatively, under average circumstances rotor noise, as perceived at a common set back distance of around 400 m (1200 ft.), mi ght be described as a churning, mildly periodic sound due to blade sw ish, particularly when there are several units at comparable distances from the point of observation. The normally non-synchronized and incoherent sounds from multiple units tend to blur the sound and minimize the perception of swish, although it is most commonly weak during \" normal\" circumstances even if only one unit is present. Another common description is that the noise is reminiscent of a plane flying over at fairly high altitude. This apt comp arison is probably partly due to the basic similarity in frequency cont ent of the two sounds but also to the phenomenon where the sound can fade in and out randomly. In the case of an actual plane it is the intervening non-homogeneous atmosphere that alternately enhances or hinders sound propagation from the distant source producing this effect wh ile, in the case of th e wind turbine, it is 6 004569 more likely to be short-term variations in noise generation at th e source itself, or a combination of both source and path effects. A pure path effect that occasionally occurs is the enhanced propagation of turbine noise due to thermal layering, known as a stable atmo sphere, where the air is warmer above the surface than at the surface cau sing sound rays to diffract downward and making a distant sound louder than it would otherwise be. At night, this phenomenon, most likely in combination with the wind speed gradient, is most likely to lead to an increase in periodic noise (generally referred to as amplitude modulation, or AM)9,10. The exact mechanism behind this noise, particularly when it b ecomes unusually pronounced, is not entirely understood, but, in simple terms, it is thought to be caused when the wind speed at the top of the rotor is significantly higher than the wind speed at the bottom; i.e. when the vertical wind speed gradient is more slanted and less vertical, as is usually the case at night. Having said that, however, this phenome non is not always present or particularly pronounced at all sites, but when of sufficient magnitude , the fairly pronounced swishing or thumping sound that can result on certain evenings can and does give rise to quite legitimate complaints. In fact, this is proba bly the primary cause of serious complaints about wind project noise. In general, the occurrence of this phenomenon in its pronounced or enhanced form is rather rare making deta iled measurements difficult 11 but a major effort(ibid) is currently underway in the United Kingdom s eeking to quantify and further understand this noise. 2.1 Low Frequency Noise and C-weighted Sound Levels When the swishing, thumping or beating noise alluded to above does occurs it is usually at a rate of about once per second, or 1 Hz, which is the blade passing frequency of a typical three-bladed ro tor turning at 20 rpm. Although th e \"frequency\" of its occurrence at 1 Hz obviously falls at the very low end of the frequency spectrum, this noise is not \"low frequency\" or infrasonic noise, per se. It is simply a periodic noise where the actual frequency spectrum may contain some slightly elevated levels in the lower frequencies but where the most prominent noise is roughly centered around 500 Hz near the middle of the audible frequency spectrum. In genera l, the widespread belief that wind turbines produce elevated or even harmful levels of low frequency and infrasonic sound is utterly untrue as proven repeatedly and inde pendently by numerous investigators12, , , ,13141516 and probably arose from a confusion between this periodic amplitude modulation noise and actual low frequency noise. Problematic le vels of low frequency noise (i.e. those resulting in perceptible vibrations and complaints) are mo st commonly associated with simple cycle gas turbines, which produce trem endous energy in the 20 to 50 Hz region of the spectrum - vastly more than could ever be produced by a wind turbine. The mistaken belief that wind turbines produ ce high levels of low frequency noise can also be attributed, perhaps even more de finitively, to wind-i nduced microphone error where wind blowing through virtually any wi ndscreen will cause the low end, and only the low end, of the frequency spectrum to su bstantially increase due to self-generated distortion. The magnitude and frequenc y response of this error has been theoretically/mathematically quantified by van den Berg 10 and empirically by Hessler17 7 004570 by subjecting a variety of commonly used windscreens to known air speeds in a massively silenced wind tunnel - thereby di rectly measuring the frequency response to air flow alone (the specific results of this study and its applications are discussed further in Section 5.1). The results of this wind tunnel experiment were used to evaluate measurements of actual wind tu rbine noise at a site in Southern Minnesota by Hessler in 200818. Figure 2.1.1 below shows, as an exampl e, the frequency spectra measured under fairly windy conditions in a rural soybean fi eld 1000 ft. from an isolated unit and, at the same time, in an identical soybean fiel d 3 miles away from any turbines.

(Empirical Flow-Induced Noise) Figure 2.1.1 The two measurements show the same values in the lowest frequency bands. Since there is clearly no source of low frequency noise present in the bac kground measurement, the low frequency levels - in both measurements - simply represent self-generated distortion and are not the actual sound emissions of anythi ng. This can be conf irmed from the wind tunnel study where the measured frequency sp ectrum for this particular windscreen (7\" diameter) subjected to a 6.1 m/s wi nd is also plotted in Figure 2.1.1 a. What all this shows is that virtually any measurement taken under moderately windy conditions will be severely affected by false-si gnal noise in the lower frequencies, even a It should be noted that the wind tunnel results quantify the minimum amount of false-signal noise measured under more or less laminar flow conditions in the absence of possible further distortion from turbulence and atmospheric conditions. 8 0-0 0-0 004571 when a large windscreen is used as in the example above. The measurement will appear to show high levels of low frequency noise - whet her a wind turbine is pr esent or not. Figure 2.1.1 also illustrates an other important point concerning C-weighted sound levels; namely, that the C-weighted levels at 1000 ft. and 3 miles are somewhat similar at 67 and 62 dBC, respectively. The si gnificance of this is that C-weighted sound levels, as opposed to the much more common A-weighted metric, are normally used for the specific purpose of quantifying, investigating or placing a limit on noise sources that are rich in low frequency noise. The reason for this is that C-weighting does not mathematically suppress the low frequenc ies the way A-weighting does making it highly sensitive to and usually dominated by the low frequency content of a sound. Figure 2.1.2 shows this graphically for the example measurement at 1000 ft. from a wind turbine. Typical Sound Level Spectrum 1000 ft. from a Turbine (Neglecting Microphone Distortion) As-Measured vs. A and C-weighted Levels 01020304050607080 6.3 8 10 12.5 16 20 25 31.5 40 50 63 80 100 125 160 200 250 315 400 500 630 800 1000 1250 1600 2000 Level, dBAs-Measured, Un-w eighted Sound Level C-weighted Sound Level Spectrum A-weighted Sound Level Spectrum - As Perceived by the Ear48 dBA67 dBC Figure 2.1.2 The as-measured sound level, warts and all, without any weighting applied is the blue trace. C-weighting reduces the low end of the frequency spectrum by a moderate amount whereas A-weighting reduces it substantiall y. There is no tang ible or physiological rationale behind C-weighting bu t A-weighting serves the very useful purpose of adjusting the frequency spectrum of the sound so that it matches the way it is subjectively perceived by the human ear, which is relativ ely insensitive to low frequency sounds. Figure 2.1.2 shows that what is actually heard at 1000 ft. from this turbine is mid- frequency sound from roughly 100 to 2500 Hz - a nd even if the artificially elevated low frequency levels were actually attributable to the turbine nothing would still be audible in 9 004572 the low frequencies (recall that this measur ement is unadjusted for low frequency false- signal noise). The ultimate point of this discussion is that C-weighted sound leve ls cannot be measured in any kind of meaningful way in the windy c onditions associated with turbine operation, since they essentially quantify the level of low frequency microphone distortion rather than any actual noise. As another example, the plot below shows th e C-weighted sound leve ls measured over a two week period at a residence surrounded by several wind turbines and simultaneously by a monitor located miles away from the project area in a similar setting (rural Midwestern farm country). As-Measured LCeq Sound Level at Position 2 Compared to Average Background Level and Concurrent Wind Speed 0102030405060708090100 4/5/11 12:00 4/6/11 0:00 4/6/11 0:00 0:00 Date and TimeSound Pressure Level, dBC 02468101214161820 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/sOff-Site Background Level, dBCOn-Site Level, dBC Wind Speed Figure 2.1.3 In essence, the levels are largely the same at both places and are more a measurement of the prevailing wind speed and its effect on th e microphone rather than any real source of low frequency noise. Consequently, despite their occasional appearan ce in local ordinances as an intended way of limiting the low frequency noise emissions from wind projects, by either an absolute limit or a dBA-dBC differential, C-weighted sound levels have no pr actical place in the measurement of wind turbine sound. 10 004573 3.0 Recommended Design Goals It would be a trivial soluti on to set an extremely low sound level of, say, 30 dBA as a permissible sound level for a new wind project at potentially sensitive receptors or to impose massive set back distances to any re sidences. While such restrictions would probably ensure that there was no adverse impact whatsoever from the project, the effective inaudibility of proj ect noise would be due more to the fact it was never built than to its low sound emissions. Realizing virt ual inaudibility or maintaining set backs of several thousand feet from all residences is ge nerally an impracticality at all but the most remote sites. In fairness then, any noise limit on a new project mu st try to strike a balance that reasonably protec ts the public from exposure to a legitimate noise nuisance while not completely standing in the way of economic development a nd project viability. It is important to realize th at regulatory limits for other power generation and industrial facilities never seek or demand inaudibility bu t rather they endeavor to limit noise from the source to a reasonably acceptable level eith er in terms of an absolute limit (commonly 45 dBA at night) or a relative increase over the pre-existi ng environmental sound level (typically 5 dBA19). Research, principally by Pedersen 20,21 and Persson-Waye22, on what the reaction is to wind turbine sound levels and what levels might be considered acceptable has been on-going for some time now in Europe. These studies analyze the responses to blind questionnaires distributed to residents liv ing near wind farms in Sweden and The Netherlands in an effort to correlate the level of annoyance with noise and other factors with the calculated project sound level at each residence. In general, the results suggest among many other important findings that a project sound level in the 40 to 45 dBA range can lead to relatively high annoyance rates of around 20 to 25% (ibid); however, it important to understand that these numbers refe r to the percentage of those with exposure to such sound levels and not th e entire population in the vicin ity of the projects. Viewed within the context of the to tal survey population the rate of advers e reaction comes down to a handful of individuals or very roughly about 4 to 6% when residences are exposed to project sound levels in the 40 to 45 dBA range. A somewhat similar rate of complaints/annoyan ce expressed as a percentage of the total population living within 2000 ft. of a turbine was found by Hessler23 during compliance sound testing at a number of typical, newl y operational wind proj ects in the United States. In each survey the total number of residents where complaints or even mild concerns about noise had been called in was obtained from project operations and the actual sound levels at all of these loca tions were measured over 2 to 3 week periods. The fundamental results are summarized in the following table. 11 004574 Table 3.0.1 Number of Observed Complain ts Relative to the Total Number of Households in Clo se Proximity to Turbines [Hessler, 23] Number of Complaints as a Function of Project Sound Level (dBA) (a) Project Total Households in the Site Area (Approx.) < 40 40 - 44 45 or Higher Total Number of Complaints Percentage Relative to Total Households Site A 107 0 2 1 3 3% Site B 147 0 3 3 6 4% Site C 151 0 3 0 3 2% Site D 268 0 2 4 6 2% Site E 91 1 1 4 6 7% Overall Average: 4% (a) Sound levels expressed as long-term, mean values Although the purpose of these surveys was to confirm compliance w ith regulatory noise and not specifically to evaluate community reaction, the findings, taken together with the European research mentioned above, suggest that the vast majority of residents living within or close to a wind farm have no substantial objections to project noise, particularly if the mean sound level is below 40 dBA. It is important to add that all of the sites investigated in these studies were just as prone as any other site to all the adverse character issues mentioned above, such as amplitude modulation, stable atmospheric conditions, highly variable sound levels and higher nighttim e noise levels. While the possibility of annoyance, if not serious distur bance, can almost neve r be completely ruled out, it appears that the total number of complaints would be fairly small as long as the mean project level does not exceed 40 dBA. Above that point, specifically in the 40 to 45 dBA range, complaints can be expected with some certainty but, as indicated in Table 3.0.1, still at a fairly low rate of about 2% relative to the total populat ion in close proximity to the project. Consequently, it would be advisable for any new project to attempt to maintain a mean sound level of 40 dBA or less outs ide all residences as an ideal design goal. Where this is not possible, and it frequently is difficult to achieve even in sparsely populated areas, sound levels of up to 45 dBA might be considered acceptable as long as the number of homes within the 40 to 45 dBA range is relatively small. Under no circumstances, however, should turbines be loca ted in places where mean le vels higher than 45 dBA are predicted by pre-construction modeling at re sidences. A project sound level of 40 dBA does not mean that the project would be inaudible or complete ly insignificant, only that its noise would generally be low enough that it would pr obably not be considered objectionable by the vast majority of nei ghbors based on the actual reaction to other projects. It is important to note that the sound leve ls in Table 3.0.1 and the suggested sound level targets discussed above are mean, long-term values and not instantaneous maxima. Wind turbine sound levels naturally vary above and below their mean or average value due to wind and atmospheric conditions and can signifi cantly exceed the mean value at times. Extensive field experience measuring operatio nal projects indicates that sound levels commonly fluctuate by roughly +/- 5 dBA about the mean trend line and that short-lived (10 to 20 minute) spikes on the order of 15 to 20 dBA above the mean are occasionally 12 004575 observed when atmospheric conditions strong ly favor the generati on and propagation of noise. Because no project can be designed so that all such spikes would remain below the 40 or 45 dBA targets at all times, thes e values are expressed as long-term mean levels, or the central trend through data co llected over a period of several weeks. 4.0 Noise Impact Assessments 4.1 Noise Modeling The principal mechanism for evaluating the po tential impact of a proposed wind project is to analytically model its noise emissi ons. A sound level contour map showing the expected sound emissions from the project rela tive to all the residences in the area is essentially a graphic illustration of the potenti al impact. It follows from the preceding discussion of ideal design goals that predicte d levels below 40 dBA at residences can be associated with a relatively low adverse imp act, while higher levels, particularly those higher then 45 dBA, suggest a relatively high probability of serious complaints. Because there are few options to reduce noise from a project once it becomes operational, any necessary noise abatement must essentially be designed into th e project while it is still in the planning stage. Computer modeling allows the potential noise impact to be visualized but, importantly, also allows mitigation options to be explored, since the effects of relocating or removi ng individual turbines or using alternate turbine models can be easily evaluated. Such optimization studies are best performed early in the development process while ther e is still some flexibility to move things around. This process can be repeated iteratively as the design develops and lease and easement agreements evolve to help keep community noise levels as low as possible within the context, of course, of many other constraints. 4.1.1 Acceptable Sound Propagation Standards Wind turbine noise is actually rather simple to model because the proj ect consists of more or less ideal point sources located high in the air. Consequently, the dominant sound propagation factor is simply spherical wave spreading with distance, which is an axiomatic law of physics that is built into ev ery modeling software package. All other effects, such as ground or air absorption, are minor subtleties by comparison so great sophistication in modeling software is not required. In fact, all that is really necessary is to calculate sound propagation from the project using ISO 9613-2 Acoustics - Attenuation of sound during propagation out doors. Part 2: General method of calculation (1996) 24, which is, by far, the prevailing and most widely accepted worldwide standard for such calculations and the basi s for essentially every commercial noise modeling program. Like the other test standards alluded to in the introduction, ISO 9613-2 was not written with wind turbines in mind and its applicabil ity to elevated sources (usually 80 m) and long propagation distances is occasionally questioned. Table 5 in the standard gives the 13 004576 estimated accuracy of the method for noise sources up to 30 m high and for propagation distances up to 1000 m. This 30 m height fi gure is sometimes interpreted to mean that the standard cannot be used for 80 m high sources , but it is just that no specific accuracy estimate is given for such cases, not that th e standard is inappropr iate. As mentioned earlier, the principal sound pr opagation loss in wind tu rbine modeling is simple geometric spreading of the sound wave, which is a phenomenon that has no dependence on the specific point of origin or its height above ground level. Source height is a factor, however, in the re latively minor ground absorption loss (i.e. the tendency of the ground surface to variously absorb or reflect sound waves) but measurements of actual wind turbine sound le vels vs. predictions show reasonably good agreement indicating that th e calculation of the ground abso rption loss and, indeed, the entire methodology, is perfectly valid for wind turbines. Having said that, it should be noted that ISO 9613-2 does not consider atmospheric conditions, such as the wind a nd temperature gradients, stability, turbulence, etc., and was always intended to portray very long-te rm or average propagation conditions under slightly conservative downwind conditions. Consequently, the model results using this standard need to be interpreted as the e xpected sound level under \"average\" conditions, meaning that the actual sound le vel will be close to the pred iction much of the time but higher and lower levels will occur with about equal regularity due to fluctuating atmospheric conditions, which affect both the generation and propagation of wind turbine noise. The plot below show s a typical comparison between the measured project-only sound levels over a two week period compared to predictions at various wind speeds. The model predictions tend to agree with the central trend line. The scatter evident in this chart is normal and inevitable and reflects the natural variability of wind turbine sound levels as observed at a distant point. 14 004577 Regression Analysis of Measured Project-Only Sound Level vs. Normalized Wind Speed Location Surrounded by 11 GE 1.5sle Turbines at Various Distances y = -0.1481x3 + 2.012x2 - 5.4756x + 35.702 R2 = 0.4643 05101520253035404550556065 2345678 Wind Speed at 10 m above Ground Level, m/sL90(10 min) Sound Pressure Level, dBA Model Prediction at Key Wind Speeds Turbine Not Operating Below 2.5 m/s Figure 4.0.1 It should be pointed out that there is an alternative prediction methodology to ISO 9613-2 that takes atmospheric conditions into account: NORD200025, which is a proprietary software package that has been in devel opment in Denmark for quite some time. However, it is rather complicated and is not in wide use partially because it has not been integrated or fully integrated into the mo st commonly used mode ling programs. This sound emissions model is based on the funda mental mathematics of wave propagation rather than the empirical studies that form the basis for most of the propaga tion losses in ISO 9613-2, but despite its sophistication it do es not seem to yield substantially better results than ISO 9613-226. As exemplified by Figure 4.0.1, there is no reason why the more common and simpler ISO 9613- 2 methodology should not be used. 4.1.2 Modeling Software In theory, then, any program based on ISO 9613- 2 can ostensibly be used to model wind turbines but there is more to it than the calcul ation of sound propagation losses. What emerges as the key differentiation between prog rams is basically how well and easily the site plan can be imported into the program and the quality and nature of the program's output. Typical wind projects consist of dozens of units either spread out over many square miles in flat or rolling country or strung out along ridgelines. At the first type of site the turbines are frequently mixed in with potentia lly sensitive receptors (typically permanent residences) that can easily number into the hund reds. With ridgeline projects the nearest receptors are usually all around the base of the mountain or promontory on which the 15 J\u00b7 004578 turbines are proposed and the e ffective project area (i.e. the region where residences exist within possible earshot of the project) can be vast. Consequently, it is best, if not essential, to use a modeling pr ogram that allows for the reasonably easy importation and scaling of a site map that shows not only the turbine locations but also all of the surrounding potentially sensitive receptors. Su ch a map is normally in shapefile (.shp) format with a layer for the turbines, a layer for structures (unfortunately not often differentiated into houses, barns, garages, co mmercial buildings, etc.) and layers for other features such as roads or topography. While nominally possible, it is not normally desirable to use only numerical tables of turb ine coordinates to create the model for the principal reasons that a separate base map needs to be found and imported and different coordinate systems can become confused. In addition, publically avai lable maps (used as a base map for the model) almost never sh ow, or at least accurately show, all the residences in the vicinity of the project. In addition to the turbines and houses the topography of the site often needs to be considered in the model - not only because of the line sight between the turbines and houses may be partially blocked or obstructed, but more generally because the source- receptor distance at sites with fairly dramatic terrain is affected and usually lengthened when modeled in three-dimensions. Conse quently, a program that has the ability to import terrain contours and then mathemat ically consider their effect on sound propagation is essential for any project in a hi lly or mountainous setti ng. This factor can only be safely ignored for sites with fa irly flat or gently rolling topography. In terms of output the most important element is the ability of the program to map sound contours in high resolution over the input base map. The potential impact from any wind project is normally grap hically evaluated from contour plot s. It is the number of houses within a certain threshold or sound level that usually determ ines whether the project is likely to result in complaints or not or whethe r it will comply with re gulatory noise limits. In terms of specific programs, Cadna/A \u00ae developed by Datakustik GmbH (Munich, Germany), appears to be used most often by engineers and consultants and is fully capable of importing shapef iles, modeling complex terr ain and producing detailed contour maps. The second most common noise prediction prog ram is the sound emissions component of the WindPRO \u00ae software package (EMD Internat ional A/S, Denmark), which is a generalized siting tool for wind farms. The noi se prediction module is only one aspect of the much larger program. SoundPLAN \u00ae (Braustein & Berndt GmbH, Backnang, Germany), is evidently similar in capability to Cadna/A\u00ae but, for reasons that are unclear, is not often used for wind turbine analyses despite its apparent capability to integrate th e NORD2000 algorithm as an optional calculation methodology. One other program, WindFarm\u00ae (ReSoft Ltd, U.K.), is a nother general project design package of which the noise component is only a small part. 16 004579 Any one of these programs would be genera lly acceptable for modeling the noise from a new project. 4.1.3 Model Inputs In contrast to models of acoustically comple x fossil fueled power plants that consist of dozens of major sources, the sound levels of wh ich often need to be estimated, the input to a wind turbine project model is a single sound power level spectrum that is known with considerable accuracy. Turbine sound power levels are tested in accordance with IEC 61400-11 5, in which highly specialized and meticu lous techniques are used to derive the sound power level of a wind turbine over a range of wind speeds from 6 to 10 m/s (as measured at 10 m above ground)b. The best input to us e for any model is the maximum octave band sound power level frequenc y spectrum taken directly from a field test report. Although such reports are sometimes made available by manufacturers, it is more common for the acoustical performance to be reported second-hand (b ased on either an IEC 61400-11 test or analytical calculatio ns) in a technical specification document published by the manufacturer. The reporte d sound levels may or may not contain an explicit design margin and/or may be stated as warranted sound levels. While input sound levels that have been ar tificially inflated w ould tend to needle ssly overstate the potential impact of a project, there often isn't any alternative to using whatever performance the manufacturer deci des to publish. Whatever the source of the data is, it should be clearly stated in the impact assessment report. 4.1.4 Modeling Methodology Recommended procedures for modeling wind turbine project noise are as follows: Begin with a base map showing the turbin e locations and all potentially sensitive receptors in and around the project area (residences, schools, churches, etc.) Build up the topography of the site in th e noise model if the terrain features consist of hills and valleys with a total elevation difference of more than about 100 ft. - otherwise flat terrain can be assumed Locate point sources at the hub height of each turbine (typically 80 m) Use the maximum octave band sound power level spectrum for the planned turbine model or the loudest model of those being considered Assume a ground absorption coefficient (A g from ISO 9613-2) appropriate to the site area (a moderate value of 0.5 generally works well as an annual average for rural farmland, although higher values specifically for farm fields during summer conditions may be appropriate. A value of 0 (100% reflective ground) is likely to produce highly conservative results) b In its current edition (2.1). A revision to this standard has been in development for some time that would expand this wind speed range and add a number of other refinements (and complexities) to the test procedure. It is unclear whether this new edition will ever actually be adopted. 17 004580 Assume ISO \"standard day\" temperature a nd relative humidity values of 10 deg. C/70% RH unless the prevai ling conditions at the site are substantially and consistently different than that Plot the sound contours from the project assuming an omni-directional wind out to a level of 35 dBA (shading the area between each 5 dBA gradation with a different color often greatly improves legibility) The assumption of an omni-directional wind means that the sound power level of the turbine, which is measured in the IEC 61400-11 procedure downwind of the unit, is modeled as radiating with equa l strength in all directions; i.e. the sound level in every direction is the downwind sound level. Althoug h this may seem be depict an unrealistic situation and over-predict upwind sound levels, the fact of the ma tter is that this approach generally results in predictions that are cons istent with measurements irrespective of the where the receptor point is lo cated. Although somewhat count erintuitive, the reason for this is that wind turbine noise under most normal circumstances is not particularly directional and generally radiates uniformly in all directions. As an example, the plot below shows the sound levels measured in th ree directions 1000 ft. fr om a typical unit in a rural project in Southern Mi nnesota. Although there are pe riods when the levels differ, implying some directionality, the majority of the time all three sound levels are generally about same irrespective of the wind direc tion. Moreover, the sound level at the downwind position is almost never elevated relative to other directions as one might expect. 18 004581 Sound Levels - LA90(10 min) - at All Three 1000 ft.

In this instance, the units are located on a fairly prominent ridgeline and the topography has been recreated in the model. 19 004582 Figure 4.1.5.1 Noise Model Plot - Example A Based on the plot, the potential noise impact from this project can be characterized as being fairly mild in the sense that nearly all of the residences in the vicinity of the project are expected to see a mean sound level of 40 dBA or, in most cases, less. The few houses that are nominally above 40 dBA are only marg inally above that threshold and none are close to the 45 dBA absolute upper limit. The green region between 40 and 35 dBA generally represents the area where in all likelihood project noise would still be readily audible some of the time, if not much of th e time, but at a fairly low magnitude.

Below 35 dBA project noise generally becomes so low that it is only rarely considered objectionable even in extremely low noise envi ronments. Complete inaudibility does not occur for quite some distance from most project s in quiet areas because of the distinctive, periodic nature of wind turbine noise. The actual distance to the point of inaudibility varies amorphously with atmospheric conditions and is generally much further at night than during the day. Conse quently, the exact reaction to any project can never be predicted with certainty because project noise is often audible to some extent, at least intermittently, far from the project. Howeve r, the studies of response to wind turbine noise discussed in Section 3.0 suggest that the threshold be tween a mild or acceptable impact and a fairly significant adverse reac tion is a gray area centered at 40 dBA. An additional sound contour plot is shown in Figure 4.1.5.2 representing another hypothetical but typical project, this time in essentially flat Midwestern farm country.

Turbine Location Nearby Residence 004584 In contrast to Example A, there are many homes inside of the 40 dBA sound contour in this scenario and even a few above 45 dBA, which is a common occurrence. One would have to conclude that at least a few complain ts about noise would arise from this project if it were to proceed to completion in this configuration. The population density is such at this site that an optimization study should be undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of removing and relocating turbines outside of the present site area so that sound levels are substantially reduced at the ho mes with predicted levels of above 45 dBA and so that the number of residences above 40 dBA is dramatically diminished. 4.2 Pre-Construction Background Sound Surveys Noise impacts can be evaluated in both absolu te and relative terms. In the discussion immediately above the reaction to the example projects was estimated directly from the predicted project sound levels, neglecting background noise or essentially assuming a rural setting with generally qui et background sound levels. Ho wever, not all sites are the same and it is often prudent to perform a surv ey of existing conditions to establish just what the baseline sound levels are at residences in the proposed project area. In general, the audibility of, and potential impact from, any project is a functi on of how much, if at all, its noise exceeds the prevailing b ackground level. A comparison between the predicted/modeled sound level from a pr oposed project and the actual background sound level measured in the project area under comparable wind and weather conditions gives a site-specific indication of the potential relative impact from the project. Such a survey is not essential in all cases but is recommended when: Unusually high background levels are suspected (e.g. due to the proximity of a major highway, urban areas or existing industrial facilities) Unusually low background levels are suspected The project is unusually large or controversial There is simply a desire to carry out a complete and thorough assessment 4.3 Recommended Field Survey Methodology The objective of a pre-construction survey is to establish what levels of environmental sound are currently being experienced at typi cal residences within the general project area in order to form a baseline against which the predicted sound emissions from the project can be compared. Ther e is no need, nor would it be practical, to measure at every house. The idea is to get a set of samples th at can be considered representative of the overall site area. In rural areas away from significant sources of man-made noise, it is common to find that the sound levels at all po sitions are generally si milar indicating that background sound levels are for al l intents and purposes unifo rm throughout the site area. Contrary to popular beli ef, such a survey is not useful for the purpose of establishing the pre-existing environmental sound level as a baseline against which to compare the measured sound emissions from the comple ted project. The background sound level 22 004585 varies dramatically with time, typically over a dynamic range of 30 dBA or more, depending not only on the wind speed but many other factors, such as the prevailing atmospheric conditions, the time of day, season of the year, etc., so the level measured one or two years earlier cannot be taken to accurately represent the background level present during an operational compliance test. In fact, the only valid background level is the background level occurring, literally, at th e same time that the operational sound level is measured. A methodology for overcoming this seeming impossibility is discussed later in Section 5.1. 4.3.1 Measurement Positions Specific monitoring positions shoul d ideally be lo cated at or near typi cal residences in the site area. It is the sound le vel where people actually are most of the time and especially at night that is of primary importance (rather than at property lines, for instance). Permission to set up equipment on private prop erty is usually freely granted upon request. If a site is largely flat and homogenous in nature (e.g. rural farmland away from any major highways, urban areas or industry) monitor positions should be selected at points that are more or less evenly distributed over the project area. In such simple cases, 6 to 8 monitoring positions are usually more than suffi cient even if the project area is fairly large. For more complex sites, where the topography is significant or where man-made noise sources already exist, more monitoring positions will generally be required with the objective of capturing sound levels at residenc es in each kind of setting. A \"setting\" is defined as an area where the prevailing environmental sound level is suspected of differing significantly from other parts of the project area. For example, houses in the bottom of ravines or valleys may experience different ambient sound levels than nearby houses on exposed hilltops. Monitors should be located at positions representative of both of these settings. Another type of unique setting might be at homes that are located directly on a major road or hi ghway or in an urban area vers us others in the project area that are in remote areas. In some cases, a wi nd farm already exists adjacent to the area where a new project is proposed. Measuremen ts should be made at homes that have maximum exposure to the sound emissions from the operating turbines for comparison to measurements at residences that are remote from the existing project. The total number of monitoring positions is generally limited by equipment availability and logistical concerns but no more than about 12 to 14 positions are normally required, even for the most complex sites. 4.3.2 Survey Duration and Scheduling Short duration spot samples are insufficient to capture environmental sound levels over the variety of wind and atmosphe ric conditions that are relevant to project ope ration. For example, a brief sample on a calm, quiet night is meaningless in the sense that it does not represent the background sound level that will exist on a continuous basis or during the moderately windy conditions necessary for the project to generate noise. In fact, 23 004586 background sound levels in the rural areas where wind project s are most commonly sited are remarkable for their variability and subs tantial dependency on wind speed. It is the background sound level that occurs when it is moderately windy that is actually of interest for comparison to pr oject sound emissions. In the very typical example below, the background sound level measured at four positions widely distributed over a proposed wind project site in the Midwest can be seen to parallel the concurrent wind speed and, moreover, to vary dramatically from 17 dBA during calm conditi ons to 54 dBA during windy conditions. Pre-Construction Background Sound Levels, LA90(10 min), at All Four On-Site Monitoring Stations Compared to Wind Speed at 10 m 010203040506070 2/22/07 12:00 2/23/07 0:00 2/23/07 0:00 12:00 3/6/07 0:00 3/6/07 12:00 Tim e and DateSound Pressure Level, dBA 0481216202428 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/sDynamic Range 17 to 54 dBA Wind Speed Figure 4.3.2.1 Consequently, a long-term, continuous monitori ng approach is needed in which multiple instruments are set up at ke y locations and programmed to run day and night for a period of about two weeks or more. In essence, it is necessary to cast a wide net in order to capture sound levels during a variety of wind and atmosp heric conditions and provide sufficient data so that the relationship between background noise and wind speed can be quantitatively evaluated. Field experience suggests that an adequate range of wind speed s, from 0 to 10 m/s at 10 m above ground level, will usually be observed over any given 14 day period at most wind energy project sites, except perhaps dur ing the low wind season at sites that might have very pronounced seasonal wind characteristics. Probably the principal reason for this observation is that this length of time is large relative to the time normally taken for 24 004587 weather patterns, wind directions and genera l atmospheric conditions to change, which essentially ensures that the da ta are statistically independent , as discussed in great detail in ANSI S12.9-1992/Part 227. Data independence implies that the test results can be taken to represent the longer-term acoustic situa tion for that area, at least for the general time of year of the test. However, if a re view of the weather conditions that occurred during the survey period shows that the winds were unusually calm or if an insufficient number of data points were collected at th e higher wind speeds, the survey may need to be extended for another two weeks. Low wind conditions are most commonly captured and the vast majority of the measurements w ill be for conditions below or just above the cut-in wind speed. High winds normally occur intermittently over a few hours or a few days separated by sometimes lengthy periods of relatively calm conditions. It may sound counterintuitive, but it is not critical to capture extr emely high wind conditions, say higher than about 12 m/s at 10 m, since most complaints and issues with wind turbine noise occur during moderate or even light wind conditions, while background noise tends to predominate under very windy conditions. As a practical matter, the instruments for such a survey are set up, st arted and left to run unattended for the nominal two-week test pe riod following which they can be retrieved and downloaded. Of course, one could stay on site through the test making additional intermittent manned measurements and observations but the very high cost of such an effort would be difficult to ju stify, particularly since it w ould not necessarily guarantee a better or more definitive result than could be derived from the monitor data alone. In terms of scheduling, it is highly preferable to conduct this type of survey during cool season, or wintertime, conditions to eliminate or at least minimize possible contaminating noise from summertime insects, frogs and birds. In addition, it is best for deciduous trees to be leafless at sites wher e they are present in quantity to avoid elevated sound levels that might not be representative of the mi nimum annual level. Human activity, such as from farm machinery or lawn care, is also normally lower during the winter. While summertime surveys can be successful they should, as a general rule, be avoided wherever possible because nocturnal insect noi se, for instance, can easily contaminate the data and make it impossible to quantify th e relationship between sound levels and wind speed. In addition to seasonal concerns, it is desirable, when practical, to attempt to schedule the survey set up to just precede a predicted pe riod of moderate or high winds. This not only ensures that the survey period will capture these winds but also creates an opportunity for manned observations and measurements to be made for a day or two to augment to the longer term monitoring survey. 4.3.3 Instrumentation and Test Set-up As with any field sound survey, what equipment is used and how it is deployed must adhere to certain minimum technical stan dards. These requirements are generally described in numerous standard s, such as ANSI S12.9-1992/Part 2 27; however, the focus of this section is not to repeat and belabo r those details but rath er to point up what 25 004588 adaptations need to be made for the specific application of performing general site-wide surveys for wind turbine projects. As mentione d earlier, no standard exists that can be directly used for this purpose, if only becau se they limit data collection to low wind conditions. In terms of instrumentation, most environmental sound measurement standards recommend the use of Type 1 precision equipment per IEC 61672-1 28 or ANSI S1.43- 199729 while also allowing for the use of Type 2 equipment. There is certainly no reason on technical grounds to oppose this recommendation but, from a practical perspective, it is often necessary to use Type 2 equipment fo r surveys of this type because of the large number of instruments needed. The norma lly negligible difference in technical performance between these two instrument classes is totally inconsequential within the inherently and unavoidably impreci se nature of this type of survey. It is much more important that the equipment is durable, reliable and specifically designed for extended use in the outdoors. Delicat e and expensive Type 1 precision grade equipment can be unreliable in such applications or even unable to be programmed as a data logger. Although high cost and extreme pr ecision are not essential, th e functional capabilities to statistically integrate sound le vels over a user defined time period and automatically store the results are necessary. Because the on-si te wind and weather monitoring towers, or met towers, normally integrate and store measurements in 10 minute increments it is convenient, if not necessary, to measure and store sound data in synchronization with the wind data collected by these towers for later co rrelation. It is evid ently universal practice for met towers to store data 6 times an hour in 10 minute intervals that begin at the top of the hour; as in 9:00, 9:10, 9:20, etc. Consequently, sound data logging should be started using a trigger function to begin at the to p of an hour and not randomly by the manual push of the start button. The timers on all instruments should be exactly synchronized to local time. Of course, all of the instruments must be field calibrate d at the beginning of the survey and checked again for drif t at the end of the survey. Because this long-term survey approach involves unattended monitoring, the instrument and the microphone must be capable of withstanding damage, inte rference or outright destruction from rain and snow, which, am ong other things, means that the ground plate technique specified in IEC 61400- 11 - where the microphone is laid flat in the center of a board on the ground and covered with one or more hemispherical windscreens - is not a viable option, despite its otherwise highl y desirable advantage of minimizing wind- induced pseudo noise. Consequently, the microphone must be mounted above ground level and protected from wi nd-induced distortion by a s pherical weather-treated windscreen, which normally entails a higher de nsity foam that is hydrophobically treated to shed water (windscreens and wind-induced no ise are discussed in detail later). As a general rule, a slightly lower than norma l microphone height of about 1 m above ground level is preferred for this application on the premise that wind speed diminishes exponentially with decreasing el evation theoretically going to zero at the surface, or boundary layer. To illustrate this, the nominal wind speed profile, or shear gradient, per Eqn. (7) in IEC 61400-11 is illustrated below in Figure 4.3.3.1 for a common turbine 26 004589 operating condition where the wind speed is 6 m/s at the standard elevation of 10 m above ground level. Standardized Wind Speed Profile per IEC 61400-11 for a Wind Speed of 6 m/s at 10 m 0102030405060708090 0123456789 1 0 Wind Speed, m/sHeight Above Ground Level, mStandard IEC Height = 10 m Wind Speed = 6 m/sCommon Hub Height = 80 m Wind Speed = 8.4 m/s Recommended Microphone Height = 1 m Wind Speed < 4 m/s Figure 4.3.3.1 For these moderate wind conditions, the wind speed at a 1 m microphone height would be less than about 3 or 4 m/s, whic h as shall be seen later, m eans that distortion from wind blowing through the windscreen is of little or no consequence with respect to the A- weighted sound level so long as an extra la rge windscreen is used (typically 7\" in diameter, as a minimum). In addition to arranging for the microphone to be about 1 m off the ground so that it is not adversely affected by precipitation, it is also necessary to keep the instrument itself dry and secure in a waterproof case, which is best mounted above the ground on a fencepost, utility pole or other support. While the microphone can be remotely connect ed to the instrument with a cable and independently supported, anothe r option is to us e a self-contained system where the microphone is attached to the instrument case with a rigid boom to hold the microphone away from the box and the entire assembly is mounted 1 m above ground level with a strap as shown, for example, in Figure 4.3.3.2. While there is nothing wrong with supporting the microphone separately on a tri pod there is a tendenc y, unique to wind turbine survey work, for tri pods to blow over, even afte r being weighted down and/or firmly staked to the ground. The use of tem porary metal fence posts to support either the microphone alone or the entire sy stem is a more reliable op tion and is sometimes the only option in places where there are no exis ting supports, such as in open fields. 27 \\ 004590 Figure 4.3.3.2 Typical Integrating Sound Monitor with 7\" Weather- treated Windscreen In addition to sound level meters it is also advisable to set up at least one temporary weather station at the most exposed measur ement position in order to measure the wind speed at microphone height and other parameters such wind direction and rainfall. All weather data should also be logged in 10 minute increments for later correlation to the sound data. 4.3.4 Measurement Quantities For a background survey of this type the principal quantity of interest is the L A90 statistical measure, which is the A-we ighted sound level exceeded 90% of the measurement interval (10 minutes in this case). What this means is that the sound level is higher than the L A90 value most of the time and, conversely, that the L A90 level represents the near-minimum sound level for each interval . It essentially cap tures the momentary, quiet lulls between sporadic noise events, like cars pa ssing by, and, as such, is a conservative measure of the environmental sound level. The average A-weighted sound level, or L Aeq, which is the fundamental metric for highway noise surveys and the calculati on of the Day-Night Average Level, L dn, is unsuitable for wind turbine background surveys in rural areas because this level is extremely sensitive to contaminating noise events, such as from occasional traffic, planes flying over or dogs barking - things that cannot be relied on to be consistently present and available to potentially mask project noise on a permanent basis. The L A90 measure, on the other hand, automatically excludes these events for the most part and essentially defines the true \"back ground\" noise floor. 28 004591 4.4 Analysis and Interpretation of Results 4.4.1 Data Analysis and Wind Speed Correlation At the completion of the survey the L A90 sound levels measured at all positions should be plotted together to evaluate th eir consistency and to determine if the levels in different settings should be segregated. For exampl e, if the sound levels at sheltered valley locations are consistently lower than measur ements on higher ground then the data should be analyzed separately to develop typical background levels for each setting. Somewhat surprisingly, the need for this kind of sepa rate treatment is rare and the much more common result is for the sound levels at all of the positions to be generally similar in magnitude at any given time with each gene rally following the same temporal trends and intertwining with each other. As a typical example, the as-measured L A90 levels at 7 positions spread over a fairly large site in Southern Minnesota are shown below. Overview of As-measured L90(10 min) Sound Levels at All Positions 010203040506070 3/17/10 3/18/10 0:00 3/18/10 12:00 0:00 3/31/10 12:00 Date and TimeSound Pressure Level, dBAPos. 1 Pos. 2 Pos. 3 Pos. 4 Pos. 5 Pos. 6 Pos. 7Local Noise Events to be Discarded Figure 4.4.1.1 All positions follow each other and there is no one position that is consistently higher or lower than the others. Since these positions are miles apart from each other one would not expect exact agreement yet the levels are remarkably similar indicating that the environmental sound level over th e entire site are is more or less uniform (sometimes termed a \"macro-ambient\"). If obvious cont aminating events - those occurring at only one position - are discarded (as noted in the figure) th e arithmetic average of the remaining data points can reasonably be cons idered the typical sound level over the site area. However, the question becomes: what is the sound level? The level varies 29 004592 substantially with time from almost complete silence (17 dBA) to nearly 60 dBA. The background level is obviously not a single number. The reason for this variation becomes clear if the average site-wide sound le vel is compared to the concurrent wind speed (Figure 4.4.1.2).

Conseque ntly, the sound level is almost entirely a function of the wind speed occurring at any given moment. This relationship can be quantified by re-plotting the sound levels in Figure 4.4.1.2 as a function of wind speed (normalized to a standard height of 10 m per Eqn (7) in IEC 61400-11). 30 004593 Regression Analysis of Measured L90 Sound Level vs. Normalized Wind Speed Overall Survey Period - Day and Night y = -0.0182x3 + 0.488x2 - 1.0249x + 24.389 R2 = 0.7139 051015202530354045505560 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1Wind Speed at 10 m above Ground L evel, m/sL90(10 min) Sound Pressure Level, dBA 2 Figure 4.4.1.3 The central trendline through the data gives the mean L A90 sound level for any particular wind speed - at least in terms of the overall survey period. It is important to point out in this contex t that, although the wind sp eed correlated to the sound data is the normalized value at the IEC standard elevation of 10 m, the measurement is actually taken at the top of the met tower, usually 60 m (197 ft) above ground level. Thus, the wind speed associated with turbine operation (not far below hub height) is directly correlate d to the sound level measured near ground level; where the wind speed may well have been negligib le. In other words, Figure 4.4.1.3 is not showing the relationship between the sound level and wind speed at the measurement position, as is quite often supposed. 4.4.2 Daytime vs. Nighttime Levels Since nighttime conditions are of the most re levance with respect to potential disturbance from project noise, the data should be broken down into daytime (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and nighttime (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.) levels to see if it is significantly quieter at night - something that is not always particularly apparent in the level vs. time data (Figure 4.4.1.1). In this instance, the nighttime levels (Figure 4.4.1.4) ar e substantially quieter than during the day (Figure 4.4.1.5), particularly, in the vicinity of 6 m/s, which is usually the point where wind turbines first start to ge nerate significant noise but th e background level is typically 31 004594 still rather low thereby maximizing the potential audibility of project noise. In these examples, the mean background level for 6 m/ s wind conditions duri ng the day is 34 dBA while the nighttime level is about 28 dBA. Bo th of these levels are extremely quiet, but 28 dBA is so low that any potential maski ng from background noise can essentially be neglected as insignificant.

Under high wind conditions, say around 10 m/s, background noise is in the mid-40's dBA irrespective of time of day and therefore will act to partially obscure project noise, but during low wind conditions when the project is operating at low load an adverse impact can be expected unless the mean project sound level is ke pt to a relatively low level at residences. In this instance, it would be advisable to strictly design the project so that all residences are predicted to have aver age sound levels no higher than 40 dBA. In general, background survey results may be used to establish a very rough impact threshold of 5 dBA over the ambient when the nighttime L A90 is about 35 dBA or more under what is usually the critical wind speed of 6 m/s. For example, if the measured level is 40 dBA then little adverse reaction might be expected from project levels up to 45 dBA (predicted with the project operating during comparable 6 m/s wind conditions). This 5 dBA increase metric does not hold for very low background levels (<35 dBA) because the background sound level and the project level both become so low as to be insignificant in absolute terms. If the background were 10 dBA, for in stance, there would be no need to design a project to not ex ceed 15 dBA - both levels represent almost complete silence and are inconsequential. For low background situations like the 33 004596 example discussed above the outcome of the survey would be to set a firm upper limit of 40 dBA at residences. In terms of a potential noise impact, a low background level combined with predicted project levels of more than 40 dBA at numerous residences would be an undesirable situation likely to lead to complaints. Although 6 m/s may be assumed in most cases to be the critical wind speed - i.e. the point where turbine noise is likely to be loudest relative to the amount of background noise available to potentially obscure it - the si te-specific critical wind speed may also be calculated by comparing the sound power levels of the particular turbine model planned for the project with the L A90 background levels actually measured at the site. The critical condition corresponds to the point where the simple differentia l between these two values is maximum, as illustrated in the following example. Table 4.4.3.1 Comparison of Turbine Sound Power Levels to Measured Background Levels to Determine Critical Wind Speed Wind Speed at 10 m, m/s Measured Overall L 90, dBA Turbine Sound Power Level, dBA re 1 pWcDifferential 4 27 95 68 5 29 99 69 6 32 102 70 7 35 104 69 8 38 104 66 9 41 104 63 10 45 104 59 11 48 104 56 In this case (based arbitrarily on the data in Figure 4.4.1.3) the maximum differential of 70 occurs at 6 m/s - meaning that the sound em issions from the turbine are the highest at this particular point relativ e to the background level indica ting that project noise would theoretically be most audible under these conditions. Ironi cally, the maximum audibility point does not usually correspond to the wind speed when th e turbine first reaches its maximum noise emission point (in this example 7 m/s and a sound power level of 104 dBA re 1 pW). As a side note, this analysis illustrates one of the reasons why it is beneficial to normalize the met tower wind speed data to 10 m; name ly, because wind turbine sound power levels are expressed as a function of wind speed at 10 m above grade (and not at hub height). Consequently, the background sound levels and the turbine sound levels are all compared on an equal footing. c The fundamental unit of sound power is Watts and sound power levels are expressed with reference to 1 picoWatt, or 10-12 W. By convention this referen ce is explicitly stated to help distinguish power levels from pressure levels , which are measured in terms of Pascals. 34 004597 5.0 Measuring Wind Turbine Sound Emissions 5.1 Project-wide Compliance Testing 5.1.1 Historical Approaches In general, it has been difficult, historica lly, to devise or settle on a completely satisfactory methodology for test ing newly completed wind projects for the purpose of determining whether or not they are in comp liance with permit or regulatory conditions. One of the principal stumbling blocks has ge nerally been accounting in some meaningful way for background noise, since the total measured sound level at the typically substantial distances to residences and, therefore, the point of measurement, commonly contains a very prominent background comp onent that cannot be disregarded without causing the result to be erroneously high. It is, of course, the project-only sound level and not the total sound level that is limited by regulations. Consequently, it is the project-only sound leve l that is sought in such surveys. Existing guidelines and standards that mention the topic of compliance testing at all do not lay out or detail test procedur es that are entirely satisfactory in this and other respects. For example, the often beleaguered 30 ETSU-R-97 report The Assessment and Rating of Noise from Wind Farms31 published by the Department of Trade and Industry in the U.K. addresses the issue of background noise in one sentence, quoted below, by suggesting simply that one might want to meas ure operational turbine noise at night. To minimize the effects of extraneo us noise sources it may be necessary to perform these measurements during night-time periods when other human and animal activity noise sources are likely to be at a minimum. This approach, which involves measuring only fo r a relatively short period of time (20 to 30 L A90, 10 min samples), is connected with the idea of taking measurements only at, or close to, a specific critical wind speed identified from \"m onitoring\", carried out in an unspecified manner, and correlated to logged observations by complainants as to when the \"noise is most intrusive\" (ibid). In short, the idea is fo r the test engineer to be physically at the location and ready to take measurements when the wind conditions that result in maximum noise are occurring - so long as those conditions are happening at night on a night when the background sound leve l is negligible (i.e . roughly 10 dBA or more lower in magnitude than the turbine sound level). As might be imagined, the unfortunate reality is that the probability of all these things coming together at the same time is miniscule. In particular , it is typically difficult, for a number of reasons, for a test engineer to schedule a site visit to coincide with a particular wind speed or direction. In general, the notion of being on hand to observe and measure wind turbine noise when it is at its loudest may sound reasonable on pa per but it is seldom pr actical to actually do it. Another approach to the issue of background noi se that has been used, for example in the New Zealand Standard NZS 6808:1998 Acoustics - The assessment and measurement of 35 004598 sound from wind turbine generators32, is to measure the background level at one time, say, prior to construction or st art-up, and the operational noise from the project at another time - and then subtract the two to derive the project-only sound level. While this is often thought of or suggested as a reasonable approach, the problem is that both the background and wind turbine sound levels are extremely dependent on circumstances that vary significantly with time in both the short and long-term. The two sounds are highly specific not only to the prevailing wind speed at a particular time but also to factors such as the stability of the wind (whether it's gust y or constant in nature, for instance), wind direction, shear gradient, thermal gradient, ti me of day and time of year. Moreover, the background level is also exclusively influenced by foliage (bare trees vs. leafed out trees, for example), insects, frogs, distant or near by traffic, farm equipment and a myriad of other human activities that occur sporadic ally and unpredictably. Consequently, a background sound level measured days, months or years before can't be used with a tremendous amount of confidence to correct a later measurement of operational noise, even if both have been normalized to sim ilar wind speed conditions, because so many other unquantifiable factors may have had a ha nd in shaping the final results. What is needed, of course, is the background sound level th at would have existed at that particular time and at that place if the project had not been operating. This latter objective can sometimes be essent ially realized by using the technique of temporarily shutting down, or parking, the ne arest turbines to a measurement position, if not the entire project. While this technique has its applications, which will be discussed later, it is not usually a pr actical method that can be used for a general site-wide compliance test. Widespread or complete sh utdowns would be requi red repeatedly over a variety of wind speed conditions and times of da y to get even a minimally complete set of usable background levels. Thus, there are certain impracticalities associated with the few existing guidelines, standards or common practices that deal w ith the testing of opera tional noise from wind turbine projects. 5.1.2 Test Methodology The suggested methodology outlined below, which has been developed over time through field experience on a variety of wind projects , does not purport to completely solve the problems of background noise and capturing th e periods of maximum noise, among other things, but it has been found to work very well in numerous fi eld applications. 5.1.3 Survey Duration and Scheduling In order to overcome the problem of being on hand to take short-duration measurements when conditions might favor noise generation at the source and/or sound propagation from the turbines to typical receptor points, a long-term, continuous monitoring approach is needed in which multiple instruments are set up at key locations and programmed to run day and night for a period of about two weeks or more. In essence, it is necessary to capture sound levels during a variety of wind and atmospheric conditions; something that 36 004599 is extremely difficult to achieve by taking intermittent manned samples, which amount to static snapshots of a dynamic situation. Field experience suggests that an adequate range of wind speed s, from 0 to 10 m/s at 10 m above ground level, will usually be observed over any given 14 day period at most wind energy project sites, except perhaps dur ing the low wind season at sites that might have very pronounced seasonal wind characteristics. As a practical matter, the instruments for such a survey are set up, st arted and left to run unattended for the nominal two-week test pe riod following which they can be retrieved and downloaded. In terms of scheduling, it is highly preferable to conduct this type of survey during cool season, or wintertime, conditions to eliminate or at least minimize possible contaminating noise from summertime insects, frogs and birds. In addition, it is best for deciduous trees to be leafless at sites where they are present in quantity to decrease this source of wind- driven background noise and maximize the signal to noise ratio. Human activity, such as from farm machinery or lawn care, is also normally lower during the winter. While summertime surveys have been successful th ey should, as a general rule, be avoided wherever possible because nocturnal insect noise, for instance, can easily render the project sound level indeterminate at some or all of the measurement positions. If measurements are required during the summer, and they often are for reasons of project scheduling, high frequency contamination can be analytically factored out by taking the measurements in octave or 1/3 octave bands and correcting the sp ectra, as will be discussed later in greater detail. In addition to seasonal concerns, it is desirabl e; when practical, to attempt to schedule the survey set up to just precede a predicted pe riod of moderate or high winds. This not only ensures that the survey period will capture these winds but also creates an opportunity for manned observations and measurements to be made for a day or two to augment to the longer term monitoring survey. There is ge nerally nothing to observe or measure at a wind turbine site when the winds are calm, so if one can be on site with the proper equipment just before a windy period useful short-term measurements can probably be made that can later be viewed within the cont ext of the long-term monitor results for that time period. As an alternative or supplemental approac h, another opportunity fo r these supplemental manned observations can sometimes be arrange d by coordinating the in strument retrieval visit with a predicted windy pe riod. The specific end date for the survey is usually flexible, although instrument battery life is no rmally the limiting factor. The principal danger in carrying out manned measurements just before the end of a survey, however, is that all of the long-term monitors may not stil l be recording due to power supply issues or any number of other lamentable and sometim es comical things, such as tampering, weather damage or the removal of the windscreen by livestock. 37 004600 5.1.4 Test Positions The test positions should be selected to captu re data at a number of potentially sensitive receptors (usually non-participa ting and participating residences within or near the site area) or other relevant points of interest, where maximum pr oject sound levels might be expected either from modeling or a simple insp ection of the site plan. In just about every case, it is not practical or even possible to establish a monitoring station at every house in the vicinity of a project so it is necessary to carefully select a limited but adequate number of sites that are representative of the worst-case exposures at potentially sensitive receptors in all relevant settings. Examples of specific settings would be: homes in sheltered valleys below ridge top turbines ; homes on high, open ground with exposure to the wind and nearby project turb ines; homes in generally flat open country with turbines in multiple directions; homes in wooded area; homes on the outer edge of a project area, etc. Because every site is unique the number of monitoring stations required to adequately evaluate project noi se will vary but the general concepts are to reasonably account for different settings, to cover a number of points were maximum project sound levels are likely to occur at residences and to cover the entire project area with a generally even but somewhat random dist ribution. Adding one or two deliberately random positions can help increase the statis tical independence of the data and avoid inadvertent bias. For sparsely populated sites in open and uniform farm country only about 4 or 5 on-site monitors might be needed while at more densely populated sites with more complex topography the number of moni toring stations would only be limited by the quantity of equipment reasonably available to the test engineer either from in-house stock or outside rental. Realistically, it is seldom possible to gather enough equipment for more than about 10 to 14 on-site monito ring points, but that is normally enough. A typical survey at a fairly large project site with numerous residences intermixed with the turbines might call for about 10 positions at receptors within the project area. As mentioned above, the genera l objective is to capture so und levels throughout the site area at key receptors in all distinct settings within the project area. In addition, it is commonly necessary and desirable to esta blish a measurement position at all homes where complaints or concerns a bout noise have been expressed to the oper ations staff. In these instances, it is sometimes possible to enlist the help of residents by having them try to keep a date and time log of when th e noise becomes particularly noticeable or unusually loud or when other non-project soun ds are present; for example, from lawn moving, farm activity, etc. When this is actually done the comments can provide some valuable insights that help explain and iden tify peaks in the recorded sound levels. It is often assumed that project noise is of no concern to project participants who were, and presumably still are, favorably disposed to the project and are receiving lease royalties for units on their land ; however, experience at a nu mber of sites suggests that this is not always the case largely due to the confluence of two factors: (1) these residences are typically the cl osest ones to turbines (sometimes only a few hundred feet away) and (2) the actual sound levels from these nearby units can turn out to be substantially louder than they expected them to be or they were led to believe. Consequently, monitoring at the homes of project participants in response to complaints 38 004601 is fairly common - even though participants ar e often, but not always, technically exempt from ordinance or permit noise limits. It is usually best to start the site selection process a week or two in advance of the actual survey by circling proposed measurement areas on a site map or s ound contour plot and submitting this to operations personnel at the site for their input on who, within or near each designated area, might be willing to host a sound monitor at their house and where else, outside of these proposed areas, it might be also be desirable to measure (at complaint locations, for instance). The objective of this preparatory review is to obtain approval and permission from homeowners to set up equipment on their property prior to arrival. Although it is desirable to inspect the proposed locations and make a judgment as to their suitability in person, attempts to a rrange for permission on the day of the survey are often unsuccessful due to the simple fact that people are not at home and cannot be reached. Calling ahead usually settles the i ssue before the equipment is shipped to the site. Setting up the equipment in the rear yard of a house where permission has been obtained generally ensures that the equipment will still be there upon returning at the end of the survey, that the equipment won't be interfered with and that it can be minimally attended to, if necessary (re placing the windscreen after the family dog has run off with it, for example). Positions th at are not at anyone's house, su ch as on utili ty poles along the public right-of-way, are sometimes necessary to collect data at strategic locations without a suitable host, but they do not have an y of these advantages and, in fact, the risk of theft or tampering is uncomfortably high. In terms of the specific placement of the mon itor at each position, it should be located in an area representative of but away from the house, or any other building with large reflective surfaces, and that is not prone to frequent activity or contaminating local noises, such as from air conditioning units, milking machines at dairy farms or flowing streams or rivers. As a final note on placement, it is best to avoid using fences or posts to mount the monitor or microphone in areas where livestock or other domestic animals may be able to get at the equipment during the survey. Mi crophone windscreens are evidently of keen interest to cows, horses and dogs, among others. 5.1.5 Background Noise On the important issue of background noise, an approach that has worked well in a number of field applications is to set up a number of mon itoring stations outside of the project area in settings similar to those at the on-site monitor pos itions. Of course, considerable judgment is involved in selecting these positions but in an ideal situation of, say, an isolated project in open farm country that is largely uniform in character both within and beyond the project area one would wa nt monitors at least 1.5 to 2 miles from the perimeter of the project (nearest turbines) in the four cardinal directions. The locations should be far enough away that project noise is negligible and yet close enough that they are reasonably repres entative of the site area. At the end of the survey the off- site positions can then be evaluated for consistency. If the levels are generally similar, 39 004602 and, somewhat surprisingly, this is usually th e result, the average can be taken as a time history record of the background sound level that probably would have existed within the site area and then used to correct the on-si te measurements taken, importantly, at the same time under identical environmental conditions. Figure 5.1.5.1 below is an example from a site in the Eastern United States where the landscape is rural and generally homogenous in nature with in the project area and for some distance beyond it in terms of topography (ro lling hills), vegetation (a mix of farm fields and wooded areas) and population density (farms and residences scattered more or less uniformly over the site area). The 80 or so 1.5 MW turbines ar e spread throughout a roughly 20 sq. mi. project area on numerous parcels of private land and thoroughly intermixed with the residences in the area. Proxy background measurement positions were set up about 1.5 miles beyond the perimete r of the turbine arra y to the northwest, east and south of the project (a neighbor ing wind project to the west prevented measurements in that direction) at locations that were similar in character to the various settings near on-site residen ces: one was on an open and ex posed hilltop, another was at the edge of a field with nearby trees and a th ird was essentially in a forested area. The expectation was that there might be a cons istent difference between these different positions - with the sheltered forest locati on being quieter than the windy hilltop, for instance - in which cas e background corrections for a partic ular setting would be applied to on-site measurements at positions with comparable settings. However, as can be seen from the figure, the levels at all three lo cations, each many miles from the others, were largely the same at any given time and, perhaps more significantly, no one position is consistently higher or lower th an the others. Consequently, the arithmetic average of all three, with the s ite area physically lyi ng between them, can be taken as a reasonably reliable estimate of the on-site background leve l at any particular time that accounts for the specific wind speed, dire ction, time of day and atmospheric conditions prevailing during that 10 minute period. 40 004603 Background Sound L evel, LA90(10 min), at All Three Off-Site Monitoring Stations with Contaminating Noise Events Eliminated - Compared to Wind Speed 0102030405060 7/10/12 12:00 7/11/12 0:00 7/11/12 0:00 12:00 7/25/12 0:00 7/25/12 12:00 Tim e and DateSound Pressure Level, dBA 0369121518 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/s Wind SpeedLA90 at Background Positions Figure 5.1.5.1 Measured Background Sound Levels at Three Off-Site Proxy Positions The data in Figure 5.1.5.1 have been edited to remove noise spikes that were observed only at one position and not at any others, indicating a contaminating local noise event that is not representative of the area as a w hole. Spikes were also deleted (from both the on-site and background data) if there were no concurrent spik e in wind speed, even if they may have occurred at multiple locations, on the premise that the noise was not associated with the turbines and may have be en due to thunder, rain, a helicopter flyover or some other area-wide noise event. The results shown in the example above are not unique to that site and a similar consistency between the off-site proxy loca tion sound levels has been observed at a number of other projects in rural areas even though the background monitors are deliberately set up in diverse settings. Fo rtunately, for the purpose of estimating simultaneous background sound levels, most wi nd projects are located in rural areas but, of course, not all of them are and other situations exist. In urban settings or near major highways the background sound is no less importa nt, in fact more so, but its dependence on wind and atmospheric conditions is greatly di minished, if not relegated into complete insignificance. In such cases, the proxy background technique is still theoretically viable although the selection of bac kground positions that are representative of receptors potentially affected by project noise becomes highly specific to the circumstances at each receptor. In the case of a highway, for instance, one might try to find a background position that is the same distance from the ro adway as the actual point of interest and similar in all other ways but far enough from an y turbines that they are undetectable. In 41 004604 this kind of a complicated situation where the background level is more dependent on man made noise than natural, wind-induced s ounds it may be necessary to perform a pre- construction survey at the key receptors near turbines and at a number of candidate background positions to evaluate the validity of the proxy locations before the project turbines become operational. 5.1.6 Sound Test Equipment and Set up As with any field sound survey, what equipment is used and how it is deployed must adhere to certain minimum technical standa rds. Most environmental sound measurement standards recommend the use of Type 1 precision equipment per IEC 61672-1 28 or ANSI S1.43-199729 while also allowing for the use of Type 2 equipment. There is certainly no reason on technical grounds to oppose this recommendation but, from a practical perspective, it is often necessary to use Type 2 equipment for surveys of this type because of the large number of instruments needed. The utterly intangible difference in technical performance between these two instrument classes is totally inconsequential within the inherently and unavoidably impreci se nature of this type of survey. It is much more important that the equipment is durable, reliable and specifically designed for extended use in the outdoors. Although high cost and extreme pr ecision are not essential, th e functional capabilities to statistically integrate sound le vels over a user defined time period and automatically store the results are necessary. Because the on-si te wind and weather monitoring towers, or met towers, normally integrate and store measurements in 10 minute increments it is convenient, if not necessary, to measure and store sound data in synchronization with the wind data collected by these towers for later co rrelation. It is evid ently universal practice for met towers to store data 6 times an hour in 10 minute intervals that begin at the top of the hour; as in 9:00, 9:10, 9:20, etc. Consequently, sound data logging should be started using a trigger function to begin at the to p of an hour and not randomly by the manual push of the start button. The timers on all instruments should be exactly synchronized to local time or to the project's SCADA control system clock, if it is different from the actual time, which it often is. Of course, all of the instruments must be field calibrated at the beginning of the survey and checked again for drift at the end of the survey. Because this long-term survey approach involves unattended monitoring, the instrument and the microphone must be capable of withstanding damage, inte rference or outright destruction from rain and snow, which, am ong other things, means that the ground plate technique specified in IEC 61400- 11 - where the microphone is laid flat in the center of a board on the ground and covered with one or more hemispherical windscreens - is not a viable option despite its otherwise highl y desirable advantage of minimizing wind- induced pseudo noise. Consequently, the microphone must be mounted above ground level and protected from wi nd-induced distortion by a s pherical weather-treated windscreen, which normally entails a higher de nsity foam that is hydrophobically treated to shed water (windscreens and wind-induced no ise are discussed in detail later). As a 42 004605 general rule, a slightly lower than norma l microphone height of about 1 m above ground level is preferred for this application on the premise that wind speed diminishes exponentially with decreasing el evation theoretically going to zero at the surface, or boundary layer. For these moderate wind conditions, which are often when turbine noise tends to be most prominent relative to the background level, the wind speed at a 1 m microphone height would be less than about 3 or 4 m/s, which as shall be seen later, means that distortion from wind blowing through the windscreen is of little or no consequence with respect to the A-weighted sound level. In addition to arranging for the microphone to be about 1 m off the ground so that it is not adversely affected by precipitation, it is also necessary to keep the instrument itself dry and secure in a waterproof case, which is best mounted above the ground on a fencepost, utility pole or other support. While the microphone can be remotely connect ed to the instrument with a cable and independently supported, another practical option is to use a self-contained system where the microphone is attached to the instrument case with a rigid boom to hold the microphone away from the box and the entire assembly is mounted 1 m above ground level with a strap. While there is no thing wrong with supporting the microphone separately on a tripod there is a tendency, unique to wind turb ine survey work, for tripods to blow over, even after being weighted down and/or firmly staked to the ground. The use of temporary metal fence posts to suppor t either the microphone alone or the entire system is a more reliable option and is so metimes the only option in places where there are no existing supports, such as in open fields. 5.1.7 Weather Stations and Wind Speed Monitoring In addition to the sound monitors it is also advisable to establish at least one temporary weather station at the sound monitoring positi on with the most exposure to wind. The primary reason for this station is to m easure the maximum wind speed at microphone height (about 1 m) for use in correcti ng the measured sound data for wind-induced distortion as described in a later section. Wi nd speed at 1 m, direc tion and rainfall are the primary parameters to be reco rded by this station, or others set up in othe r settings as appropriate, such as at a sound monitoring pos ition sheltered from the wind by the local terrain (to demonstrate, for instance, that wi nd-induced distortion is negligible at such locations). This data should be integr ated and stored in 10 minute blocks in synchronization with the sound monitors. This temporary anemometer at 1 m above groun d is solely there to evaluate microphone wind exposure and it is the on-si te met tower anemometers, usually at 50 to 80 m above ground level, that should be used to correlate the measur ed sound levels at ground level to the wind speed essentially experienced by the turbine rotors. Turbine nacelle anemometers scattered throughout the site may also be used to determine wind speed, but this is somewhat less desirable because a free field correction usually needs to be applied 43 004606 to this data to account for the energy extracted from the wind by the rotor just upstream of the wind speed sensor. It is customary to normalize mast top or nacel le wind speeds to a sta ndard elevation of 10 m above grade per IEC 61400-11. It is this result that is compared to the measured sound levels. 5.1.8 Measurement Quantit ies and Parameters The objective of a compliance su rvey is to extract the proj ect-only sound level from the total soundscape and compare that result to the permissible lim it. As such, the principal challenge is identifying and eliminating cont aminating noises that are unrelated to the project over many days and thousands of measur ements. If it were practical to take a manned sample for 20 minutes, removing spurious noises by pausing the instrument or discarding contaminated subsamples, and decl are the result as the performance of the project it would be a trivial matter; howev er, over a relatively long time period of unattended monitoring it is necessary to use the L A90 statistical measure to generally perform this function in an automated manner, since it captures the consistently present sound level during relatively quiet periods be tween common interfering and identifiable noise events like cars passing by or planes flying over. A 10 minute sampling duration has been found to work very well since it a llows direct correlation with met mast wind speed data and is generally short enough that fairly rapid changes in project noise are captured. The use of the average, or L Aeq, 10 min , sound level or a finer time resolution of, say, 1 minute come to mind as alternatives to the L A90, but these approach es have their own serious drawbacks. If the L Aeq is used to measure at on-site positions with the idea of better quantifying turbine sound levels, then the L Aeq measured at the proxy background positions must also be used as an apples-to-apples correction factor. But the L Aeq is often completely unusable for this application. As an example, multiple statistical measures were recorded at the off-site background meas urement positions previously mentioned in connection with Figure 5.1.5.1, including the L Aeq. Figure 5.1.8.1 below shows the average L A90 and L Aeq levels measured at all three locations compared to wind speed. 44 004607 Average LA90(10 min) and LAeq(10 min) Background Levels Compared to Site-wide Average Wind Speed at 10 m 010203040506070 7/10/12 12:00 7/11/12 0:00 7/11/12 12:00 7/25/12 0:00 7/25/12 12:00 Time and DateSound Pressure Level, dBA 0369121518 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/s Wind SpeedLAeq LA90 Figure 5.1.8.1 What is immediately obvious from this plot is that the L Aeq, 10 min level is clearly driven by daily human activity; primarily intermittent vehicular noise on nearby sparsely traveled roads (noise that is filtered out by the L A90). The L Aeq levels rise to about 53 dBA every morning, stay there all day irrespective of the wind conditions and then gradually fall off in the evening hours bottoming out briefly so mewhere around 23 dBA every night. The L A90 level, on the other hand, is clearly more attuned to the natura l environmental sound level, which in rural areas like this one is normally a function of wind speed. The unsuitability of the L Aeq, 10 min as a measure that might quantify project noise can be seen in Figure 5.1.8.2 where the average background L Aeq level from Figure 5.1.8.1 is compared to the L Aeq level measured at a typical, ra ndomly selected on-site receptor. 45 004608 LAeq(10 min) Sound Levels at Test Position vs. Time Compared to LAeq(10 min) Proxy Background Levels 01020304050607080 7/10/12 12:00 7/11/12 0:00 12:00 0:00 7/25/12 12:00 Tim e and DateSound Pr essure Level, dBA Background LAeqTest Position LAeq Figure 5.1.8.2 The L Aeq, 10 min sound levels at both positions are virtually indistinguishable meaning that the project-only sound level simply cannot be deduced. Furthermore, it could even be reasoned that project noise is utterly inconsequential at this location because the on-site level is about the same or even lower than the off-site level, which is entirely free of any turbine noise, but, as we shall see later, that is not at all the case at this particular test position. Finally, it is desirable to use instruments cap able of measuring the frequency spectrum in 1/3 octave bands at one or two key locations with, usually Type 2, monitors measuring overall A-weighted levels at the majority of positions. The use of one or more frequency analyzers at key positions al lows for some frequency anal ysis, although great caution must be exercised with the lower frequency ba nds, as discussed later, since wind-induced false signal noise is largely inevitable and the low frequency result s cannot be taken at face value. Fortunately, this phenomenon doe s not significantly affect the measurement of A-weighted sound levels, however. The use of 1/3 octave band analyzers is largel y essential for surveys that, for one reason or another, must be conducted during summ ertime conditions when insect, frog or cicada noise is present. Measurements taken under these unfavorable conditions can be \"corrected\" to a certain extent by smoothing the high end of the frequency spectrum, where this kind of noise is usually obvious, a nd then recalculating the overall A-weighted sound level as shown in the (generic) example below. 46 / 004609 Frequency Spectrum Smoothed to Approximately Eliminate Contaminating Noise at 2 and 4 kHz 01020304050607080 6.3 Hz 8.0 Hz 10 500 Hz 630 Hz 800 Hz 1.0 kHz 1.25 kHz 1.6 kHz 2.0 kHz 2.5 kHz 3.15 kHz 4.0 kHz 5.0 kHz 6.3 kHz 8.0 kHz 10.0 kHz12.5 kHz 16.0 kHz 20.0 kHz dBA dBC 1/3 Octave Band Center Frequency, HzSound Pressure Level, dBAs-Measured Spectrum Estimated Spectrum without ContaminationCorrected A and C-wtd Levels Figure 5.1.8.2 Of course, this correction w ould be laborious to perform for thousands or even just dozens of measurements so it is usually necessary to determine a t ypical correction, such as the -7 dBA adjustment that resulted in the example above, and apply that to all periods when this noise was apparently present. Th is is, of course, an imperfect remedy and the best policy is to avoid, if possible, measuri ng under these circumstances in the first place. A solution to this common problem is currently being proposed by Hessler 33 and Schomer34 in the form of a modified A-weighted network, termed \"Ai-weighting\", where all of the measured sound above 1000 Hz, or the 1250 Hz 1/3 octave band, is disregarded in situations where insect noi se is present and an adjust ed A-weighted sound level is calculated from the truncated spectrum. 5.1.9 Wind-induced Microphone Distortion One of the principal errors in measuring wi nd turbine noise is fa lse signal noise from wind blowing through the windscreen and ove r the microphone tip, which is manifested in the form of artificially elevated sound leve ls in the lower freque ncy bands. Taken at face value any measurement made in modera tely windy conditions will ostensibly indicate relatively high levels of low frequency noise, irre spective of whether a wind turbine is present or not. This measurement error is probably one of the principal reasons wind turbines are mistakenly believed to produce high, if not harmful, levels of low frequency and infrasonic noise. 47 004610 Some degree of distortion is essentially in evitable in any measurement taken above ground level when the wind is blowing, even when using an extra-large windscreen. It is in an effort to minimize this error that the IEC 61400-11 test procedure prescribes measuring on a reflective plate at ground leve l, where the wind speed is theoretically, although often not actually, zero. As previously mentioned, this ground plate technique is fine for short-term, attended measurements but is impractical for long-term surveys due to the potential for rain or melted snow to damage the microphone. Consequently, for lengthy compliance and evaluation surveys it is necessary to measure above ground level using a large, weather-treated windscreen - perhaps augmented with a very large secondary windscreen, although the practicality of such devices is questionable in harsh winter conditions. Because environmental sound measurements of most other sources apart from wind turbines are not generally conducted in windy conditions as mandated by applicable standards, the significance and even existen ce of this measurement error has long gone unnoticed. Although this phenomenon and its physical basis were theorized decades ago by Strasberg 35,36 it is only fairly recently that its relevance to wind turbine sound measurements has been examined in detail a nd quantified. In particular, the subject of wind generated self-noise was thoro ughly reviewed in 2006 by van den Berg37 where he showed that the magnitude of the distortion depends not only on the mean incident wind speed but also on the amount of atmosphe ric turbulence present at the microphone position (largely a function of the local su rface roughness) and on atmo spheric stability. Measurements taken at 1 or 2 m above a smooth surface during stable, nighttime atmospheric conditions, when the surface wind s are usually light, generally contain the least amount of self-generated noise ultimat ely replicating the case where the principal noise generation mechanism is wake turbulence trailing off the windscreen. In other less ideal circumstances self-noise levels can be developed by estimating the local surface roughness and atmospheric turbulence factor, , from wind speed measurements at two heights and/or from observations of cloud cover, time of day, general wind conditions, or meteorological data, if available. The minimum level of false-signal noise due to wind, excluding the e ffect of atmospheric turbulence, can be estimated based on an em pirical wind tunnel study carried out by Hessler and Brandst\u00e4tt in 2008 38 in which conventional \u00bd\" microphones fitted with an array of common windscreens and were su bjected to known wind velocities in a massively silenced wind tunnel. The meas ured sound levels duri ng each test were essentially a direct measure of the false-signa l noise - although for more or less laminar flow conditions corresponding to an outdoor setting with a ve ry low surface roughness in neutral atmospheric conditions. Nevertheless, for the specific windscreens examined it is possible to generally estimate both the overall A-weighted or un- weighted (dBZ) sound level of the distortion from the microphone heig ht wind speed and then subtract it from the total measured level to largely reverse the error. An example is shown in Figure 5.1.9.1 where th e overall A-weighted le vel of self-noise is calculated as a function of wind speed and subtracted from the as-measured sound 48 004611 level. The plot is a three day detail of a wind turbine survey where oversized 175 mm (7\") diameter treated windscreens (ACO M odel WS7-80T) were used. This particular windscreen was found to be the best performer, in terms of minimizing wind-induced self-noise, in the wind tunnel study. As-Measured Design L90 Background Sound Level Compared to Level Corrected for Wind-induced Microphone Self Noise 175 mm (7\") Windscreen TimeSound Pressure Level, dBA 03691215 Wind Speed at Microphone Height, m/sAs-Measured Level Corrected LevelSelf-Noise Level for WS7-80T Wind Speed Figure 5.1.9.1 This figure shows the very typi cal result, at least where extr a-large windscreens are used, that the correction is insignificant and can be essentially neglected when it comes to A- weighted sound levels. This is because with a large windscreen the distortion is confined to the very lowest frequencies where it has almost no impact on the A-weighted sound level. With a conventional 75 mm (3\") windscreen, on the other hand, wind-induced noise begins to become significant in the mid-frequency region, between about 63 and 400 Hz, where it has much more influence on the A-weighted sound level. Consequently, standard windscreens are not re commended for this type of survey and windscreens with a minimum diameter of 7\" are recommended for wind turbine field work. The empirical wind tunnel study results fo r 175 and 75 mm treated windscreens are shown below. 49 004612 Self-Generated Noise Levels (dBA) as a Function of Wind Speed for 75 and 175 mm Treated Windscreens y = 28.273Ln(x) - 6.8736 R2 = 0.999 y = 28.692Ln(x) - 17.447 R2 = 0.9995 0102030405060708090100 11 0 1 00Wind Speed at Microphone, m/sSound Pressure Level, dBAACO WS1-80T 75 mm Treated, dBA ACO WS7-80T 175 mm Treated, dBA Log.

In a neutral atmosphere, which occurs at higher wind speeds (> 6 m/s at 10 m height) or in very clouded conditions, the wind-induced level might be anywhere from 5 to 9 dB higher than the leve ls shown above. After sunset, when the atmosphere is more prone to be stable, the wind-induced noise levels will be more similar to the values given above. 5.1.10 Correction for Background Noise Once a design L A90 background sound level has been developed from averaging the data collected at the off-site proxy positions it can then be su btracted in the usual logarithmic mannerd from the levels measured at each of the on-site positions to deduce the project- only sound level. However, th is correction process is only relevant to samples recorded while the turbines were actually in opera tion and not necessarily to all samples; consequently, the data must be sifted to i gnore all periods of calm winds. This can be accomplished by dealing only with data sets collected above the effective cut-in wind speed for the turbine model in question (b earing in mind whether that wind speed is measured at 10 m or hub height ) or, more preferably, by comp aring the measured data to a time history of project elec trical output obtained from th e SCADA, or project control system. For this latter option it is best to compare the oper ational output of the 2 or 3 units closest to each on-site measurement position rather than the total project output because this not only accurately defines the on and off times at each monitoring station but also may reveal, the fairly common occurre nce, that certain units were temporarily down for maintenance or due to some unexpected malfunction. The relevance of this, of course, is that the measurements of proj ect noise during this period would not have captured the maximum possible sound level. Because the proxy background level is, for practic al reasons, an inexact estimation of the site-wide background level, there will usually be instances when the background level exceeds the total measured level at certain on-site positions. Under this circumstance, and when the background level is below but w ithin 3 dB of the total level, the project- only sound level would normally be considered indeterminate. While the calculation of d Lp Project = 10 log [10^(Lp Total/10) - 10^(Lp Background /10)], dBA 51 I I ~-I I===:=== I I I I I I 004614 the project-only sound level is mathematica lly possible when th e background level is below but within 3 dB of the total level, doi ng so tends to create spurious mathematical artifacts where the project le vel can be estimated at unrealistically lo w and obviously incorrect sound levels. Since mo st standards, such as ISO 374639, essentially disallow this calculation it is best to follow that policy here as well. 5.1.11 Typical Test Results and Com parison to Model Predictions Representative examples from typical test positions within two different wind projects using two different turbine models and located in two different states are discussed below as a way of illustrating the outcome of the test methodology outlined above. Example 1 The first example is from a test position at a re sidence within a project in a rural area in the Eastern United States where the turbines and homes are thoroughly mixed together - a common situation in this region and the Midw est. This location is surrounded in nearly all directions by a number of turbines at va rious distances, the clos est being about 490 m (1600 ft.) away from the home with anothe r 10 lying within a 1500 m (4900 ft.) radius. The terrain is gently rolling hills with a mixt ure of open fields and wooded areas. Mild complaints about noise had been received by th e project from the residents of this home, which is the primary reason it was se lected as a monitoring position. The overall test results from a two week measurement survey in terms of the total measured level at the test point, the design background level derived from proxy positions and the normalized 10 m wind speed, are shown in Figure 5.1.11.1. This is same test position that was previously disc ussed in conjunction with Figure 5.1.8.2 and L Aeq sound levels. 52 004615 As-Measured LA90 vs. Time at Test Position Compared to Proxy LA90 Background Sound Level and Wind Speed 0102030405060 7/10/12 12:00 7/11/12 0:00 7/11/12 12:00 7/25/12 0:00 7/25/12 12:00 Time and DateSound Pressure Level, dBA 0369121518 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/sA-D Local Noise Events ABCD Test Position Background Wind Speed Figure 5.1.11.1 Although the raw results may app ear unintelligible at first gl ance, a closer look reveals that the design background level (developed from an average of three off-site measurement positions) and the sound level at the test position both ge nerally parallel the wind speed indicating that the measured levels are due to wind-induced sounds associated with the natural environment in the first case and to both natural and wind turbine sound in the second. As expected, the on-site leve l at the position surrounded by almost a dozen turbines is usually substantia lly higher than the background whenever a moderate wind is blowing and, also as expected, the on-site le vel is similar to the background during calm conditions when the project is not operating. It is the difference between these two levels during windy conditions that essentially constitutes and quantifies the no ise impact of the project. As is evident from the plot, it is an ever-chang ing dynamic situation where the project sound level variously exceeds the background by anywhere from 0 to 10 dBA. This figure graphically points up the inadequacy of attempting to determine the project's noise emissions from a few short-term manne d samples. The greatest differentials between the on- and off-site level tend to occu r at night but it is im portant to note that while the project level may be quite a bit higher than th e background, the sound level at the receptor point often remains very low in absolute terms with unadjusted raw levels commonly in low to mid 30's dBA. Taking these test resu lts through the next steps of co rrecting the on-site level for background noise and parsing out the low wind periods when the project was idle 53 004616 produces the following plot where the nominal project-only sound level is shown as a function of time over the survey period. Derived Project-Only Sound Level After Correction for Background Noise and Project Down Times at Test Position Compared to Wind Speed Overall Survey Period 0102030405060 7/10/12 12:00 7/11/12 0:00 7/11/12 0:00 12:00 Time and DateSound Pr essure Level, dBA 024681012 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/s Wind SpeedMeasured - Project-Only Figure 5.1.11.2 In terms of magnitude the proj ect apparently generates sound levels ranging from 30 to 49 dBA at this location, depending largely but not only on wind speed. The fact that the project sound level does not exactly parallel the wind speed (which was derived from high elevation, rotor height anemometers) indi cates that other atmospheric factors play a significant role in determining exactly how loud the project is at this location at any given moment. What Figure 5.1.11.2 is technically showing is the baseline - L A90 - project sound level that is consistently present during each 10 minute measurement period. This means that somewhat higher sound level excursions la sting a few seconds to a few minutes are possible, if not probable, but it is not practical to capture the moment to moment variation over the lengthy survey period needed to ad equate evaluate long-term project sound levels. However, comparing these results to model predictions based on the turbine sound power level indicates that the L A90 approach does not inadvertently underestimate project levels, as might be suspected. Figure 5.1.11.3 plots the modeled project sound level at this test position (using the procedures outlined in Section 4.1) against the measured project-only sound level. For clar ity a detail of a re presentative three day period from the third to the sixth day of the survey is shown. 54 I I I 004617 Project-Only LA90 Sound L evel Corrected for Backgr ound at Test Position Compared to Modeled Sound L evel and Wind Speed Detail: 3 Day Period of Fairly High Winds Wind Speed at 10 m, m/s Wind SpeedMeasured Modeled Figure 5.1.11.3 The modeled level is derived using a curve-fit polynomial function based on the predicted project sound level at integer wind sp eeds, which in turn is based on the turbine sound power level at those wind speeds taken directly from an IEC 61400-11 field test report. In general, the plot shows that the model predicti on, based solely on the turbine's sound power level at specific wind speeds, provides a reasonably good approximation of the actual observed sound level. Example 2 The second example is from a site in the Midwes tern United States where the turbines are again intermixed with scattered homes and farms in a rural setting. This particular test location was adopted in respons e to, what turned out to be understandable, complaints about noise from a participant's \"own\" turbin e that had been sited at the unfortunate distance of only 180 m (600 ft.) from the house. The raw test results are summarized in Figure 5.1.11.4. 55 004618 As-Measured LA90 vs. Time at Test Position Compared to Proxy LA90 Background Sound Level and Wind Speed 010203040506070 2/24/09 12:00 2/25/09 0:00 2/25/09 12:00 0:00 Time and DateSound Pr essure Level, dBA 036912151821 Wind Speed, m/sLocal Noise Event Wind SpeedTest Position Background Figure 5.1.11.4 In this instance, the total sound level at the house is consistently a nd not surprisingly well above the background level develo ped from four off-site monitoring stations, meaning that much of the time background noise was larg ely insignificant, if not inaudible. The corrected project-only sound leve l for a three day windy period near the beginning of the survey is shown below comp ared to model predictions. 56 004619 Project-Only LA90 Sound Level Corrected for Background at Test Position Compared to Modeled Sound Level and Wind Speed Detail: 3 Day Period of Fairly High Winds 0102030405060 2/25/09 0:00 2/25/09 2:00 2/25/09 and DateSound Pressure Level, dBA 0369121518 Wind Speed at 10 m, m/s Wind SpeedModeled Measured Figure 5.1.11.5 In this instance, as with Example 1, the predicted level intertwines with the measured level, sometimes over-estimating, sometimes un derestimating but generally capturing the mean project sound level. The variation above and below the predicte d level is largely a measurement of how all other factors beyond the simple wind speed are affecting the total sound level perceived at this location. One of these factors may be unique to the turbine model used at this site, which, ba sed on other surveys a nd observations, appears to have a tendency to produc e sound levels in excess of the manufacturer's stated performance in high wind conditions, which ma y be part of the reason the actual level significantly exceeds the expected levels in the second half of this sample period. This same departure between the pred icted and measured levels also appears in the regression analysis below for the entire survey pe riod where the project-only sound levels are plotted as a function of wind speed. 57 004620 Regression Analysis of Measured Project-Only Sound Level vs. Normalized Wind Speed 0510152025303540455055606570 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 01 11 2 Wind Speed at 10 m above Ground L evel, m/sSound Pressure Level, dBA Model Prediction at Key Integer Wind Speeds Figure 5.1.11.6 Good agreement with the mean trend is ev ident up to about 9 m/s but not beyond it. These two examples are presented to illustra te the outcome of the test methodology and are generally representative of the typical re sults obtained at a number of test positions over a number of such surveys. That is not to say, however, that the method is infallible and that mismatches between measured and predicted levels will ne ver be found. Testing wind turbine noise is challenging and inherently imprecise because the sound sources themselves and the propagation of sound from them to a given point of interest is dependent on the environment in general and amorphous wind and atmospheric conditions in particular. 5.1.12 Interpretation of Test Resu lts Relative to Permit Limits The regression plot above (Fi gure 5.1.11.6) exhibits the typical behavior where there is a scatter to the test re sults and the project sound level is not a perfectly fixed quantity at a given wind speed. This is an unavoidable consequence of the nebulous atmospheric conditions mentioned above. The question that this raises, however, is how to interpret the results of the survey relativ e to the absolute, or in some cases relative, noise limits contained in planning consent or permit conditions. Excursions, sometimes very substantial excursions, above the mean proj ect sound level are inev itable and under all normal circumstances it would be a complete im possibility to design and lay out a project so that the sound level never exceeded a spec ific value at a partic ular point or, more realistically, at a large number of residences within the vici nity of the project.

Consequently, the possibility, even lik elihood, that project noi se will occasionally spike for short periods should be factored in to regulatory limits. That this issue is not addressed in current laws or limits pertaining to wind turbines is simply a result of the understandable fact that few are awar e that it is even an issue. As a suggestion, it seems reasonable to conclude that a project is in compliance with an absolute regulatory limit if the measurements indicate that the proj ect-only sound level is lower than the stated limit at least 95% of the time, taking that number from the commonly used statistical c onfidence interval. 5.2 Single Site Investigations In addition to evaluating operational sound leve ls on a project-wide basis with regard to regulatory compliance, it is sometimes necessa ry to carry out dedi cated field surveys, usually in response to complaints, that ar e focused only on a specific point. Although each of these situations is cer tainly unique, the general test approach outlined above can generally be applied with the exception that more resources can be brought to bear on understanding the project sound level at that particular location. 5.2.1 General Test Design The general test set up for a diagnostic or investigative sound surv ey at a single point would follow the procedures described for a s ite-wide test in terms of survey length, equipment and measurement technique with the following enhancements. The primary measurement position will be ou tside the residence or point of interest where it is usually prudent to use multiple instruments for redundancy and/or increased functional capability. For example, it is highly desirable to measure the overall A- weighted sound level, the frequency content in 1/3 octave bands and to store audio recordings whenever an appropriate trigger level is reached. While all three of these things can be achieved by some instruments, it would be safer to us e the 1/3 octave band analyzer to store numerical data and use a second instrument to store both back-up A- weighted data and the audio files. In any case, having multiple instruments can also allow for additional time resolutions (besid e the standard 10 minute periods) to be recorded at the same time; 1 minute or 1 hour data, for instance. In addition to the sound recording equipment a weathe r station recording wind speed at microphone height, wind direction and rainfall, among other comm on parameters, should be set up nearby. The specific measurement position should be at a location with exposure to all of the nearest turbines or at a place that replicates the exposur e of the residence to the project but is removed from any sources of local contaminating noise (HVAC equipment, farm machinery, human activities, etc.). 59 004622 As with a more general survey, the background level is still of just as much concern so 2 to 3 proxy background measurement positions s hould be found in opposite directions that are remote from any turbines and, in this pa rticular case, replicate as closely as possible the setting of the principal test location in terms of terrain, exposure to wind and exposure to other noise, such as from a road. The principal and proxy background positions above will theoretically determine what the project sound level is at th e residence but may not indicat e why it is. To this end several additional monitoring stations clos e to the 3 or 4 nearest turbines are recommended that are ideally located in line with the principal position at the standard IEC 61400-11 test distance of the hub height plus half the rotor diameter (typically around 125 m, or 400 ft.). A hypo thetical test set up involv ing four nearby turbines is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1. Figure 5.2.1.1 Note that several of the intermediate positions ar e slightly off the direct sight line to keep them in open and reasonably accessible areas. Although this hypothetical example was conveniently conducive to this test set up, additi onal complications are likely to arise; in particular access to private pr operty, which may call for some creativity in designing the 60 Ideal Measurement Positions For a Single Location Diagnostic Survey -\u00ad Hypothetical Example 004623 test layout. Nevertheless, the idea is to ga uge the individual contri bution from all of the nearest units over a variety of wind directions and weather conditions to determine if the problematic noise levels are pr incipally associated with perhaps one unit or a particular set of wind conditions. Moreover, the pr incipal purpose for measuring the noise emissions of all the nearest units is to be able to estimate the actual sound power level of each unit and analytically calculate, by m eans of a simple spreadsheet model, or modeling software, the total sound level at the house for comparison to the measured level there. This approach allows the i ndividual contribution fr om each unit to be quantified for different conditions and also he lps confirm, in a manner independent from the proxy monitoring approach, how much of the received signal at the principal measurement location is due to the projec t and how much is background noise. In addition, the sound power level of each unit can be informally checked against the manufacturer's warranty value. While the ground board technique specified in IEC 61400-11 is not practical for long- term, unattended measurements - mainly because of concern about rain - a comparable, if somewhat less rigorous, result can be obtained from measur ing at 1 m above grade by placing the microphone or monitor on a tripod or temporary post at the appropriate distance. In Figure 5.2.1.2, for example, measurements were made simultaneously at 1 second resolution with a microphone on a ground plate and with two additional microphones at 1 and 2 m above it. The averag e and consistent differential between both above ground positions and the microphone on the reflective plate was 2.7 dB, which is close to the ideal 3 dB differen tial that one would expect. 61 004624 Simultaneous Measurements 125 m from Turbine on Reflective Ground Plate and at 1 and 2 m above Level, dBATurbine Operating Turbine Operating Turbine Shutdown Ground Level 1 and 2 m above Ground Level A verage Differential 2.7 dB Figure 5.2.1.2 This example illustrates that it is possibl e under certain circumstances to reasonably measure the apparent A-weighted turbine sound power level above ground level without serious degradation due to wind distortion. Of course, this ma y not be true when it is particularly windy at 1 m a bove ground level. Another po tential complication arises when multiple turbines are in unusually close proximity to each other, as they are in Figure 5.2.1.1, and background noise or cross-c ontamination from one unit to another must be taken into account in such cases. In general, however , the only substantive modification to the IEC 61400-11 process for cal culating sound power level would be to change the constant \"6\" to \"3\" in Eqn. (9) of the standard since above ground measurements are being used. As suggested by Figure 5.2.1.2, an additional tool th at is normally useful and practical for single site investigations is to temporaril y shutdown, for 10 to 20 minutes, the nearest turbines to the point of interest, if not all those that could conceivably be affecting the sound level there, in order to obtain direct measurements of the background level so the project-only level can be derived with some confidence from the operational sound levels occurring just before or afte r the shutdown. A short-duration shutdown helps ensure that the wind and weather conditions are essentially identical for both the on and off measurements. This technique also offers a way of verifyi ng the validity of the levels measured at the off-site background positions. It is usually during the times of peak noise that it is most desirable to have an exact measurement of project's sound level, since 62 004625 these are the noise levels that most likely engendered the complaint in the first place. Consequently, it becomes a matter of either being there when these conditions occur, which is frequently at night, to organize the shutdown - or pu tting control over the shutdown in the hands of the resident who can call in by pre-arrangement to the control room if and when the noise becomes objecti onable in terms of its overall magnitude and/or begins to exhibit some adverse charac ter, such as from amplitude modulation. Although this latter approach of allowing th e resident identify the time of maximum noise has been used successfully to quantify the overall magnitude of project noise and its frequency content in 1/3 octave bands, one must really be on hand to manually measure amplitude modulation, since it calls for the us e of an extremely fi ne time resolution, on the order of milliseconds, to capture the sound oscillations that normally have a period of roughly 1 second. Such manual measurements can be taken indoors, wh ere this kind of noise is most often observed to be ob jectionable, as well as outdoors. Only with attended measurements it is possibl e, and then only occasionally, to measure indoor sound levels in any kind of meaningf ul way because contaminating noises can be observed and, hopefully, factored out. Long-term monitoring is effectively limited to the outdoors for the fundamental reason that ther e is no way to ascertain the background sound level inside of a dwelling at a particular time with the project operating. This is because the background sound level indoors is dr iven by a unique set of seemingly minor but significant sound sources that cannot be replicated by a proxy measurement position. Indoor background sound levels are partially a function of the outdoor conditions, particularly when it is windy or raining, but are also driven by such things as air flow from the heating and air conditioning system, appliances, computers and, of course, human activity even when it is in a distant pa rt of the house. These usually very minor sounds are significant because the intruding noise level from the project is often very low or extremely low in terms of the A-weighted sound level. For exampl e, it would not be unusual for a project sound level to be in the vicinity of 30 dBA inside of the house (perhaps being in the 40 to 45 dBA range outdoors). The successful measurement of the project-only sound level would then require the indoor background level to be 20 dBA or less, which is usually not the case. Sound leve ls in a bedroom at night are commonly at least 30 dBA even when no wind project is present. In any event, it is sound level outside of dwellings that is norma lly (but not always) restricted by regulations or permit conditions and this leve l can typically be measured with the long-term monitoring methodology described above. 63 004626 References 1 ISO 10494:1993, Gas turbines and gas turbine sets - Meas urement of emitted airborne noise - Engineering/survey method, International Standards Organi zation, Geneva, Switzerland, 1993. 2 ISO 3746:1995, Acoustics - Determination of sound pow er levels of noise sources using sound pressure - Survey method using an enveloping measurement surface over a reflecting plane, International Standards Organi zation, Geneva, Switzerland, 1993. 3 ANSI S12.9-1992/Part 3 (R2008), American National Standard Q uantities and Procedures for Description and Measurement of Environmental So und.

O'Neala), Robert D. Hellweg Jr.b)and Richard M. 2010; Revised: 7 January 2011; Accepted: 8 January 2011) A common issue raised with wind energy developers and operators of utility- scale wind turbines is whether the operation of their wind turbines may createunacceptable levels of low frequency noise and infrasound. In order to answerthis question, one of the major wind energy developers commissioned a scienticstudy of their wind turbine fleet. The study consisted of three parts: 1) a world-wide literature search to determine unbiased guidelines and standards used toevaluate low frequency sound and infrasound, 2) a eld study to measure windturbine noise outside and within nearby residences, and 3) a comparison of theeld results to the guidelines and standards. Wind turbines from two differentmanufacturers were measured at an operating wind farm under controlledconditions with the results compared to established guidelines and standards.This paper presents the results of the low frequency noise and infrasound study.Since the purpose of this paper is to report on low frequency and infrasoundemissions, potential annoyance from other aspects of wind turbine operationwere not considered, and must be evaluated separately. \u00a9 2011 Institute of Noise Control Engineering. Primary subject classication: 14.5.4; Secondary subject classication: 21.8.1 1 INTRODUCTION Early down-wind wind turbines in the US created low frequency noise; however current up-wind wind turbines generate considerably less low frequencynoise. Epsilon Associates, Inc. (\"Epsilon\") wasretained by NextEra Energy Resources, LLC(\"NextEra\"), formerly FPL Energy, to investigatewhether the operation of their wind turbines may createunacceptable levels of low frequency noise and infra-sound. This question has often been posed to NextEra,and other wind energy developers and operators ofutility-scale wind turbines. NextEra is one of theworld' s largest generators of wind power with approxi-mately 7,600 net megawatts (MW) in operation as ofJuly 2010. The project was divided into three tasks: 1) literature search, 2) eld measurement program, and 3) compari-son to criteria. Epsilon conducted an extensive litera-ture search of the technical and scientic literature onthe effects of low-frequency noise and infrasound and existing criteria in order to evaluate low-frequencynoise and infrasound from wind turbines. Aftercompletion of the literature search and selection of criteria, a eld measurement program was developed tomeasure wind turbine noise to compare to the selectedcriteria. The frequency range 20-20,000 Hz is commonly described as the range of \"audible\" noise. The frequencyrange of low frequency sound is generally from20 Hertz (Hz) to 200 Hz, and the range below 20 Hz is often described as \" infrasound\". However, audibility extends to frequencies below 20 Hz. Low frequency sound has several denitions. Ameri- ANSI/ASA S12.2 1and ANSI S12.9 Part 42have provisions for evaluating low frequency noise, and these special treatments applyonly to sounds in the octave bands with 16, 31.5, and63-Hz mid-band frequencies. For these reasons, in thispaper on wind turbine noise, we use the term \"lowfrequency noise\" to include 12.5 Hz-200 Hz with emphasis on the 16 Hz, 31 Hz and 63 Hz octave bandswith a frequency range of 11 Hz to 89 Hz. International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 60050-801:1994 \"infrasound\"a s \"Acoustic oscillations whose frequency is below thelow frequency limit of audible sound (about 16 Hz).\"This denition is incorrect since sound remains audible at frequencies well below 16 Hz pro vided that the sound level is sufciently high. In this paper we dene infra-sound to be below 20 Hz, which is the limit for thestandardized threshold of hearing.

J. 59(2), March-April 2011 135 004630change in hearing at 20 Hz, the division into \"low-frequency sound\" and \"infrasound\" should only beconsidered \"practical and conventional.\" 2 EFFECTS AND CRITERIA OF LOW FREQUENCY SOUND AND INFRASOUND We performed an extensive world-wide literature search of over 100 scientic papers, technical reports and summary reports on low frequency sound andinfrasound\u2014hearing, effects, measurement, and crite-ria. Leventhall 4presents an excellent and comprehen- sive study on low frequency noise from all sources andits effects. The Leventhall report also presents criteriain place at that time, which does not include some ofthe more recently developed ANSI/ASA standards onoutdoor environmental noise and indoor sounds. The United States government does not have specic criteria for low frequency noise. The US EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) has guidelines for the protec-tion of public health with an adequate margin of safetyin terms of annual average A-weighted day-nightaverage sound level (L dn), but there are no corrections or adjustments for low frequency noise. The USDepartment of Transportation (DOT) has A-weightedsound pressure level criteria for highway projects andairports, but these do not have adjustments for lowfrequency noise. The following sections describe thelow frequency and infrasound criteria to which windturbine sounds are compared in later sections. 2.1 Threshold of Hearing and Audibility Moeller and Pedersen5present an excellent summary on human perception of sound at frequenciesbelow 200 Hz. The ear is the primary organ for sensing infrasound. Hearing becomes gradually less sensitive fordecreasing frequencies. But, humans with a normal hearing organ can perceive infrasound at least down to afew hertz if the sound level is sufciently high. The threshold of hearing is standardized for frequen- cies down to 20 Hz 6. Based on extensive research and data, Moeller and Pedersen propose normal hearingthresholds for frequencies below 20 Hz; however, theirproposed threshold is higher than that obtained by Watanabe and Moeller 7. To be conservative, we have used the data from Watanabe and Moeller7for the region below 20 Hz. (See Fig. 1.) Moeller and Pedersen5suggest that the curve for low frequency thresholds for normal hearingis \"probably correct within a few decibels, at least in mostof the frequency range.\" The hearing thresholds show considerable variabil- ity from individual to individual with a standard devia-tion among subjects of about 5 dB independent of frequency between 3 Hz and 1000 Hz with a slight increase at 20- 50 Hz. This implies that the audibilitythreshold for 97.5% of the population is greater than thevalues in Fig. 1 minus 10 dB and for 84% of the popula-tion is greater than the values in Fig. 1 minus 5 dB.Moeller and Pedersen suggest that the \"pure-tone thresh-old can with a reasonable approximation be used as for the thresholds also for [low frequency]non-sinusoidal sounds\" 5; ISO 226 has thresholds for frequencies at and above 20 Hz and approximatelyequates the thresholds and equal loudness contours fornon-sinusoidal sounds to those in the standard forsinusoidal sounds 6. As frequency decreases below 20 Hz, if the noise source is tonal, the tonal sensation ceases. Below 20 Hztones are perceived as discontinuous. Below 10 Hz it ispossible to perceive the single cycles of a tone, and theperception changes into a sensation of pressure at the ears.020406080100120 4 5 6.3 8 10 12.5 16 20 25 31.5 40 50 63 80 100 125 160 One-Third Octave Band Center Frequenc y,H zSound Pressure Level, dBISO 226: Average Watanabe and Moeller: Average Fig. 1\u2014Low frequency average threshold of hearing from ISO 2266and Watanabe and Moeller7. 136 Noise Control Eng. the dynamic range of the auditory system decreases with decreasing frequency, and the compressed dynamic range has an effect on equalloudness contours: a slight change in sound level canchange the perceived loudness from barely audible toloud. This combined with the large variation in individualhearing may mean that a low frequency sound that isinaudible to some may be audible to others, and may berelatively loud to some of those for whom it is audible.Loudness for low frequency sounds grows considerablyfaster above threshold than for sounds at higherfrequencies 5. Non-auditory perception of low frequency and infra- sound occurs only at levels above the auditory thresh-old. In the frequency range of 4-25 Hz and at \" levels 20-25 dB above [auditory] threshold it is possible to feel vibrations in various parts of the body, e.g., the lumbar, buttock, thigh and calf regions.

Ranges of theDNL are outlined, within which a specic region ofcompatibility may be drawn. These ranges take intoconsideration the noise reduction in sound level fromoutside to inside buildings as commonly constructed inthat locality and living habits there. There are adjust-ments to day-night average sound level to account forthe presence of low frequency noise, and the adjust-ments are described in ANSI S12.9 Part 4, which use asum of the sound pressure levels in octave bands withcenter frequencies of 16, 31 and 63 Hz. ANSI S12.9/Part 4 identies two thresholds: annoy- ance is minimal when the 16, 31.5 and 63 Hz octave band sound pressure levels are each less than 65 dB andthere are no rapid fluctuations of the low frequencysounds. The second threshold is for increased annoyancewhich begins when rattles occur, which begins at L LF 70-75 dB. LLFis 10 times the logarithm of the ratio of time-mean square sound pressure in the 16, 31.5, and63-Hz octave bands divided by the square of the referencesound pressure. The adjustment procedure for low frequency noise to the average annual A-weighted sound pressure levelin ANSI S12.9/Part 4 uses a different and more compli-cated metric and procedure (Equation D.1) than thoseused for evaluating low frequency noise in roomscontained in ANSI/ASA S12.2. (See Sec. 2.3). Sincewe are evaluating low frequency noise and not A-weighted sound levels, we do not recommend usingthe procedure for adjusting A-weighted levels. Insteadwe recommend using the following two guidelinesfrom ANSI S12.9/Part 4: a sound pressure level of65 dB in each of the 16-, 31.5-, and 63 Hz octave bandsas an indicator of minimal annoyance, and 70- 75 dB forthe summation of the sound pressure levels from thesethree bands as an indicator of possible increased annoy-ance from rattles. 2.3 ANSI/ASA S12.2\u2014Evaluating Room Noise ANSI/ASA S12.2-20081discusses criteria for evalu- ating room noise, and has two separate provisions forevaluating low frequency noise: (1) the potential tocause perceptible vibration and rattles, and (2) meetinglow frequency portions of room criteria curves. Sincethe ANSI S12.2 criteria are for indoor sounds, in orderto determine equivalent outdoor criteria for comparisonto outdoor measurements, data from Sutherland 9and Hubbard and Shephard10were used to determine typical noise reductions from outdoor to indoor withwindows open. (The Appendix of this paper describesthe noise reductions used to determine equivalentoutdoor criteria to indoor criteria.) Table A1 presentsoctave band noise reductions applied in this evaluationalong with the average low frequency octave bandnoise reductions from outdoor to indoors from Refs. 9 and 10 for open and closed windows. Table A2 presentsthe one-third octave band noise reductions applied inthe analysis that were determined in the same mannerusing data from the same references. Vibration and Rattles: Outdoor low frequency sounds of sufcient amplitude can cause building wallsto vibrate and windows to rattle. Homes have lowvalues of transmission loss at low frequencies, and lowfrequency noise of sufcient amplitude may be audiblewithin homes. Window rattles are not low frequencynoise, but may be caused by low frequency noise.ANSI/ASA S12.2 presents limiting levels at lowfrequencies for assessing (a) the probability of clearly perceptible acoustically induced vibration and rattles inlightweight wall and ceiling constructions, and (b) theprobability of moderately perceptible acoustically induced vibration in similar constructions. The limitingsound pressure levels in the octave bands with centerfrequencies of 16, 31.5 and 63 Hz are presented in Table 1. Applying the outdoor to indoor attenuations for wind turbine sources with windows open given in thelast row of Table A1 to the ANSI/ASA S12.2 indoorsound pressure levels in Table 1 yields the equivalent Noise Control Eng.

Room Criteria Curves: ANSI/ASA S12.2 has three primary methods for evaluating the suitability of noisewithin rooms: a survey method\u2014A-weighted soundlevels, an engineering method\u2014noise criteria (NC)curves, and a method for evaluating low-frequencyfluctuating noise using room noise criteria (RNC)curves. ANSI/ASA S12.2 states \"The RNC methodshould be used to determine noise ratings when thenoise from HV AC systems at low frequencies is loudand is suspected of containing sizeable fluctuations or surging.\" [emphasis added] The NC curves are appro-priate to evaluate low frequency noise from windturbines in homes since wind turbine noise does nothave signicant fluctuating low frequency noise suf-cient to warrant using RNC curves and sinceA-weighted sound levels do not adequately determineTable A1\u2014Average low frequency octave band home noise reductions from outdoor to indoors in dB (from Ref. 9 and 10).

The recom-mended NC and RNC criteria for schools and privaterooms in hospitals are the same.

ANSI/ASA S12.2 also presents a method to deter- mine if the levels below 500 Hz octave band are too high in relation to the levels in the mid-frequencies whichcould create a condition of \"spectrum imbalance\". Themethod for this evaluation is: \u007f Calculate the speech interference level (SIL) for the measured spectrum.

Infra-sounds slightly above detection threshold may causeperceptual effects but these are of the same character asfor 'normal' sounds. Reactions caused by extremelyintense levels of infrasound can resemble those of mildstress reaction and may include bizarre auditory sensa-tions, describable as pulsation and flutter\" 12. 2.4.2 The UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) The report prepared by the University of Salford for the UK Department for Environment, Food, and RuralAffairs (DEFRA) on low frequency noise proposedone-third octave band sound pressure level L eqcriteria and procedures for assessing low frequency noise13.T h e guidelines are based on complaints of disturbance fromlow frequency sounds and are intended to be used byEnvironmental Health Ofcers. Existing low frequency noise criteria from several countries were reviewed and experiences with lowfrequencies complaints were considered in developingthe proposed guidelines. The criteria are \"based on5 dB below the ISO 226 average threshold of audibility for steady [low frequency] sounds.\" However, the DEFRAcriteria are at 5 dB lower than ISO 226 only at20-31.5 Hz; at higher frequencies the criteria are equal to the Swedish criteria which are higher levels than ISO226 less 5 dB. For frequencies lower than 20 Hz, DEFRAuses the thresholds from Ref. 7 less 5 dB. The DEFRA criteria are based on measurements in an unoccupied room, and it was noted by a practicingconsultant that measurements should be made withwindows closed 14. However, we conservatively used windows open conditions for our assessment to deter-mine equivalent outdoor criteria since the DEFRAmeasurement procedure does not explicitly statemeasurements are with windows closed. If the lowfrequency sound is \"steady\" then the criteria may be relaxed by 5 dB. A low frequency noise is considered steady if either L 10-L90/H110215 dB or the rate of change of sound pressure level (Fast time weighting) is less than10 dB per second in the third octave band which exceedsthe criteria by the greatest margin. Applying indoor to outdoor one-third octave band transfer functions for open windows (as presented inTable A2 from analysis of data in Refs. 9 and 10) yieldsequivalent one-third octave band sound pressure level proposed DEFRA criteria for outdoor sound levels.Table 6 presents the indoor DEFRA proposed criteriafor non-steady and steady low-frequency sounds.

It was noted that traditional Japanese houses haverelatively light-weight and sensitive windows andpartitions 16. Table 8 presents the Japanese reference outdoor one-third octave band sound pressure level values forguidance in dealing with complaints of rattling fromenvironmental sounds from 5 Hz to 50 Hz. From10 Hz to 50 Hz the guidance levels are equal to theobserved threshold of rattles from two studies with a totalof 78 samples. However, for the bands centered at 5, 6.3and 8 Hz, the reference values are several dB lower thanthe supporting data contained in these two studies 15.A t 5 Hz, the lowest observed window rattle was at 74 dB inone study and 79 dB in another; at 6.3 Hz, rattles startedat 74 dB in the rst study and at 78 dB in the second; andat 8 Hz, window rattle started at 74 dB in the rst studyand 77 dB in the second study. Thus the reference valuesat 5, 6.3 and 8 Hz in Table 8 are conservative in compari-son to the other values by 4, 3, and 2 dB respectively. Table 9 presents the Japanese reference one-third octave band sound pressure level values for guidance indealing with complaints of mental and physicaldiscomfort from environmental sounds when evaluatedindoors. Evaluation measurements are to be performedwith windows closed to the outside. The values in Table9 are less stringent than the DEFRA values in Table 6for non-steady sounds but more stringent than theDEFRA values for steady sounds in some one-thirdoctave bands. In order to obtain equivalent outdoorsound levels, the average noise reduction from windturbine noise with windows closed from Ref. 10 wasapplied to the Japan reference values. Table 9 presentsthe Japanese indoor reference values, the noise reduc-tions for windows closed 10and the equivalent outdoor reference values. These equivalent outdoor values areless stringent than the equivalent outdoor DEFRAvalues in Table 7 for both non-steady sounds and steadysounds except for the 80 Hz band in which the Japanese level is 1 dB more stringent than the DEFRA level forsteady sounds. 2.4.4 C-weighted minus A-weighted LpC-LpA... indicate that the difference in C-weighted and A-weighted sound pressure levels canbe a predictor of annoyance. Leventhall states that if/H20849L pCLpA/H20850is greater than 20 dB there is \"a potential for a low frequency noise problem.\" He further states that/H20849L pCLpA/H20850cannot be a predictor of annoyance but is a simple indicator that further analysis may be needed. Thisis due in part to the fact that the low frequency noise maybe inaudible even if /H20849L pCLpA/H20850is greater than 20 dB. 3 LITERATURE REVIEW The authors performed an extensive literature search of over 100 scientic papers, technical reports andsummary reports on low frequency sound andinfrasound\u2014hearing, effects, measurement, and crite-ria. The following paragraphs briefly summarize thendings from some of these papers and reports. 3.1 Leventhall Leventhall4presents an excellent study on low frequency noise from all sources and its effects. Thereport presents criteria in place at that time andincludes data relating cause and effects. Leventhall 17 reviewed data and allegations on alleged problemsfrom low frequency noise and infrasound from windturbines, and concluded the following: \"It has beenshown that there is insignicant infrasound from windturbines and that there is normally little low frequencynoise.\" \"Turbulent air inflow conditions causeenhanced levels of low frequency noise, which may bedisturbing, but the overriding noise from wind turbinesis the fluctuating audible swish, mistakenly referred toTable 8\u2014Japan Ministry of Environment Guidance for evaluating complaints of low frequency noise: Ref- erence one-third octave band sound pressure level values for complaints of rattling.

Other studies have shown thatwind turbine generated infrasound levels are belowthreshold of perception and threshold of feeling andbody reaction. 3.2 DELTA The Danish Energy Authority project on \"low frequency noise from large wind turbines\" comprises aseries of investigations in the effort to give increasedknowledge on low frequency noise from windturbines 18. One of the conclusions of the study is that wind turbines do not emit audible infrasound, withlevels that are \"far below the hearing threshold.\"Audible low frequency sound may occur both indoorsand outdoors, \"but the levels in general are close to thehearing and/or masking level.\" \"In general the noise inthe critical band up to 100 Hz is below both thresholds\". The nal report notes that for road trafc noise (in thevicinity of roads) the low frequency noise levels arehigher [than wind turbine] both indoors and outdoors. 3.3 Hayes McKenzie Partnership Hayes McKenzie Partnership Ltd performed a study for the UK Department of Trade & Industry (DTI) toinvestigate complaints of low frequency noise thatcame from three of the ve farms with complaints outof 126 wind farms in the UK 14. The study concluded that: \u007f Infrasound associated with modern wind tur- bines is not a source which will result in noiselevels that are audible or which may be injuri-ous to the health of a wind farm neighbor. \u007f Low frequency noise was measureable on a few occasions, but below DEFRA criteria. Windturbine noise may result in indoor noise levelswithin a home that is just above the threshold ofaudibility; however, it was lower than that of lo-cal road trafc noise. \u007f The common cause of the complaints was not associated with low frequency noise but the oc-casional audible modulation of aerodynamicnoise, especially at night. \u007f The UK Department of Trade and Industry, which is now the UK Department for BusinessEnterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR),summarized the Hayes McKenzie report: \"Thereport concluded that there is no evidence ofhealth effects arising from infrasound or lowfrequency noise generated by wind turbines.\" 19. 3.4 Howe Howe performed extensive studies on wind turbines and infrasound and concluded that infrasound was notan issue for modern wind turbine installations\u2014\"whileinfrasound can be generated by wind turbines, it isconcluded that infrasound is not of concern to thehealth of residences located nearby.\" 20. Since then Gastmeier and Howe21investigated an additional situa- tion involving the alleged \"perception of infrasound byindividual.\" In this additional case, the measuredindoor infrasound was at least 30 dB below the audibil- ity threshold given by Ref. 7 as presented in Fig. 1. 3.5 Branco Branco and other Portuguese researchers have studied possible physiological affects associated withhigh amplitude low frequency noise and have labeledthese alleged effects as \"Vibroacoustic Disease\"(V AD) 22. \"Vibroacoustic disease (V AD) is a whole- body, systemic pathology, characterized by the abnor-mal proliferation of extra-cellular matrices, and causedby excessive exposure to low frequency noise.\"Table 9\u2014Japan Ministry of Environment Guidance for evaluating complaints of low frequency noise: Ref- erence one-third octave band sound pressure level values for complaints of mental and physical discomfort.

Noise levels inaircraft in which V AD has been hypothesized areconsiderably higher than wind turbine noise levels.Hayes also concluded that it is \"unlikely that symptomswill result through induced internal vibration fromincident wind farm noise.\" 23. Other studies have found no V AD indicators in environmental sound that havebeen alleged by V AD proponents 25. 3.6 French National Academy of Medicine In 2006, the French National Academy of Medicine recommended26\"as a precaution construction should be suspended for wind turbines with a capacity exceed-ing 2.5 MW located within 1500 m of homes.\" [em pha- sis added] However, this precaution is not because ofdenitive health issues but because: \u007f Sound levels one km from some wind turbine installations \"occasionally exceed allowablelimits\" for France (note that the allowable limitsare long term averages). \u007f French prediction tools for assessment did not take into account sound levels created withwind speeds greater than 5 m/s. \u007f Wind turbine noise has been compared to air- craft noise (even though the sound levels ofwind turbine noise are signicantly lower), andexposure to high level aircraft noise \"involvesneurobiological reactions associated with an in-creased frequency of hypertension and cardio-vascular illness. Unfortunately, no such studyhas been done near wind turbines.\" 27. In March 2008, the French Agency for Environmen- tal and Occupational Health Safety (AFSSET)published a report on \"the health impacts of noisegenerated by wind turbines\", commissioned by theMinistries of Health and Environment in June 2006following the report of the French National Academyof Medicine in March 2006 28. The AFSSET study recommends that one does not dene a xed minimumdistance between wind farms and homes, but rather tomodel the acoustic impact of the project on a case-by-case basis. One of the conclusions of the AFSSETreport is: \"The analysis of available data shows: Theabsence health consequencesconcerning the auditory effects or specic effectsusually with FIELD PROGRAM Two types of utility-scale wind turbines were studied for this eld program. These two turbines are among the most commonly used in the NextEra fleet: levels for these wind turbine generators (WTGs) vary as a function of wind speed from cut-inwind speed to maximum sound level. Cut-in windspeed for the GE 1.5sle wind turbine is 3.5 m/s w hile the Siemens wind turbine has a cut-in wind speed of4 m / s. Maximum reference sound power levels for theGE 1.5sle and Siemens 2.3-93 are approximately 104 dBand 105 dB respectively as provided by the manufacturer.These sound power levels are reached at electrical outputlevels of approximately 924 kW and 1767 kW for the GE and Siemens units, respectively. Under higher windspeeds, the sound levels from the wind turbines do notincrease although electrical power output does continue toincrease up to the rated power of each wind turbine(1500 kW and 2300 kW respectively). Each wind turbine manufacturer has an uncertainty factor \"K\" of 2 dB to guarantee the turbine' s sound power level. (K accounts for both measurement variationsand production variation 29.) The results presented later in this paper include sound power values which have addedthe manufacturer' s K value to the reference values, that is,2 dB above the expected reference levels for themeasured wind conditions and power output. Real-world data were collected from operating wind turbines to compare to the low frequency noise guide- lines and criteria discussed previously in Sec. 2. Thesedata sets consisted of outdoor measurements at variousreference distances, and concurrent indoor/outdoormeasurements at residences within the wind farm. NextEra provided access to the Horse Hollow Wind Farm in Taylor and Nolan Counties, Texas in November2008 to collect data on the GE 1.5sle and SiemensSWT -2.3-93 wind turbines. The portion of the windfarm used for testing is relatively flat with no signi-cant terrain. The land around the wind turbines is ruraland primarily used for agriculture and cattle grazing.The siting of the sound level measurement locationswas chosen to minimize local noise sources except thewind turbines and the wind itself. Hub height for thesewind turbines is 80 meters above ground level (AGL). Two of the authors collected sound level and wind speed data over the course of one week under a varietyof operational conditions. Weather conditions were drythe entire week with ground level winds ranging fromcalm to 12.5 m/s /H2084928 mph/H20850 over a 1-minute av erage. In order to minimize confounding factors, the data collectiontried to focus on periods of maximum sound levels from Noise Control Eng. J. 59(2), March-April 2011 143 004638the wind turbines (moderate to high hub height winds) and light to moderate ground level winds. Ground level (2 meters AGL) wind speed and direc- tion were measured continuously at one representativelocation. Wind speeds near hub height were alsomeasured continuously using the permanent meteorologi-cal towers maintained by the wind farm. A series of simultaneous interior and exterior sound level measurements were made at four houses ownedby participating landowners within the wind farm. Twosets were made of the GE WTGs, and two sets weremade of the Siemens WTGs. Data were collected withboth windows open and windows closed. Due to thenecessity of coordinating with the homeowners inadvance, and reasonable restrictions on time of day toenter their homes, the interior/exterior measurementdata sets do not always represent ideal conditions.However, enough data were collected to compare to thecriteria and draw conclusions on low frequency noise. Sound level measurements were also made simulta- neously at two reference distances from a string ofwind turbines under a variety of wind conditions.Using the manufacturer' s sound power level data,calculations of the sound pressure levels as a functionof distance in flat terrain were made to aid in decidingwhere to collect data in the eld. Based on this analy-sis, two distances from the nearest wind turbine wereselected\u2014305 meters /H208491,000 feet/H20850 and 457 meters /H208491,500 feet/H20850 \u2014and were then used where possible during the eld program. Distances much larger than 457 meters /H208491,500 feet/H20850 were not practical since an adjacent turbine string could then be closer and affect the measurements,or would put the measurements beyond the boundaries ofthe wind farm property owners. Brief background soundlevel measurements were conducted several times duringthe program whereby the Horse Hollow Wind Farmoperators were able to shutdown the nearby WTGs for abrief /H2084920 minutes/H20850 period. This was done in real time using cell phone communication. All the sound level measurements described above were attended. One series of unattended overnight measurements was made at two locations for approxi-mately 15 hours to capture a larger data set. One measurement was set up approximately 305 meters /H208491,000 feet/H20850 from a GE 1.5sle WTG and the other was set up approximately 305 meters /H208491,000 feet/H20850 from a Siemens WTG. The location was chosen based on thecurrent wind direction forecast so that the sound levelequipment would be downwind for the majority of themonitoring period. By doing this, the program was able tocapture periods of strong hub-height winds and moderateto low ground-level winds. All sound levels were measured using two Norsonic Model Nor140 precision sound analyzers, equippedwith a Norsonic-1209 Norsonic-1225 a A co-Pacic WS7. The instrumen-tation meets the \"Type 1\u2014Precision\" requirements setforth in American National Standards Institute (ANSI)S1.4 for acoustical measuring devices 30. The microphone was tripod-mounted at a height of 1.5 meters (ve feet) above ground. The measurements included simultaneouscollection of broadband (A-weighted) and one-third-octave band data ( 3.15 hertz to 20,000 hertz bands). Sound level data were primarily logged in 10-minute intervals to be consistent with the wind farm' s Supervi-sory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systemwhich provides electrical power output (kW) in10-minute increments. A few sound level measurements were logged using 20-minute intervals for use in deter- mining home transmission loss values. The meters werecalibrated and certied as accurate to standards set by theNational Institute of Standards and Technology. Thesecalibrations were conducted by an independent laboratorywithin the past 12 months. G round level wind speed and direction were measured with a HOBO H21-002 microweather station (Onset Computer Corporation). The winddata were sampled every three seconds and logged everyone minute. 5 RESULTS AND COMPARISON TO CRITERIA Results from the eld program are organized by wind turbine type. For each wind turbine type, resultsare presented per location type (outdoor or indoor) withrespect to applicable criteria. Results are presented for305 meters /H208491,000/H20850 feetfrom the nearest wind turbine. Data were also collected at 457 meters /H208491,500 feet/H20850 from the nearest wind turbine which showed lower soundlevels. Therefore, wind turbines that met the criteria at305 meters also met it at 457 meters. Data were collected under both high turbine output and moderateturbine output conditions (dened as sound power levels 2or 3 dB less than the maximum sound power levels), andlow ground-level wind speeds. The sound level data underthe moderate conditions were equivalent to or lower thanthe high turbine output scenarios, thus conrming theconclusions from the high output cases. None of theoperational sound level data were corrected forbackground noise. A-weighted sound power levelspresented in this section (used to describe turbine opera-tion) were estimated from the actual measured poweroutput (kW) of the wind turbines and the sound powerlevels as a function of wind speed plus an uncertaintyfactor K of 2 dB. Outdoor measurements are compared to criteria for audibility, for UK DEFRA disturbance using equiva-lent outdoor levels, for rattle and annoyance criteria as 144 Noise Control Eng.

This site was actually part of astring of 15 WTGs, four of which were within 610 meters/H208492,000 feet/H20850 of the monitoring location. Representative sound level data from two 10-minute periods are presented herein and include contributions from all windturbines as measured by the recording equipment. Onedata set is representative of time periods with lowfrequency sound level values near the maximummeasured and the other data set is representative of themean. The standard deviations for the low frequencyone-third octave band levels for the six measurementperiods were between 0.2- 0.7 dB. The key operationaland meteorological parameters during these two measure-ment periods are listed in Table 10. Figure 2 plots the one-third octave band sound levels /H20849L eq/H20850for both samples of high output conditions. The results show that infrasound is inaudible to even the mostsensitive people 305 meters /H208491,000 feet/H20850 from these wind turbines (more than 20 dB below the median thresh-olds of hearing). Low frequency sound above 40 Hz maybe audible depending on background sound levels. Figure 3 plots the one-third octave band sound levels /H20849L eq/H20850for both samples of high output conditions. The low frequency sound was \"steady\" according to DEFRAprocedures, and the results show that all outdoor equiva-lent DEFRA disturbance criteria are met. Figure 4 compares the one-third octave band sound levels /H20849L eq/H20850for both samples of high output conditions to the Japan Ministry of Environment levels for evaluatingcomplaints on rattle. The rattle criteria is met at allfrequencies except at 5 Hz where the mean value is 1 dB(standard deviation of 0.4 dB) higher than the Japaneseevaluation value. When one considers that the 5 Hz soundlevel is 3 dB lower than the observed threshold of rattle,one concludes that the Japanese criteria are met.

The sound level data presented herein include contributions from all wind turbines asmeasured by the recording equipment. The key opera-tional and meteorological parameters during thesemeasurements are listed in Table 11.

Thesound level meter was located in the center of the room. Figure 6 plots the indoor one-third octave band sound levels /H20849L eq/H20850for Home \"A\". The results show that infrasound is inaudible to even the most sensitive peopleapproximately 1,000 feet from these wind turbines withthe windows open or closed (more than 20 dB below themedian thresholds of hearing).

Although not shown in Fig. 7, the one-third octave band levels meet the Japan Ministry of Environmentcriteria for evaluating complaints of mental and physi-cal discomfort since in the frequency range of theJapan criteria both samples meet the more stringentDEFRA criteria for \"non-steady\" sounds, which ismore stringent than the Japan criteria. Figure 8 plots the indoor 16 Hz to 125 Hz octave band sound levels /H20849L eq/H20850for Home \"A\".

Table A1 presents the average low frequency octave band noise reductions from outdoorto indoors from these two papers for open and closedwindows. Sutherland only reported values down to63 Hz; whereas Hubbard and Shepherd presented valuesto less than 10 Hz. The closed window conditions of Ref.10 were used to estimate noise reductions less than 63 Hzby applying the difference between values for open andclosed windows from Ref. 9 data at 63 Hz. It should benoted that the attenuation for wind turbines in Ref. 10 isbased on only three homes at two different wind farms,whereas the trafc and aircraft data are for many homes.The wind turbine open window values were determinedfrom the wind turbine closed window values by subtract-ing the difference in values between windows closed andopen obtained by Ref. 9. To be conservative, we use the open window case instead of closed windows except for the adjustmentsto the Japanese guideline which specically called forclosed windows. To be further conservative, we use thewind turbine noise reduction data in Ref. 10 (adjustedto open windows). However, it should be noted that it ispossible for some homes to have some slight ampli- cation at low frequencies with windows open due to possible room resonances. The average one-third octave band noise reductions used to determine equivalent outdoor one-third octaveband criteria were determined in a similar manner. Therst row of Table A2 and Fig. 20 present the averageone-third octave band noise reductions values forwindows open that were used to determine the equiva- lent outdoor one-third octave band criteria levels inTable 7 from the indoor criteria. The second row ofTable A2 and Fig. 19 presents the one-third octave bandnoise reductions for windows closed determined byRef. 10 for homes exposed to wind turbine sounds\u2014these higher closed window noise reduction valueswere only used to determine equivalent outdoor levelsfor determining the equivalent Japanese guidanceone-third octave band sound pressure level values fordealing with complaints of mental and physicaldiscomfort from environmental sounds. 9 REFERENCES 1. \"American National Standard Criteria for Evaluating Room Noise\", American National Standards Institute ANSI/ASA S12.2-2008, Acoustical Society of America, (2008). 2. \"American National Standard Quantities and Procedures for Description and Measurement of Environmental Sound\u2014Part4: Noise Assessment and Prediction of Long-term CommunityResponse\", American National Standards Institute ANSI S12.9-2005/Part 4, Acoustical Society America, Geoff Leventhall, \"A Review of Published Research on Low Frequency Noise and its Effects\", Report for Department forEnvironment, Food, and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, (2003). 5.
