The truck carried precious cargo: boxes of the [very first COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/how-the-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-was-hobbled). With a flourish, DeSantis signed the FedEx manifest. \"Today, we will have shots going in arms,\" he proudly declared. At the time, Republicans across the country were eager to share credit for a singular feat in President Donald Trump's otherwise disastrous handling of the pandemic: the record-speed development of COVID-19 vaccines that offered hope of a return to normal life. By the end of last year, however, DeSantis's vaccine cheerleading was a distant memory. On December 13, almost exactly two years after the FedEx delivery, he petitioned the Florida Supreme Court to let him empanel a statewide grand jury to investigate COVID-19 vaccine makers, particularly Pfizer and Moderna. \"It is against the law to mislead and misrepresent, particularly when you're talking about the efficacy of a drug,\" DeSantis said, comparing the vaccine push to the profiteering that drove the deadly opioid epidemic. In January, the grand jury went to work looking for dark intent or false claims behind the lifesaving vaccines. It is slated to report its findings by January 2024. That would be just in time to potentially influence the outcome of the Republican presidential primaries, in which DeSantis is widely seen as a leading challenger to Trump, even though he hasn't yet officially declared his candidacy. DeSantis's probe has experts worried that vaccine skepticism could become an official plank of GOP policy. \"The worst-case scenario is if it becomes a litmus test in the [presidential] primary,\" says Saad B. Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health who has served on numerous US government vaccine advisory committees. \"Then all bets are off.\" \"It's All Political People\" DeSantis, by all accounts a savvy politician, is clearly aware that anti-vaccine sentiment has surged among rank-and-file Republicans. Even a former senior Trump official who worked on Operation Warp Speed, the program that successfully accelerated vaccine development, acknowledges that DeSantis's anti-vax 180 is \"good politics.\" Trump himself has drawn boos at his rallies when he mentions the vaccines. \"There is a whole contingent of the GOP that don't like vaccines,\" the former official says. Those familiar with DeSantis's inner circle say his vaccine stance is indeed driven by politics, not science. \"There's no medical people involved in this,\" someone with knowledge of DeSantis's advisers says. \"It's all political people. Now a couple of those TV doctors, those people are in his orbit, but this is not engineered by the scientific side of the house.\" His goal, insiders say, is to tack to Trump's right and peel off anti-vaxxers whose votes could prove decisive in the Republican presidential primaries next year. In his new book, The Courage to Be Free, DeSantis [attempts to paint Trump as a passive actor](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/opinion/ron-desantis-donald-trump-courage-free.html) in the early days of the pandemic, standing by as Dr. Anthony Fauci, then director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, controlled the public health response. \"As the iron curtain of Faucism descended upon our continent, the State of Florida stood resolutely in the way,\" DeSantis writes, doubling down on his ideological about-face. (Governor DeSantis's office did not respond to detailed questions seeking comment. Through a spokesperson, Fauci declined to comment.) DeSantis has recruited a host of doctors who are helping him disparage federal health agencies and platform concerns about vaccine safety. Leading the pack is his handpicked surgeon general, Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo, who has recommended against the COVID-19 vaccine for children and claimed, in a widely debunked study, that Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines elevate the risk of cardiac-related deaths in young men. On March 10, the heads of the CDC and FDA rebuked Ladapo for issuing \"misinformation.\" In a joint four-page [public letter,](https://www.fda.gov/media/166159/download) they wrote, \"It is the job of public health officials around the country to protect the lives of the populations they serve, particularly the vulnerable. Fueling vaccine hesitancy undermines this effort.\" While DeSantis's strategy may be rooted in politics, it is likely to have far-reaching public health repercussions, says Dr. Jonathan Howard, an associate professor of neurology and psychiatry at NYU Langone Health. \"You're going to continue to see Republicans dying [from COVID-19] at a higher rate, and a return of measles and whooping cough and God knows what else,\" says Howard, who has studied the anti-vax movement for a decade. Ladapo's office declined to make him available for an interview but, in response to a detailed list of questions, sent a series of links to his public statements. The Anti-vax Evolution Vaccine skepticism is nothing new. For years, it brewed on the political left, says Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist and acting chair of the FDA's COVID-19 Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Affluent California mothers pursuing an organic lifestyle and \"trendy West Siders in New York,\" he says, embraced debunked claims about the links between childhood vaccinations and autism. These views [have long been stoked by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-became-anti-vaxxer-icon-nightmare) a progressive environmental lawyer turned anti-vaccine crusader. For a brief moment in the fall of 2020, such views seemed relegated to the dustbin, as the whole world anxiously awaited protection from COVID-19. Trump himself was so desperate for a presidential win that he waged an all-out pressure campaign to get the [FDA to approve Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine before the election](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/01/how-trumps-covid-chaos-drowned-the-fda-in-junk-science). The FDA's beleaguered commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, [vowed that he would resist](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/trumps-vaccine-rush-vs-the-fda) any effort to approve a vaccine before it had been properly reviewed. The state of California was so concerned about a prematurely approved vaccine that it formed its own safety review board, to essentially shadow the FDA review process. Pfizer's COVID vaccine was approved by the FDA after the election, in December 2020. In Florida, with its elderly and medically vulnerable population, DeSantis became a ubiquitous vaccine advocate. On January 9, 2021, he boasted that his state was the first in the nation to begin vaccinating residents and staff of long-term care facilities. And Florida became one of the first states to enlist pharmacists to offer the shots. In the wake of the contentious 2020 election, however, an anti-vax fire began to flicker\u2014and then rage\u2014on the right. In July 2021, the Delta variant of the virus caused a wave of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals, fundamentally shifting federal health officials' understanding of the vaccine's protectiveness. It did not block transmission, as hoped, but rather offered strong protection against hospitalization and death. In response, right-wing influencers began questioning the vaccine's value, as well as the sincerity of experts who seemed to have overpromised and under-delivered. At the same time, the Biden administration, in a singularly focused effort to increase vaccinations, mandated the shots for federal employees, and encouraged other employers to issue mandates as well. This was framed on the right as a form of quasi-dictatorial overreach. The stage was set for an explosion, and it came amid the prospect of pediatric vaccinations. In early 2022, as the FDA's advisory committee began evaluating the COVID-19 vaccines for approval in children under five, Monto was so besieged by belligerent anti-vaccine messages that he was forced to filter his email and forward his office phone calls. Compared with some countries, the US takes a strikingly transparent approach to reviewing and monitoring vaccine development. The FDA advisory committee holds public hearings, and reports of side effects and other poor outcomes are publicly available in a database called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The anti-vax community has leapt on that transparency, taking raw data and lone reports out of context to falsely claim causation and discredit the vaccines, say a number of experts. By early 2022, the vaccine anger from the right was notable, says Monto. \"A party which used to be in favor of vaccines, probably even more than the Democratic Party, turned it around so they espouse all sorts of data for their own purposes,\" he says. According to a recently completed survey of almost 10,000 Americans conducted by the health data analytics firm Surgo Health, Republicans around the country are now 2.4 times more likely than Democrats or independents to believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe. The survey, whose not-yet-published results were exclusively obtained by Vanity Fair, also found that Republicans are more susceptible to pandemic-related conspiracy theories. They are twice as likely to believe that COVID was \"caused by a ring of people who manipulate world events\" and 1.9 times likelier to believe that a tracking chip may be implanted in a COVID vaccine. \"We Want Them Infected\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University economist and health policy expert, has a different idea about who's to blame for the rise of anti-vax sentiment on the right. \"The people playing with fire are the [CDC], who pushed vaccine mandates when it made no epidemiological sense,\" he says, citing the vaccines' inability to block transmission and, in turn, end the pandemic. \"They are the ones responsible for the vaccine skepticism we see.\" In October 2020, Bhattacharya achieved notoriety in public health circles when he and two coauthors published an open letter called [the Great Barrington Declaration,](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/great-barrington-declaration/) which criticized the COVID-19 lockdowns and argued instead for \"focused protection.\" The letter, [sponsored by a libertarian think tank](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/organisers-of-anti-lockdown-declaration-have-track-record-of-promoting-denial-of-health-and-environmental-risks/) called the American Institute for Economic Research, recommended isolating and protecting the vulnerable and elderly, while letting the young and healthy live normally. Allowing infections among the less vulnerable would speed the path to herd immunity, the authors argued. Immediately controversial, the let 'er rip strategy, as critics called it, came to the attention of President Trump via a radiologist named Scott Atlas, whom Trump had seen on Fox News and recruited as an adviser. Atlas, in turn, invited Bhattacharya and Ladapo, who was not yet Florida surgeon general, to meet Trump in the Oval Office. A Trump appointee within the Department of Health and Human Services [famously characterized a herd immunity approach](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408) in an email to colleagues, writing of the healthy, \"We want them infected.\" In August 2020, two months before the Great Barrington Declaration appeared, an official with Florida's Department of Education called Bhattacharya to ask if he would serve as an expert witness in a case brought by Florida's largest teachers' union. DeSantis wanted to force the state's schools to offer some in-person instruction during shutdowns, and the union was fighting back. Bhattacharya accepted, and became a key member of DeSantis's unorthodox COVID-19 brain trust. With their guidance, DeSantis charted a path for Florida that rejected pandemic restrictions and embraced vaccinating the elderly first. \"This was someone who knew the literature and was willing to contact experts who were not on the inside,\" says Bhattacharya. \"That is the way he governs.\" A former Florida official who worked with DeSantis went further, saying, \"He's very smart, like Elon Musk smart. He's like a computer. He can gobble up information. He can recite that information. He's read all the data.\" Most infectious disease experts view the let 'er rip approach as extremely dangerous. COVID-19 is far from harmless in unvaccinated people, even those who are young and healthy, says Dr. Mark Kline, physician in chief at Children's Hospital New Orleans. While many children with COVID will be \"sick at home with the sniffles,\" he says, [CDC data show](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination) that unvaccinated children ages 12 to 17 with COVID are 14 times more likely than their vaccinated counterparts to be hospitalized. Since the pandemic's start, Kline's medium-sized hospital has admitted 587 children with COVID-19. Twelve have died. Among those was a 15-year-old who died of respiratory and cardiac failure within 24 hours of admission. \"All of the deaths we've had have been among the unvaccinated,\" says Kline. By contrast, the hospital has not treated a single child for a vaccine-related adverse event. Extensive data [collected since the two mRNA vaccines were authorized](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2800743) \"shows very conclusively that vaccines are safe and effective and makes clear that vaccinating children against COVID is the responsible thing to do,\" he says. \"You'd be hard-pressed to find a pediatrician out there in opposition to COVID vaccinations.\" The scientists who do oppose vaccinating children, he adds, \"are not people who take care of kids.\" In March 2022, just two weeks after Ladapo was confirmed as surgeon general, Florida became the only state not to recommend pediatric COVID-19 vaccines. In a press release, Ladapo said the risks of vaccinating healthy children \"may outweigh the benefits.\" Florida also became the only state not to preorder COVID-19 vaccines for children. It is hard to predict the overall impact of Florida's decisions, says Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee of Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Do parents \"trust Ron DeSantis more than they trust their pediatrician? I don't think so,\" he says. Nevertheless, \"it has become a deeply held belief for a lot of people that these COVID-19 vaccines are somehow bad.\" This widespread distrust is reflected in the low uptake of pediatric COVID-19 vaccines. In Florida, only 11.8% of people five and up are fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19\u2014lower even than the nationwide average of 17.4%, according to CDC data. Florida's stance on pediatric vaccines sets a dangerous precedent, says Peter Hotez, codirector of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. \"No one state has the intellectual horsepower to make those complicated assessments on illness in children. There are reasons to have a federal government. To have individual states going rogue really endangers that state's population.\" Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University and author of [Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,](https://wwnorton.com/books/strongmen) sees DeSantis's COVID-19 policies as part of his effort to use Florida as a testing ground for an American model of autocracy. Wearing a mask or getting vaccinated are acts of collective caretaking, she says. \"Autocrats want to turn everyone against each other. They don't want you to have solidarity. They want radical individualism. It makes people paranoid of the federal government. The real goal is to elevate their own [power and judgment].\" \"A Lot of Integrity\" In April 2019, DeSantis nominated Dr. Scott Rivkees to be Florida's surgeon general. When DeSantis interviewed him for the job, \"we talked about the importance of childhood vaccination,\" says Rivkees, who is now a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health. \"It was recognized as an important pillar of public health.\" At the end of September 2021, however, Rivkees left and Ladapo, a Harvard Medical School graduate and associate professor at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, was brought in. Ladapo had already gained notoriety for his critiques of school closures and \"fear-fueled policy making\" in the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere. In July 2020, he had joined a press conference outside the US Supreme Court to oppose lockdowns and mask-wearing, and tout unproven cures for COVID, such as [hydroxychloroquine.](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/internal-documents-reveal-team-trumps-chloroquine-master-plan) The protest was organized by a group called America's Frontline Doctors, whose founder was later convicted of breaking into the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection. In his 2022 book, Transcend Fear: A Blueprint for Mindful Leadership in Public Health, Ladapo credits a segment by Fox News host Tucker Carlson with crystallizing his world view: In short, Ladapo had concluded that the public health decisions made as a novel airborne pathogen surged throughout the world, killing millions and threatening to topple health care systems, resulted from the desire of medical elites to control populations. This rising trope is echoed in the book's foreword, written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in which he describes how \"virtually every doctor in Germany\" during the Third Reich \"participated in Hitler's worst atrocities.\" Starting in February 2022, as Ladapo underwent confirmation hearings, a series of unflattering revelations spilled into view. Among them was a University of Florida faculty committee report which found that his tenure approval had been marred by \"numerous irregularities,\" including a rushed and secretive process in which the university agreed to pay $337,000 of his $437,000 income. Once confirmed, Ladapo began using his perch atop Florida's health department to build a case that the COVID-19 vaccines have undisclosed and undetected safety risks. In October, the department [released a study](https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20221007-guidance-mrna-covid19-vaccines-analysis.pdf) with no named authors, based on an analysis of a small number of death certificates. It claimed that the state had uncovered \"an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination.\" Ladapo used the findings to recommend against young men getting those vaccines. The study was met with widespread condemnation. In a written report, the faculty council committee at the University of Florida accused him of violating research integrity standards, using cherry-picked data, and failing to adjust for the benefits of vaccines. And in its March letter, the heads of the FDA and CDC wrote to Ladapo that \"focusing on adverse events in the absence of causal association and without the perspective of countervailing benefits is a great disservice to both individuals and public health.\" Appearing on Steve Bannon's \"War Room Pandemic\" show, Ladapo accused the CDC of suppressing the kind of data his study highlighted. After calling the CDC \"incredibly corrupt\" and \"bereft of integrity,\" he said that, by contrast, both he and DeSantis \"have a lot of integrity.\" Within a month of the study's release, however, the Florida health department's inspector general received an anonymous complaint alleging that Ladapo had manipulated data to arrive at its conclusion, as [Politico was the first to report.](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/22/florida-joe-ladapo-investigated-covid-report-00084075) Ladapo denied the allegations, and the inspector general closed its probe after the complainant failed to follow up. DeSantis's grand jury petition to investigate COVID vaccine makers cites Ladapo's study as an important piece of evidence. It accuses pharmaceutical companies of falsely claiming that the vaccines would block transmission of the virus rather than merely mitigate its effects. \"It is likely that individuals and companies with an incentive to do so created these perceptions for financial gain,\" the grand jury petition states. \"Malignant Contrarianism\" Last year, DeSantis put Ladapo in charge of what he calls a [public health integrity committee](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/12/meet-ron-desantis-new-public-health-integrity-committee/): seven doctors and scientists tasked with determining whether federal public health guidance is \"tailored for Florida's communities and priorities.\" Bhattacharya is part of the committee, as is his Great Barrington cosigner, a Swedish biostatistician named Martin Kulldorff. There's also an orthopedist, an emergency medicine physician, a former biology professor, a microbiology professor, and a Danish vaccine researcher. Bhattacharya rejects the idea that he and his colleagues have extreme or contrarian views. In fact, he says, their recommendations align with a century of managing respiratory virus pandemics: protect the vulnerable, rapidly develop treatments and vaccines, and disrupt society as little as possible. But critics, he says, have caricatured their positions. \"You say you're against vaccine mandates and all of a sudden, you're a 5G chipper,\" he adds, referring to the conspiratorial claim that vaccines contain microchips for mind control. And yet, some members of the public health integrity committee have touted unproven cures such as hydroxychloroquine and used selective data to question vaccine safety. Four of the seven have had their work published by the Brownstone Institute, a nonprofit think tank set up in May 2021 to counter what it claims are threats to \"freedom and fundamental human rights\" exposed by the global COVID-19 response. Its founder, Jeffrey A. Tucker, who initially helped convene the signers of the Great Barrington Declaration, is an author and self-described \"Victorian liberal\" who has advocated for child labor. In a 2016 blog post in the Foundation for Economic Education, he lamented that bored kids were forced to attend public school instead of experiencing an \"exciting life\" of work \"on the streets, in the factories, in the mines, with adults and with peers, learning and doing.\" In an upcoming book titled We Want Them Infected, NYU's Jonathan Howard chronicles the rise of what he calls \"malignant contrarianism\" among a certain subset of doctors and scientists. Attempting to answer the question \"Why do smart people come to believe crazy things?,\" he concludes, \"They need to be smarter than everyone. If vaccines were banned, [they] would be the loudest voices saying, 'They're suppressing this miracle. No wonder big pharma doesn't want you to know about it.\" Howard says the doctors surrounding DeSantis have vastly underestimated the toll of COVID, particularly in children, and have focused inordinately on vaccine side effects, elevating them to a \"fate worse than death.\" According to Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, the public health establishment is partly to blame for this backlash. The \"absolute refusal to acknowledge any side effects of vaccines\" has led more right-leaning scientists and doctors to emphasize them, he says. \"The public health absolutism of the moment has removed space for disagreement. It empowers people like DeSantis, who is obviously exploiting the situation\" for his own benefit. \"Don't Mention the Vaccines\" To the doctors and scientists who believe that COVID-19 vaccines are somehow a bigger threat than the virus itself, Ron DeSantis's Florida is the tip of the spear in a fight to expose the agenda of public health experts and vaccine makers. \"If not Florida to perform an independent audit, then who?\" says Dr. Robert Malone, a physician and scientist who has publicly criticized the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. MAGA supporters and insiders are increasingly disappointed, meanwhile, with Donald Trump's failure to disavow the vaccines his administration helped develop. Some have gone so far as to wage a pressure campaign to get him to renounce them. Torn between the desire to please his base and the compulsion to take credit for a win, Trump has tried to walk a middle line, bragging about the vaccines but criticizing Biden's imposition of mandates. In a statement last March, he celebrated the publication of a book about Operation Warp Speed, which he said \"tells the story of how my Administration, in record time, delivered vaccines and therapeutics to the American people to fight the China Virus. What we achieved was incredible, but it is sad to see what Biden has done with it (no mandates!).\" According to Jeffrey Tucker of the Brownstone Institute, \"Trump has been warned on multiple occasions, 'Don't mention the vaccines at your rallies. People hate them!'\" Last fall, two employees at a free speech organization, American Priority AMPFest, set out to make a film that would turn Trump against the vaccines. They recruited several doctors whose anti-vax postings had previously caused their social media accounts to be restricted. \"The plan was to produce something and present it to President Trump,\" Alex Phillips, the founder of American Priority, told Vanity Fair. \"A lot of folks in the MAGA movement are not happy with him being so positive about the vaccines in general.\" The filming took place, in part, at the home of Bettina Sofia Viviano, a right-wing filmmaker and political fundraiser from Texas who once hosted a mask-burning bonfire. Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker pulled out of a fundraiser she had planned for him after it emerged that her Twitter profile, which billed her as the \"Hollywood resistance,\" featured four syringes arranged in the shape of a swastika. (Viviano recently took down her Twitter account.) The video intended for Trump's benefit never got made. \"We got a hold of the film and it was really awful,\" says Phillips, adding that the people who worked on it were subsequently dismissed from his company, which is now defunct. Viviano declined to comment. \"This Fringe Group Has Taken Over\" On January 2, a Miami critical care physician named Dr. Natalia Solenkova awoke to a deluge of vitriol in her Twitter mentions. People were angrily responding to a phony tweet, purportedly written by her, that had originated on a Reddit thread. The tweet, which exceeded the character count limit at the time, depicted Solenkova effectively pledging allegiance to a COVID-vaccine death cult. It read: The tweet \"went like wildfire,\" said Solenkova, spread in part by DeSantis adviser Christina Pushaw, who shared it with her 280,000-plus followers. A member of DeSantis's public health integrity committee, Dr. Bret Weinstein, spent 10 minutes dissecting the tweet on Joe Rogan's podcast, claiming that it illustrated the demented mindset of vaccine lovers. Rogan, who never asked Solenkova for comment, later issued an apology and edited the conversation out of the episode. Joe Rogan and Bret Weinstein did not respond to requests for comment. There are \"no degrees of separation\" between DeSantis and the swamp of medical misinformation in Florida, says Solenkova. \"What appears to be happening is this fringe group has taken over DeSantis's COVID policy.\" Solenkova's attorney, Daniel Uhlfelder, is helping her decide whether to pursue legal action against those who targeted her. A former Republican and \"middle-of-the-road guy,\" Uhlfelder switched parties before the pandemic and last year ran for Florida attorney general. (He lost.) In his view, DeSantis poses a unique danger: \"When you're governor of the third largest state, you can legitimize things that don't exist.\" This story has been updated.
