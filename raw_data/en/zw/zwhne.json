The process of awakening is an ever-unfolding one, a deepening of that which is beyond all words and thoughts. We are in service of discovering that for ourselves. I've been hearing a lot of these concerns and it just boggles my mind. I hope I'm not opening myself up to lots of attacks here, but it makes absolutely no sense, IMO, to believe that something man-made can interfere with Spirit or Source or your connection to God, whatever. People have been cultivating their spirituality in the darkest of situations (see: persecuted Jews, Christians, Muslims, basically every religion throughout history) and y'all think a shot is going to disconnect you from God?? It's just bizarre to me and needless fearmongering. I'm not pushing vaccines or anything, your choice how you feel about them, but this just shouldn't even be a reason people consider when they decide whether to get the shot. "}
