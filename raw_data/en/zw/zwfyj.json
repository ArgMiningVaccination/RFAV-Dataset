Autism is a behavioral diagnosis. In order to receive the diagnosis of \"Autism\" a child must exhibit a certain number of behaviors over a certain time frame. If he or she does not do so, the diagnosis of \"autism\" is not warranted. There is no blood test for \"autism.\" \"Autism\" can't be confirmed or \"ruled-out\" by laboratory analysis. It's strictly a behavioral diagnosis. Therefore, anything that causes physiological damage cannot directly \"cause\" autism. Ergo... vaccines cannot \"cause\" \"autism.\" Vaccines cause other stuff. Vaccines cause encephalitis. Vaccines cause seizures. Vaccines cause immune system deficiencies. Vaccines cause gastrointestinal problems. Encephalitis causes mood swings. Encephalitis causes extreme pain. Encephalitis causes inattention and impulsivity. Encephalitis causes aggression. Encephalitis causes balance problems and difficulty relating to one's environment. Seizures cause mood swings. Seizures cause inattention and impulsivity. Seizures cause alterations in conciousness. Immune system deficiencies cause children to have more frequent bacterial infections, such as ear infections, upper respiratory infections (URIs), sinusutis, and strep infections. Immune system deficiencies cause children to have more frequent viral infections, such as stomatitis, \"fevers of unknown origin,\" \"viral rashes,\" hives, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal viruses that cause vomiting and diarrhea. Immune system deficiencies cause children to be more vulnerable to \"everything that's going around\" and to have a tougher time getting over things than their peers. Gastrointestinal damage from vaccines causes diarrhea. Gastrointestinal damage from vaccines causes nausea, reflux, vomiting, and the recently discovered \"disease\" now known as GERD (Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease). Gatrointestinal damage from vaccines causes increased vulnerability to viruses and bacteria, which leads to increased administration of antibiotics, which leads to overgrowth of pathogenic yeast. Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to intestinal hyperpermeability (\"leaky gut syndrome\"). Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to constipation. Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to food allergies. Pathogenic yeast overgrowth leads to skin eruptions, \"drunken, silly behavior,\" inattention and impulsivity, and cravings for bread, sugar, ice cream, milk, and carbohydrates. Technically, vaccines do not cause autism because techincally there is no such thing as autism. Vaccines cause the underlying physical conditions that result in the pain, neurological damage, immune system disorders, gastrointestinal damage, and yeast overgrowth - all of which combine to produce the behavioral symptoms that result in the \"autism\" diagnosis. Gastrointestinal damage is the most obvious result of vaccine damage. When a previously healthy child suddenly starts having multiple episodes of watery and extremely stinky diarrhea every day, and this happens shortly after receiving vaccinations, it is notable as a \"vaccine injury.\" What is not so obvious is that when the child's gut is permanently damaged, he or she is no longer able to absorb nutrients necessary to produce neurotransmitters necessary for proper brain function. So when the child develops mood swings, sleep difficulties, and learning disabilities several months later, these issues are not recognized as being related to the vaccine injury because the initial damage occurred many months earlier. Please re-read the previous paragraph. This is why Dr. Andrew Wakefield is such a threat to the pharmaceutical industry. Dr. Wakefield NEVER said vaccines cause autism. Dr. Wakefield is a gastroenterologist. He saw a number of children with gastrointestinal problems who also happened to be diagnosed with autism. Dr. Wakefield reported his observations. He never claimed that the MMR \"caused\" autism. He merely reported that a number of children he had seen had BOTH gastrointestinal problems AND autism, and according to parental report, these issues developed within a short time of when the children received the MMR vaccine. Again... Why is Dr. Wakefield such a threat to the pharmaceutical industry? Hint: Not because vaccines cause autism - they don't. Vaccines cause gastrointestinal damage. Gastrointestinal damage causes malabsorption of nutrients necessary for proper brain function. Malabsorption of essential nutrients causes immune system disorders, seizures, encephalopathy, etc... and THAT's what leads to the ultimate diagnosis of \"autism.\" If Dr. Wakefield's obervations are correct, SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE will eventually draw the connection between vaccines and the domino-effect that leads to the \"autism\" diagnosis. From the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry, better to \"nip it in the bud\" now, which means discrediting Dr. Wakefield to the extent that no one will look further into the science. Has this ploy worked? Not for me. And not for many of the very intelligent parents I know. Only time will tell if there are enough of us to make a difference.
