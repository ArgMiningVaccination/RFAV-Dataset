The EMA authorization for APEXXNAR is based on evidence from a clinical program in adults, including Phase 1 and 2 trials, and three Phase 3 trials ( [NCT03760146](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F34940806%2F&esheet=52579739&newsitemid=20220215005838&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03760146&index=3&md5=2080ef16e3da43b682e1e561ad256bc6), [NCT03828617](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F34315611%2F&esheet=52579739&newsitemid=20220215005838&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03828617&index=4&md5=4629ba4451157f90232e56c49a8ed39f), and [NCT03835975](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F34839993%2F&esheet=52579739&newsitemid=20220215005838&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03835975&index=5&md5=2368cb07f2387fc534c908e607e5b425)) describing the safety and evaluating the immunogenicity of the vaccine. More than 6,000 adult subjects 18 years and older participated in the three Phase 3 trials, including adults 65 years of age and older. The populations included adults with stable chronic medical conditions, pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve adults, and adults with a history of prior pneumococcal vaccination. About PCV20 PCV20 - known as APEXXNAR in the EU and PREVNAR 20TM in the US -- is that includes capsular polysaccharide serotypes (1, 7F, 9V, U.S. The vaccine also contains capsular invasive (IPD),1,2,3,4,5 and have been associated with high case-fatality rates,6,7,8,9 antibiotic resistance,10,11,12 and/or meningitis.13,14 APEXXNAR contains the broadest serotype coverage of any available conjugate vaccine and helps protect against the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine. On June 8, 2021, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PREVNAR 20, which is the U.S trade name for PCV20, for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia in adults age 18 years or older. Pfizer has recently submitted to the FDA a supplemental Biologics License Application to include data in the PREVNAR 20 prescribing information for adults age 18 years or older regarding [coadministration of PREVNAR 20 with a seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpositive-top-line-results-pfizers-phase-3-study-exploring&esheet=52579739&newsitemid=20220215005838&lan=en-US&anchor=coadministration+of+PREVNAR+20+with+a+seasonal+inactivated+influenza+vaccine.&index=6&md5=aa481bc123b5d178b2e506e8f37099c5) Pivotal Phase 3 studies of the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in infants are expected to read out in the second half of 2022 and, if positive, form the basis of potential regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA later this year. U.S. INDICATIONS FOR PREVNAR 20 - PREVNAR 20 is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, in adults 18 years of age and older - This indication for the prevention of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F is approved under accelerated approval based on immune responses as measured by opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION - PREVNAR 20 should not be given to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of PREVNAR 20 or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine - Some adults with weakened immune systems may have a lower response to PREVNAR 20. Safety data are not available for these groups. Your healthcare provider can tell you if PREVNAR 20 is right for you - In adults 18 years of age and older, the most common side effects were pain at the injection site, muscle pain, fatigue, and headache - Ask your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of PREVNAR 20. Only a healthcare provider can decide if PREVNAR 20 is right for you Please see [full prescribing information](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Flabeling.pfizer.com%2FShowLabeling.aspx%3Fid%3D15428&esheet=52579739&newsitemid=20220215005838&lan=en-US&anchor=full+prescribing+information&index=7&md5=fc704c409fef832e6f4d44994092a9e3) for PREVNAR 20.
