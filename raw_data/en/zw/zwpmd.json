It is thought that the natural swaying motion of the horse induces a pelvic movement in the rider that simulates human ambulation. Also, variations in the horse's movements can prompt natural equilibrium movements in the rider. Hippotherapy is also being evaluated in patients with multiple sclerosis and othe r causes of gait disorders, such as strokes. As a therapeutic intervention, hippotherapy is typically conducted by a physical or occupational therapist and is aimed at improving impaired body function. Therapeutic horseback riding is typically conducted by riding instructors and is more frequently intended as social therapy. It is hoped that the multisensory environment may benefit children with profound social and communication deficits, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. When considered t ogether, hippotherapy and therapeutic riding are described as equine -assisted activities and therapies. This evidence review addresses equine -assisted activities that focus on improving physical functions such as balance and gait. Summary Hippotherapy, also referred to as equine -assisted therapy, describes a treatment strategy that uses equine movement to engage sensory, neuromotor, and cognitive systems to achieve functional outcomes. Hippotherapy has been proposed as a therapy for patient s with impaired walking or balance. For individuals who have cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, or gait and balance disorders other than cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke who receive hippotherapy, the evidence includes systematic revi ews, randomized trials, and case series. Relevant outcomes include symptoms and functional outcomes. Studies in cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and other indications have had variable findings. The randomized trials are generally small and have significant methodologic problems. In the largest randomized trial conducted to date (92 children), which had blinding outcome assessment, hippotherapy had no clinically significant impact on children with cerebral palsy. There are no RCTs showing that hi ppotherapy is superior to alternative treatments for patients with multiple sclerosis. Hippotherapy for other indications has been compared primarily with no intervention and, although some benefits have been seen, it has not been shown to be more effectiv e than other active therapies. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 5/2023 Annual policy review.
