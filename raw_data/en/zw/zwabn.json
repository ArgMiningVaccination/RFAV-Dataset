The paper, \"Age- and education-related effects on cognitive functioning in Colored South African women,\" was published in Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition in March. It quickly drew attention, and outrage, from critics who objected to what they called racist overtones in the work, from the title on down. A journal has issued an expression of concern (EOC) for a paper on a common crop virus after the authors were accused of using competitors' unpublished text and plasmids. Investigations by the journal and the involved institutions \u2014 the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, where the paper's authors are based, and North Carolina State University (presumably, where the accusing group is from) \u2014 were inconclusive, the notice states. Earlier this year, authors retracted a meeting abstract about a diabetes drug, following the revelation that the biotech that funded the trial committed misconduct. The retraction was initiated by corresponding author Itamar Raz, at Hadassah Medical Center in Israel. The journal didn't receive a response from any co-authors who were affiliated with the biotech company, Andromeda, so they were not included in the retraction process. A few months after Hyperion Therapeutics acquired Andromeda's diabetes drug DiaPep277, Hyperion announced it had evidence that some employees of Andromeda had \"engaged in serious misconduct,\" such as using un-blinded data and manipulating the analyses. Two relevant studies on the drug, designed to block the immune response that leads to type 1 diabetes, were retracted last year. Here's the retraction note for the abstract \"Abstracts of the 50th Annual Meeting of the EASD, Vienna 2014. 'Evaluation of DiaPep277\u00ae treatment in type 1 diabetes by integrated analysis,'\" published in the May issue of the journal: Lists are a staple of popular media, so much so that they've earned their own word: listicle. But we've never seen one get retracted before. We weren't sure what metric of inclusion the retraction was referring to, but looking at an archive of the webpage, where the listicle appeared before the publication was taken down, we saw that every person on the list appears to be a man, and almost all of them white. We asked Stuart Thomas, Senior Reporter at Memeburn \u2014 which published the list with a related publication, Ventureburn \u2014 if this was what the publication meant by not \"inclusive enough:\" The editor-in-chief of a theology journal has retracted a paper on South African Christian groups because of \"unsubstantiated statements with potential defamation of character.\" The article, published in 2007 in HTS Teologiese Studies/Theological Studies, discusses \"demanding Christian religious movements\" where the group \"isolates itself from the outside world,\" and leaders influence their followers to \"commit to the high demands of the group under the guise that this is the will and purpose of God,\" according to the paper. The author calls out several groups and leaders by name: The research, which appeared in the Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, had served as the source of the newspaper's statement that the country is \"home to about five million immigrants.\" That figure was later quoted in other media outlets about the issue. The author of an article mapping the genome of an infectious bacterium is pulling the paper because \u2014 well, it wasn't the bacterium she thought it was. Study author Celia Abolnik is retracting her paper in Genome Announcements because it didn't actually map out the DNA of Mycoplasma meleagridis, a bacterium that typically infects turkeys but has recently been found in chickens. The trouble was, the sequence for Mycoplasma meleagridis in the National Institute of Health's DNA database, Genbank, was actually a different variety of bacteria \u2014 Mycoplasma gallinaceum, another scourge of poultry. This paper has been temporarily removed following an expression of concern. First author Assem Malhotra, based at the Department of Cardiology, Frimley Park Hospital and Consultant Clinical Associate to the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, told us the paper was pulled due to a \"technical issue,\" and an \"official explanation\" would be forthcoming. Indeed, just this morning, we received a statement from Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, which publishes the British Journal of Sports Medicine: The research involves DiaPep277, which, as Josh Levy explained here in September, \"would cause the immune system to stop attacking beta cells,\" the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. But Hyperion Therapeutics, which had acquired DiaPep277 developer Andromeda Biotech in June, announced in September that it had uncovered evidence that certain employees of Andromeda Biotech, Ltd., which Hyperion acquired in June 2014, engaged in serious misconduct, including collusion with a third-party biostatistics firm in Israel to improperly receive un-blinded DIA-AID 1 trial data and to use such data in order to manipulate the analyses to obtain a favorable result.
