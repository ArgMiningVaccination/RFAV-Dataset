It is practically insoluble in water; slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; soluble in acetone and chloroform; and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water is greater than 5000. NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg is a metered-dose, manual pump spray unit containing an aqueous suspension furoate monohydrate glycerin, citric acid, benzalkonium chloride, and polysorbate 80. The pH is between 4.3 and 4.9. INDICATIONS Prophylaxis Of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis NASONEX\u00ae is indicated for the prophylaxis of the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Treatment Of Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps NASONEX is indicated for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients 18 years of age and older. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Preparation And Administration Administer NASONEX by the nasal route only. Initial Priming Prior to initial use of NASONEX, the pump must be primed by actuating ten times or until a fine spray appears. The pump may be stored unused for up to 1 week without repriming. Repriming (as needed) If unused for more than 1 week, reprime by actuating two times, or until a fine spray appears. Recommended Dosage For Prophylaxis Of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis The recommended dosage for prophylaxis treatment of nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older is NASONEX 2 sprays (2 sprays deliver a total of 100 mcg of mometasone furoate) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose of 200 mcg). In patients with a known seasonal allergen that precipitates nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, prophylaxis with 2 sprays (2 sprays deliver a total of 100 mcg of mometasone furoate) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose of 200 mcg) is recommended 2 to 4 weeks prior to the anticipated start of the pollen season. Recommended Dosage For Treatment Of Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps The recommended dosage for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults 18 years and older is NASONEX 2 sprays (2 sprays deliver a total of 100 mcg of mometasone furoate) in each nostril twice daily (total daily dose of 400 mcg). A dose of 2 sprays (2 sprays deliver a total of 100 mcg of mometasone furoate) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose of 200 mcg) is also effective in some patients.

Manufactured by: MSD International GmbH (Singapore Branch), Singapore 638414, Singapore. Revised: Jun 2022 SIDE EFFECTS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: - Epistaxis, Ulcerations, Candida albicans Infection, Impaired Wound WARNINGS PRECAUTIONS] - Glaucoma and Cataracts [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression, including Growth Reduction [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Use In Specific Populations] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Allergic Rhinitis Adults And Pediatric Patients 12 Years Of Age And Older In controlled U.S. and international clinical studies, a total of 3210 adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with allergic rhinitis received treatment with NASONEX at doses of 50 to 800 mcg/day. The majority of patients (n=2103) were treated with 200 mcg/day. A total of 350 adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older have been treated for one year or longer. Adverse reactions did not differ significantly based on age, sex, or race. Four percent or less of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse events and the discontinuation rate was similar for the vehicle and active comparators. All adverse reactions (regardless of relationship to treatment) reported by 5% or more of adult and pediatric patients ages 12 years and older who received NASONEX, 200 mcg/day vs. placebo and that were more common with NASONEX than placebo, are displayed in Table 1 below. Table 1: Adult and Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older - Adverse Reactions from Controlled Clinical Trials in Seasonal Allergic and Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (Percent of Patients Reporting) |NASONEX 200 mcg | adverse reactions which occurred in less than 5% but greater than or equal to 2% of adult and pediatric patients (ages 12 years and older) treated with NASONEX 200-mcg/day (regardless of relationship to treatment), and more frequently than in the placebo group included: arthralgia, asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, myalgia, nausea, and rhinitis. Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps Adults 18 Years Of Age And Older In controlled clinical studies, the types of adverse reactions observed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps were similar to those observed in patients with allergic rhinitis. A total of 594 adult patients (ages 18 to 86 years) received NASONEX at doses of 200 mcg once or twice daily for up to 4 months for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The overall incidence of adverse reactions for patients treated with NASONEX was comparable to patients with the placebo except for epistaxis, which was 9% for 200 mcg once daily, 13% for 200 mcg twice daily, and 5% for the placebo. Nasal ulcers and nasal and oral candidiasis were also reported in patients treated with NASONEX primarily in patients treated for longer than 4 weeks. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-marketing period for NASONEX: nasal burning and irritation, anaphylaxis and angioedema, disturbances in taste and smell, nasal septal perforation, and vision blurred. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with NASONEX. Inhibitors Of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Studies have shown that mometasone furoate is primarily and extensively metabolized in the liver of all species investigated and undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. In vitro studies have confirmed the primary role of cytochrome CYP3A4 in the metabolism of this compound. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, mometasone furoate and potentially increase the risk for systemic corticosteroid side effects. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of NASONEX with long-term ketoconazole and other known of coadministration versus the potential risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects. WARNINGS Included as part of the \"PRECAUTIONS\" Section PRECAUTIONS Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis In clinical studies, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients with allergic rhinitis with NASONEX Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/nasonex-drug.htm#AR)]. Candida Infection In clinical studies with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, use of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg should be discontinued and appropriate local or systemic therapy instituted, if needed. Nasal Septum Perforation Instances of nasal septum perforation have been reported following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. As with any long-term topical treatment of the nasal cavity, patients using NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa. Impaired Wound Healing Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred. Glaucoma And Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated in one controlled study of 12 weeks' duration and one uncontrolled study of 12 months' duration in patients treated with NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg at 200 mcg/day, using intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examination. No significant change from baseline was noted in the mean intraocular pressure measurements for the 141 NASONEX-treated patients in the 12-week study, as compared with 141 placebo-treated patients. No individual NASONEX-treated patient was noted to have developed a significant elevation in intraocular pressure or cataracts in this 12-week study. Likewise, no significant change from baseline was noted in the mean intraocular pressure measurements for the 139 NASONEX-treated patients in the 12-month study and again, no cataracts were detected in these patients. Nonetheless, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including instances of wheezing may occur after the intranasal administration of mometasone furoate monohydrate. Discontinue such reactions occur [see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/nasonex-drug.htm#CI)]. Immunosuppression Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in nonimmune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globin (VZIG) may exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infection of the respiratory tract, or in untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral infections, or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effect Hypercorticism And Adrenal Suppression When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of NASONEX Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. Effect On Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving NASONEX Nasal Spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including NASONEX Nasal Spray, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use In Specific Populations]. Patient Counseling Information Local Nasal Effect Patients should be informed that treatment with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg may be associated with adverse reactions which include epistaxis (nose bleed) and nasal septum perforation. Candida infection may also occur. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Patients should be cautioned not to spray NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg directly onto the nasal septum. Glaucoma And Cataracts Patients should be informed that nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Patients should be cautioned not to spray NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg into the eyes [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Immunosuppression Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles, and patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Use Regularly For Best Effect Patients should use NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg on a regular basis for optimal effect. Improvement in nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis has been shown to occur within 1 to 2 days after initiation of dosing. Maximum benefit is usually achieved within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of dosing. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physician if symptoms do not improve, or if the condition worsens. Administration to young children should be aided by an adult. If a patient missed a dose, the patient should be advised to take the dose as soon as they remember. The patient should not take more than the recommended dose for the day. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility In study in Sprague Dawley rats, mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically significant increase in the incidence of tumors at inhalation doses up to 67 mcg/kg (approximately 1 and 2 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose [MRDID] in adults [400 mcg] and children [100 respectively, on a mcg/m2 basis). In a 19-month carcinogenicity study in Swiss CD-1 mice, mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically significant increase in the incidence of tumors at inhalation doses up to 160 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRDID in adults and children, respectively, on a mcg/m2 basis). Mometasone furoate increased chromosomal aberrations in an in ovary-cell assay, but did not increase chromosomal aberrations in in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay. Mometasone furoate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or mouse-lymphoma assay, and was not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay and a rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay a mouse male germ-cell chromosomal aberration assay. Mometasone furoate also did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in vivo in rat hepatocytes. In reproductive studies in rats, impairment of fertility was not produced by subcutaneous doses up to 15 mcg/kg (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis). Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg, like other corticosteroids, should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic, as opposed to physiologic, doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. In addition, because there is a natural increase in corticosteroid production during pregnancy, most women will require a lower exogenous corticosteroid dose and many will not need corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy. In mice, mometasone furoate caused cleft palate at subcutaneous doses (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis). Fetal survival was reduced at approximately 2 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis. No toxicity was observed at less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis. In rats, mometasone furoate produced umbilical hernia at topical dermal doses approximately 10 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis. A topical dermal dose approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis produced delays in ossification, but no malformations. In rabbits, mometasone furoate caused multiple malformations umbilical hernia, and hydrocephaly) at topical dermal doses approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis. In an oral study, mometasone furoate increased resorptions and caused cleft palate and/or head malformations (hydrocephaly or domed head) at approximately 30 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis. At approximately 110 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis, most litters were aborted or resorbed. No toxicity was observed at approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis. When rats received subcutaneous doses of mometasone furoate throughout pregnancy or during the later stages of pregnancy, a dose less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis caused prolonged and difficult labor and reduced the number of live births, birth weight, and early pup survival. Nonteratogenic Effects Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born to women receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully monitored. Nursing Mothers It is not known if mometasone furoate is excreted in human milk. Because other corticosteroids are excreted in human milk, caution should be used when NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg is administered to nursing women. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg for allergic rhinitis in children 12 years of age and older have been established [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/nasonex-drug.htm#AR) and [Clinical Studies](/nasonex-drug.htm#CS)]. 50 mcg for allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 to 11 years of age is supported by safety and efficacy data from clinical studies. Seven hundred and twenty (720) patients 3 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily clinical trials [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/nasonex-drug.htm#AR) and [Clinical Studies](/nasonex-drug.htm#CS)]. Twenty-eight (28) patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily dose) in a controlled trial to evaluate safety [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/nasonex-drug.htm#AR)]. Safety and effectiveness of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg for allergic rhinitis in children less than 2 years of age have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of NASONEX Nasal Spray for the treatment of nasal polyps in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. One 4-month trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NASONEX in the treatment of nasal polyps in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate safety; efficacy parameters were collected as secondary endpoints. A total of 127 patients with nasal polyps were randomized to placebo or NASONEX Nasal Spray 100 mcg once or twice daily (patients 6 to 11 years of age) or 200 mcg once or twice daily (patients 12 to 17 years of age). The results of this trial did not support the efficacy of NASONEX Nasal Spray in the treatment of nasal polyps in pediatric patients. The adverse events reported in this trial were similar to the adverse events reported in patients 18 years of age and older with nasal polyps. Controlled clinical studies have shown intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \"catch up\" growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of safe and effective noncorticosteroid treatment alternatives. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including NASONEX Nasal Spray, 50 mcg, each patient should be titrated to his/her lowest effective dose. A clinical study to assess the effect of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily dose) on growth velocity has been conducted in pediatric patients 3 to 9 years of age with allergic rhinitis. No statistically significant effect on growth velocity was observed for NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg compared to placebo following one year of treatment. No evidence of clinically relevant HPA axis suppression was observed following a 30-minute cosyntropin infusion. The potential of NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg to cause growth suppression in susceptible patients or when given at higher doses cannot be ruled out. Geriatric Use A total of 280 patients above 64 years of age with allergic rhinitis or nasal polyps (age range 64 to 86 years) have been treated with NASONEX Nasal Spray 50 mcg for up to 3 or 4 months, respectively. The adverse reactions reported in this population were similar in type and incidence to those reported by younger patients. Hepatic Impairment Concentrations of mometasone furoate appear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/nasonex-drug.htm#CP)]. OVERDOSE There are no data available on the effects of acute or chronic overdosage with NASONEX. Because of low systemic bioavailability, and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical studies, overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation. Chronic overdosage with any corticosteroid may result in signs or symptoms of hypercorticism [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. CONTRAINDICATIONS NASONEX with known hypersensitivity to mometasone furoate or any of its ingredients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DESCRIPTION]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action NASONEX is a corticosteroid demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory properties. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on allergic rhinitis is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. In two clinical studies utilizing nasal antigen challenge, NASONEX decreased some markers of the early-and late-phase allergic response. These observations included decreases (vs. placebo) in histamine and eosinophil cationic protein levels, and reductions (vs. baseline) in eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cell adhesion proteins. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. The effect of NASONEX on nasal mucosa following 12 months of treatment was examined in 46 patients with allergic rhinitis. There was no evidence of atrophy and there was a marked reduction in intraepithelial eosinophilia and inflammatory cell infiltration (e.g., eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells). Pharmacodynamics Adrenal Function in Adults: Four clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted in humans to assess the effect of NASONEX at various doses on adrenal function. In one study, daily doses of 200 and 400 mcg of NASONEX and 10 mg of prednisone were compared to placebo in 64 patients (22 to 44 years of age) with allergic rhinitis. Adrenal function before and after 36 consecutive days of treatment was assessed by measuring plasma cortisol levels following a 6-hour Cortrosyn (ACTH) infusion and by measuring 24-hour levels. NASONEX at both the 200-and 400-mcg dose, was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels post-Cortrosyn infusion or a statistically significant decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo. A statistically significant decrease in the mean plasma cortisol levels post-Cortrosyn infusion and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels was detected in the prednisone treatment group compared to placebo. A second study assessed adrenal response to NASONEX (400 and 1600 mcg/day), prednisone (10 mg/day), and placebo, administered for 29 days in 48 male volunteers (21 to 40 years of age). The 24-hour plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC0-24), during and after an 8-hour Cortrosyn infusion and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were determined at baseline and after 29 days of treatment. No statistically significant differences in adrenal function were observed with NASONEX compared to placebo. A third study evaluated single, rising doses of NASONEX (1000, 2000, and 4000 mcg/day), orally administered mometasone furoate (2000, 4000, and 8000 mcg/day), orally administered dexamethasone (200, 400, and 800 mcg/day), and placebo (administered at the end of each series of doses) in 24 male volunteers (22 to 39 years of age). Dose administrations were separated by at least 72 hours. Determination of serial plasma cortisol levels at 8 AM and for the 24-hour period following each treatment were used to calculate the plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC0-24). In addition, 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were collected prior to initial treatment administration and during the period immediately following each dose. No statistically significant decreases in the plasma cortisol AUC, 8 AM cortisol levels, or 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were observed in volunteers treated with either NASONEX or oral mometasone, as compared with placebo treatment. Conversely, nearly all volunteers treated with the three doses of dexamethasone demonstrated abnormal 8 AM cortisol levels (defined as a cortisol level <10 mcg/dL), reduced plasma AUC values, and decreased 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels, as compared to placebo treatment. In a fourth study, adrenal function was assessed in 213 patients (18 to 81 years of age) with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps before and after 4 months of treatment with either NASONEX (200 mcg once or twice daily) or placebo by measuring 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. NASONEX at both doses (200 and 400 mcg/day), was not associated with statistically significant decreases in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo. Three clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted in pediatric patients to assess the effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray on the adrenal function at daily doses of 50, 100, and 200 mcg vs. placebo. In one study, adrenal function before and after 7 consecutive days of treatment was assessed in 48 pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis (ages 6 to 11 years) by measuring morning plasma cortisol and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Mometasone furoate nasal spray, at all three doses, was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels or a statistically significant decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo. In the second study, adrenal function before and after 14 consecutive days of treatment was assessed in 48 pediatric patients (ages 3 to 5 years) with allergic rhinitis by measuring plasma cortisol levels following a 30-minute Cortrosyn infusion. Mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, at all three doses (50, 100, and 200 mcg/day), was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels post-Cortrosyn infusion compared to placebo. All patients had a normal response to Cortrosyn. In the third study, adrenal function before and after up to 42 consecutive days of once-daily treatment was assessed in 52 patients with allergic rhinitis (ages 2 to 5 years), 28 of whom received mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg per nostril (total daily dose 100 mcg), by measuring morning plasma and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Mometasone furoate nasal spray was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels or a statistically significant decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Mometasone furoate monohydrate administered as a nasal spray suspension has very low bioavailability (<1%) in plasma using a sensitive assay with a lower quantitation limit (LOQ) of 0.25 pcg/mL. Distribution The in vitro protein binding for mometasone furoate was reported to be 98% to 99% in concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/mL. Elimination Following intravenous administration, the effective plasma elimination half-life of mometasone furoate is 5.8 hours. Any absorbed drug is excreted as metabolites mostly via the bile, and to a limited extent, into the urine. Metabolism Studies have shown that any portion of a mometasone furoate dose which is swallowed and absorbed undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. There are no major metabolites detectable in plasma. Upon in vitro incubation, one of the minor metabolites formed is 6\u00c3-hydroxy\u00c2mometasone furoate. In human liver microsomes, the formation of the metabolite is regulated by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Administration of a single inhaled dose of 400 mcg mometasone furoate to subjects with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4), and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment resulted in only 1 or 2 subjects in each group having detectable peak plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate (ranging from 50 to 105 pcg/mL). The observed peak plasma concentrations appear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment, however, the numbers of detectable levels were few. Patients With Renal Impairment The effects of renal impairment on mometasone furoate pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Pediatric Patients Mometasone furoate pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in the pediatric population [see Use In Specific Populations]. Male And Female Patients The effects of gender on mometasone furoate pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Racial Or Ethnic Groups The effects of race on mometasone furoate pharmacokinetics have not been adequately investigated. Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: In a drug interaction study, an inhaled dose of mometasone furoate 400 mcg was given to 24 healthy subjects twice daily for 9 days and ketoconazole 200 mg (as well as placebo) were given twice daily concomitantly on Days 4 to 9. Mometasone furoate plasma concentrations were <150 pcg/mL on Day 3 prior to coadministration of ketoconazole or placebo. Following concomitant administration of ketoconazole, 4 out of 12 subjects in the ketoconazole treatment group (n=12) had peak plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate >200 pcg/mL on Day 9 (211\u00c2324 pcg/mL). Animal And/Or Pharmacology Reproduction Toxicology Studies In mice, mometasone furoate caused cleft palate at subcutaneous doses of 60 mcg/kg and above (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). Fetal survival was reduced at 180 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). No toxicity was observed at 20 mcg/kg (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). In rats, mometasone furoate produced umbilical hernia at topical dermal doses of 600 mcg/kg and above (approximately 10 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). A dose of 300 mcg/kg (approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis) produced delays in ossification, but no malformations. In rabbits, mometasone furoate caused multiple hernia, hydrocephaly) at topical dermal doses of 150 mcg/kg and above (approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). In an oral study, mometasone furoate increased resorptions and caused cleft palate and/or head malformations (hydrocephaly or domed head) at 700 mcg/kg (approximately 30 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). At 2800 mcg/kg (approximately 110 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis), most litters were aborted or resorbed. No toxicity was observed at 140 mcg/kg (approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). When rats received subcutaneous doses of mometasone furoate throughout pregnancy or during the later stages of pregnancy, 15 mcg/kg (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis) caused prolonged and difficult labor and reduced the number of live births, birth weight, and early pup survival. Similar effects were not observed at 7.5 mcg/kg (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). Clinical Studies Prophylaxis Of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis In Adult And Pediatric Patients 12 Years Of Age And Older The efficacy and safety of NASONEX in the prophylaxis and treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis have been evaluated in 18 controlled trials, and one uncontrolled clinical trial, in approximately 3000 adults (ages 17 to 85 years) and pediatric patients (ages 12 to 16 years). Of the total number of patients, there were 1757 males and 1453 females, including a total of 283 adolescents (182 boys and 101 girls) with seasonal allergic or perennial allergic rhinitis. Patients were treated with NASONEX at doses ranging from 50 to 800 mcg/day. The majority of patients were treated with 200 mcg/day. The allergic rhinitis trials evaluated the total nasal symptom scores that included stuffiness, rhinorrhea, itching, and sneezing. Patients treated with NASONEX 200 mcg/day had a statistically significant decrease in total nasal symptom scores compared to placebo-treated patients. No additional benefit was observed for mometasone furoate doses greater than 200 mcg/day. A total of 350 patients have been treated with NASONEX for 1 year or longer. Prophylaxis of seasonal allergic rhinitis for patients 12 years of age and older with NASONEX given at a dose of 200 mcg/day, was evaluated in two clinical studies in 284 patients. These studies were designed such that patients received 4 weeks of prophylaxis with NASONEX prior to the anticipated onset of the pollen season; however, some patients received only 2 to 3 weeks of prophylaxis. Patients receiving 2 to 4 weeks of prophylaxis with NASONEX demonstrated a statistically significantly smaller mean increase in total nasal symptom scores with onset of the pollen season as compared to placebo patients. Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps In Adults 18 Years Of Age And Older Two studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NASONEX in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. These studies involved 664 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, 441 of whom received NASONEX. These studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies in patients 18 to 86 years of age with bilateral nasal polyps. Patients were randomized to receive NASONEX 200 mcg once daily, 200 mcg twice daily or placebo for a period of 4 months. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were 1) change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction averaged over the first month of treatment; and 2) change from baseline to last assessment in bilateral polyp grade during the entire 4 months of treatment as assessed by endoscopy. Efficacy was demonstrated in both studies at a dose of 200 mcg twice daily and in one study at a dose of 200 mcg once a day (see Table 2 below). Table 2: Effect of NASONEX in Two Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Chronic |Mean change polyps in each nasal fossa were graded by the investigator based on endoscopic visualization, using a scale of 0-3 where 0=no polyps; 1=polyps in the middle meatus, not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2=polyps reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate but not the inferior border of the inferior turbinate; 3=polyps reaching to or below the border of the inferior turbinate, or polyps medial to the middle turbinate (score reflects sum of left and right nasal fossa grades). | nasal congestion/obstruction was scored daily by the patient using a 0-3 categorical scale where 0=no symptoms, 1=mild symptoms, 2=moderate symptoms and 3=severe symptoms. There were no clinically relevant differences in the effectiveness of NASONEX in the studies evaluating treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.
