My calling to delve deep into the most effective and healing medicines on the planet came through years of dedicated yoga practice. The transformation of mind-body practice has allowed me to dedicate my life to being a part of your healing process as a board licensed primary care provider. I offer acupuncture, herbal medicine, Ayurvedic massage, Ayurvedic coaching, personalized seasonal cleanses, and private yoga instruction. In your treatment, mind, body and spirit will be nourished, stress reduced and the nervous system supported. Chinese, Ayurvedic and herbal medicine can aid in healing of almost all acute or chronic conditions. I also incorporate Western medicine into my practice, and I specialize in pain management, orthopedics, sports medicine, gynecology and women's health (menstrual cycles, fertility, prenatal/postnatal care and menopause), cancer support, and help yoga practitioners maintain optimal health. I was raised in Michigan, lived many years in the Colorado Rockies, and currently call the Bay Area home. As an adventurer, my inspiration comes through living life to it's fullest in the divinity of nature - exploring mountain peaks or in the ocean's embrace. "}
