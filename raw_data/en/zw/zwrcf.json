{"title": "The Meaning Of Healing: Transcending Suffering", "author": "Thomas R Egnew", "url": "https://www.annfammed.org/content/3/3/255", "hostname": "annfammed.org", "description": "PURPOSE Medicine is traditionally considered a healing profession, but it has neither an operational definition of healing nor an explanation of its mechanisms beyond the physiological processes related to curing. The objective of this study was to determine a definition of healing that operationalizes its mechanisms and thereby identifies those repeatable actions that reliably assist physicians to promote holistic healing. METHODS This study was a qualitative inquiry consisting of in-depth, open-ended, semistructured interviews with Drs. Eric J. Cassell, Carl A. Hammerschlag, Thomas S. Inui, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Cicely Saunders, Bernard S. Siegel, and G. Gayle Stephens. Their perceptions regarding the definition and mechanisms of healing were subjected to grounded theory content analysis. RESULTS Healing was associated with themes of wholeness, narrative, and spirituality. Healing is an intensely personal, subjective experience involving a reconciliation of the meaning an individual ascribes to distressing events with his or her perception of wholeness as a person. CONCLUSIONS Healing may be operationally defined as the personal experience of the transcendence of suffering. Physicians can enhance their abilities as healers by recognizing, diagnosing, minimizing, and relieving suffering, as well as helping patients transcend suffering.", "sitename": "Annals of Family Medicine", "date": "2005-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Article Figures & Data Figures Tables The Article in Brief Background: Medicine is a healing profession but until now, the profession has not defined healing. The purpose of this study was to develop a definition of healing based on interviews of leading figures in medicine and holistic health. What This Study Found: Healing can be defined as the personal experience of the transcendence of suffering. Wholeness, narrative (the patients life story), and spirituality are a part of healing. Implications: * Suffering can cause the person experiencing it to feel separate from herself/himself and from society. By sharing suffering, doctors and patients can create meaning and reduce the sufferers feeling of separation. * Doctors can be better healers by recognizing, diagnosing, minimizing, relieving, and helping patients go beyond suffering.
