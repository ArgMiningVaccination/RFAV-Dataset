Between the hair products recommended in salons, those touted by bloggers and beauty influencers and the ones available in stores and pharmacies, it can be difficult to disentangle what constitutes a real good shampoo, both in terms of ingredients and results. We want to [take care of our hair and our scalp with naturally-sourced products](/blogs/lifestyle/natural-hair-care-8-tips-for-beautiful-healthy-hair), but we do not know where to start? With all these different choices, it can be quite hard to choose. Add to that the fact that companies sometimes have a greenwashing marketing strategy, it can get really confusing. But don't stress! We've got you covered! We've put together a handy little guide to help you get a better understanding of what to look for (and what to avoid!) when it comes to hair products. You'll soon be able to hair flip that beautiful mane of yours with pride! Why are harmful ingredients found in so many shampoos? The question arises: if so many ingredients are recognized as being potentially toxic or carcinogenic, why aren't they simply banned? Although several organizations, such as the EWG or the American foundation [Breast Cancer Prevention Partners with its Campaign for Safe Cosmetics](https://www.safecosmetics.org/) denounce the risks associated with certain ingredients, the government allows their use in supposedly safe small doses in household and personal care products. On the other hand, consumers wonder (and are right to do so): if the use of these products is frequent, and that we use several of these products containing contaminants daily, should this be cause for concern? Indeed, there is food for thought. Since our epidermis is our largest organ and absorbs the substances that we deposit on it, we should be careful about what we put on our body the same way we are careful about we ingest, for example. It is the consumer's role to educate themselves and learn to [read product labels carefully](/blogs/lifestyle/get-to-know-your-cosmetics-with-the-ewg-s-skin-deep-cosmetics-database), much like reading the list of ingredients of a food product. The beneficial ingredients to look for in a shampoo With all that being said, we might wonder what to look for on these seemingly unreadable labels that seem written in a language we don't understand. Generally, vegetal butters and oils, herbs and essential oils are all natural and effective ingredients. But these ingredients of plant or natural origin are often listed according to their scientific names, which makes them more difficult to identify and recognize. To guide you and help you find the best shampoo for you, here is a list of healthy and safe ingredients * as found on most labels: - Sodium coco-sulfate: a surfactant derived from coconut oil with excellent cleaning power and which adds consistency to the shampoo. - Coco-glucoside: a foaming agent (surfactant) of plant origin derived from coconut oil and composed of glucoses (sugars). In shampoos, it cleanses and smoothes the hair fiber. - Decyl glucoside: a surfactant composed of glucose and derived from cornstarch and coconut oil. - Lauryl glucoside: a surfactant of plant origin and derived from corn and coconut oil. - Sodium cocoyl glutamate: a surfactant derived from coconut oil, corn and fruit sugars (glucose). - Sodium cocoyl isethionate: a surfactant derived from coconut oil. - Vegetable glycerin: obtained from rapeseed or coconut oil.

Good to know: All of the above ingredients are of natural origin and fully biodegradable. * The ingredients listed above are examples of clean ingredients approved by EWG, but it is important to note that in pure form, they can be irritating. The secret is always in the right dosage and formulation! Ingredients to avoid in hair care Unfortunately, just looking for \"natural\", \"organic\", \"green\" or \"plant-based\" labels on packaging is not enough to ensure that the products we buy are indeed the best for us.
