Patricia Clark University of Notre Dame pclark1@nd.edu Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Functional instability in Transcription Activator -Like Effectors 1Johns of Biophysics, 2University of Illinois Urbana -Champaign Materials Science and Engineering, 3Howard Hughes Medical Institute kgeiger2@jhu.edu Transcription activator -like effector proteins (TALEs) contain lar ge numbers of repeats that bind double stranded DNA, wrapping around DNA to form a continuous superhelix. Since unbound TALEs retain superhelical structure, it seems likely that DNA binding requires a significantstructural distortion or partial unfolding. We have used nearest -neighbor \"Ising\" analysis of consensus TALE (cTALE) repeat unfolding to quantify intrinsic folding free energies, coupling energies between repeats, and the free energy distribution of partly unfolded states. We find a moderate level o f cooperativity for cTALEs (stabilizing interfaces combined with unstable repeats), at values intermediate between those of TPR and ankyrin repeat proteins (low and high cooperativity, respectively). Using parameters from the Ising analysis, we have analyz ed the distribution of partly folded states as a function of cTALE length. We findthat partly unfolded states with one or more unfolded repeats are energetically accessible. To quantify the DNA binding of cTALES, and to probe the dependence of DNA binding dynamics on accessibility to partially folded states, single molecule Total Internal Reflection (smTIRF) experiments were performed. Immobilized Cy3 -labelled cTALEs incubated with Cy5 - labelled dsDNA show an average FRET efficiency of ~0.45. When im mobilized protein is incubated with DNA in 200 mM KCl, many on and off events occur in single traces. Long movies were collected for cTALEs incubated with increasing DNA concentrations. FRET of single molecules was fit using Hidden Markov modeling analysis , and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for on and off dwell times of many molecules were generated. CDFs for on and off events are well fitted b y double exponentials, suggesting a complicated kinetic binding process. The fast on phase is DNA concent ration dependent, while the slow phase is not DNA concentration dependent, suggesting a fast bimolecular binding event (5.9x108 nM-1*sec-1) and a unimolecular isomerization (0.15 sec-1). The near -diffusion limited association indicates that association is not limited by the cTALE superhelical structure, and is consistent with rearrangem ent to a binding -competent (perhaps partly unfolded) state. It is possible that the subsequent slow isomerization involves locking the superhelix onto the DNA. Neither the fa st nor slow off phase shows a DNA concentration dependence (1.2 sec-1 and 0.13 sec-1), suggesting an isomerization in the bound state as well. Progress on binding kinetics of entropy enhancing variants will be discussed to explore how partly folded states affect DNA binding kinetics.

It is commonly observed in macroscopic biological phenomenon but here we investigated if protein folding is a subject to stochastic resonance. Human cell surface antigen protein VlsE; a two st ate folder was F RET labelled in order to report on its folding/unfolding. The protein was subjected to periodic thermal modulation below its melting temperature. On top of the periodic thermal modulation , controlled artificial noise was added to monitor th e effect of noise on protein unfolding reaction s. The phase shift in the donor and acceptor signal as a function of driving frequency revealed the reaction rates. We observed a maximum in the signal as a function of thermal noise confirming that addition o f artificial noise was in fact capable of driving the unfolding reaction for the protein. Simulation of a small model -protein, and our experimental result both show clear evidence that correlated noise is a physically and chemically plausible mechanism by which cells could modulate biomolecular dynamics during threshold processes such as signaling. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Tracing the evolution of peptide binding specificity in the S100 protein family using phage display and deep sequencing Luke Wheeler , Hiranmayi Duvvuri, Michael J. Harms University of Oregon, Institute of Molecular Biology, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry lwheeler9@gmail.com Substitutions that alter the binding specificity of proteins are essential for the evolution of new biological functions. To directly study this process, we are tracing changes in the total set of partners recognized by proteins over evolutionary time through a combination of ancestral sequence reconstruction, high -throughput phage display, and rigorous biophysical characterization. We are using two members of the S100 protein family, S100A5 and S100A6, as a model of the evolution of specificity. These proteins bind short peptide regions of interaction - partners in a calcium depend ent manner, with each protein having distinct biological targets. To determine how this peptide recognition specificity changed over time, we are deploying a quantitative, high -throughput phage display approach that combines four strategies: 1) use of a competitor peptide to target the relev ant binding site on the protein; 2) careful experimental and computational treatment of library composition and sampling bias; 3) quantitative, global analysis of binding using a partition function; and 4) incorporation of clustering and machine - learning t o identify important determinants of binding specificity. We have used this approach to characterize peptide binding by human S100A5. Machine -learning analyses indicate that binding peptides are distinguished from non -binders by higher rigidity and distinc t side chain patterns. We are currently extending the approach to other S100s, including the last common ancestor of all S100A5 and S100A6 proteins. These experiments will allow us to directly measure how binding specificity has changed evolutionarily and aid identification of new biological targets for these proteins.

Sanap NCBS, Bangalore dipakbs@ncbs.res.in Proteins are flexible entities and undergo conformational changes in solution due to motions ranging from transient local fluctuations to global unfolding. Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) has been a ubiquitously used technique to probe these motions. Generally, HDX has two outcomes : 1) peptide level resolution in terms of observed rates and 2) amplitude (# of amide hydrogens exchanged with deuterium in a peptide fragment).We used all atom molecular dynamics simulations to get atomic insight in to HDX d ata. We calculate mechanical force at atomic level associated with amide bonds and depth to understand the relationship of these atomic forces with HDX data. We find that no single structural property alone can best explain HDX amplitude s. Forces alone giv e a fairly good picture of amplitude but not the best. The forces in combination with depth best represent HDX amplitude s. Presence of mild concentration of Gu anidinium Hydro chloride (~1M) is not significant to affect the network of atomic forces. Although coordination numbers show Gu anidinium ions stick to specific parts of the protein, in simulated time, forces do not explain any relationship between HDX rates and timescale (reciprocal of observed rates). Therefore, the exact role of mild denaturant remains unclear. We found few residues show ed an open state; consistent with a recent study. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Using single molecule chemo -mechanical unfolding to probe the effect of environmental conditions on protein folding Emily Guinn , Bharat Jagannathan, Susan Marqusee California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, UC -Berkeley eguinn@berkeley.edu In vivo, proteins function in a complex environment where they are subject to stresses like solutes, temperature and strain which can modulate the proteins energy landscape. Perturbing these conditions allows one to explore how proteins respond to changes in environment. This also helps to characterize protein energy landscapes because perturbant effects are related to the structure and energetics of the different protein states along the energy landscape. The effect of perturbants on protein stability is related to the structure of the native and denatured state, while the effect of perturbants on protein kinetics is related to the folding pathway. We have developed a technique called chemo -mechanical unfolding where we combine force and chemical denaturan t using optical tweezers. We use chemo -mechanical unfolding as well as temperature and point mutations to explore the denatured state and the parallel pathways proteins fold through. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Internal friction in protein what is it? Abani K. Bhuyan School of Chemistry, Universit y of Hyderabad akbsc@uohyd.ac.in Internal friction in macromolecules is one of the curious phenomena that control conformational changes and reaction rates. The phenomenon has been known since early studies of polymer viscoelasticity, but its definite meaning and manifestations in protein dynamics appear eclipsed by a large number of studies during the past 20 years that have invoked internal friction to model kinetics and dynamics of the p rotein folding reaction. Witho ut referring to protein folding, we simply hold that dispersion interactions and London -van der Waals forces between nonbonded atoms are major contributors to internal friction. Root -mean -square volume fluctuations ( VRMS) in a glycerol -smothered protein c an be used as a proxy of internal friction. We ansatz that internal friction is related to nonbonded interactions by ( ) , where the variable n is the extent of nonbonded interactions with fi coefficients.

Cathy Royer Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute royerpc@rpi.edu Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Characterization of amyloid A oligomers by extrinsic fluorescence probe DCVJ Sureshbabu Nagarajan1, Physics and Astronomy and 2Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University nsuresh@msu.edu Misfolded and intrinsically unfolded proteins are more prone to aggregation in the form of oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils. Oligomers and fibrils are toxic to neuronal cells in vitro, forms ion channels, and disturb the integrity of the synthetic membr ane lipids and rafts. Although probes such as thioflavin -T/S and Congo Red binds more specifically to amyloid fibrils, there is a pressing need to identify probes that bind at the early stage of aggregation and reports on the mechanism of their aggregation . Here we show that molecular rotor 9 -(dicyano -vinyl)julolidine (DCVJ) binds monomers as well as early aggregates and reports on the change in dynamics as well as olig omeric shape and packing. The binding of DCVJ to A 40 and A 42 increases the fluorescence intensity with time around 505 nm, and for the A 40 there appears a second excimer peak at 575 nm. Further the DCVJ fluorescence at 505nm increases 5 -fold greater for A 42 compared to A 40, which suggests the oligomers are more tightly packed in A 42 than in A 40. The comparison of DCVJ kinetics profile at 505nm and 575 nm for A 40 and two mutants show differences that reflect the size and shape of the corresponding oligomers obtained from AFM. The results of this study shows that DCVJ not only binds earl y aggregates, but also provides valuable information regarding oligomer packing, morphology and mechanism of its formation. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Direct observation of concerted backbone -side chain dynamics in short linear peptides Rubin Institute .2Department of Chemical, Biological and Macromolecular Sciences, S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences gautam@jcbose.ac.in Protein dynamics, characterized by constant fluctuation s around the equilibrium structure and dictated by the global free energy surface, greatly influenc ing its function. Molecular simulations can capture protein dynamics in atomistic detail. Experimental signatures of protein dynamics include B -factors in x -ray crystallography or order parameter s in NMR. Protein dynamics results from highly correlated backbone -sidechain motion s, as exemplified in protein structure database analyses where strong correlation is observed between population s of sidechain rotamers and the corresponding backbone dihedral angles. However, direct experimental observation of correlated backbone -sidechain dynamics is difficult to observe since that calls for independent observations of backbone and sidechain motio ns. We have studied a series of tri -peptide s with a central Pro residue flanked by Trp at the C -termini(Ac -Xaa-Pro-Trp-NH 2). NMR showed that the cis - conformation of the peptides are stabilized by CH interaction s, between -H of Xaa and the side chain of Trp. Taking advantage of the slow backbone cis/trans isomerization kinetics and substantially enhanced cis -content moieties in non -aqueous solvents containing LiCl, we have performed time -resolved fluorescence studies on the Trp residue in th e peptides following solvent jump from TFE/LiCl to aqueous buffer. The time resolved fluorescence data fitted well with a three -component model where, upon solvent jump, the relative populations of each component ascribed to Trp rotamers g+ ( 1 = +60), g- (1 = -60) and t (1 = 180), varied exponentially with a rate constant compatible with NMR -determined cis/trans isomerization rates. The exponential decrease of g+ and t rotamers, known to be associated with the cis -isomer by NMR, and the concomitant exponential increase of the g- rotamer, known to be associated with the trans -isomer by NMR, with a time constant that matches the backbone cis/trans isomerization kinetics, i s a direct experimental evidence of concerted nature of backbone -sidechain dynamics. The results also confirm the origin of multiple Trp lifetimes as arising from ground -state conformational heterogeneity ( and the peptide system provide excellent fr amework to understand mechanisms governing Trp lifetimes associated with CH interactions. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Salt-binding induced oligomerization of the mouse prion protein monitored time Ishita Bhate, Ranabir Das National Centre for Biological Sciences ishitas@ncbs.res.in The prion protein forms -rich soluble oligomers in vitro at pH 4 i n the presence of physiological concentrations of salt. In the absence of salt, oligomerization and misfolding does not take place in an experimentally tractable timescale. While it is well established that a lowering of pH facilitates misfolding and oligomerization of the prion protein, the role of salt remains poorly understood. Here, solution -state NMR was used to p robe perturbations in the structure of the monomeric mouse prion protein (moPrP) immediately upon the addition of salt prior to the commencement of the oligomerization reaction. The weak binding of salt at multiple sites dispersed all over the monomeric pr otein causes an overall non -specific perturbation, albeit weakly of structure throughout the monomeric protein. The only significant perturbation occurs in the loop between helix 2 and helix 3 in and around the partially buried salt -bridge between residues K193 and E195. This perturbation, presumably because of the screening of this key electrostatic interaction, is the earliest detectable change in the monomer before any major conformational change occurs, and appears to constitute the trigger for the comm encement of misfolding and oligomerization. Subsequently, the kinetics of monomer loss, due to salt -induced low pH oligomerization of moPrP was monitored at the individual residue level. The oligomerization reaction was found to be rate -limited by associat ion and not conformational change, with an overall reaction order of 2.6, averaged across residues. Not surprisingly, salt accelerated the kinetics of oligomerization, albeit in a non -specific manner, by electrostatic screening of the highly charged monome rs at acidic pH. Together, these results allowed a demarcation of the specific and non -specific effects of salt on prion protein misfolding and oligomerization. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Ising models and protein folding Douglas Barrick Johns Hopkins University barrick@jhu.edu Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Probing the cooperativity and stability of a repeat protein PP32 and cavity mutants using high pressure fluorescence Institute 2 CBS CNRS Montpellier France 3Syracuse University 4Philand er Smith College 5The Johns Hopkins University jenkik3@rpi.edu How the primary sequences of proteins define folding cooperativity and free energy landscapes is poorly understood. We examined the cooperativity determinants of PP32, a leucine rich repeat protein with a linear topology which exhibits increasing stability from the N - to the C -terminus. We made mutations in PP32 that created cavities at different locations in the protein. The effect of these cavities on PP32 folding landscapes was probed by high pressure fluorescence and NMR. Pressure denaturation offers an alternative approach to studying protein folding bec ause its effects are due to void volume present in the proteins folded state, rather than the surface area of the unfolded state, leading to a more local effect and a rougher energy landscape with more intermediate states being populated than are observed with chemical denaturants. High pressure NMR studies of PP32 cavity mutants provide equilibrium unfolding data at the residue specific level. These results were used to constrain coarse grained structure -based simulations yielding pseudo free energy profi les and structural characterization of the ensemble at several pressures and temperatures. Pressure -jump (p -jump) studies yielded activation volumes for folding and unfolding, which are defined by the molar volume of the transition state relative to the folded and unfolded states.This high resolution structural and energetic characterization of PP32 cavity containing mutants reveal key features of the PP32 sequence which define its folding cooperativity. Keywords: High pressure, cooperativity, fluorescence kinetics, LRR proteins Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Alternatively packed, near -native states of a multi -domain protein Santosh Kumar Jha CSIR -National Chemical Laboratory sk.jha@ncl.res.in Crystal structures of almost all proteins show a static image of the native state in which the hydrophobic side -chain residues are tightly packed inside the protein core, analogous to the crystals of small organic molecules, in order to maximize the streng th of the van der Waals (vdW) interactions. It has been difficult to quantify the degree of side -chain conformational heterogeneity in the native state due to the dynamic fluctuations away from the crystallographic structure. In addition, the role and ener getic contribution of vdW interactions relative to the hydrophobic effect in stabilizing the native state of proteins is also not clear. In this study, we show using a battery of high -resolution spectroscopic probes, including fluorescence resonance energ y transfer, red shift and near -and far -UV circular dichroism, that the native -state state ensemble of a multi - domain protein, human serum albumin, contains a significant population of an intermediate state with an alternative side -chain packing arrangement. We show that the intermediate state is slightly expanded than the native -state, has a disrupted inter -domain side -chain packing interactions and the sole tryptophan residue is buried in the hydrophobic envi ronment instead of partially exposed to the solvent. However, it has native -like secondary structure and has a dry core. The sequential population of this native -like intermediatestate during equilibrium unfolding allows us to dissect the energetic contrib ution of inter -domain side -chain packing interactions in protein stability. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Charge Patterned Sequences Form Helical Structures Through Charge Neutralization Tyler S. Harmon1, Ammon E. Posey2, and Rohit V. Pappu2 1Department of Physics, Washington University in St. Louis 2Department of Biomedical Engineering & Center for Biological Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis tylerharmon@gmail.com Many proteins with repeating blocks of oppositely charged residues form long single alpha helices (SAHs).The consensus sequence is a block of four Glu residues followed by a block of four Lys or Arg residues, (Glu 4(Lys/Arg) 4)n. The current working hypothesis is that SAHs are stabilized by i:i+4 salt bridges between opposite charges in consecut ive helical turns.We test the merits of this hypothesis to understand the sequence -encoded preference for SAHs and the logic behind the failure of certain atomistic simulations in anticipating the preference for stable SAHs. In simulations with fixed char ges the favorable free energy of solvation of charged residues and the associated loss of sidechain entropy hinders the formation of SAHs. We proposed that alterations to charge states induced by sequence context might play an important role in stabilizing SAHs.We tested this hypothesis using a (Glu 4Lys 4)n repeat protein and a simulation strategy that permits the substitution of charged residues with neutralized protonated or deprotonated variants of Glu / Lys. Our results predict that stable SAH structures derive from the neutralization of approximately ha lf the Glu residues. These findings explain experimental observations and also provide a coherent rationale for the failure of simulations based on fixed charge models. Large -scale sequence analysis reveals that naturally occurring sequences often include \"defects\" in charge patterns such as Gln or Ala substitutions. This sequence -encoded incorporation of uncharged residues combined with neutralization of charged residues might tilt the balance toward alpha helical conformations. Our results highlight the need for developing robust methodologies for constant pH simulationsthat can be applied to sequences with high charge contents. They also highlight the need for generalizing bioinformatics predictors to account for sequence -encoded charge regulation that might influence disorder predictions for sequences with high fractions of charged residues. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Microfluidic turbulent mixers, time resolved SAXS and folding intermediates of CheY Sagar Virendra Kathuria University of Massachusetts sagar.kathuria@umassmed.edu The process of folding a polypeptide chain from an unstructured random coil in denaturant to a functional 3 dimensional form is a rapid process that is perhaps biased very early on during the initial steps, even as the solvent conditions are transitioning from favoring denaturation to favoring folding. Access to kinetics in the microseconds to milliseconds time scale by multiple spectroscopic probes is crucial to interpreting these initial steps of folding. Time resolved small angle X -ray scattering (trSAXS) is a powerful technique for studying 3 dimensional shapes of proteins as they transition from unfolded to native structures.By interfacing microfluidic devices with powerful x -ray sources we can access timescales in the sub -hundred microseconds range. Structural details determined using trSAXS of the kinetic refolding process of CheY reveal a burst phase in the sub 50 -microsecond time -scale, that is perhaps structured around a local -in- sequence cluster of hydrophobic residues .

The secondary function of cytc involves its interact ion with membrane, peroxidase activity and initiation of apoptosis. We report here a detailed experimental and computational study, which aims to understand at molecular level the difference in secondary functions of different cytc proteins. The conformati onal landscape of cytc has been found to be heterogeneous, consisting of an equilibrium involving compact and an extended conformers, and oligomeric species. Since the determination of relative populations of these conformers is difficult by ensemble meas urements, we have used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which can monitor the diffusional and conformational dynamics of a biomolecule with single molecule resolution. These populations are found to vary depending on multiple factors, including protein sources, the presence of membrane or denaturing agents, and their concentrations. The complex interplay between the conformational distribution and oligomerization plays crucial roles in the variation of the pre -apoptotic regulations of cytc obser ved in different sources. Finally, computational studies reveal that the variation of the charge distribution at the surface and the charge reversal sites may be the key determinants of the conformational stability of cytc. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Structural and mechanistic insights into the copper -modulated unfolding pathways of azurin Sri Rama Koti Ainavarapu Department of Chemical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research koti@tifr.res.in Metalloproteins make up one -third of all known proteins. Characterization of protein energy landscape of metalloproteins is challenging because of the subtle changes imparted by metal binding. Here we present copper induced changes in the mechanical unfold ing pathways of azurin through a joint experimental -computational study. Single -molecule force spectroscopy experiments reveal an intermediate along the unfolding pathway of apo -azurin in ~50% of population. Steered molecular dynamics simulations attribute the native and intermediate unfolding transition states (TSs) to the rupture of interactions between the pairs of -strands, 2B - 8 and 4 -7, respectively. We show that the binding to copper does not change the first TS of azurin and its mechanical propertie s, but influences the second TS. The rupture of the 4 -7 - strand pair is delayed in holo -azurin because of constraints imposed by the copper coordination sphere and occurs after the second TS. Our experimental and computational approach extracts unpreceden ted details along the unfolding landscape for apo - and holo -azurins. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Observing a late folding intermediate of Ubiquitin at atomic resolution by NMR Ranabir Das National Centre for Biological Sciences rana@ncbs.res.in The study of intermediates in the protein folding pathway provides a wealth of information about the energy landscape. The intermediates also frequently initiate pathogenic fibril formations. While observing the intermediates is difficult due to their transient nature, extreme conditi ons can partially unfold the proteins and provide a glimpse of the intermediate states. Here, we observe the high resolution structure of a hydrophobic core mutant of Ubiquitin at an extreme acidic pH by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In th e structure, the native secondary and tertiary structure is conserved for a major part of the protein. However, a long loop between the beta strands 3 and 5 is partially unfolded. The altered structure is supported by fluorescence data and the difference i n free energies between the native state and the intermediate is reflected in the denaturant induced melting curves. The unfolded region includes amino acids that are critical for interaction with cofactors as well as for assembly of poly - Ubiquitin chains. The structure at acidic pH resembles a late folding intermediate of Ubiquitin and indicates that upon stabilization of the protein's core, the long loop converges on the core in the final step of the folding process.

Robert Matthews University of Massachusetts Medical School Yvonne.chan@umassmed.edu TIM barrel proteins are encoded by highly divergent sequences, but fold to highly conserved () 8 structures with varying stabilities and functions. The phosphate synthase required for tryptophan biosynthesis in bacteria, archaea and yeast, was used to investigate how sequence and structure are correlated wi th fitness in a competition growth assay. the S. Solfataricus (SsIGPS, and T. bacteria) thermophiles were subjected to the EMPIRIC assay to assess the change in fitness of yeast transformed with these genes following saturating mutagenesis on the 8 -stands and the preceding -loops, known to be important for protein stability. We explored the fitness landscapes of these three orthologous TIM barrel proteins to answer two important questions at the intersection of biophysics and evolutionary biology: what are the salient features of a TIM barrel fitness landscape, and whether the fitness landscapes of phylogenetically -divergent proteins are correlated. The fact that the thermophilic proteins we chose for this study were not well adapted to the mesophilic host environment was fortuitous, providing an opportunity to identify beneficial mutations that increase the fitness under sub - optimal growth conditions. Surprisingly, mutations in t he -loops distal from the active site increase the fitness of all 3 IPGS orthologs, implying a common allosteric effect. In general, despite the low sequence identity (<35%) of the wildtype (WT) sequences, the fitness landscapes of the three IGPS protein sare correlated. While part of this result can be explained by the effects of side chain physical chemistry on protein folding and thus fitness, the correlation between fitness landscapes at structurally equivalent positions, irrespective of the WT amino a cid, suggests that the structure of the TIM barrel fold imposes a specific fitness landscape. To our knowledge, the conservation of a fitness landscape in sequence and structure space across evolutionary time has not been previously observed.

Here we report the conformational properties of a panel of disordered proteins having sequence compositions typical of folded proteins. Small angle X -ray scattering (SAXS) finds that their conformational ensembles are highly expanded in water. An analysis of the SAXS curves finds that the Flory exponent, which describes the collapse propensity of a chain, is 0.53. This value is between the ideal self -avoiding random walk (=0.59) and the theta solvent limit where intra -chain attraction exactly counterbalances excluded volume terms in an o therwise random walk (=\u00bd). The addition of moderate amounts of denaturants results in very mild expansion. Simulations generate a molecular form factor applicable to IDPs that can be used to determine the Rg and from a single SAXS measurement. These fin dings along with recent re -evaluation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies largely resolves the ongoing SAXS/ FRET controversy concerning the behavior of disorder proteins. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Homodimeric E. coli Toxin CcdB (Controller of Cell Divisio n or Death B Protein) Folds via Parallel Pathways Chetana Baliga, Raghavan Varadarajan and Nilesh Aghera Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India nilesha@mbu.iisc.ernet.in The existence of parallel pathways in the folding of proteins seems intuitive, yet remains controversial. We explore the folding kinetics of the homodimeric E. coli toxin CcdB using multiple optical probes and approaches. Kinetic studies performed as a fun ction of protein and denaturant concentrations demonstrate that the folding of CcdB is a four -state process. The two intermediates populated during folding are present on parallel pathways. Both form by rapid association of the monomers in a diffusion limi ted manner and appear to be largely unstructured, as they are silent to the optical probes employed in the current study. The existence of parallel pathways is supported by the insensitivity of the amplitudes of the refolding kinetic phases to the differen t probes used in the study. More importantly, interrupted refolding studies and ligand binding studies clearly demonstrate that the native state forms in a bi -exponential manner, implying the presence of at least two pathways. Our studies indicate that the CcdA antitoxin binds only to the folded CcdB dimer and not to any earlier folding intermediates. Thus, despite being part of the same operon, the antitoxin does not appear to modulate the folding pathway of the toxin encoded by the downstream cistron. Thi s study highlights the utility of ligand binding in distinguishing between sequential and parallel pathways in protein folding studies, while also providing insights into molecular interactions during folding in Type II TA systems. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Unfolded states under folding conditions Rohit Pappu Washington University in St. Louis pappu@wustl.edu This talk will present new insights from recent experiments, simulations, and theories regarding protein unfolded states under folding conditions. The emerging integrative picture from a combination of FRET, SAXS, NMR, and computational analysis suggests that the statistical properties of unfolded states under folding conditions are consistent with flexible polymers in theta solvents. This has broad impl ications for interactions in crowded milieus, for folding - unfolding transitions, and for tilting the balance toward heterogeneous ensembles as is the case with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These implications will also be discussed with special emphasis on IDPs that undergo multisite phosphorylation. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Dynamics of protein folding studied by single molecule fluorescence measurements at microsecond resolution Satoshi Takahashi , Masataka Saito and Hiroyuki Oikawa Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, and Department of Chemistry, Graduate Schoo l of Science, Tohoku University sttagen.tohoku.ac.jp Single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMFS) is a powerful technique for the investigation of the heterogeneity and dynamics of proteins in the unfolded state [1]. However, the time resolution of the conventional method of SMFS is limited to a few milliseconds. We developed a line-confocal microscope, which enables us to obtain the time resolution of 2 0 microsecond and the observation time of a few milliseconds in the FRET efficiency time series from single proteins [2]. We first investigated the B domain of protein A (BdpA) by doubly labeling the protein with donor and acceptor fluorophores [3]. We ob tained traces having high and low FRET efficiencies, assignable to the native and unfolded states, respectively. The distribution assigned to the unfolded state was broad and split into two components near the unfolding midpoint, suggesting the presence of substates. The distribution assigned to the native state showed a gradual shift as the changes in the denaturant concentration, demonstrating a partial swelling of the native state. We next investigated the unfolding transition of ubiquitin [4]. We esta blished that the covalent coating of the cell surface by MPC polymer is important for the reproducibility of the single molecule data. At 0 M concentration of urea, the FRET distribution assignable to the native state was observed, whose width was narrow a nd comparable to the theoretical width estimated from the average photon numbers. In contrast, the FRET distributions at 4 and 8 M urea were assignable to the denatured state,and were obviously broader than the theoretical width. Furthermore, the traces as signed to the unfolded state mostly showed constant efficiencies but at different values during the observation time of a few milliseconds. Accordingly, the data suggested that the denatured ubiquitin are heterogeneous and that the each component of the unfolded state possess the lifetime longer than several milliseconds. We are currently trying several new approaches to increase the time resolution of the FRET efficiency measurements and to combine the solution -mixing device for the line confocal optics. The line confocal detection of SMFS will become a powerful tool to understand the mechanism of protein folding and other dynamics as an experimental counterpart of molecular dynamics calculations.

Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and small angle X -ray scattering (SAXS) experiments disagree on whether Protein L collapse transition occurs during the burst -phase of folding. We study Prot ein L folding using a coarse -grained model and molecular dynamics simulations.The collapse transition in Protein L is found to be concomitant with the folding transition. In the burst -phase of folding, we find that FRETexperiments overestimate radius of gy ration (Rg) of the protein due to the application of Gaussian polymer chain end-to-end distribution to extract Rg from the FRET efficiency. The actual decrease in Rg is close to the statistical uncertainties of the Rg data measured from SAXS experiments, w hich sugg est no compaction, leading to a disagreement with the FRETexperiments. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM The dimensions of denatured state ensemble (DSE) and the degree to which water is a good solvent Tobin Sosnick University of Chicago trsosnic@uchicago.edu With the goal of stimulating discussions on issues where opinions may differ within the expert audience, I will cover three topics: 1. The dimensions of denatured state ensemble (DSE) and the degree to which water is a good solvent. 2. Properties of the transition state ensemble (TSE) including the level of diversity and native -like character. 3. Recent progress in cooperative de novo folding simulations to the native state ensemble (NSE) conducted using a single processor Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Physical origins and evolutionary effects of high -order epistasis in genotype -phenotype maps Michael Harms University of Oregon harms@uoregon.edu A key goal in molecular evolution is to understand why one evolutionary trajectory is taken rather than others. One important determinant of these outcomes is epistasis, where the effect of mutation depends on the presence or absence of other mutations. While pairwise epistasis has been studied extensively, much less is known about high -order epistasis between three or more mutations. If present, high -order interactions could lead to a profound memory effect in evolution, with early mutations strongly shaping evolutionary outcomes. To investigate high - order epistasis, we analyz ed a series of experimental genotype -phenotype maps using a robust statistical model. We found extensive high -order epistasis, with statistically -significant interactions between up to six mutations. Computationally removing these interactions dramatically altered outcomes of evolutionary simulations in these maps, revealing that high - order epistasis does indeed shape evolutionary outcomes. We next investigated the origins of this epistasis. Using simple protein lattice models, we then showed that the obser ved patterns of high - order epistasis arise naturally from the ensemble nature of biomolecular systems. From these results, we propose that high -order epistasis is the rule rather than the exception in molecular evolution, and that this is a natural consequ ence of the physical properties of biomolecular systems. This implies that, in general, the effect of mutations will be different if they occur early or late in evolution, and that early evolutionary events strongly constrain future ones. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Native and nonnative interactions in protein folding Gerhard Hummer Max Planck Institute of Biophysics gerhard. hummer@biophys.mpg.de The mechanism of a reaction is contained in the dynamic transition pathways between the reactant and product states. The theoretical framework of transition path theory allows us to describe reaction mechanisms in quantitative terms. Within this framework and on the basis of the atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reported by the group of D.E.Shaw, we can address l ong-standing questions concerning the mechanism of protein folding [1,2]. For the relatively fast -folding proteins amenable to simulation, we can assess whether protein folding is primarily a build -up of native structure, as assumed in native -centric theor etical and simulation models; or if non -native interactions play an important role, e.g., by stabilizing intermediate structures along the folding pathway, as deduced from earlier simulations. By comparing phi - values calculated directly from the MD traject ories, we can also assess whether the simulations capture the folding mechanism correctly. References : 1. R. B. Best, G. Hummer, W.

Using a few examples, I will show how computational protein folding can be used both to understand folding free energy l andscapes and to detect regions of the protein that alter these landscapes. We have also shown that such non -folding regions often aid the function of the protein either directly or indirectly. Finally, our studies have shown that such functional regions m odulate folding in a variety of ways which include increased or reduced folding free energy barriers, increased population of folding intermediates and altered folding routes.

I will talk about our recent efforts where we have applied single -molecule force spectroscopy t o study of helical membrane protein folding under native -like bicelle conditions. Applying force using magnetic tweezers, a transmembrane helix protein, Escherichia coli rhomboid protease GlpG, is unfolded in a highly cooperative manner, largely unraveling as one physical unit in response to mechanical tension above 25 pN. Considerable hysteresis is observed, with refolding occurring only at forces below 5 pN. Characterizing the energy landscape reveals only modest thermodynamic stability ( DG = 6.5 kBT) but a large unfolding barrier (21.3 kBT) that can maintain the protein in a folded state for long periods of time ( t1/2 ~3.5 h). The observed energy landscape may have evolved to limit the existence of troublesome partially unfolded states and impart rigidity to the structure.

Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Balancing protein folding and aggregation by interface residues Radhakrishnan Mahalakshmi Department of Biological Sciences , Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal maha@iiserb.ac.in The lipid bilayer interface is a complex environment that bridges the hydrophilic solvated exterior with the hydrophobic lipid core. The unique amphipathic chemical milieu presented at the bilayer interface demands equally complex amino acids to be positioned here, in the integral membrane protein. Aromatic amino acids, particularly tryptophan, are usually abundant at the interfac e and are believed to contribute significantly to the folding and stability of membrane proteins. Surprisingly, however, our estimates of the water -to-interface partitioning free energy reveal that at the interface, tryptophan is thermodynamically destabil izing. Similarly, the thermodynamic stabilization of the thiol side chain is considerably high, despite which cysteine is one of the least abundant amino acids at the bilayer interface. In this talk, I will present a detailed experimental investigation of these anomalies using two transmembrane beta -barrel proteins as model systems. We find that a fine -tuned balance between protein folding and protein aggregation dictates the choice of residues lining the bilayer interface. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Protein folding - on and off the ribosome Jane Clarke Department of Chemistry University of Cambridge jc162@cam.ac.uk Most eukaryotic proteins contain more than one independently folding domain. Sinc e the local concentration of domains is high, how do natural proteins avoid misfolding? Our single molecule studies of the folding and misfolding of multidomain proteins suggest that the early folding events of multidomain proteins are much more intricate than previously thought. The single molecule data suggest that ~50% of the total population form transient non -native species. Since co -translational folding is likely to be important to prevent misfolding particularly for multidomain proteins, we are now investigating the folding of multido main proteins on stalled ribosomes. We conclude that individual domains can fold close to the ribosome, certainly before the following domain has been translated and that this will prevent inter -domain misfolding. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Kinetic effects on protein folding in vivo Patricia Clark University of Notre Dame pclark1@nd.edu The vast majority of what we know about protein folding has been gleaned from equilibrium studies of the folding of small proteins that unfold and refold reversibly from chemical denaturants such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride. However, many proteins cannot unfold and refold reversibly. Instead, once diluted out of denaturant, these proteins tend to misfold and aggregate. For these proteins, the specific route taken to traverse the foldin g energy landscape can determine whether the protein will fold to its native state or not. Intriguingly, many of these proteins fold to high yield in vivo, despite the more challenging environment for folding (higher temperature and increased macromolecula r crowding). These results have inspired our investigation of specific mechanisms in the cell that can reduce the conformational ensemble of partially folded proteins to favor those intermediates that have a high likelihood of forming the native protein st ructure. We have found that during translation (synthesis) of an aggregation - prone protein by the ribosome, N -terminal portions of the nascent protein can adopt conformations that increase the yield of native protein, versus the refolding of free, full len gth protein upon dilution from denaturant. Moreover, the local rate of translation can affect the populations of these co -translational folding intermediates. An analysis of protein coding sequences from 76 fully sequenced genomes indicates that local tran slation rate may play a role in the folding mechanism for a significant fraction of newly -synthesized proteins. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM The allosteric landscape of Hsp70 chaperones \u2014molecular machines that help proteins fold and stay folded Wenli Meng1, Charles A English1, Eugenia M Clerico1, and Lila M. Gierasch1,2 Departments of 1Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and 2Chemistry University of Massachusetts Amherst , Life Sciences Laboratories gierasch@biochem.umass.edu Members of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones perform a wide array of cellular functions under non -stress and stress conditions. These functions range from several that involve interactions with nascent chains -facilitation of folding and avoidance of aggregation, assembly of speci fic complexes, shepherding polypeptides across membranes, and acting as decision points for protein degradation. Under stress conditions, they protect the proteome from misfolding and aggregation, and partner with disaggregases to break up aggregates. The essential mechanism of nucleotide -modulated substrate binding/release cycles and partnering with J - protein and nucleotide exchange factor co -chaperones is conserved among all Hsp70s. Then how do Hsp70s achieve their functional diversity? Sequence conservat ion among Hsp70s is relatively high, but nonetheless they fall in sub -families. We are seeking to understand the structural origins of Hsp70 allosteric function well enough that we can correlate sequence variations between Hsp70s with their functional dive rsity. This talk will describe our findings to date, including the striking observation that the propensity for docking of the nucleotide -binding and substrate -binding domains varies substantially between eukaryotic induc ible cytoplasmic Hsp70, dissecting the key residue contributions to allosteric interfaces that may account for this altered allosteric landscape. Building on our earlier analysis ofthe E. coli Hsp70, DnaK (Zhuravleva et al., Cell 151: 1296 [2012]), we have identified sites that tune the allosteric landscape in Hsp70s and postulate that these sites represent evolutionary specialization in this ubiquitous chaperone family. In addition, we are dissecting the role of the interdomain l inker in coupling the energetics of the interdomain interfaces while also allowing conformational sampling. Lastly, we will describe recent efforts to elucidate the mode of binding of DnaK to a model substrate. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Conversion of a chaperonin GroEL -independent protein into an obligate substrate, and vice Hideki Taguchi Toky o Institute of Technology taguchi@bio.titech.ac.jp Chaperones assist protein folding by preventing unproductive protein aggregation in the cell. In Escherichia coli, chaperonin GroEL/GroES (GroE) is the only indispensable chaperone and is absolutely required for the de novo folding of atleast ~60 proteins. We previously found that several orthologs of the obligate GroE L substrates in Urea plasma urea lyticum, which lacks the groE L gene in the genome, are E. coli GroE L-independent folders, despite their significant sequence identities.Here, we investigated the key features that define the GroE L-dependency. Chimera or rando m mutagenesis analyses revealed that independent multiple point mutations, and even single mutations, were sufficient to confer GroE -dependence on the UreaplasmaMetK. Strikingly, the GroE L-dependency was well correlated with the propensity to form protein aggregates during folding. In addition, we are pursuing the opposite direction, that is, the direction from GroE L-dependent to GroE L-independent folder. The results reveal the delicate balance between GroE L-dependence and independence. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM The dry molten globule state and its role in protein folding and f unction Thomas Kiefhaber Martin -Luther -Universit\u00e4t Halle -Wittenberg, Institute of -halle.de A dry molten globule (DMG) state has been observed as a transient intermediate in protein unfolding a nd as an alternative native state for several proteins. The DMG state has a solvent inaccessible core but shows increased side -chain flexibility and reduced strength of side -chain interactions compared to the native state. Triplet -triplet energy transfer e xperiments discovered two native states in the villin headpiece subdomain (HP35). Analysing the effect of temperature, pressure and amino acid replacements on the equilibrium between the two native states yielded information on the energetics, dynamics and structural properties of the free energy landscape for native -state dynamics in HP35. The results indicate an equilibrium between a locked native state with low -amplitude motions and a more flexible, unlocked native state, from which local and most likely also global unfolding reactions occur. The properties of the unlocked native state are compatible with a compact DMG, whereas the transition state for interconverting between the two native state represents an expanded DMG. The structural properties of th e two native states and their role in protein folding and function will be discussed. Literature: 1. Reiner, A., Henklein, P. & Kiefhaber, T (2010 & Kiefhaber, T .

Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Pressure -based mapping of protein conformational landscapes Catherine A. Royer Renss elaer Polytechnic Institute royerc@rpi.edu A major challenge in protein science is obtaining detailed structural, dynamic and thermodynamic descriptions of protein conformational ensembles. One very useful approach towards this goal is to use pressure perturbation, combined with state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods. Pressure perturbs protein stability because the less structured conformations of proteins are also those that occupy the smallest mola r volume. This is because the more structured forms ofproteins harbor internal solvent -excluded voids that are eliminated upon disruption of the structure. Hence, unlike the effects if denaturants, which are based on changes in surface area of the unfolded form, pressure effects arise due to very specific properties of the folded forms of proteins. Pressure acts locally on protein folded structures. Because of this mechanism, intermediate states are much more likely to be observed in pressure perturbation e xperiments. Coupling pressure with structural approaches such as multi - dimensional NMR, provides information about the structure of the ensemble at nearly every residue. These structural constraints can be used to computationally generate structural models of the ensemble. Another advantage of pressure is that it considerably slows folding relaxation rates due to positive activation volumes for folding. This allows for residue specific folding kinetics using different NMR approaches. Both the equilibrium and kinetic studies reveal complexities in folding that could not be observed using alternate approaches. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Folding of repeat and globular consensus proteins Katherine Tripp, Matt Sternke, Katie Geiger, Mark Peterson, Max Yuhas, Fabio Parmeggiani, David Baker, and Doug Barrick* *T.C. Jenkins Department of Biophysics Johns Hopkins University barrick@jhu.edu Linear repeat proteins provide an excellent framework for studying protein stability and cooperativity. Although the interactions stabilizing repeat proteins are the same as those stabilizing globular proteins, repeat proteins have rough translational symmetry over 20 -50 residues, reducing structural heterogeneity on longer length -scales. Moreover, the linear architecture of repeat proteins perm its the removal and addition of the repeated structural element, facilitating nearest -neighbor (1D -Ising) of folding, which provides a unique thermodynamic measure of cooperativity in folding. However, the repeat units of naturally occurring repeat protein s show significant sequence variation from, complicating analysis. To eliminate this sequence variation and to improve the accuracy of nearest -neighbor analysis, we and other labs have found that highly stabilized proteins with identical repeats can be designed, using consensus information from multiple sequence alignments. Recent successes with this approach will be presented, along with generalities and variations in underlying cooperativity parameters. In addition, Ising -analysis will be presented for a series of rosetta - designed helical repeat proteins that bear no sequence or structural similarity to naturally occurring proteins. Recently, we asked whether we could achieve similar success using consensus -based information to engineer globular protei ns. Starting with the homeodomain fold, we created a highly thermostabilized consensus variant that adopts the homeodomain fold, folds extremely fast, and to our surprise, binds cognate DNA sequences with nearly 100 -fold greater affinity than the Drosophil a engrailed homeodomain. Very recently, we have had success with other folds, including the -helical spectrin domain and a mixed / and -sheet proteins. Results from these studies, along with implications for protein evolution and design, will be discus sed. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Effects of an anti -prion pharmacological chaperone on the folding dynamics of single PrP molecules Michael T. Woodside Dept. of Physics, University of Alberta and National Institute for Nanotechnology, NRC mwoodsid@ualberta.ca Many diseases involve the aggregation of misfolded proteins. In some cases,as with the prion disorders and prion -like diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's,Parkinson's, ALS), misfolded proteins can propagate by converting natively folded molecules into more misfolded molecules. Small - molecule pharmacological chaperones that act to prevent misfolding and conversion have been sought as therapeutics for several protein misfolding diseases, but their develop ment has proven challenging, in part because their mechanism of action often remains unclear. We studied Fe - TMPyP, a tetrapyrrole that binds to the prion protein PrP and inhibits misfolding, using optical tweezers to unfold single PrP molecules with and wi thout Fe-TMPyP present and thereby examine the effects of this ligand on PrP folding at the single -molecule level. We found that ligand binding to the native structure increased the unfolding force significantly and altered the transition state for unfoldi ng, making it more brittle and raising the barrier height. Fe -TMPyP also bound the unfolded state, delaying native refolding and thereby allowing metastable misfolded states to form. Furthermore, looking at the folding of two PrP molecules linked in tandem we found that Fe -TMPyP binding blocked the formation of a thermodynamically stable misfolded state by interfering with intermolecular interactions, acting in a manner similar to that of some molecular chaperones. This anti-prion ligand thus promotes nativ e folding by stabilising the native state while also suppressing interactions that drive aggregation. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM The challenges and opportunities of understanding protein folding and protein misfolding in health and disease Sheena E. Radford Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds s.e.radford@leeds.ac.uk The last decade has seen astounding increases in our knowledge of how proteins fold, both in vitro and in living cells. Based on experiments with ever -increasing levels of sophistication, combined with increases in the powers of simulation and computational methods, we can now monitor folding transitions on rapid timescales in all atom detail, watch proteins folding as they first em erge from the ribosome, and witness the conformational fluctuations of individual protein molecules as they search for their native conformations on rugged energy landscapes. It is also clear that proteins can misfold, sometimes frequently during folding. If left unchecked by molecular chaperones, misfolding can result in disastrous consequences for the cell. Understanding how different proteins assemble into the ordered, insoluble aggregates associated with amyloid disease is a formidable challenge. Whil st it is generally accepted that protein misfolding is required for the formation of amyloid fibrils, the point at which the folding and aggregation free energy landscapes diverge, and how or why non -native states of proteins are able to aggregate aberrant ly remain obscure. Even more challenging is the identification of early aggregation -prone monomers and oligomeric species and their structural characterisation, since such species are aggregation -prone, short -lived and rapidly equilibrating. In this semin ar I will describe how we have been using different biochemical and biophysical methods to reveal insights into the mechanism(s) by which normally soluble proteins convert into amyloidogenic conformations, how bimolecular collisions between non -native prot eins can result in very different outcomes of assembly and how we have used small molecules to modulate the aggregation process. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Monomer dynamics control the first steps of aggregation and folding Lisa Lapidus Departments of Physics and Astronomy, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Michigan State University lapidus@pa.msu.edu An important aspect of protein folding is understanding how folding competes with aggregation, which leads to diseases such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers. The complexity and dynamics of unfolded protein ensembles may be the ultimate speed limit of folding and play a crucial role in aggregation. In my lab over the past several years we have investigated the reconfiguration dynamic s of unfolded proteins by measuring the rate of intramolecular diffusion, the rate one part of the chain diffuses relative to another. We have measured diffusion coefficients ranging over three orders of magnitude and observed that aggregation -prone sequen ces tend to fall in the middle of this range. In this talk, I shall present our experiments on alpha -synuclein, the Alzheimers peptide and various prion sequences. We correlated intramolecular diffusion of the disordered protein with solution conditions t hat promote aggregation. Finally, we have begun measurements on small molecule aggregation inhibitors and found that some can prevent aggregation by shifting intramolecular diffusion out of the dangerous middle range. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Protein structure prediction/dete rmination by global optimization Jooyoung Lee Center for In Silico Protein Science and School of Computational Sciences, Korea Institute for Advanced Study jlee@kias.re.kr, lee.kias.re.kr First, I will discuss our recent progresses on the protein structure prediction using the methodology of global optimization as illustrated in the CASP11 competition held in 2014. We will demonstrate that this method can be applied to difficult MR (molecular replacement) targets to determine X -ray crystallography structures of proteins and protein complexes, which could not be solved using conventional MR methods. We will also discuss the possible application of our method to the high throughput NMR structure determination of large proteins (over 20 kDa) and membra ne proteins. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM A reaction coordinate for amyloid beta m isfolding Sudipta Maiti Tata Institute of Fundamenta l Research maiti@tifr.res.in Misfolding, like folding, is a highly multidimensional process. However, it may be possible to identify spatial coordinate(s) (i.e. specific intra -protein distance parameters) which largely describe the overall process, and manifest/control the main kinetic events. We study misfolding and aggregation of the Am yloid - peptide, a phenomenon associated with Alzheimers disease. Using a combination of fluorescence and solid state NMR spectroscopy, we identify a few atomic level reaction coordinates which capture the essence of the transitions between the initial monomeric to the final fibrillar state, through identifiable intermediates. Significantly, the evolution of these coordinates closely mirror the evolution of function of this toxic peptide.They provide us with a handle to monitor and potentially disrupt the progression towards toxicity. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Revisiting supersaturation as a factor determining amyloid fibrillation Yuji Goto Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University gtyj8126@protein.osaka -u.ac.jp Amyloid fibrils involved in various diseases are formed by a nucleation -growth mechanism, similar to the crystallization of solutes from solution. To study amyloid fibrils, we developed several types of unique techniques. First, to visualize amyloid fibrils, we combined total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) with amyloid -specific thioflavin T fluorescence (1). With this approach, we succeeded in observing the growth of amyloid fibrils in real -time at a single fibrillar level for various amyloidogenic proteins including A . Second, we showed that ultrasonication is one of the best means of accelerating amyloi d nucleation and thus the formation of fibrils (2, 3) . By combining a water bath -type ultrasonicator and a microplate reader, we constructed a HANdai Amyloid Burst Inducer (HANABI), which enables a high - throughput analysis of ultrasonication -forced amyloid formation of proteins (4). Third, calorimetry, one of the most powerful methods used to study the thermodynamic properties of globular proteins, has not played a s ignificant role in understanding protein aggregation. We succeeded with 2-microglobulin in direct heat measurements of the formation of amyloid fibrils using isothermal titration calorimeter (5). Our results with various approaches indicate that the solutions of denatured proteins are often supersaturated above the solubility limit and ultrasonic agitations release the supersaturation effectively, excluding solvated monomers to form fibrils. We suggest that amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates are similar to the crystals and glasses of solutes, respectively, and supersaturation is required to form crystal -like amyloid fibrils. We propose a general view of how the structures of protein and peptide precipitates vary from single crystals to amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates, in which \"solubility\" and \"supersat uration\" play critical roles (3, 6, 7) .

These dynamically restrained water molecules in the hydration layer of proteins are termed as \"Biological Water\" and play critical role in the folding,enzyme catalysis, protein - DNA and prote in-protein interactions and aggregation. Protein misfolding and aggregation resulting in amyloid formation are associated with a variety of debilitating human disease such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and transmissible prion diseases, systemic, amyloidosis and cancer. My laboratory is involved in addressing some important structural, dynamical, nanoscopic and mechanistic issues of an emerging class of amyloid -forming proteins known as Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). IDPs challenge the tenets of tra ditional sequence -structure -function paradigm and are associated with important functions and diseases. Using a diverse array of biophysical and biochemical techniques, we have previously shown how these proteins undergo a disorder -to-order transition duri ng amyloid formation. Recently, using femtosecond and picosecond time -resolved fluorescence spectroscopy,we have embarked upon studies aimed at unraveling the crucial role of hydration dynamics in the conformational transition and aggregation of disease -related IDPs. I will discuss our recent ultrafast spectroscopic results that illuminate the intriguing behavior of water molecules in IDPs and reveal a novel mechanistic aspect of aberrant protein aggregation. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Microsecond protein dynamics revealed by two -dimensional fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy Tahei Tahara Molecular Photonics, RIKEN tahei@riken.jp Conformational heterogeneity and structural fluctuation are essential molecular properties of biomacromolecules. Protein folding is a central problem for which these properties are extensively studied, and the single -molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) technique is an indispensable tool for such studies. Recently, the microsecond dynamics of protein folding have attracted much interest because of a number of reasons. For instance, the speed limit of protein folding is supposed to be ~1 \u00b5s and it closely relates to the roughness of the folding free energy landscap e as well as to the internal friction of the polypeptide chain in the unfolded state. Furthermore, microsecond structural fluctuations in the native and intermediate states are highly relevant to protein functions as well as protein -protein interactions. I n addition, direct comparison with molecular dynamics simulation with experimental observation is possible for the dynamics on the microsecond time scale. Therefore, experimental elucidation of the microsecond conformational dynamics of proteins is critica lly important for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the folding processes of proteins. Although several pioneering attempts have been made to detect submicro - to microsecond dynamics with smFRET techniques, it is still very challenging to detect t ransient states with a microsecond time - resolution. Recently, we have developed a new single -molecule technique, i.e. two -dimensional fluorescence lifetime correlation (FCS) and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, which has enabled us to investigate the microsecond structural dynamics of proteins. In this presentation, we will report on the application of 2D -FLCS to the study on the conformational dynamics of cytochrome c [2] as well as BdpA [3], and discuss the relevant energy landscape of the protein folding.

Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Every molecule is special: e nzyme molecules in action Gilad Haran Weizm ann Institute of Science Gilad.Haran@weizmann.ac.il The catalytic mechanisms of complex biological machines, such as enzymes, may involve a combination of chemical steps and conformational transitions. The latter are often times hidden to traditional biochemical investigations, but can be exposed by single -molecule experiments. I will first discuss an intriguing feature of enzymes when probed on the single molecule level, namely static and dynamic disorder: different molecules catalyze at different rates, and even the same molecule can switch its rate during activity. An attempt to understand this phenomenon using single -molecule spectroscopy has led us to discover strong correlations between conformational dynamics at different sites on the same enzyme molecule (1). Single -molecule FRET is an ideal tool to probe the conformational dynamics accompanying enzyme catalysis. We have used single -molecule FRET to constrain mechanistic models for the activity of QSOX, a sophisticated catalyst of disulfide bond formation with two active sites (2). Most recently, we developed a novel photon -by-photon analysis method that facilitates studying conformational dynamics even on the microsecond time scale, and applied our new method to the domain closure of the enzyme adenylate k inase. Surprisingly, we find that the bound enzyme opens and closes its domains much faster than the unbound enzyme, and two orders of magnitudes faster than the turnover rate of the enzyme! This exciting finding, which radically deviates from previous obs ervations on adenylate kinase, suggests that the domain closure of this enzyme occurs multiple times before the right conformation is found for the chemical step to occur (3).

Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM A general mechanism for mutation -induced destabilization and modulation ofallosteric coupling in Madras athi@iitm.ac.in Mutations in the hydrophobic interior of proteins are generally thought to weaken the interactions only in their immediate neighborhood. This forms the basis of protein -engineering based studies of folding mechanism and function. However, mutational work on diverse proteins has shown that distant residue s are thermodynamically coupled, with the network of interactions within the protein acting as signal conduits, thus raising an intriguing paradox. Are mutational effects localized and if no, is there a general rule for the extent of percolation and on the functional form of this propagation? We explore these questions from multiple perspectives in the current work. Perturbation analysis of interaction networks within proteins and microsecond - long molecular dynamics simulations of several aliphatic mutants of ubiquitin reveal strong evidence for distinct alteration of distal residue -residue communication networks. We find that mutational effects consistently propagate into the second shell of the altered site (even up to15 - 20 \u00c5) in proportion to the perturba tion magnitude and dissipates with a decay distance -constant of ~4 -5 \u00c5. We also report evidence for this phenomenon from published experimental NMR data that strikingly resemble predictions from network theory and MD simulations. Reformulatin g these observations onto a statistical mechanical model, we reproduce the stability changes of 375 mutations from 19 single -domain proteins. Our work thus reveals a robust energy dissipation -cum-signaling mechanism in the interaction network within protei ns, quantifies the partitioning of destabilization energetics around the mutation neighborhood and presents a simple theoretical framework for modeling the allosteric effects of point mutations. Lectures THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Observation of nanometer fluctuations in a multifunctional protein complex Hagen Hofmann1,3, 2Department of Physics 3Department of Structural Biology hagen.hofmann@weizmann.ac.il Dynamics and flexibility are essential for protein function but are often difficult to probe and quantify. Ultrafast three -color single -molecule FRET allows us to probe flexibility in a folded complex of two intrinsically disordered proteins on previously inaccessible time - and length scales. Despite its high stability, the complex fluctuates on sub -microsecond timescales with nanometer amplitudes. Three -color photon cor relations combined with molecular simulations reveal a lack of long -range collectivity in these dynamics, suggesting that rapidly exchanging interactions stabilize the complex. Our results show that high affinity and large -scale flexibility in protein comp lexes are not mutually exclusive but rather constitute a design principle to enable multifunctionality at the expense of a rigid three -dimensional structure.

To understand how the unstructured NTR modulates misfolding of the structured C -terminal domain (CTD), the effects of two pathogenic mutations, G113V and A116V in the palindromic region of the NTR, on the misfolding and oligomerization of the mouse prion protein (moPrP) were studied. Although they had no effect on the structure, stability or dynamics of moPrP under native conditions, both mutations significantly accelerated both misfolding and oligomerization under misfolding conditions. Unlike in the case of wt moPrP, for which misfolding and oligomeriza tion appeared to occur concurrently, oligomerization was shown to precede misfolding in the case of both G113V and A116V moPrP. The temporal sequence of misfolding events in the unstructured NTR and in the of G113V and A116V moPrP was deline ated by kinetic hydrogen deuterium exchange -mass spectrometry experiments. Sequence segment 89 -132 from the NTR became structured, albeit weakly, during the oligomerization of both G113V and A116V moPrP. Importantly, it was seen that this occurs prior to s tructural change in the CTD, wherein the unfolding of helix 1 appeared to occur concurrently with the conformational conversion of helix 2 and helix 3 . Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Graded Structural Polymorphism in a Bacterial Thermosensor Protein Abhishek Narayan Naganathan Bhupat & Jyoti School of Biosciences Department of Biotechnology, IITM nar.abhishek@gmail.com Thermosensing is critical for the expression of virulence genes in pathogenic bacteria that infect warm -blooded hosts. Proteins of the Hha -family, conserved among enterobacteriaceae, have been implicated in dynamically regulating the expression of a large number of genes upon temperature shifts. However, there is little mechanistic evidence at the molecular leve l as to how changes in temperature are transduced into structural changes and hence the functional outcome. In this study, we delineate the conformational behavior of Cnu, a putative molecular thermosensor, employing diverse spectroscopic, calorimetric an d hydrodynamic measurements. We find that Cnu displays probe -dependent unfolding in equilibrium, graded increase in structural fluctuations and temperature -dependent swelling of the dimensions of its native ensemble within the physiological range of temper atures, features that are indicative of a highly malleable native ensemble. Site -specific fluorescence experiments in combination with coarse - grained and all -atom MD simulations reveal that the fourth helix of Cnu acts as a unique thermosensing module disp laying varying degree of order and orientation in response to temperature modulations. Our combined experimental -computational study unravels the folding - functional landscape of a natural thermosensor protein, highlights how functional constraints regulate specific folding -mechanistic behaviors and the design principles orchestrating the signal transduction roles of the Hha protein family. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Conformational Conversion of the Prion Protein in the Presence Centre for Protein Science, Design and Engineering, Department of Chemical Sciences and Departme nt of Biological Sciences, IISER Mohali aishwarya.mhg.bhu13@gmail.com Prion diseases belong to a unique class of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and are manifested as infectious, genetic and sporadic diseases. The key step in the pathogenesis is the misfolding and aggregati on of an endogenous GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchored protein, termed as the prion protein (PrP). The cellular -rich PrP is converted into a misfolded (protease -resistant) -rich isoform. Lipid membranes are hypothesized to play a key role in th e conversion to the pathogenic isoform. Our previous results have shown that in the presence of a membrane mimetic anionic detergent such as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), PrP converts into two types of oligomers. Highly ordered large -oligomers represent benign off -pathway intermediates that lack the ability to mature into amyloid fibrils. On the contrary, predominantly unstructured, small oligomers are capable of switching to ordered amyloids that are toxic to mammalian cells. These amyloids exhibited re markable amyloid -polymorphism possessing varied nanoscale morphology. We are currently investigating the role of negatively charged lipid membranes in the prion conversion using an array of biochemical and biophysical techniques. Our preliminary data showi ng the synthetic lipid -mediated conversion of PrP will also be presented. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Formation of inclusion bodies poses a major hurdle in obtaining recombinant protein from E. coli . Akansha Singh National Institute Of Immunology akansha.singh@nii.ac.in Urea and guanidine hydrochloride have routinely been used as solubilization agents for inclusion bodies, but many a times result in poor recovery of bioactive protein. Mild solubilization has been shown to be an effective method f or high throughput recovery of bioactive protein from bacterial inclusion bodies and also result in improved yield as compared to conventional solubilization methods. High pH buffers, detergents and organic solvents have been successfully used as mild solu bilization agents. Here we show recovery of bioactive human growth hormone from bacterial inclusion bodies using organic solvents like n -propanol, -mercaptoethanol and trifluoroethanol as solubilization agents. These organic solvents act as effective yet mild solubilization agents by denaturing the tertiary structure and preserving secondary structure of inclusion body proteins. We also show that organic solvents can be used to solubilize inclusion bodies of a number of different proteins. This also encou rages screening different organic solvents for solubilization of inclusion body proteins. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Role of C -terminal Extension on the Structure and Chaperone Function of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp16.3 Alok Kumar Panda and Ashis Biswas School Basic Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar abiswas@iitbbs.ac.in Hsp16.3 is a major immunodominant antigen of M. tuberculosis . Its molecular chaperone function is important for the growth and survival of this pathogen in macrophages. The importance of N -terminal region on the structure and chaperone function of Hsp16.3 is well understood. But, the role of C -terminal region (CTR) on its structure and function is still unclear. Therefore, we cloned, over -expressed and purified wild -type (Hsp 16.3 1-144/Hsp16.3WT) function similar to wild -type protein; whereas, deletion of three residues from CTE (Hsp16.3 1- 141/Hsp16.3C3) triggers the perturbation in the tertiary structure, dissociation of oligomeric assembly (dodecamer to nonamer/trimer), enhancement in subunit dynamics (~1.5 folds) and improvement in t he chaperone function of Hsp16.3. Interestingly, these structural modulations (except oligomeric dissociation) and chaperoning strength reaches (Hsp16.3 the degree of oligomeric dissociation of Hsp16.3 which is completed (trimer only) upon the truncation of entire CTR (Hsp16.3 1- 128/Hsp16.3C16). Overall, our study suggests a \"new structural element\" in the CTR i.e. C - terminal extension which plays an important role in oligomerization, subunit exchange dynamics and chaperone function of Hsp16.3. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Small Molecule Based Investigation on Different Stages of Alpha Synuclein Aggregation Amrita Kundu , Sumanta Ghosh, Krishnananda Laboratory, Structural Biology and Bioinformatics Division, CSIR -Indian Institute of Ch emical Biology amrita.katwa@gmail.com disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, affecting 1 -2% of the population older than 65 years and 4 -5% of those aged over 85 years. PD is a movement disorder, associated with different motor and nonmotor syndromes, arising from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of s ubstantia nigra. The hallmark of PD is the observation of intracellular protein aggregates, Lewy Bodies (LB). Alpha synuclein is one of the major components of this LB. The heterogeneity of aggregation process and the presence of large number of triggering mechanisms results in the difficulty to devise therapeutic strategies against these toxic inclusions formation. There have been continuing efforts to search for small molecules against alpha synuclein aggregation. With the help of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), confocal imaging, FRAP and other biophysical experimentswe have studied the early and late events of alpha synuclein aggregation. Subsequently, we have explored the possibilities of identifying possible small molecules, whic h would prevent early oligomer formation. For the FCS experiments, we have labeled a single cysteine mutant of alpha synuclein (G132C) using Alexa488 Maleimide. Our FCS data have shown significant changes in the conformation of the protein in the presence of an inhibiting small molecule. To obtain additional insights into these molecules; we have studied their effects inside two mammalian model cell lines, namely HeLa and SH -SY5Y. For this purpose, we have transiently transfected the cells using a tetra -cysteine tagged alpha synuclein, following which the cells have been stained using Flash -EDT2 dye for fluorescence imaging and FRAP studies. The results show that the electrostatic differences between the protein and the small molecules contribute significant ly towards the ability of the small molecules to modulate the early and late stages of aggregation. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Biochemical and Structural Role of 104EWGWS108: An Insert Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fun damental Research anasuya_moitra@yahoo.co.in Plasmodium falciparum enolase (Pfeno) has insert, 104EWGWS108 that is conserved in apicomplexans and plants and absent in host enol ases. To examine the functional role of this insert, a deletion variant was made which resulted in poor affinity for cofactor Mg2+, a ~100 fold decrease in kcat/Km and dissociation of the native dimeric form into monomers (Vora et al. (2009), Arch. Biochem Biophys 485, 128 -138). To assess the importance of individual residues, site -directed mutagenesis was employed and the following decreased enzymatic activity and affinity for cofactor Mg2+, but the native dimeric form was retained. However, substituting the Trp residues with Ala/Lys not only drastically reduced the enzymatic activity, but also led to monomerization of rPfen o. Expressing the Trp variants as GST tagged proteins, led to dimerization of the enzyme. Such a stabilization of the subunit -subunit interface interactions via GST induced dimerization of rPfeno led to partial restoration of enzyme activity. Thus, the eff ects of these mutations reveal the importance of the insert in maintaining the active state as well as the three dimensional structure of Plasmodium falciparum enolase. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Development of Research (IISER) anjalijha@aripune.org The pathological hallmark of the Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid (A) peptide aggregates in the Brain. The current therapeutics available for AD are known to mask the symptoms of the disease temporarily. Newer and more effective drugs thus need to be developed to cure AD. Small peptides are fast emerging as possible therapeutic mole cules for AD. These peptides known as -sheet breaker peptides (BSBPs) bind to aggregates of full length A peptide and inhibit the formation of fibrils. Currently, peptide -based therapeutics suffer from multiple problems and are not yet approved for clini cal trials. One of the major limitation is its poor proteolytic stability and its delivery. Novel strategies are therefore required to improve the therapeutic efficacy and delivery of peptides. We have synthesized a series of novel peptides using solid p hase peptide synthesis method and fmoc chemistry. Screening of the synthesized peptides were carried out to identify the peptides with higher efficiency to disrupt the fibril formation for A 1 - 42 peptide. This was performed by studying the kinetics aggre gation of A 1 -42 peptide in presence or absence of synthesized therapeutic peptides. The kinetics were quantified using various method like Thioflavin -T fluorescence intensity, congo red binding & turbidity assay. Aggregation of A 1 -42 in presence of the rapeutic peptides showed a lower rate of aggregation and the amount of fibril formation was also decreased significantly. Further, when the internal structures of amyloid fibrils of A 1 - 42 peptide were probed using circular dichroism spectroscopy, it show ed a complete loss of - sheet content of fibrils on co -incubation with therapeutic peptides. The results indicate that these peptides possess promising characteristic akin to BSBP. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Interface aromatics demarcate membrane protein folding and aggregation Ankit Gupta and Radhakrishnan Mahalakshmi* Molecular Biophysics Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Educatio n and Research, Bhopal agupta@iiserb.ac.in Polypeptide self -assembly into a folded, bioactive conformation occurs through controlled and rapid formation of thermodynamically favorable native contacts. Non -native interactions induce frustrated folding kinetics, causing protein misfolding and aggrega tion. This results in amyloidogenesis and several debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. It is known that interface residues act as anchoring elements in membrane proteins. Hence, we investigated the importance of aromatic amino acids in defining membran e protein folding, stability and aggregation kinetics using the outer membrane -barrel Ail (Attachment invasion locus protein) from Yersiniapestis . Ail shows rapid unfolding and irreversible thermal denaturation coupled with protein aggregation. We demons trate that the stability and aggregation propensity of Ail is controlled by the nature and position of interface aromatics (Y>F>W>A). Further, aggregation kinetics of Ail involves irreversible \"seeding\" by non -native unfolding intermediates. The aggregate s show distinct amyloid like morphology. Overall, we propose a mechanism for irreversible association in transmembrane -barrels and similarities and differences in the aggregation pathways. Most interestingly, our studies identify a sizeable contribution of the kinetic component in membrane protein stability. We find an evolutionary importance for different amino acids to maintain optimal folding and stability. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Examining the Mechanical Properties of Apo - and Copper -bound Azurin s using Single -Molecule Force Tata Institute of Fundamental Research anju.yadav@tifr.res.in The metal -ligand bonds in metalloproteins are of special interest for their partial covalent character and redox properties. How metal ions influence the stability and dynamics of proteins is remains to be understood. Here, we used force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) to study the effect of copper on the mechanical stability of azurin which is a periplasmic protein which undergoes forced -unfolding during translocati on from cytoplasm to periplasm. The unraveling of both apo and holo azurin show two distinct force p eaks with a contour length of ~6 nm between peaks. Holo azurin requires ~10pN higher force than apo form. SMD indicated that the unraveling is always initiated from the C -terminus by rupture of -strands 7 -8 and 2B -8. Both techniques show that 1st transiti on state (TS) is identical in both forms of azurin. The 2nd TS is distinct in two forms due to additional constraint by copper coordination, which is confirmed by the simulations.

Solvent accessibility of the native disulfide bond of azurin in the X -ray structure and in MD simulation showed that only ~15% of its surface area is accessible to the external aqueous solvent. Indeed, we have found from our pulling experiments that the native disulfide bond is inaccessible and resistant to chemical reduction by DTT and -mercapto -ethanol. However, the disulfide bond gets exposed after the initial rupture of the native state and undergoes mechano -chemical reduction in SMFS experiments. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Microsolvation assisted membrane insertion of Bcl Bose Institute, 2 Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology atanuchem48@gmail.com Bcl-xl, a protein of Bcl -2 family remains distributed over cytosol and mitochondrial membrane maintaining a balance between apoptosis and survival of cell. Translocation to membrane is essential for its biological functions (i.e. to antagonize pro -apoptotic proteins of Bcl2 family) which is known to be initiated by insertion of C -terminal into the membrane. This tail is understood from experiment to be predominantly helical in the aqueous condition, binding as a pseudo inhibitor to the protein itself, but gets released from confinement when it approaches to membrane. This work, hereby reports the energetic of the events associated with insertion of the helical tail into an all -atom membrane, which reveals an unfolding -refolding cycle. The peptide is most stable in fully inserted state where hydrophobic residues interact with hydrophobic tail of lipid and terminal charged residues are flanked to the charged head groups. Potential of mean force in 2D reveals that the peptide gets absorbed in a wide range of conformations at membrane -water interface followed by vertical insertion. Molecular dynamics further brings the insight that the peptide insertion associates an encapsulation of thin water layer around it throughout the course of insertion which plausibly motivates the protein to refold once the insertion is complete. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Dynamics of the growth of ds -DNA toroid Atreya Dey , Govardhan Reddy Indian Institute of Science atreya.dey@gmail.com A significant gap exists between experimental and theoretical work on ds -DNA folding and toroid formation regarding the length and the number of DNA molecules involved in a single toroid. While experimental systems use toroids with ~6 to 32 DNA molecules of ~3 kbp in a single toroid, till date simulations have only studied toroid formation by one, often shorter DNA molecule. To bridge this gap we performed Brownian Dynamics s imulations to investigate the nucleation followed by growth of DNA toroids. A coarse grained bead -spring model of DNA has been used without any explicit charges. The simulation methods were validated by calculating the Flory exponents of non -stiff polymers in good and bad solvents. Firstly mechanisms of toroid formation were investigated for DNA chains of length ~2560 bp by allowing DNA pre - equilibrated in a good solvent to collapse in a bad solvent. Afterwards mechanisms of toroid growth were investigated by attaching non -toroidal structures, also formed in bad solvent conditions like spindles or free chains on formed toroids. Facile collapse of non toroidal DNA onto DNA toroids was observed. The different pathways followed by this collapse and the structur e of the resulting toroid has been investigated and validated with experimental data.

Latha * Sri Venkateswara College (University of Delhi) avijit.podder@bic -svc.ac.in Dopamine receptors (DR) are neuronal cell surface proteins that mediate the action of neurotransmitter dopamine in brain. Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is a major therapeutic target for schizophrenia and Parkinsons disease. The third inter cellular loop (IC L3) in DRD2 is essential for coupling G proteins and several signaling scaffold proteins. We have examined the deleterious effect of serine to cysteine mutation at position 311 (S311C) in the ICL3 region that is genetically well associated with diseases li ke schizophrenia and alcoholism. An in silico structure modeling approach was employed to determine the wild type (WT) and mutant protein structures of DRD2. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to provide insights into essential dy namics of the modeled structures. To provide information on intra - molecular arrangement of the structures, a comprehensive residue interactions network was studied. Besides, protein -ligand and protein -protein docking protocols were exercised to compare the interactions of natural agonist (dopamine) and scaffold proteins - Gi/o and NEB2. We observed a marginal effect of the mutation in dopamine binding mechanism throughout the trajectories. However, we noticed a significant structural alteration of the muta nt receptor which affects Gi/o and NEB2 binding that can be causal for malfunctioning in cAMP -dependent signaling and Ca+ homeostasis.

Solid -like aggregates of prion -like proteins are a hallmark of many aging -associated diseases. Aberrant phase transitions might be one trigger causing aging - associated diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this aberrant phase transition and the strategies cells have developed to sustain the function of these aggregation - prone proteins remain largely enigmatic. Here, we present recent advances we made in understanding the mechanisms cells might have developed to prevent the liquid -solid phase transitions, by using a wide range of biochemical, biophysical and cell biology techniques. We find that electrolytes, small compounds and protein interactor s affect the liquid -liquid, as well as liquid -solid transitions.

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that AgNPs control the growth of mycobacterial species. But, whether AgNPs influence the growth of non -culturable M. leprae (causative agent of leprosy) is unclear. Additionally, whether AgNPs affect the functionality of antigens that are important for the survival of this pathogen is still unknown. Here, we have taken an attempt to understand the effect of AgNPs on the structure and chaperone function of 18 -kDa antigen, actually a small heat shock protein (HSP18), which plays a vital role in the virulence and survival of M. leprae.

It has been reported that there exists high correlation between the folding rate constant ( kf) of non -two-state protein and the number of non -local contact clusters ( Nc) obtained from the residue -residue contact map. This study suggests the importance of the arrangement of substructures ( -helices, -hairpins, and so on) for the folding kinetics in the no n-two-state proteins1,2. However, the corresponding correlations for the two -state proteins were shown to be less significant. We constructed the final non -redundant dataset of two -state (76) and non -two-state proteins (46) based on the complete experime ntal data and available databases in protein folding rates. We utilized this dataset to reinvestigate the relationship between (log kf) and (log Nc) for both non - two-state and two -state proteins by introducing the new definition of non -local contact cluster. Our data has revealed statistically significant correlation for both non -two-state and two -state proteins. However, the optimized parameters such as sequence separation ( L), steepness parameter ( ), cutoff distance ( dcut) and contact strength ( R) were different between the two -state and non -two-state protein. Long sequence separation, short -distance contact and high contact strength controls the folding of non -two-state proteins, while relatively short sequence separation, long-distance contact and very high contact strength controls the folding of two -state proteins. These results will be discussed in terms of the molecular mechanisms of folding of non -two-state proteins as well as two-state proteins. References: 1. Kamagata, K., Arai, M. & Kuwajima, K. (2004).

Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Evidence for Anti -parallel Beta Sheets in A Oligomers from Alzheimers disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the presence of extracellular deposits of plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, of which the major components are the fibril form of amyloid beta peptide [1, 2]. Recent studies have shown that although plaques are composed of fibrils, small oligomeric assemblies of the peptide generated during the early stages of peptide assembly are the major toxic species [2]. However, structural details of the oligomer species remain inaccessible to commonly used molecular structure determination techniques. Here, we examine the oligomer structure in solution using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We constructed atomistic fully solva ted models of oligomers of different sizes ranging from trimer to dodecamer, based on the structure of monomer unit from a fibril structural model (PDB ID: 2M4J). The models were sampled over time scale ranging from 40 -500 ns and structural markers obtaine d from IR, Raman and solid state NMR experiments [3] were followed to examine the oligomeric state. Based on average non-bonded interaction energy per monomer, the tetramer and pentamer species were found to be the most stable species over the time scale o f simulations. We find that oligomer structures larger than octamer are unstable in solution and break down into shorter oligomer components within 40 ns. We observed spontaneous formation of anti -parallel beta sheets for pentamer and hexamer fragments in solutions. The anti -parallel beta show -L34 contact, E22 -I31 consistent with emerging experimental data on oligomers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. References: 1. Xu (2013). Biophys. J. 287 -288. 3. Sarkar et al . (2014).

As evidenced by several reports, the link between the process of fibril formation and disease rests in the protofibrils and soluble oligomers formi ng transiently during the process. Therefore, the formation of stable oligomers under physiological conditions and their characterization are important and would help their detection in biological specimens. In this work, we report that human serum albumin (HSA) converts into amyloid -like protofibrils on mild stirring (230 RPM) of the protein in 60 mM sodium -phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C. Contrary to reported mechanism of HSA aggregation, we have shown that HSA aggregation under near -native condition is a nucleation -dependent process that can be seeded by aggregated HSA acting as nuclei. On the basis of a comparativeaggregation and stability studies of natural fatted -HSA and experimental fatty acid free HSA, we conclude that conformational/stability alteration of the HSA due to ligand removal is the main cause of the aggregation. Slow stirring, which does not significantly alter stability of the protein speed up the fibrillation process by known mechanisms such as increasing the air -water interface and breaking up large complexes and increasing the collision of reactive complexes with each other. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM The role of residues forming the B/C barrel in conformational transitions of belongs to a small subset of proteins that exist naturally in energetically less stable state(s). Many members of this superfamily are inhibitory proteins controlling proteolytic cascades. The core serpin fold is composed of three -sheets (A -C) and an exposed mobile reactive center loop (RCL) connecting -strands s5A of A s1C -sheet. The RCL upon cleavage by a protease inserts in the central A -sheet of the protein thereby translocating the covalently attached protease by 70 to the opposite pole of the molecule. In the process, the protease is irreversibly inactivated and the serpin is transformed into its thermodynamically more stable alterna tive fold. Of the three - sheets, the A -sheet is labile while the B - and C -sheets interact to form a stable -barrel (B/C barrel) which is reported as an early forming structure in serpin folding. The RCL insertion in the A-sheet is also known to occur in the absence of a protease, a state referred to as latent form, but results in a non -functional serpin. In the latency transition and in polymer formation, in addition to the conformational change in the RCL, the -strand s1C detaches from the C -sheet (or t he B/C barrel) and adopts a loop like structure. Interactions in the B/C barrel in stabilizing the RCL via s1C is important for understanding folding of serpins to its functional metastable state or its other structural form(s). Of the known human Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor -1 (PAI1) spontaneously undergoes latency transition with a t 1/2 of about 2 hrs in plasma. Thus, PAI1 allows monitoring all the various conformations in serpins. We selected 22 residues of the B/C barrel in PAI -1 and made al anine substitutions at these positions to create single mutants. The role of each of these residues in the structure and function of PAI1 as a protease inhibitor will be presented in this poster.

However, the direct observation and unambiguous assignment of this inherent dynamics in chemically denatured proteins are challenging due to various experimental limitations. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) such as -Synuclein, are excellent systems to study the torsional dynamics since their inherent conformational fluctuations are independent of any extraneous factor. In order to directly ma p the backbone torsional mobility, we created a number of single -tryptophan variants encompassing the entire chain. We then utilized picosecond time - resolved fluorescence depolarization measurements that allowed us to discern the site -specific torsional re laxation at a low protein concentration under physiological condition. Our results show the presence of a characteristic relaxation time of ~1.4 ns. We are now evaluating if different fluorescence labels at Cys variants can be used to recapitulate the tors ional dynamics and the effect of dye linker on the correlation time.

Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) has been a ubiquitously used technique to probe these motions. Generally, HDX has two outcomes: 1) peptide level resolution in terms of observed rates and 2) amplitude (# of amide hydroge ns exchanged with deuterium in a peptide fragment).We used all atom molecular dynamics simulations to get atomic insight into HDX data. We calculate mechanical force at atomic level associated with amide bonds and depth to understand the relationship of th ese atomic forces with HDX data. We find that no single structural property alone can best explain HDX amplitudes. Forces alone give a fairly good picture of amplitude but not the best. The forces in combination with depth best represent HDX amplitudes. Pr esence of mild concentration of Guanidinium Hydrochloride (~1M) is not significant to affect the network of atomic forces. Although coordination numbers show Guanidinium ions stick to specific parts of the protein, in simulated time, forces do not explain any relationship between HDX rates and timescale (reciprocal of observed rates). Therefore, the exact role of mild denaturant remains unclear. We found few residues showed an open state; consistent with a recent study.

Typically, the ANTAR domain occur along with s ignal -sensing domain suggesting signal dependent gene control. Classical bacterial ANTAR domains form a three -helical structure showing high sequence conservation. However, recent studies have identified a family of GTPases that contain a structurally sim ilar classical ANTAR domain having less sequence conservation. These GTPases with \"ANTAR -like\" domains occur in a subset of bacteria (eg. RbgA from Bacillus subtilis) and Lsg1, Mtg1 in and C -terminal extensions in eukaryotes.

How these proteins recognize the ribosome, its modulation by GTP, the role of \" ANTAR -like\" domain and N, C-terminal extensions remains unstudied. We are attempting to use different structural -bioinformatic approaches such as threading and ab- initio modeling methods along with MD -simulations to obtain confident model structures.

Perturbing these conditions allows one to explore how proteins respond to changes in environment. This also helps to characterize protein energy landscapes because perturbant effects are related to the structure and energetics of the different protein states along the energy landscape. The effect of perturbants on protein stability is related to the structure of the native and denatured state, while the effect of perturbants on protein kinetics is related to the folding pathway. We have developed a technique called chemo -mechanical unfolding where we combine force and chemical denaturan t using optical tweezers.

Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Use of designed sequences in protein structure and Unit, Indian Institute of Science gayatrikumar@mbu.iisc.ernet.in It is common knowledge that the protein sequence space is increasing at a disproportionately faster pace in comparison to the structure space. Improvements in next generation sequencing methods has further widened this gap. Knowledge of the structure of a protein is crucial in characterizing its biochemical function, making us e of information on other members of the same fold. However, the protein structure space is riddled with gaps and there exists a dearth of proteins which serve as evolutionary linkers between distantly related protein families. This limits the association of remotely related families through sequence searches hence curtailing attempts at relating a protein family of unknown structure with a remote homolog of known structure. In this work we used a search space consisting of natural protein sequences augment ed with artificial protein -like sequences, which were designed to serve as bridges that link distantly related natural protein families. For our study we adopted an iterative sequence search method which exploited the use of designed sequences as linkers a nd identified relatives however distant, of the queried sequences. This we hoped would serve as a significant start point in structure prediction through fold assignment for protein families with yet unknown structure. We identified the number of protein d omain families associated with a known structure in literature and identified the number of correct fold assignments made by our approach. We observed that in 99% of the cases we were successful. Further, the extension of our approach to protein domain families of yet unknown structure resulted in the robust fold assignment for over 3000 protein domain families. Detailed analysis of a few cases revealed blocks of residues conserved between the sequence and structure domains, which could be implicated in fun ction. One of the prospective applications of this study is to decrease the limitations in the routine search algorithms imposed by the paucity of structural neighbors for making reliable fold associations.

Intact mass spectrometry based study was carried out with the largest and smallest isoforms of tau to ge t deeper insight into the effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature and solvent polarity on the structure of the protein. For the first time we report that at physiological pH, three distinct conformations of the protein, viz unfolded, intermediate, and c ompact exist. An increase in pH showed an increase in the compact population, reaching maxima near isoelectric point of the protein, whereas acidic pH shifts the conformation completely towards unfolded population. Compaction of structure correlated with the enhanced fibrillation at alkaline pH. Similarly on increasing ionic strength, tau showed compaction due to charge neutralization, followed by unfolding of the less -structured population due to electrostatic repulsion. An increase in temperature showed s light compaction possibly due to increased hydrophobic interaction. Decrease in solvent polarity unwinds the protein, stabilizing further unfolded states. The study shows both lack of hydrophobicity and high net charge at physiological pH is responsible fo r the unfolded nature of tau and factors driving the protein towards more compact population might trigger its fibrillation.

But when CcdB is embraced by gyrase, only a part of binding site remains accessible for CcdA to interact and CcdA can displace gyrase off CcdB. This interesting obser vation has been proposed to be the result of allosteric changes happening due to binding of a part of CcdA to CcdB -gyrase complex. Using Normal Mode Analysis, we have observed change in dynamics between CcdB in free form, CcdA bound and gyrase bound forms hinting towards possibility of little difference in the conformational space accessible to the CcdB molecule. Using Perturbation Response Scanning method, residues of CcdB known to be involved in CcdA binding were perturbed and changes were observed at sit es involved in gyrase binding. All these observations give an idea about how binding of one protein to already existing protein complex can cause dissociation of proteins.

Here we report the distinctive absorption of a synthetic 67 residue protein ( 3C) devoid of aromatic amino -acids in the 250 -500 nm region. Molecular Dynamics simulations of 3C reveal inter -residue interactions between lysine amino acids mediated by water and lysine -glutamate salt bridges. TDDFT calculations on individual and clusters of amino acid fragments show that the unique spectral signatures beyond 250 nm arise from charge transfer transi tions involving both, the amino (NH 3+)/carboxylate (COO-) headgroups of lysine/glutamate and the peptide backbone. The long tail of the experimental absorption spectra from 300 -500 nm is attributed to the sensitivity of the charge transfer transitions to t he amino acid conformation, interaction between charged amino acids, and their solvation environment. Indeed, the charge transfer band is shown to be sensitive to thermal destabilization of 3C. Our studies introduce a novel spectral window (300-500 nm) for optical probes of protein structure and dynamics. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Probing misfolding kinetics at the monomeric level during protein aggregation Ishita Sengupta and Jayant B. Udgaonkar National Centre for Biological Sciences ishitas@ncbs.res.in Protein aggregation is often synonymous with beta -sheet formation. As a result, ensemble probes tracking overall secondary structural changes like Circular dichroism and Thioflavin T binding assays have been commonly employed to study protein aggregation k inetics. However, to probe the exact sequence of events which culminate in such drastic conformational changes is not trivial. Since both intra and intermolecular effects are operational in protein aggregation, a major challenge is to tease apart their con tributions to the overall process. Here, using mouse prion protein as a model system, we attempt to specifically probe the intramolecular changes that occur in the monomer during oligomerization. Briefly, the kinetics of co -aggregation of a Trp - less mutant and several carefully designed single Trp -single Cys mutants (spanning the various secondary structural elements) of the protein were measured using steady -state FRET. While most probes traditionally used to follow protein aggregation output an average ra te at which the protein aggregates (and/or changes conformation), our data suggest that intramolecular conformational changes take place with variable kinetics, allowing the elucidation of the steps through which misfolding proceeds.

Here we report the conformational properties of a panel of disordered proteins having sequence com positions typical of folded proteins. Small angle X -ray scattering (SAXS) finds that their conformational ensembles are highly expanded in water. An analysis of the SAXS curves finds that the Flory exponent, which describes the collapse propensity of a cha in, is 0.53. This value is between the ideal self -avoiding random walk (=0.59) and the theta solvent limit where intra -chain attraction exactly counterbalances excluded volume terms in an otherwise random walk (=\u00bd). The addition of moderate amounts of denaturants results in very mild expansion. Simulations generate a molecular form factor applicable to IDPs that can be used to determine the Rg and from a single SAXS measurement. These findings along with recent re -evaluation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies largely resolves the ongoing SAXS/ FRET controversy concerning the behavior of disorder proteins.

Human cell surface antigen protein VlsE; a two state folder was FRET labelled in order to report on its folding/unfolding. The protein was subjected to periodic thermal modulation below its melting temperature. On top of the periodic thermal modulation, controlled artificial noise was added to monitor the effect of noise on protein unfolding reactions. The phase shift in the donor and acceptor signal as a function of driving frequency reveale d the reaction rates. We observed a maximum in the signal as a function of thermal noise confirming that addition of artificial noise was in fact capable of driving the unfolding reaction for the protein. Simulation of a small model -protein, and our experi mental result both show clear evidence that correlated noise is a physically and chemically plausible mechanism by which cells could modulate biomolecular dynamics during threshold processes such as signaling.

Growing evid ences suggest that tau and -Syn interact and form amyloids in a pathologically relevant manner, which results in several neurological ailments like Parkinsons Disease, Alzheimers Disease, Down syndrome, Multiple System Atrophy, etc. However, the molecul ar and structural determinants of tau --Syn interactions are not yet clearly understood. We are investigating the de novo molecular interactions between these two proteins using multiparametric fluorescence techniques. The aggregation of tau and -Syn unde r identical solution conditions were monitored separately using Thioflavin T as an amyloid marker. We observed that -Syn forms amyloids via a nucleation -dependent polymerization mechanism whereas tau did not aggregate in the absence of heparin. Upon addit ion of monomeric -Syn, tau readily aggregates with a short lag phase. We speculate that the aggregation is primarily driven by electrostatic interactions between tau and -Syn and subsequent formation of obligatory oligomers that mature into amyloid fibri ls. Additionally, the structural insights into -Syn aggregates at a residue specific level will be discussed. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Functional instability in Transcription Activator -Like Effectors 1Johns of Biophysics, 2University of Illinois Urbana -Champaign Materials Science and Engineering, 3Howard Hughes Medical Institute kgeiger2@jhu.edu Transcription activator -like effector proteins (TALEs) contain large numbers of repeats that bind double stranded DNA, wrapping around DNA to form a continuous superhelix. Since unbound TALEs retain superhelical structure, it seems likely that DNA binding requires a significantstructural distortion or partial unfolding. We have used nearest -neighbor \"Ising\" analysis of consensus TALE (cTALE) repeat unfolding to quantify intrinsic folding free energies, coupling energies between repeats, and the free energy distribution of partly unfolded states. We find a moderate level of cooperativity for cTALEs (stabilizing interfaces combined with unstable repeats), at values intermediate between those of TPR and ankyrin repeat proteins (low and high cooperativity, respe ctively). Using parameters from the Ising analysis, we have analyzed the distribution of partly folded states as a function of cTALE length. We findthat partly unfolded states with one or more unfolded repeats are energetically accessible. To quantify th e DNA binding of cTALES, and to probe the dependence of DNA binding dynamics on accessibility to partially folded states, single molecule Total Internal Reflection (smTIRF) experiments were performed. Immobilized Cy3 -labelled cTALEs incubated with Cy5 - labelled dsDNA show an average FRET efficiency of ~0.45. When immobilized protein is incubated with DNA in 200 mM KCl, many on and off events occur in single traces. Long movies were collected for cTALEs incubated with increasing DNA concentrations. FRET of single molecules was fit using Hidden Markov modeling analysis, and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for on and off dwell times of many molecules were generated. CDFs for on and off events are well fitted by double exponentials, suggesting a complicat ed kinetic binding process. The fast on phase is DNA concentration dependent, while the slow phase is not DNA concentration dependent, suggesting a fast bimolecular binding event (5.9x108 nM-1*sec-1) and a unimolecular isomerization (0.15 sec-1). The near -diffusion limited association indicates that association is not limited by the cTALE superhelical structure, and is consistent with rearrangement to a binding -competent (perhaps partly unfolded) state. It is possible that the subsequent slow isomerization involves locking the superhelix onto the DNA. Neither the fast nor slow off phase shows a DNA concentration dependence (1.2 sec-1 and 0.13 sec-1), suggesting an isomerization in the bound state as well. Progress on binding kinetics of entropy enhancing variants will be discussed to explore how partly folded states affect DNA binding kinetics.

We examined the cooperativity determinants of PP32, a leucine rich repeat protein with a linear topology which exhibits increasing stability from the N - to the C -terminus. We made mutations in PP32 that created cavities at different locations in the protein. The effect of these cavities on PP32 folding landscapes was probed by high pressure fluorescence and NMR. Pressure denaturation offers an alternative approach to studying protein folding because its effects are due to void volume present in the proteins folded state, rather than the surface area of the unfolded state, leading to a more local effect and a rougher energy landscape with more intermediate states being populated than are observed with chemical denaturants. High pressure NMR studies of PP32 cavity mutants provide equilibrium unfolding data at the residue specific level. These results were used to constrain coarse grained structur e-based simulations yielding pseudo free energy profiles and structural characterization of the ensemble at several pressures and temperatures. Pressure -jump (p -jump) studies yielded activation volumes for folding and unfolding, which are defined by the mo lar volume of the transition state relative to the folded and unfolded states.This high resolution structural and energetic characterization of PP32 cavity containing mutants reveal key features of the PP32 sequence which define its folding cooperativity.

The disease can occur sporadically; or in 5 -10% of the patients, the disease occurs due to inheritance of a mutation. A missense mutation (P56S) in the VAMP Associated Protein gene [VAPB/ALS8], a highly conse rved gene is one such locus (Nishimura et al., 2004). Drosophila models of ALS8 have been generated that show that VAP -P58S aggregates and recruits wildtype protein to these aggregates, eliciting a dominant negative effect (Chai et al., 2008; Ratnaparkhi e t al., 2008; Tsuda et al., 2008). We find that this proline residue at the 56th position is present in the cis conformation in human VAPB. This leads to the possibility that any change of a cis peptide bond to a trans peptide bond may be the central featu re in ALS8 (P58S) aggregation. Aggregation of VAPB in neurons has been proposed to be either a cause or a consequence of mechanistic changes in the cell that lead to neuronal cell death (Lev et al., 2008; Ratnaparkhi et al., 2008; Tsuda et al., 2008). We t hus wish to explore the importance of having a cis conformation at the proline bond in the folding of VAP. Further, we attempt to identify the Peptidyl prolyl isomerase(s) in the cell that are responsible for aiding VAP fold to its correct conformation and modify aggregation kinetics of the protein. This study may provide insight into the mechanism and progression of the ALS8 in humans.

Harms University of Oregon, Institute of Molecular Biology, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry lwheeler9@gmail.com Substitutions that alter the binding specificity of proteins are essential for the evolution of new biological functions. To directly study this process, we are tracing changes in the total set of partners recognized by proteins over evolutionary time through a combination of ancestral sequence reconstruction, high -throughput pha ge display, and rigorous biophysical characterization. We are using two members of the S100 protein family, S100A5 and S100A6, as a model of the evolution of specificity. These proteins bind short peptide regions of interaction - partners in a calcium depend ent manner, with each protein having distinct biological targets. To determine how this peptide recognition specificity changed over time, we are deploying a quantitative, high -throughput phage display approach that combines four strategies: 1) use of a competitor peptide to target the relevant binding site on the protein; 2) careful experimental and computational treatment of library composition and sampling bias; 3) quantitative, global analysis of binding using a partition function; and 4) incorporation of clustering and machine - learning to identify important determinants of binding specificity. We have used this approach to characterize peptide binding by human S100A5. Machine -learning analyses indicate that binding peptides are distinguished from non -binders by higher rigidity and distinct side chain patterns. We are currently extending the approach to other S100s, including the last common ancestor of all S100A5 and S100A6 proteins. These experiments will allow us to directly measure how binding specifi city has changed evolutionarily and aid identification of new biological targets for these proteins. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM A Consensus View of the Factors Favoring Protein Folding: Grappling with Free Energies of Folding via Molecular Dynamics Simulations M Varun IIT, Delhi varun.mandalaparthy@gmail.com The factors that favour protein folding have been discussed in literature extensively. Hydrophobicity, intramolecular main chain hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions are often implicated as favouring fol ding and loss of main chain and side chain entropy as disfavouring folding. A clear quantification of these factors applied to a large number of systems for developing a consensus view however is lacking. Such an insight would be useful for protein enginee ring as well as furthering basic science. Free energies of folding can be arrived at through calorimetry. Parsing these energies into factors favoring or disfavoring folding is not currently amenable to experiment. Thus the question of which factor contri butes how much remains answered only via intelligent guesses. In this study, we seek to address the issue of developing quantitative estimates of the factors involved in protein folding via a large number of microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. We aim to develop a consensus view of the folding energetics and examine the various stabilizing and destabilizing components over the course of the early part of the folding pathway.

The TLRs contain N -terminal LRR repeats, a single transmembrane domain and a conserved C - terminal TIR domain. In addition to th e receptors, there also exist five TIR domain -containing adaptor molecules. Ligand binding to the receptor leads to its dimerisation and subsequent recruitment of adaptor proteins. This results in a signalling cascade and production of pro - inflammatory cyt okines and interferons. The Pro residue in the BB loop of the TIR domains is highly conserved and mutation of this Pro to His abrogates dimerisation. TLR -3 senses viral double stranded RNA and is localised at the endosome. However, TLR -3 is different from other TLRs in two aspects. Firstly, it contains a conserved Alanine (795A) instead of Proline in the BB loop of its TIR domain. Secondly, while all other TLRs utilize the MyD88 adaptor protein, TLR - 3 binds directly to the TRIF adaptor protein. A mutation o f Ala 795 to Pro 795 led MyD88 to be recruited to TLR -3 instead of TRIF. Currently, the structural basis of receptor TIR -adaptor TIR interactions is not well understood due to the transient nature of these interactions. In this work, using long scale molec ular dynamic simulations and residue network analysis, we have attempted to investigate the subtle conformational changes induced by the mutation. The observations made from these analyses will contribute towards obtaining a better picture of the interacti ons between the TLR receptors and adaptor proteins.

Parkinsons disease (PD) belongs to the group of diseases known as Lewy body diseases (LBDs) which also includes PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The pathological characteristic of these diseases is progressive accum ulation of the presynaptic protein alpha -synuclein (alpha -syn) and therefore they are often referred to as synucleinopathies. Various point mutations in the gene encoding alpha -syn (SNCA) namely A30P, A53T, . oligomerization and fibrillation of alpha -syn and its mutants are central processes in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies and hence represent significant therapeutic target. We have studied the effect of several ayurvedic preparations such as Ashw agandha, Triphala, etc. on the process of fibrillation of alpha -syn and its mutants. The fibrillation process was monitored by ThioflavinT (ThT) -binding assay and the structural changes were monitored by different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. We observed that the fibrillation process was completely suppressed in the presence of Triphala. We also studied the effect of several ayurvedic preparations on the stability of pre -formed fibrils of alpha -syn and its mutants. We observed a disruption of t he cross beta -sheet fibrils in the presence of Triphala. In conclusion, our results indicate that Triphala is a potential candidate for prevention as well as cure for synucleinopathies. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Design and characterization of novel trimeric cyclic permutants Science mansip@mbu.iisc.ac.in HIV-1 Env is a trimeric glycoprotein synthesized as single chain gp160 precursor and expressed on the virion surface after being cleaved into gp120 and gp41 subunits, which are bound to each other in a non -covalent fashion. Previously, it has been shown that properly cleaved trimeric Env immunogens show better binding specificity to neutra lizing antibodies by presenting the relevant epitopes in the right conformation and simultaneously occluding non neutralizing epitopes. Owing to the labile interaction of gp120 and gp41, the cleavage site has been mutated previously but these trimers faile d to take up a native like structure. Recently, a 3.5 \u00c5 crystal structure of SOSIP gp140 from subtype A BG505 strain of HIV -1 has been reported. It provides important insights about the relative orientation and interactions of gp120 and gp41 subunits. The structure reveals that the gp41 C -terminus is in very close proximity (~8\u00c5) to the N -terminus of gp120 from an adjacent subunit. We have designed a cyclic permutant of gp140 from JRFL and BG505 strain where the gp41 C terminus is now connected to the gp120 N-terminus with a short linker. This novel connectivity results in preservation of the native gp41 N -terminus along with a much shorter linker length than in conventional gp140. This may promote trimer folding and stabilization because of the resulting de creased magnitude of conformational entropy change during folding. The structure also reveals that the gp120 C -terminus is close to the trimer axis, and due to cyclic permutation, this becomes the new C -terminus of gp140. To further stabilize the trimeric form, we have attached a foldon trimerization domain at the C terminus. The protein has been expressed and purified from mammalian cells. The protein exists primarily as a trimer in solution as assessed by SEC -MALS. It shows better binding to broadly neutr alizing antibody b12 when compared to b6, a non neutralizing antibody. Further biophysical characterization of the protein is in progress.

We obtained the time series of sm -FRET efficiency from ubiquitin labeled with two different dyes. At low concentrations of denaturant, we obtained the traces having the high FRET efficiency cor responding to the native state. At high concentrations of denaturant, the traces possessed the low FRET efficiency corresponding to the denatured state. We calculated the shot noise -limited probability density functions of the sm-FRET efficiency distributi on for the native and denatured states, and compared them with the histograms of the observed FRET efficiency. While the observed peak for the native state is comparable to the noise width, the denatured peak is significantly broader than the noise width. Contrary to the previous concept of the denatured proteins, which fluctuate randomly without any structures, our data suggested that the denatured ubiquitin are heterogeneous and that the heterogeneous components possess the lifetime longer than several mi lliseconds. We inferred that the heterogeneity of the denatured state was caused by the local structural dynamics around the labeled fluorophores, and that the slow transitions revealed by sm -FRET measurements might be the common properties of the denature d proteins.

Here, we have cloned, expressed and purified two variants of MARK4 [the kinase domain (MARK4 -F2), and kinase along with 59 N - terminal residues (MARK4 -F1)] and compared their stability at varying pH range. Structural and functional changes were observed by incubating both forms of MARK4 in buffers of different pH. We me asured the secondary structure of MARK4 using circular dichroism and tertiary structure by measuring intrinsic fluorescence and absorbance properties along with the size of proteins by dynamic light scattering. We observed that at extremes of pH (below pH 3.5 and above pH 9.0), MARK4 is quite stable. However, a remarkable aggregate formation was observed at intermediate pH (between pH 3.5 and 9.0). To further validate this results, we have modelled both forms of MARK4 and performed molecular dynamics simula tion for 15 ns. The spectroscopic observations are in excellent agreement with the findings of molecular dynamics simulation. Now the question is, what brings MARK4 stability at physiological pH? In order to solve this puzzle, we have cloned, expressed, an d purified UBA -domain along with catalytic domain of MARK4. We found pronounced structure at different pH by using different spectroscopic techniques, supported by the activity assay. This variant of MARK4 was stable at physiological pH, indicates that UBA domain may provide stability to the protein and thus function at physiological pH conditions.

Secondary structural changes of insulin were monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy which inferred that less beta sheet formation in presence of vitamin C. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images also confirmed the reduction of size of insulin aggregate in presence of vitamin C. Furthermore, Vitamin C w as also found to prevent amyloid induced neurotoxicity on human neuronal cell line, SHY -5Y cells. Importantly, it was also found that vitamin C remodel preformed amyloids to less toxic amorphous aggregates with less cross beta sheet content.

To understand the molecular basis of halo -adaptation of proteins, nucleotide sequence, primary amino acid sequence and the 3D protein structure of halophilic bacterial species were a nalyzed. Present study utilizes a novel two -step hybrid approach (machine learning and analytic hierarchy process -AHP) to derive halostabilizing mutations. Halostabilizing protein attributes have been ranked and a model has been generated for predicting mu ltiple mutations leading to halostability. Various machine learning approaches were tested on 64 codon, 29 amino acid and 20 structural feature parameters. The ranking was developed on a final dataset of 100 pairs of halophilic and non -halophilic proteins. Statistical analysis reveals that k -nearest neighbour (k=10) and artificial neural network classifies halophilic/non -halophilic protein with 91.67% accuracy, respectively. Results also show that the trend of GAC (Asp) codon increases in halophilic protein s. Asp and Thr followed by acidic amino acid content was found to be increasing in halophilic proteins. The accuracy obtained by AHP was 90.0%. Further, the generated model will be validated by halostabilizing mutations using various spectroscopic methods and molecular dynamic simulation in Bacillus subtilis lipase to monitor dynamic changes.

In this study we present a framework to characterize the structural changes occurring in proteins as they unfold under the action of an external f orce in Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations. We propose possible strategies to identify the reaction coordinate connecting the transition state to the ground state.We show that a judicious choice of the reaction coordinate (rather than the convent ional N -C terminal distance) can enable unambiguous identification and characterization of the transition state.

One would expect protein possessing similar native fold to exhibit similar folding and domain swapping propensities. T he cysteine protease inhibitor, stefin -B and sweet -tasting protein, monellin, present a unique case. Despite having similar structures (112345) the two differ in their folding mechanism and domain -swapping propensity. Using all -atom structure -based m odels and molecular dynamics simulations the folding of monellin and stefin -B is investigated to understand these differences. Results from simulations indicate that monellin folds in a cooperative manner while that of stefin -B populates an intermediate. I n stefin -B, the backbone dihedral of VAL48 (involved in protease binding) was found to shift from a disallowed region of the Ramachandran map when folded as a monomer to an allowed region in the domain -swapped structure. Upon encoding this effect in stefin -B a new intermediate (345) is formed which mimics one of the swapped region. We conclude that the function of monellin which is spread over the protein can accommodate cooperative folding while the more localized functional residues (in N -terminal, loo p1 and loop2) as exhibited in stefin -B promote the formation of a folding -intermediate which in turn can lead to domain swapping and aggregation.

However, network theory predicts such perturbations to influence even distal residue -residue communication networks. Analysi s of microsecond -long molecular dynamics simulations of several aliphatic mutants of ubiquitin reveals that mutational effects consistently propagate into the second shell of the altered site (even up to 15 -20 \u00c5) in proportion to the perturbation magnitude and dissipates exponentially with a decay distance -constant of ~5 \u00c5. We also report evidence for this phenomenon from published experimental data. Reformulating these observations onto a statistical mechanical model, we reproduce the stability changes of 375 mutations from 19 single -domain proteins. Our work thus reveals a robust energy dissipation -cum-signaling mechanism in the interaction networks within proteins, quantifies the partitioning of destabilization energetics around the mutation neighborhood and presents a simple theoretical framework for modeling the allosteric effects of point mutations. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Creation of depth dependent substitution matrices The 20 naturally occurring amino acids have different environmental preferences of where they are likely to occur in protein structures. Environments in a protein can be classified by their proximity to solvent, a measure called as residue depth. Since the freque ncies of amino acids are different at various depth levels, the substitution frequencies should vary according to depth. To quantify the substitution rates, we built depth dependent substitution matrices. The dataset used for creation of the matrices consi sted of high quality 3696 non redundant pairwise protein structural alignments. One of the applications of these matrices is to look at the tolerance of mutations at different environments. Using these substitution scores the prediction of deleterious muta tions were done on 3344 mutations in T4 lysozyme and CcdB. The accuracy of the technique in terms of MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) is 0.41, comparable to other state of art methods.

Structure -based molecular dynamic simulations of stefin -B and single chain monellin, two proteins with same topology ( 1-1-2-3-4-5) but very di fferent domain swapping propensities show that domain swapping is a consequence of the constraints imposed by function on protein structure, which is captured very well in the folding simulations of these two proteins in the form of a folding intermediate (mimicking the 3-4-5 swapped domain of dimer) which can directly lead to domain swapping in case of stefin -B, but not monellin. It follows from this result that if similar dihedral frustration is introduced into monellin, it will increase its domain -swapping propensity. I show experimental evidence confirming the predictions from the above study. Preliminary results from size -exclusion chromatography and multi -angle light scattering show that replacing the Gly -Phe linker of scMN by a QVVAG lin ker converts the protein from a monomer to a dimer, with no observable monomeric fraction. Dependence of the refolding rates of QVVAG - scMN on protein concentration further substantiates the claim that this protein exists as a dimer. In the QVNAG variant of scMN, roughly 20% of the protein exists as a monomer. We are currently crystallizing the QVVAG -scMN to deduce a high -resolution structure to prove that the experimentally observed dimer is indeed a domain -swapped dimer. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Early events in assimilation of GNNQQNY peptide: From segregation to aggregation Nidhi Institute of Technology Amyloid fibrils are aberrantly associated with numerous pathological neurodegenerative diseases. These deposits are formed via oligomeric intermediates, which are plausible cytotoxic entities in these diseases. Thus, complete understanding of the pathway particularly from segregated dispersed monomers to oligomerization, becomes imperative for rational ther apeutic design. In this perspective, we have explored the kinetics of aggregate formation of fibril forming GNNQQNY peptide fragment from the N -terminal prion determining domain of yeast protein SUP35. Using all atom conventional atomistic MD simulations, we have validated the experimentally observed nucleated conformational conversion mechanism and gained additional insights into the factors governing the process. Results suggest that although at any temperature/concentration, beta sheet formation follows peptide assimilation; however its propagation is more consistent at lower concentration. Increasing concentration leads to unfavourable backbone -water interactions resulting in formation of clump of collapsed disordered peptides. Kinetic profile demonstrat es that aggregation phenomenon is impeded by different barriers in the early and later oligomerization steps. Principal component analyses of 26 different properties were employed to delve into the cause of its existence. Compared to the latter, the initia l barrier can be easily surpassed by higher temperature and concentration, representative of different barrier heights for structured and unstructured aggregates. Hydration layer water molecules around larger aggregates are slightly structured and exhibits moderately slow dynamics compared to early small oligomers. Different metastable oligomers with both parallel and antiparallel configurations were identified during both the lags. Hydrogen bonding interactions were observed to be the principal determinant of aggregate formation. The growth of these aggregates proceeds via bimolecular association with condensation as the predominant assembly pathway. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Polyphenols modulates the aggregation pathway of ALS Chemist ry, IIT Delhi nkb288@gmail.com Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neuro ns. In vivo studies have shown that ALS is associated with aggregation of various forms of Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1). Evidences suggest that SOD1 containing pathological inclusions in ALS exhibit amyloid like properties. Unfortunately, effective th erapeutics against this disease has not yet been developed. In the present study, we observed the DTT induced fibrillation of SOD1 in the presence of various polyphenols (like curcumin, quercetin etc.). Using various biophysical techniques, we have demonst rated that curcumin and quercetin inhibit the fibrillation of SOD1. Further, there is a significant increase in SOD1 mediated toxicity in the regime of pre fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates which is not evident in polyphenol containing samples. Our result s show that polyphenols interacts strongly with these pre fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates. Hence, these polyphenols can act as potential candidates to combat the pathogenic misfolded SOD1 species found in ALS patients and may pave the way in designing n ovel therapeutic agents. We have tried to shed some light on the mechanism of inhibition of fibrillation by these polyphenols Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Isolated globular domain of human guanylate binding protein -2 is more stable than its full length protein Nikunj H Raninga , Safikur Rahman, Sudeepa Institute of Immunology nikunjraninga@nii.ac.in Small GTPases are single domain proteins that are unstable in the absence of the nucleotide either GTP or GDP. However, large GTPases which are multi -domain proteins have evolved in a manner that they are stable even in the absence of the nucleotides. Human guanylate binding protein -1 (hGBP1) is such kind of large GTPase which is comprised of an N -terminal globular (G) domain, C -terminal helical d omain which is linked by an intermediate region. It hydrolyzes GTP to both GDP and GMP with the GMP being the major product. Data from our laboratory suggest that the isolated G -domain in full length hGBP1 is stable to some extent without the nucleotide, b ut the protein is more stable in the presence of both the helical domain and the intermediate region. Thermodynamic stability of the full -length protein is found to be higher than the sum of its individual domains, suggesting that interdomain interactions provide further stability to the full length protein. However, hGBP2, a homolog of hGBP1, hydrolyses GTP to GDP and GMP, where GDP is the major product. To investigate whether in hGBP2 interdomain interaction play similar role in the stability of the prote in, we prepared truncated proteins and determined their thermodynamic stability. We found that the free energy of the truncated protein lacking the helical domain is higher than that of the full -length protein, suggesting that the interaction of the helica l domain reduces the stability of the full -length protein. Thermal denaturation studies of the isolated domains showed two -state transition, whereas the full length protein showed three states transition, indicating that domains are unfolding individually. This finding is supported further by unfolding kinetics, where the protein lacking the helical domain unfolds slower than that of the full -length protein. Structural analysis shows the presence of the positively charged clusters of both the G -domain and t he helical -domain are in vicinity of each other. This could be the reason for the decreased stability of the full -length protein compared to its isolated G domain with intermediate region. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Modulation of the dynamics of CcdB by Gyrase and CcdA: insights into the mechanism of CcdA action Nilesh Aghera and Raghavan Varadarajan Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science nilesha@mbu.iisc.ernet.in CcdB is a toxin of the type -II TA system in E. coli , which kills the cell by inhibiting its target protein, DNA Gyrase. Normally, the toxicity of the CcdB is neutralized by its cognate anti -toxin CcdA. CcdA binds to free CcdB and also facilitates active dissociation of the CcdB -Gyrase complex. The molecular mechanism of the action of CcdA is yet to be understood. To obtain insights into the process, native state dynamics of CcdB has been investigated using HX -MS in both the absence and presence of either CcdA or Gyrase. The HX process of CcdB in the absence of any binding partner has three phases, where the two faster phases arise due to local unfolding, and the slowest phase arises due to global unfolding. Binding of CcdA and Gyrase causes increased protection in CcdB against HX and hinders its global unfolding. Interestingly, many segments of Ccd B show decreased protection against HX upon binding to CcdA. These segments also show decreased protection upon Gyrase binding, although they dont interact with the Gyrase molecule. These results suggest that the modulation of the dynamics of CcdB by Gyra se may enable the action of CcdA by facilitating its binding to CcdB.

We provide evidence for presence of DMG like state in two of the three domains of a multidomain protein having disrupted side chain packing with dry core. Furthermore, we demonstrate the significance of vdW packing i nteractions in the stability of protein by quantitatively estimating the energetic contribution of vdW packing interactions in protein stability.

In proteasomal system, ubiquitination. SCF (Skp1 -Cullin -Fbox) complex is one of the E3 enzymes that ubiquitinates the cell cycle regulatory proteins. SCF complex is formed by substrat e binding protein with F -box domain (Skp2), adapter protein Skp1, central scaffold Cullin, and the ring box protein Rbx. Skp1 protein recognizes the Skp2 protein and presents it to the rest of the SCF complex by binding to N -terminal domain of Cullin. NMR is the very usefull technique to calculate structure and dynamics of protein at atomic level resolution. NOESY - HSQC experi ments performed for structure calculation and T1 and T2 relaxation experiments for dynamics calculation. Sequence specific backbone and side chain assignment was completed and residue specific secondary structure as well as dynamic nature of Skp1 protein from chemical shift was obtained from NMR assignment. Additiona lly we also performed three molecular dynamic simulations (each 200 ns long) of Skp1 protein using Gromacs 4.6 package. The assignments reported here will further our understanding of the standalone Skp1 structure and will pave way for the future characterization of protein structure -dynamics and will assist in ascertaining mode of interaction of Skp1 with various F -box proteins.

The intermediates also frequently initiate pathogenic fibril formations. While observing the intermediates is difficult due to their tran sient nature, extreme conditions can partially unfold the proteins and provide a glimpse of the intermediate states. Here, we observe the high resolution structure of a hydrophobic core mutant of Ubiquitin at an extreme acidic pH by Nuclear Magnetic Resona nce (NMR) spectroscopy. In the structure, the native secondary and tertiary structure is conserved for a major part of the protein. However, a long loop between the beta strands partially unfolded. The altered structure is supported by fluorescence data an d the difference in free energies between the native state and the intermediate is reflected in the denaturant induced melting curves. The unfolded region includes amino acids that are critical for interaction with co -factors as well as for assembly of pol y- Ubiquitin chains. The structure at acidic pH resembles a late folding intermediate of Ubiquitin and indicates that upon stabilization of the proteins core, the long loop converges on the core in the final step of the folding process.

Bovine lactoferrin (BLf) is a monomeric, bilobed protein principally isolated from secretory fluids such as milk, saliva, and t ears. It has antipathogenic and immunomodulatory properties which solely depend on its unusual structure. It comprises of all types of secondary structure including a rare 3 10 helix. Thus it can be used as a model protein to study the conformational dynamics. Studying protein -nanoparticle interactions can have far -reaching applications in terms of how a nanoparticle may behave inside biological systems. Moreover, the rough surf ace of nanoparticles is known to promote the conformational changes in interacting proteins. Therefore, in the present study, we aim to explore how the binding of Bovine Lactoferrin (300 ug/ml) with different concentration of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) c an alter its conformation, subsequently the anti -pathogenic activity. For the circular dichroism (C.D.) spectroscopy and zeta potential studies have been employed. The binding of BLF over AgNPs is reflected by the surface Plasmon resonance peak shift of AgNPs conjugates from 396 nm to 388 nm. Also, the surface charge of BLF ( -13.1 mV) neutralizing the surface -36.8 mV) to -12.8 mV inferring that the charged residues of BLF are non -covalently interact with AgNPs. CD spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence data revealed that higher concentration of AgNPs (40 ug/ml) is disrupting the conformation and stability of BLF, however, the conformation is preserved in 20 ug/ml A gNPs. Therefore 20 AgNPs was of BLF -AgNPs conjugates was found to be higher in contrast with BLF and AgNPs alone.

The native state is believed to be assisted with minimum free energy. But very little is known about the equilibrium conf ormations of the native state itself. For instance, if the native state represents a single state or it is an equilibrium mixture of native state and many different native -like intermediates? Herein, we present evidence for alternatively packed native like intermediate in the chemical denaturant induced unfolding transitions of a multi domain pr otein, Human Serum Albumin.

Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Stabilization Induced Reduction in Cooperativity of Protein Folding Prashant Jethva and Jayant B Udgaonkar National Center for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research prashantjethva@ncbs.res.in Highly cooperative folding of small globular proteins (two state folder) imposed a view that cooperativity is the inherent property of protein molecules and one invariant transition state separates the native state from the unfolded state. However, energy landscape theory predicts that there are many pathways available to protein for folding and they are sensitive to solvent conditions. Evidences suggest that folding is not always a barrier limiting reaction; it could be highly non cooperative like one state downhill folding. In the current s tudy we observed that native state of PI3K SH3 undergoes large cooperative unfolding suggesting that native and unfolded states are separated by a large free energy barrier. Reduction in cooperativity observed under strong stabilizing condition suggests th at smooth free energy barrier becomes highly rugged and lead to non -cooperative unfolding. Our study suggest that, change in stability of protein lead to modulation of cooperativity of unfolding and resulting in change in free energy landscape from a barri er limited (highly cooperative) to a barrier less (non cooperative).

Aminoacyl -tRNA synthetases are central enzymes in protein translation, providing the charged tRNAs for the appropriate synthesis of peptide chains. The of Entamoeba histolytica Aspartyl -tRNA synthetase (Ehis -AspRS) has been solved. The presence of a single tryptophan at position 507, makes it an attractive system for biophysical studies. The objective of this study i s to elucidate the structure - function relationship of Ehis -AspRS and to establish it as a probable drug target. Ehis -AspRS follows a three state transition in presence of chemical denaturants, and the intermediate is not a molten globule. However, it is v ery stable under varying pH as some residual structural remains are present even above pH 12. Our preliminary observation suggests that Ehis -AspRS unfolds differently in presence of different denaturants. Ligand studies using fluorescence quenching (ITC) revealed that Ehis -AspRS has probably undergone conformational changes upon binding to its cognate amino acid (L - Aspartate) that increases its affinity for ATP.

This emerging class of amyloids is denoted as functional amyloids. One such functional amyloid is formed by the melanosomal protein Pmel17, which is a melanocyte specific transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an essential role in melanosome maturation and its amyloid fibrils acts as a template for mela nin deposition in skin and eyes. Pmel17 comprises an intrinsically disordered polypeptide fragment namely, the repeat (RPT) domain, which forms the amyloid core that promotes the melanin biosynthesis. Previous studies have reported that the RPT domain aggr egates under mildly acidic condition. However, the molecular mechanism of amyloid formation as well as the organization of individual protein molecules within the supramolecular amyloids still remains elusive. We have used an array of spectroscopic and ima ging techniques involving fluorescence, circular dichroism, light scattering and atomic force microscopy to elucidate the mechanistic details of pH-dependent aggregation of the RPT domain. Our results suggest that a mechanistic switch in the aggregation pa thway occurs from an isodesmic to a nucleation -dependent polymerization as a function of pH which leads to the genesis of diverse nanoscopic dendritic and straight fibrils.

Soluble oligomers of A are recognized as key intermediates that cause synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Also, it has been conjectured that soluble A oligomers induce tau hyper -phosphorylation. However, the mechanism of oligomers -induced neurotoxicity as well as A -mediated tau hyper - phosphorylation remains elusive. Our efforts are directed towards understanding the mechanistic details of A -induced tau pathology using a host of biochemical and biophysical tools. Additionally, recen t evidences suggest that the cellular prion protein (PrP) acts as one of the receptors for soluble A oligomers and this binding event is proposed to inhibit long term potentiation. Therefore, we are also investigating the binding affinities and the bindin g sites of two distinct conformational oligomers of A namely, prefibrillar - and fibrillar oligomers recognized by conformation -dependent antibodies, with PrP by using an array of biophysical techniques.

CDKs have long been known to be regulated by activatory and inhibitory phosphorylations, which majorly impact kinase activity of complex. In contrast, while acetylation of CDKs (CDK2/CDK5/CDK9) has been reported, little is known about the physiological significance of this acetylation. In this study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simula tions to assess the effect of point mutations and acetylation of a key conserved active site lysine (K33) on ATP binding and complexation with CyclinB. Our studies reveal key switching interactions between K33, the incoming ATP, and conserved acidic residu es (D146, E51) which are disrupted by the mutations. Our studies provide a molecular basis to understand the biochemical characterization of both K -R and K -Q mutants which indicate that acetylation is key in mediating the activation cycle of CDK1 and impin ges on CDK1 -CyclinB complex formation. Given the fundamental property of cells to divide and proliferate, our findings provide novel insights into CDK regulation and hence cell cycle progression by acetylation -deacetylation cycles.

In case of Zika virus, the roles of protein intrinsic disorder in mechanisms of pathogenesis are not completely understood. In this study, we have analysed the prevalen ce of intrinsic disorder in Zika virus proteome (strain MR 766).

SF3b is a multi -protein complex and as part of U2 snRNP or U11/U12 di -snRNP in recognizes adenosine of pre -mRNA. Although a cryo -EM density map exists for the seven protein human SF3b complex, the structure and relative spatial arrangement of the SF3b components is not known. Hence, using an integrative approach , involving cryo -EM density maps, structural and other experimental data tailored with effective computational techniques, a pseudo -atomic model for the closed form of SF3b complex was deciphered. Thus, for the first time the model provides structural info rmation for five proteins (SF3b10, SF3b155, SF3b145, SF3b130 and proteins (SF3b10, SF3b145, SF3b130 and SF3b14b). In addition, it was found that SF3b is a \"fuzzy complex\" with highly flexible components and mu ltiplicity of folds. An existing U11/U12 di -snRNP cryo -EM density map further allowed the modeling of an open form of SF3b complex. This open form provided insights on the mechanistic features involved in the transition between closed and open forms pivote d by a hinge region in the SF3b155 protein that also harbors cancer causing mutations. Finally, the open form guided model of the 5 end of U12 snRNA which also comprises the branch point duplex region with pre -mRNA shows that the architecture of SF3b acts as a scaffold for U12 snRNA: pre -mRNA branch point duplex formation with potential implications for branch point adenosine recognition fidelity.

Misfolding of cellular prion protein is known to cause several neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as t ransmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).

A proposed function of ASN is regulation of synaptic vesicles in the brain. ASN binds strongly to anionic lipid vesicles in vitro and undergoes a tran sition from intrinsically -disordered to partially -helical. Membrane properties such as lipid molecular shape, lipid phase, and curvature (size) will likely modulate the interaction of ASN with lipid vesicles but systematic studies have not been reported. Membrane bilayer properties affects the aggregation process (speed/mechanism) of ASN as both inhibition and promotion of ASN amyloid formation in the presence of vesicles have been reported. To separate the individual effects of lipid shape, charge and c urvature, we used far -UV circular dichroism and fluorescence to probe ASN secondary structure and aggregation propensity upon interacting with bilayers of varying lipid composition (combinations of DOPG, DOPS, DOPC, DOPE and DOPA). All experiments were per formed at 37\u00b0 C, pH 6.5 and in the absence of salts. We observed that upon comparing ASN interactions with liposomes of equimolar mixtures of DOPS:DOPE and DOPG:DOPE, there is a higher number of lipids bound per ASN and more induced aggregation (in a process that depends non -linearly on the fraction -bound ASN) whereas such effect is lacking in DOPE -containing vesicles.

Especially small molecules - which can diffuse across cell barriers - are potent effectors of cellular response and fitnes s on shorter and longer time scales respectively. Optimal proteostasis is crucial for cells fitness which is evident by the fact that maintenance of proteostasis is one of the most energetically costly processes in cell. Here we investigate potential impac t of chemical environments on the proteostasis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that chemical chaperones i.e. small molecules that assist protein folding [1, 2] rescue the effect of inhibitors which inhibit protein folding. Interestingly, chemical chap erones also revert reduced diffusivity of cytoplasm by inhibitors as monitored by \u00b5NS probe [3]. From current data, we establish a role of cytoplasmic phase transitions [4] in maintenance of cytoplasmic proteostasis in cases of changes in chemical environm ents. Collectively we find that chemical chaperones assist cytoplasmic protein folding by improving fluidity of cytoplasm. We also find that physico -chemical properties of small molecules such as polarizability and hydrophobicity are important in guiding t hese effects while deeper investigation of underlying mechanistic details is still under progress.

Information obtained from crystal structures of the HIV -1 Env, as well as neutralization sensitivity data, was used to select 14 residues in the primary receptor CD4 -binding site, which were randomized by our site -saturation mutagenesis approach. A librar y of single -site mutant viruses was made, and used to infect TZM -bl cells in the presence and absence of a bNAb. Viruses capable of productive infection are being isolated, and deep sequencing carried out on the env gene of virus pools before and after infection. Mutations that make the virus resistant to a bNAb are likely to be epitopic residues. In principle, this approach could be used for epitope mapping of any viral protein.

The rate of misfolding of the protein to cytotoxic - structured oligomers exhibiting partial proteinase -K resistance is found to correlate well with the extent to which the i ntermediate populates and is limited by dimerization of this intermediate suggesting that it is the direct monomeric precursor initiating misfolding and oligomerization. Structural and energetic characterization of the intermediate by native -state hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry indicates that the intermediate is a partially unfolded form of the native state of the protein which forms under misfolding -prone solvent conditions. Kinetic folding studies in the micro -second regime carried out a t different experimental conditions indicates that the protein folds through multiple pathways at low pH while at higher pH, it folds predominantly via a single pathway with the intermediate being obligatory to the folding of the protein.

For this purpose, we have monitored the folding kinetics of FRET pairs spanning different structural parts (such as helix, beta sheet, etc) of the protein usi ng time resolved fluorescence measurements. The equilibrium unfolding data suggests that structural changes occur in a combination of continuous and cooperative manner. Interestingly, the equilibrium unfolding of helix is quite distinct from rest of the st ructure. The double kinetics trFRET data suggests that all the molecules do not collapse within few milliseconds of refolding process, a significant fraction of molecules still remain unfolded like even after 100 ms of refolding. This suggests that collaps e is a barrier limited process. This observation has been made across different distances spanning different structural parts of the protein.

We hypothesize that the flexibility and stability of ubiquitin family proteins is modulated by changes in protein sequence and complexation. To validate our hypothesis, we develop computational measures of protein stiffness, based on Elastic Network Models (ENM) and Principal Component Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MD - PCA) trajectories. Further, we carried out steered molecular dynamics simulations of ubiquitin family proteins to examine the structural origin of differences in their unfolding f orces. Our results show ubiquitin to be stiffer and more stable than SUMO proteins in free form. Complexation with protein -partners which attach ubiquitin/SUMO to target protei ns, represent tagged targets, and recognize tagged protein cargo,increase or dec rease intrinsic protein stiffness in a context specific manner. Changes in sequence and complexation both tune protein stiffness through global rearrangements of both protein side -chain packing and the protein backbone. We discuss the different modes of de composing protein stiffness and its relevance towards understanding the function of ubiquitin family proteins. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM High Temperature Unfolding Simulations of Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) Sapna Mayuri Borah, Dr. Biology & Biotechnology, Tezpur University sapna@tezu.ernet.in Protein folding is an aspect that holds paramount importance in structural biology. The current scenario involves the incorporation of in -silico methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in unveiling these events at the atomistic level. In this work , we aim at understanding the unfolding pathways of the homo -tetrameric legume lectin, Peanut Agglutinin (PNA). The monomer of this protein has more than 15 -strands forming three -sheets contributing to a stable and compact structure. It has been known that the unfolding of such proteins is comparatively more challenging than -helical proteins. Here, atomistic MD simulations in total of around 1\u00b5s with explicit solvent have been performed to study the unfolding of PNA monomer at high temperature using t he protein denaturants, urea and guanidium chloride. Our analysis of the simulation trajectories shows gradual loss in both secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. However interestingly, at the same temperature, the extent and pattern of unfoldi ng differs for both the denaturants. Additionally, the unfolding percentage has increased at higher temperature. This work sheds some light on the unfolding phenomenon including identification of structural regions that initiate the unfolding in Peanut agg lutinin monomer.

TN16 is one of the promising inhibitors of that alters the conformation of tubulin dimer and interrupts normal cycle of the subunits into the microtubules. The TN16 is reported to primarily bind at - interface al ong with some experimental hints of heterogeneity in binding modes3. TN16 is found to take various ways of binding possibilities within the same pocket and the present work explores the mechanism of which gets elucidated only when the structurally packed i nterfacial water molecules are explicitly considered in standard binding energy calculation (MMGBSA). With the help of QM calculations, this work underscored the importance of such consideration of the network of interfacial water molecules which is necess ary to reveal the extra beneficial effect in binding energy stabilization due to multiple quasi degenerate states4.This tiny molecular tricks could add up an extra rate of interest during the drug development strategy.

Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Small Amplitude Afm : Understanding Mechanical Unfolding Of Proteins Via is widely used to study the Protein folding problem. Many researchers use commercially available AFMs which are operated on resonance frequency of the cantilever. In this, large on -resonance amplitude provides enough restoring force to overcome jump -in instability. However, the cantilever dynamics becomes non -linear and it is difficult to quantify the forces from measured qu antities such as amplitude and phase. We have built an AFM which is operated off -resonance with operation amplitudes as small as 1\u00c5. In this case the force field can be linearized over the amplitude of the tip. This allows the use of a simple relationship between observed dynamic quantities such as phase and amplitude with stiffness and damping. In order to detect the amplitude of the order of an angstrom, we have used fiber -based interferometer instead of the conventional laser -deflection -based detection s ystem in commercial AFMs. We present our preliminary data on Force Spectroscopy experiments used to study the mechanical unfolding of single protein molecules (I27 protein) pulled using the novel technique. The method enables us to locally measure the prot ein stiffness and damping by the use of linear visco -elastic models. This technique can therefore help us understand the visco -elastic behaviour of a single protein molecule during its unfolding. The methodology developed may lead to the revelation of the dynamics of protein folding.

Chaudhuri Kusuma School of Biological Science, IIT Delhi staneja.harvard@gmail.com Understanding the protein folding pathway, its mechanism and the role of folding intermediates has always been a fundamental area in the field of biological research.Various approaches have been applied to increase our understanding of the intermediates an d the transition states of proteins from their unfolded to the near-native or native states. Multi domain proteins comprise a major percentage of the total cellular proteome and little is known about their folding pathways. In this study we have optimized a protocol to study the refolding event of a model multidomain protein, malate synthase G (MSG) at the molecular level and tried to answer some fundamental questions regarding complexity of protein folding. We have applied limited proteolysis approach with LC -MS/MS to get a molecular level resolution of these intermediates. The different refolding intermediates of MSG were captured and subjected to limited proteolysis using trypsin. The peptides thus generated were separated on a C18 column using nano LC a nd subjected to ESI-MS. With the use of softwares; HyStar 3.2, Data Analysis, Bio Tools and Pattern Lab we identified certain regions on the protein that are differentially sensitive to enzymatic cleavage, region that constitutes the folding nucleus and ch aracterized the transition states at the molecular level. Using a simple approach along with MS we have tried to get a better understanding of the dynamic conformation of the ir folding intermediates and map the refolding pathway of a large protein. Our res ults demonstrate the utility of mass spectrometry for characterization of protein folding intermediates of large multidomain proteins that are a challenge to study. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Functionally Relevant Specific Packing Can Determine Protein Folding Routes Shilpa Yadahalli TIFR shilpa.yadahalli@gmail.com Functional residues can modulate the folding mechanisms of proteins. In some proteins, mutations to such residues can radically change the primary folding route. Is it possible then to learn more about the functional regions of a protein by investigating just its choice of folding route? The folding and the function of the protein Escherichia coli ribonuclease H (ecoRNase -H) have been extensively studied and its folding route is known to near -residue resolution. Here, we computationally study the folding of ecoRNase -H using molecular dynamics simulations of structure -based models of increasing complexity. The differences between a model that correctly predicts the experimentally determined folding route and a simpler model that does not can be attributed to a set of six aromatic residues clustered together in a region of the protein called CORE. This clustering, which we term \"specific\" packing, drives CORE to fold early and determines the folding route. Both t he residues involved in specific packing and their packing are largely conserved across E.coli -like RNase -Hs from diverse species. Residue conservation is usually implicated in function. Here, the identified residues either are known to bind substrate in ecoRNase -H or pack against the substrate in the homologous human RNase -H where a substrate - bound crystal structure exists. Thus, the folding mechanism of ecoRNase -H is a byproduct of functional demands upon its sequence. Using our observations on specific p acking, we suggest mutations to an engineered HIV RNase -H to make its function better. Our results show that understanding folding route choice in proteins can provide unexpected insights into their function.

Understanding the mechanical properties of bio-molecules involved in such processes is very vital for studying the fundamental biological phenomenon like gene transcription, adhesion properties in cells, mec hanical stability of protein etc. Mechanical single molecule techniques offer exciting possibilities for investigating protein folding and stability in native environments at sub -nanometer resolutions. Recent developments in Atomic force microscopy enable us to go beyond the ensemble average and measure the behavior of individual molecules. Here, we present the visco -elastic properties of membrane protein Bacteriorhodopsin extracted from the thermal cantilever motion during force measurements. Our aim is to get the thermal deflections of the cantilever tip as a function of time when the protein Bacteriorhodopsin attached to the tip unfolds in a typical force curve measurement. We investigated the thermal deflections using Power spectral density (PSD) func tion. The PSD gives information about stiffness and damping of the biomolecule. Results show that stiffness and damping of the biomolecule changes in a single unfolding event. These information and approach are set to provide possibilities for further st udies regarding protein folding as well as in resolving structure -dynamic relationships of complex bio -molecular systems. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Temperature Dependent Protein Malleability Probed by Single -Molecule Force Bhattacharya, A. S. R. Koti Tata Institute of Fundamental Research shrabasti.bhattacharya@tifr.res.in Increase in temperature decreases the stiffness of proteins and makes them more malleable as observed by single -molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments. However, the mechanism by which the temperature softening happens still remains to be understood. Here we use fluorescence spectroscopy, near UV CD and SMFS to probe the native and transition states of a ubiquitin -like protein, small ub iquitin -related modifier (SUMO2), to get molecular insights into the protein dynamics and mechanical resistance. Initial SMFS measurements indicated a decrease in mechanical resistance which intrigued us to look at the interactions which take over at highe r temperatures. Tryptophan at the core of the protein (F64W) was used as a fluorescent probe. Fluorescence intensity measurements and quenching showed that the environment around tryptophan is nonpolar in the temperature range 5 -55 0C. However, the anisotr opy experiments showed that the amplitude of segmental motion around tryptophan increased a lot indicating that the local rotationally restricted environment of tryptophan at 5 0C becomes dry molten globule -like and flexible with increase in temperature. The near UV CD reported the tertiary structure around the tryptophan to be restricted and achiral at 5 0C which is eventually lost as we increase temperature. This adds to the fact the tryptophan moves more freely in the melted core at higher temperatur e hence losing its achirality. The flexible core around the tryptophan explains the reduction in the stiffness of SUMO2 as measured by SMFS.

Studies on protein folding and misfolding are therefore crucial in understanding the key stages involved in the process. For multimeric proteins, intersubunit interactions play an important role in addition to the intrasubunit interactions for stabilizatio n of its three -dimensional structure. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) is one such tetrameric protein isolated from Arachishypogaea . In the present study, we aimed to find out the key structural intermediates that populate when PNA is exposed to various stress cond itions like hydronium ions and temperature. High temperature and GdnHCl concentration depict a three step unfolding pathway involving an intermediate. The anionic detergen t SDS and TFE have been found to induce an a -helical predominant transient PNA population. Interestingly, the cationic detergent CTAB is more robust, and induces molten globule population at very low concentrations. Additionally, the protein is found to re tain its secondary structure over a wide pH range. The data, altogether, indicate that the protein is significantly stable against stress conditions. However, each denaturant disrupts its structure in a different way depending upon denaturant functional groups that interacts with accessible side chains of the protein.

The intricate balance between chain -chain and chain -solvent interaction underlies one of the major physical driving forces for amyloid formation. However, the role of water in amyloid formation remains elusive. The f act that many pathological amyloids are often formed by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) underscores the importance of IDPs in amyloid biology. Using femtosecond and picosecond time -resolved spectroscopy, we have elucidated the water dynamics durin g the amyloid transition of a collapsed amyloidogenic IDP, namely bovine k -casein. Our femtosecond results indicate that the dynamics of \"biological water\" gets dampened and the contribution of the bulk water decreases significantly as a result of conforma tional sequestration during amyloid formation. Additionally, an increase in the ultraslow solvation component revealed the ordering of (trapped) interstitial water. Our findings suggest that water undergoes a profound reorganization, with chain desolvation and entrapping of water taking place in a concerted manner during amyloid assembly. Our results on the site -specific solvation dynamics of -synuclein will also be presented.

Active -site residues could be distinguished from buried ones, based on their differential tolerance to aliphatic and charged amino acid substitutions. At non active -site exposed positions, almost all substitutions were tolerated. Among aromatic (F, H, Y, W) and charged (D, E, K, R) categories, phenotype was observed to be differentially dependent on residue size. Remarkably similar results were observed for two other small proteins, PDZ domain (PSD95pdz3) (McLaughlin et al, 2012 ) and IgG -binding domain of protein G (GB1) (Olson et al, 2014) . Mutational sensitivity data obtained with CcdB were used to d esign a model for predicting functional effects of mutations. The performance of the model was evaluated using mutational data for PDZ and GB1 proteins. Results compared favourably with those of two widely used computational predictors, SNAP2 and SuSPect a s well as to the ProTherm database.

This reverse turn is part of the transition state in the folding process for Z34C and influences its foldi ng rates. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the peptide corresponding to this turn region and two of its alanine mutants -D20A and P21A, and turnformation was studied using GROMOS54A7 force field. We found that this region has a turn propensi ty of its own and the highest turn propensity is observed for the wild -type, which is in agreement with CD and temperature -dependent IR spectroscopy measurements done by Du and Gai in 2006 (Biochemistry 2006, 45, 13131 -13139). The turns sampled were largel y native, with respect to the NMR structure, and of all the interactions present between the residues, we found that the interactions between the sidechain of D20 and the backbone of N22/L23 were predominantly stabilizing the turn conformations here. The a lanine -mutants showed a lesser propensity for turn formation due to enthalpic factors and thus this turn is more enthalpy driven. We also found that a slight unfavorable change in G for turn conformation causes a drastic change in the folding rate.

While NTDs are re sponsible for their dimerization, CTDs bind both substrates and inhibitors. To delineate the roles of helix 3 and some conserved NTD residues (such as Y15, D44, etc.) in FKBP22 -like proteins, we investigated a recombinant FKBP22 (rFKBP22) and its two NTD mutants (e.g. Y15A and and three helix 3 mutants, I65P, V72P, and A82P. The results show that mutants are not only different from each other but also differ from rFKBP22 in structure, activity and stability. Conversely, they bound inhibitors normal ly. Unlike rFKBP22 and NTD mutants, other mutants were unfolded by a non -two state mechanism. Of the mutants, I65P showed maximum structural and functional loss. We also noticed an anomalous domain movement in I65P as well as the collapse of its V -shaped s tructure. Interestingly, Y15A exists as monomers in solution. A reduced number of non -covalent bonds at the dimeric interface of Y15A seemed to be responsible for its monomerization.

To get insight into its complex mechanical unravelling process, and the role of native disulphide bond and the copper -binding site on the mechanical properties, we designed two mutants of azurin, N47C and C26A. Wild -type azurin gives a characteristic 628 nm band in the absorption spectra due to LMCT from S (cys, sigma donor) to Cu(II). However, the absorption profile of the C26A mutant has a weak 628 nm band and it is absent in the N47C mutant. These results suggest that holo C26A has two different Cu bound populations. C26A has the structured fluorescence emission of Trp similar to WT azurin with a broad shoulder around 340 nm whereas N47C h as unstructured red -shifted fluorescence emission. C26A has a mixed population of water exposed and hydrophobic core. Cu binding property of these two populations is different, giving different bands in the absorption profile. Thermal denaturation reveals that the disulfide bond has a distinct role towards thermal stability of the protein. Fluorescence decay kinetics at 340 nm clearly shows Cu binding of N47C mutant whereas decay kinetics at 320 nm for C26A mutant shows Cu binding is ambiguous. Anisotropy measurement showed that N47C has a short rotational correlation time for Trp rotation, when measured at 340 nm, which is in accordance with the red -shifted fluorescence emission. For C26A, the short correlation time is long with very small amplitude when me asured at 320 nm. This indicates the property of the population with compact core.

Although the cause of this disease is unknown, aggregation of copper -zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is considered to be one of the prime factor responsible for the disease pathology (2 ). A thorough understanding of the folding land scape pertaining to SOD1 native structure attainment and its intrinsic propensity towards misfolding is essential to identify suitable pharmaceutical leads against ALS. Since SOD1 is a metalloenzyme and Cu and Zn are responsible for the catalytic activity and structural stability, it is important to understand the role of metals in the context of stability and aggregation propensity of the metalloenzyme.

But oligom eric construction needs to be initiated by activation of Bax (by BH3 only proteins) and eventual major conformational changes in the first place. Among many theories regarding BAX activation [1], some have suggested transient binding of activator BH3 prote ins to the hydrophobic BC groove (2 -5) initiates activation, whereas some have voted for the rear pocket (1-6) BH3 binding. However, C -terminal (9) exclusion from the BC groove is the first major conformational change regardless of the activation path way. In this work, we have tried to understand the energetic preference among the suggested pathways using MD simulation. We have found two distinct minima inside the BC groove with two different compactness of the C - terminal for a wild -type BAX, but in bu lk water extended helices are more favorable. Later, comparison of this wild -type free energy landscape with the one having a BH3 only protein in the rear pocket of BAX, has provided useful insight into this debate. Moreover, atomistic MD simulation have e xplored the dynamical consequences of rear pocket BAX binding towards its activation.

It is generally considered that only native contacts are formed during transition from unfolded to native state. But many interactions, other than those pr esent in the native state, can be generated in the folding pathway, which might have relevance to their biological function. The PI3K SH3 domain was believed to be a two state folder, but recent studies have shown the presence of equilibrium as well as kin etic folding intermediates. The protein is known to encounter a transient non native burial of Trp53, the sole Trp in the protein, which is otherwise present in the solvent exposed surface, within dead time of mixing (8 ms). Here, we have studied kinetic u nfolding of SH3 domain of PI3K in sub -millisecond time domain to capture the formation of the non native interaction, which could not be characterized earlier due to limitations in the dead time achieved by stopped flow mixer. Here, we see an inverse depen dence of apparent unfolding rate constants on denaturant concentration, which being a characteristic of folding reaction, gives a clear indication, that it is a folding like event happening during unfolding of the protein. The non native interactions were further characterized by mutational analysis.

The response of CaM protein as a fu nction of ionic strength, calcium ion removal and temperature at physiological pH condition is investigated using classical Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Changing the ionic strength and temperature came out to be two of the possible routes for obser ving a conformation change in the protein. In the present study, as the calcium ions are removed from the protein, the protein is observed to acquire more flexibility. This flexibility is observed to be more prominent at a higher ionic strength. At a lower ionic strength of 150 mM with all the four calcium ions intact, the N and C -lobes are observed to come close to a distance of 30 \u00c5 starting from an initial separation distance of 48 \u00c5. This conformation change is observed to take place around 50 ns in a s imulation of 100 ns. As a second parameter, temperature is observed to play a key role in the conformation change of the protein. Earlier these kind of studies have been performed experimentally using fluorescence measurements as in [4]. The calcium bound form of CaM is observed to undergo a reversible conformation change in the range 295 -301 K at calcium ion concentration 150 mM. The transition temperature was observed to depend on the calcium ion concentration of the protein. Leap -dynamics approach was a lso used earlier to study the temperature dependent conformation change of CaM [5]. We perform MD simulations of 100 ns each for the temperature range 300 - 500 K on the apo form of CaM, 3CLN and 1CFD. A remarkable dependence of the temperature is observed o n the overall dynamics of the protein as reported in our earlier study [6, 7]. 1CFD shows a much flexible linker as compared to 3CLN whereas the overall dynamics of the lobes mainly N -lobe is observed to be more in later case [8]. 1.

Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Partially Native Intermediates Mediate Misfolding in SOD1 Studied by Single -Molecule Garen,1 and Michael T. Woodside1,2,* 1Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E1 Canada 2National Institute for Nanotechnology, National protecting against from superoxide, is associated with the fatal neur odegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the mechanism of misfolding remains unclear. We examined SOD1 folding at the single -molecule level, using optical tweezers to unfold and refold SOD1 under tension. Focusing on the reduced, un -metallated form of the protein (apo - SOD1SH), which is the least stable form and thus thought to be most relevant for misfolding, we measured force -extension curves (FECs) of the unfolding and refolding of isolated monomers. FECs revealed multiple intermedi ate states, showing that the folding is much more complex than expected. By relating the contour -length changes observed in the FECs to structural features of apo-SOD1, we propose possible native folding pathways for the apo -SOD1SH monomer wherein -strand s peel off sequentially. We also identified a stable core of the protein which always unfolds last and refolds first. Notably, FECs occasionally revealed length changes that did not match the value expected for native folding, suggesting misfolding. Compar ing the sequence of intermediates observed during native folding and misfolding, we found that misfolding branched off from the native folding at different stages after formation of the stable core. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Characterization of amyloid A oligomers by extrinsic fluorescence probe DCVJ Sureshbabu Nagarajan1, Physics and Astronomy and 2Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University nsuresh@msu.edu Misfolded and intrinsically unfolded proteins are more prone to aggregation in the form of oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils. Oligomers and fibrils are toxic to neuronal cells in vitro, forms ion channels, and disturb the integrity of the synthetic membrane lipids and rafts. Although probes such as thioflavin -T/S and Congo Red binds more specifically to amyloid fibrils, there is a pressing need to identify probes that bind at the early stage of aggregation and reports on the mechanism of their aggregation. Here we show that molecular rotor 9 -(dicyano -vinyl)julolidine (DCVJ) binds monomers as well as early aggregates and reports on the change in dynamics as well as oligomeric shape and packing. The binding of DCVJ to A 40 and A 42 increases the fluorescence intensity with time around 505 nm, a nd for the A 40 there appears a second excimer peak at 575 nm. Further the DCVJ fluorescence at 505nm increases 5 -fold greater for A 42 compared to A 40, which suggests the oligomers are more tightly packed in A 42 than in A 40. The comparison of DCVJ kine tics profile at 505nm and 575 nm for A 40 and two mutants show differences that reflect the size and shape of the corresponding oligomers obtained from AFM. The results of this study shows that DCVJ not only binds early aggregates, but also provides valua ble information regarding oligomer packing, morphology and mechanism of its formation. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM How the terminal region of a multi -domain protein dictates its folding, function and stability? Tapan K. Chaudhuri and Ashutosh Pastor School of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi tkchaudhuri@bioschool.iitd.ac.in Maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ) short malto oligosaccharides from the reducing end releasing glucose and maltose. It is an aggregation prone protein, and forms inclusion body during recombinant expression, and provides very poor quantity of spontaneous refolding. However, molecular chaperone GroEL/GroES assists in its refolding process, and yields about 50% of refolding in vitro and significant enhancement of folding yield happens when co -expressed with recombinant MalZ. The N -terminal region of this enzyme appears to be a unique domain as seen in sequence comparison studies with other amylases as well as through homology modelling. The sequence and homology model analysis show a probability of disorder in the N -Terminal region of MalZ. The crystal struc ture of this enzyme has been recently solved, which indicates that the N -terminal region of the enzyme (Met1 - Phe131) might be unstructured or flexible. To understand the role of the N -terminal region of MalZ in its folding, enzymatic activity, and overal l stability, a truncated version (Ala111 -His616) of MalZ was created. The truncated version failed to fold into an active enzyme both in E.coli cytosol and in vitro , even with the assistance of chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Furthermore, the refolding effort of N -truncated MalZ in the presence of isolated N -terminal domain didn't succeed. Our studies suggest that while the structural rigidity or orientation of the N -terminal region of the MalZ protein may not be essential for its stability and function, but t he said domain is likely to play an important role in the formation of the native structure of the protein when present as an integral part of the protein. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Solubility of TMRA42 fibrils is controlled by the equilibrium between the accessible conformations of the monomeric peptide timirbaransil@gmail.com Amyloids are one -dimensional aggregates of protein involved in multiple diseases e.g., Alzheimers Diseases (AD), Parkinsons Diseases (PD) etc. Deposition of these aggregates is the pathological hallmark of these diseases and it keep accumulating over tim e due to its insoluble nature in native condition. Measured in-vitro solubility of these aggregates lies in micro molar range which contradicts with in-vivo pico molar solubility. We have measured solubility of TMRA42 aggregate sta rting from fibrillar sp ecies in native buffer and it showed minimal solubility even at low nM concentrations. These aggregates can be dissolved in chemical denaturant like Urea and GdnCl in a concentration dependent manner. The solubility data can be fit using a two -state foldin g-unfolding model allowing us to measure free energy difference between the conformations in soluble phase (random coil) and insoluble phase (beta -structure). Measurement of hydrodynamic radii using Fluorescence correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) revealed a si milar free energy changes for transition from native to denatured conformations for the monomeric TMRA42. We hypothesize that dissolution of fibrils is controlled by the equilibrium of the conformations of the monomeric peptide between the soluble and the fibrillar phases. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Charge Patterned Sequences Form Helical Structures Through Charge Neutralization Tyler S. Harmon1, Ammon E. Posey2, and Rohit V. Pappu2 1Department of Physics, Washington University in St. Louis 2Department of Biomedical Engineering & Center for Biological Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis tylerharmon@gmail.com Many proteins with repeating blocks of oppositely charged residues form long single alpha helices (SAHs).The consensus sequence is a block of four Glu residues followed by a block of four Lys or Arg residues, (Glu 4(Lys/Arg) 4)n. The current working hypothesis is that SAHs are stabilized by i:i+4 salt bridges between opposite charges in consecutive helical turns.We test the merits of this hypot hesis to understand the sequence -encoded preference for SAHs and the logic behind the failure of certain atomistic simulations in anticipating the preference for stable SAHs. In simulations with fixed charges the favorable free energy of solvation of char ged residues and the associated loss of sidechain entropy hinders the formation of SAHs. We proposed that alterations to charge states induced by sequence context might play an important role in stabilizing SAHs.We tested this hypothesis using a (Glu 4Lys 4)n repeat protein and a simulation strategy that permits the substitution of charged residues with neutralized protonated or deprotonated variants of Glu / Lys. Our results predict that stable SAH structures derive from the neutralization of approximately h alf the Glu residues. These findings explain experimental observations and also provide a coherent rationale for the failure of simulations based on fixed charge models. Large -scale sequence analysis reveals that naturally occurring sequences often include \"defects\" in charge patterns such as Gln or Ala substitutions. This sequence -encoded incorporation of uncharged residues combined with neutralization of charged residues might tilt the balance toward alpha helical conformations. Our results highlight th e need for developing robust methodologies for constant pH simulationsthat can be applied to sequences with high charge contents. They also highlight the need for generalizing bioinformatics predictors to account for sequence -encoded charge regulation that might influence disorder predictions for sequences with high fractions of charged residues. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Influenza Immunogen Design on a Nanoparticle Platform Uddipan Kar, Vamsee V. A. Mallajosyula and Raghavan Varadarajan Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science kar.uddipan@gmail.com Influenza virus is a human pathogen leading to frequent respiratory illness and current influenza vaccines need to be annually updated due to the ever evolving nature of the virus resulting in escape variants. Hemagglutinin (HA), a surface glycoprotein on Influenza virus has a lways been an attractive target for vaccine design. We recently designed a headless HA stem immunogen pH1HA10 -foldon, where Foldon is the corresponding sequence from H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (PDB -3LZG). Further in a recent study, Ferritin nanoparticles which self -assemble to 24 -mers were engineered to display repetitive arrays of full -length HA and a HA mini stem that induced a strong immune response (Kanekiyo et al, 2013). We therefore engineered a fusion of pH1HA10 -Foldon with Ferritin as the antigen display platform.This pH1HA10 fused to Ferritin construct was biophysically characterized. Since Ferritin can self-assemble itself into a 24 -mer, we also removed the Foldon trimerization domain to generate pH1HA10 fused to Ferritin which was further characterized. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Multiple Intermediates in the Folding Pathway of Rabbit Prion Protein Studied by Single -Molecule Force Spectroscopy Uttam Anand , Craig Garen and Michael T. Woodside Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton uanand@ualberta.ca Prion protein (PrP) is one of the most extensively studied proteins in regards to misfolding and aggregation. It has long been known that different species of animals have different susceptibility to prion disease, b ut the factors that protect the resistant species that could help develop treatments both for prion diseases and prion -like diseases remain unclear. Hence, to explore the folding of individual PrP molecules from different species with different levels of d isease susceptibility, we applied single -molecule force spectroscopy to observe directly the folding pathway of the Rabbit prion protein, RbPrP (less susceptible) to compare it with Syrian Hamster PrP (ShPrP, more susceptible) which has already been studie d in detail at the single molecule level. By measuring force -extension curves (FECs) of single RbPrP molecules held under tension in a high -resolution optical trap, we found that RbPrP has multiple intermediate states unlike ShPrP which shows only two stat e unfolding. By relating the contour -length changes observed in the FECs to structural features of RbPrP, we propose possible native folding pathways for the RbPrP where all the -helices unfold separately along with the loops and the - strand. We observed similar intermediates by analyzing the refolding FECs and there were no dissimilarities between the unfolding and refolding pathways. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Investigation of multi -domain protein folding through characterization of folding/unfolding intermediates Vipul Sciences, IIT Delhi vipul_tmr99@yahoo.co.in Multi domain proteins, despite of their large size and loosely -dependent/independent folding units manage to attain their native form with high accur acy. Recent studies have shown that Malate synthase G (MSG), a large, single chain multi -domain protein (82kDa), folds reversibly from GdmCl unfolded state and indicate presence of equilibrium intermediates1. Same study also shows that the protein refolds via formation of native like intermediates which slowly rearranges to native conformation1. As all previous studies have been conducted with GdmCl as denaturant, we further explore the mechanism by urea as denaturant to exclude the ionic effects of GdmCl. Equilibrium studies with urea give clear indication of three state transition curve and hence presence of stable intermediates. The manual refolding kinetics studies indicate double phase of refolding with curvature in both refolding arms. The point of in flexion at low urea concentration probably hints towards off -pathway intermediate which further needs to be confirmed. The manual unfolding studies show two distinct intersecting chevron arms with different m u corresponding to two phases of unfolding. The result might be due to heterogeneity in the native form or a consequence of unfolding of independent units of same protein. Reference : 1. Dahiya V ., Chaudhuri T . K. (2013).

Udgaonkar National Centre for Biological Sciences vishal@ncbs.res.in The conformational dynamics of prion protein appears to be responsible for the causation of a number of fatal neurodegenerative disorders. It is believed that the normal cellular form of prion protein, which is membrane tethered and appears to be cyto -protective in nature, makes a transition to a conformationally altered, pathogenic form which is aggregation -prone. However, the precise nature of this transition, the physiological functions of the normal cellular form, and the molecular mechanism utilized by the pathogenic form for neurodegeneration are still not clear. There are indications that regulation of calcium levels in cells might be a key aspect of prion protein biology. The presence of different forms of prion protein, monomeric or aggregated, has been shown to affect calcium levels in cells. Further, the prion protein has been shown to interact with several proteins at cell surface that are linked with calcium signaling in cells, and the recombinant form of prion protein has been shown to form calcium selective ion - channels on artificial membranes, therefore suggesting that the prion protein could influence calcium levels in cells using multiple modes. H owever at this stage, it is not completely clear as to which mode of calcium transit (ion -channel or signaling) is preferred by which form of prion protein (monomeric or aggregated), and why. Using the mouse prion protein as a model system, we have explore d such interactions of prion protein at cell surface and their impact on cellular calcium levels. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Effect of functional residues on folding of Ubiquitin Vishram L. Terse NCBS vishramt7@gmail.com Ubiquitin (Ub), a highly protein has been studied extensively both experimentally and computationally. The current study is based on the observation that Ub folds through different pathways when simulated using 4.5 \u00c5 cutoff and CSU contact maps. Analysis of both the contact maps shows that C SU map has long range contacts made by residues His68 and Arg72 which are absent from the 4.5 \u00c5 map. In order to dissect out the role of these contacts a folding motif was constructed. The motif folds through same pathway, irrespective of the contact map u sed. Comparison of motif contact map with Ub led to the conclusion that contacts made by His68 and Arg72 are unique to Ub. These residues are known to be important for binding of Ub to its partners. The study concludes by speculating that these residues fo rm binding pockets/cavities which cause them to have long range contacts. Posters THIRD INTERNATIONAL PROTEIN FOLDING SYMPOSIUM Sequence and structure impose a specific fitness landscape across t hree phylogenetically divergent thermophilic Venev, Konstantin Zeldovich, C. Robert Matthews University of Massachusetts Medical School Yvonne.chan@umassmed.edu TIM barrel proteins are encoded by highly divergent sequences, but fold to highly conserved () 8 structures with varying stabilities and functions. The phosphate synthase required for tryptophan biosynthesis in bacteria, archaea and yeast, was used to investigate how sequence and structure are correlated wi th fitness in a competition growth assay. the S. solfataricus (SsIGPS, and T. bacteria) thermophiles were subjected to the EMPIRIC assay to assess the change in fitness of yeast transformed with these genes following saturating mutagenesis on the 8 -stands and the preceding -loops, known to be important for protein stability. We explored the fitness landscapes of these three orthologous TIM barrel proteins to answer two important questions at the intersection of biophysics and evolutionary biology: what are the salient features of a TIM barrel fitness landscape, and whether the fitness landscapes of phylogenetically -divergent proteins are correlated. The fact that the thermophilic proteins we chose for this study were not well adapted to the mesophilic host environment was fortuitous, providing an opportunity to identify beneficial mutations that increase the fitness under sub - optimal growth conditions. Surprisingly, mutations in t he -loops distal from the active site increase the fitness of all 3 IPGS orthologs, implying a common allosteric effect. In general, despite the low sequence identity (<35%) of the wildtype (WT) sequences, the fitness landscapes of the three IGPS protein sare correlated. While part of this result can be explained by the effects of side chain physical chemistry on protein folding and thus fitness, the correlation between fitness landscapes at structurally equivalent positions, irrespective of the WT amino a cid, suggests that the structure of the TIM barrel fold imposes a specific fitness landscape. To our knowledge, the conservation of a fitness landscape in sequence and structure space across evolutionary time has not been previously observed.
