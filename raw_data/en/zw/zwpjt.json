Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Here, we report the case of a 13-year-old girl with a history of HSP who presented to a chiropractic clinic with chronic low back pain and rehabilitation for lower extremity weakness. She had been receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and baclofen for spasticity. Full-spine radiography revealed borderline acetabular dysplasia in the right hip. After nine months of chiropractic therapy, the patient reported reduced lower extremity spasticity and pain as well as improved strength and functionality. As non-invasive therapies have minimal side effects, chiropractic therapy can be used alongside or in combination with other treatments as an additional option for the long-term management of HSP.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-03-23", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
