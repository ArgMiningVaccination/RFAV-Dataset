Staphylococcus aureus is one of the strong biofilm-forming bacteria that cause antibiotic resistance. Calincing ( Oxalis corniculata L.) leaves have excellent antibacterial activity, but their antibiofilm activity against S. aureus has not been reported until now. Currently, the discovery of new antibiofilm against S. aureus biofilms is significant to prevent the impact of infections caused by biofilms. This study was intended to determine the effectiveness of the ethanol extract of O. corniculata leaves in inhibiting and eradicating S. aureus biofilm formation. Planktonic testing, inhibition, and biofilm eradication activity were carried out using the microtiter broth method. Antibiofilm activity of O. corniculata leaves against S. aureus biofilm was analyzed by calculating the minimum concentration of biofilm inhibitor (MBIC 50 ) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC 50 ). Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) with a 95% confidence level. Oxalis corniculata leaves showed inhibitory activity on the formation of the tested S. aureus biofilm. The ethanol extract of 1% O. corniculata leaves gave 76.23\u00b10.01% antibacterial activity of S. aureus and 71.32\u00b10.01% of mid-phase antibiofilm activity, and 69.33\u00b10.01% maturation phase. The results also prove that the ethanolic extract of O. corniculata leaves can eradicate S. aureus biofilm formation. Therefore, the ethanol extract of O. corniculata leaves can be developed as a new antibiofilm against S. aureus .", "sitename": "Borneo Journal of Pharmacy -", "date": "2018-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Themes by Openjournaltheme.com Novelty OJS 3 Theme by openjournaltheme.com theme Quick jump to page content Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Borneo Journal of Pharmacy Register Login Online ISSN : 2621-4814 Toggle navigation Home About About the Journal Abstracting and Indexing Publication Frequency Journal History Citedness in Scopus Citedness in Web of Science Article Statistics Journal Diversity Subscribers Sponsorship Journal Policy Aims and Scope Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement Retraction, Withdrawal, and Correction (R-W-C) Policy Editorial Policies Peer-Review Policy Open Access Policy Licensing Policy Archiving Policy Plagiarism Policy Study Ethics and Ethical Clearance Policy Informed Consent Policy Conflict of Interest Policy People Editorial Board Acknowledgment for past Peer-Reviewers Publisher Contact Issue Current Archives Accepted Manuscripts Author Index Submit Article Submissions Author Guidelines Article Processing Charge Copyright Notice Privacy Statement Announcements Search "}
