There are potential side effects to these new vaccines. But it's also important to know that, upon granting authorization and approval, the FDA stated that the \"known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks\" of each of these vaccines. \"What we certainly don't want is for people to avoid getting vaccinated because they're afraid of side effects,\" says Dr. H. Dirk Sostman, president of the Academic Institute at Houston Methodist. \"In addition, since both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, we also don't want people to be surprised by the side effects and avoid getting their second dose as a result. You will need to get both doses of these vaccines to be protected.\" While inconvenient, it may be reassuring to understand that these side effects are an indication that the vaccine is doing its job \u2014 helping your body develop immunity to the virus. This is tough work, so it's no surprise you \"feel it.\" What are the most common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines? Before any new COVID-19 vaccine is made available to the public, the FDA and other experts will have reviewed a lot of information regarding both its safety and effectiveness. (Related: [Here's What We Know About COVID-19 Vaccine Safety](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/dec/heres-how-we-know-covid-19-vaccines-are-safe/)) \"Every COVID-19 vaccine will have undergone rigorous testing via clinical trials, as well as thorough external review by the FDA, CDC and their independent panels of experts,\" says Dr. Sostman. \"Any potential side effects will be well-documented and made clear to the public.\" The most common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines are: - Pain, redness and swelling at the site of the shot - Fatigue - Headache - Muscle and joint pain - Low-grade fever and chills - Nausea/vomiting - Swollen lymph nodes \"One way to reduce the chance of uncomfortable side effects is to take a pain reliever, such as Tylenol, if you experience any discomfort,\" adds Dr. Sostman. If you do become concerned about side effects you're experiencing, seek medical attention immediately or call 911 if the effects are severe. If they are not severe, call your doctor's office or use [Houston Methodist Virtual Urgent Care](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/virtual-urgent-care/?inm=blog). \"Ultimately, when compared to the very severe symptoms a person can develop while ill with COVID-19, vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to protect your health and keep your community safe during this pandemic,\" explains Dr. Sostman. Can the COVID-19 vaccine get me sick? While there are potential side effects to the vaccines, these reactions are a feature of receiving a vaccine \u2014 not of being infected with COVID-19. \"These vaccines cannot cause COVID-19,\" Dr. Sostman says. \"Instead, what you may feel are the so-called 'reactogenic' effects of the vaccine working on your body and immune system.\" There will ultimately be several different types of COVID-19 vaccines, and each vaccine will work in a slightly different way. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are [mRNA vaccines](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/dec/how-an-mrna-covid-19-vaccine-works). Not only are these much quicker to produce, one of the major advantages of this type of vaccine is that there's no chance that the vaccine can result in infection. \"These new mRNA vaccines rely on synthetic, noninfectious RNA material \u2014 which your cells then use to create a harmless viral component. Since this component cannot assemble into a complete virus, it can't actually make you sick. But, it can stimulate an immune response to the virus,\" explains Dr. Sostman. \"The mRNA is then quickly degraded, so there's also no chance for it to affect your body beyond its role in helping to confer immunity.\" Similarly, Johnson & Johnson's [viral vector vaccine](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/mar/viral-vector-covid-19-vaccines-4-things-to-know/) also cannot make you ill. There are several other [misconceptions about these vaccines](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/mar/covid-19-vaccine-myths-debunked/) you may hear about online or on social media. Make sure you know how to separate misinformation from actual information when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. What about adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccination? The bottom line is that no vaccine or drug is ever going to be completely free of side effects or adverse effects \u2014 COVID-19 vaccines included. \"It's true that we don't have years of long-term follow up for these vaccines yet. What we do have is months of follow-up that cover the period when adverse issues with vaccines are normally discovered,\" adds Dr. Sostman. It is important to note that each vaccine is made slightly differently. While rare, allergic reactions are possible. You should not take any vaccine that contains an ingredient you are allergic to: [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download) [Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download) [Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download) If you feel that you're having a severe allergic reaction after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, call 911. People who have a severe or immediate allergic reactions to the first dose of the vaccine [should not get a second dose](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html). Lastly, the CDC and the FDA will continue to monitor individuals who have received the vaccine to ensure that we completely understand any safety issues. **After a temporary pause, use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine has resumed. However, [the CDC has stated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/JJUpdate.html) that women under the age of 50 should be aware of the rare but increased risk of experiencing an adverse event called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). This risk has not been seen with the other COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S., Pfizer and Moderna. Women between the ages of 18 and 49 should discuss vaccine options with their doctor if they have questions or concerns.
