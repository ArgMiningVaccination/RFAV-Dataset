Consumers are increasingly using aromatherapy for specific health issues, especially in France and Germany , where aromatherapy is used as a medical treatment in the context of phytotherapy. Product descripti on Aromatherapy is defined as using genuine and authentic essential oils for their healing properties; the term \"essential oil therapy\" is also increasingly used. In aromatherapy, essential oils can be inhaled, used topically or used internally. Box 1: How to use this Factsheet Learn how European consumers use aromatherapy and for which indication areas . Learn about the developing country species that are most commonplace and of greatest interest . Learn about requirements you need to meet for aromatherapy species . There are v arious forms of aromatherapy (Fundamentals of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Micozzi, 2015). This factsheet focuses on the following: Holistic aromatherapy is the most common form of aromatherapy. Here, massage is an important form of application ; for that purpose several essential oils can be blended with vegetable oils and lotions. The efficacy and safety of the overall combination is the main consideration. Holistic aromatherapy has a holistic approach, focu sing o n the balance of body and mind. Medical aromatherapy is the second largest form of aromatherapy, which originates in herbal medicine. This is mostly practi sed in Germany and France, although it is growing in countries such as the UK. In this form, es sential oils are applied for their pharmacological activities, rather than for their aroma or psychophysiological effects. Moreover, dosages are generally higher or more intensive than in holistic aromatherapy. Internal use is more common in medical aromat herapy, along with topical application. Compliance with pharmaceutical legislation might be required. This is needed when the essential oil is marketed as a medical product or ingredient (herbal or conventional medicinal product) by a manufacturer, or when pharmacists use it in their preparations. However, when consumers themselves apply essential oils as aromatherapy products medicinally based on literature, it is not needed (e.g. essential oils can still be marketed as natural ingredients according to che mical legislation, including as cosmetic ingredients and consumer products). Other forms of aromatherapy include clinical aromatherapy (a combination of holistic and medical aromatherapy) and aesthetic aromatherapy (for wellbeing and cosmetic benefits). Essential oils can be produced from various plant sources (wild collection and/or cultivated), as well as from different plan t parts, including resins (plant exudates), leaves, flowers, fruits (the peel), bark and wood. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines essential oils as products \"made by distillation with either water or steam, or by mechanical processing of citrus rinds [expression], or by dry distillation of natural materials\". Extraction methods mainly depend on the raw material that is being extracted. Essential oils include flower oils (e.g. rose, geranium absolute), resin oils (e.g. franki ncense), fruit oils (e.g. citrus oils), leaf oils (e.g. patchouli or cajeput oil), roots (e.g. vetiver or valerian oil) herb oils (e.g. peppermint oil) and bark/wood oils (e.g. sandalwood and cedarwood oils). CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 3 Essential oil quality Product identity of ess ential oils for aromatherapy is key and needs to be specific (species, sub -species, varieties and chemotypes). Chemical compositions vary among species and varieties thereof. This chemical composition forms the basis of its therapeutic benefits in aromathe rapy. Next to the species used, an oil's chemical composition also depends on : the environment of production; time and method of harvesting and processing; and storage conditions. Quality of the oil s is key for their use in aromatherapy, especially in med ical aromatherapy. Optimum quality of essential oils implies that they are 100% natural (i.e. not adulterated through the addition of chemicals) and 100% pure (i.e. not mixed with, or infused in , any other oils that have similar characteristics). Such esse ntial oils are called \"genuine and authentic\". Essential oils from developing countries Aromatherapy is an important market for small and medium -sized essential oil producers at origin, when they can guarantee the quality needed for use in aromatherapy. This market works with low volumes at high value . Essential oils are used in a wide range of indication areas, although aromatherapy treatment is more common for some health issues than others. Major indication areas are fungal, bacterial and/or viral infections, stress & anxiety (including mood and sleep disorders), cough & cold and pain relief. These and other indication areas are included in Annex I . This table also includes some exemplary essential oil species. Developing country producers h ave good potential to produce several of these oils. What is the demand for aromatherapy in Europe? Data on European market demand for aromatherapy are limited. The majority of European essential oil imports are destined for the flavour and fragrance industry. Some 20% of these imports are used in aromather apy and cosmetics, Tips: Provide analyses of the chemical profile of your essential oil as \"type\" and \"lot\" samples. All your lots need to be tested with gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) in order to describe the oil's composition. Include this information in your Product Factsheet and specifications, as it is important to buyers. Work together with a local university department or laboratory to determine the composition of your essential oil. Get in c ontact with your national aromatherapy sector to supply genuine and authentic essential oils to your national market. Have a look at WHO herbal monographs (volumes 1 -4) and the WHO Traditional Medicine homepage for more information on product identity requirements and aromatherapy in your own country/region. For more information on essential oils used in cosmetics, refer to CBI's Market Intelligence on Natural Ingredients for Cosmetics regarding several essential oils and the cosmetics market for aromatherapy . Also, refer to relevant European and International literature available from , for example , Forum Essenzia . Tips: Refer to CBI's Market Intelligence on Natural Ingredients for Health Products for mo re information on other health products for the above -mentioned indication areas. For more information on essential oils used in aromatherapy, please refer to the literature available under Forum Essenzia . For information on properties of essential oils in aromatherapy, have a look at sources such as WHO Herbal Monographs ; books by Dr. Kurt Schnaubelt , Pierre Franchomme and Robert Tisserant ; the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA); or the Aromatherapy Bible. Check community herbal monographs for essential oils as provided by the European Medicines Agency to assess product standards and possible claims. This is important in medical aromatherapy. Check databases such as Herbmed to identify research on traditional use, clinical trials (safety and efficacy evaluati on of herbal formulations on people) and patents. In Europe, you can contact relevant universities such as the University of Vienna , the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and the University of Graz . Access scientific resources , for example through Elsevier Science Direct (not for free). Also consider becoming a member of the Society for Medicinal Plant and Natural Product Research (GA) to access their research. CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 4 according to industry sources. In 2014, European imports of essential oils amounted to 86 thousand tonnes at \u20ac1.2 billion. The aromatherapy market in Europe is stable, according to industry sources. There is a particularly strong market for aromatherapy in France, Germany, the UK, Austria and Switzerland , where aromatherapy is commonly practi sed as medicine. Although this is still uncommon in the UK, the country's licensed practitioners are growing in number. In most other West European c ountries mostly holistic or aesthetic aromatherapy is used, with products being market as cosmetics. In France , aromatherapy is a popular form of alternative medicine and used to treat various conditions. In French aromatherapy practices, essential oils ar e mainly used internally. Practitioners with a focus on phytotherapy require a separate licen ce to administer aromatherapy. According to industry sources, the country offers good opportunities for genuine and authentic essentia l oils for use in aromatherap y. The aromatherapy market in Germany is developing strongly, as health insurance companies are increasingly paying for alternative therapies. Compared to most West European countries, alternative therapies in Germany (such as aromatherapy) have a stronger focus on curing illness, as opposed to preventive health. Essential oils are used both internally and externally. Aromatherapy is regarded as a medical treatment, and is administered in conjunction with doctors. Austria and Switzerland have a similar mark et for medical aromatherapy according to industry experts. The a romatherapy oil market in the UK was estimated to grow almost 2% in both 2013 and 2014, after the market dropped from 2008 to 2011 ( Research and Markets, 2013 ). UK consumers, but also Dutch consumers, still use aromatherapy mostly for relaxation or preventative care rather than as a form of medication targeting particular health issues. Oils are less often used intern ally as compared to France and Germany. Aromatherapists are recog nised as a separate profession. What trends offer opportunities on the European market for aromatherapy? Several trends on the European market aid the interest in aromatherapy oils: Consumers see natural health products, such as aromatherapy, as milder and thus safer options as compared to conventional medicine. Consumer awareness of side effects from conventional medicine is increasing, especially for strong medicines taken over long periods of time. According to industry experts, there is growing trust in the effectiveness of essential oils for various health indications. For example, there are more accounts of resistant bacteria, which antibiotics cannot defeat. Some researchers are looking into the use of essential oils, which may be effective on these resistant bacteria. To both consumers and companies, massive, and growing, amounts of information are available on aromatherapy and essential oils used for specific effects. Some essential o ils do not even need product claims and information on applications because consumers already know or can easily find information on how and for what effect to use them. Be aware that you are not allowed to make medicinal claims in your product documentation or marketing materials when marketing your product to cosmetics manufacturers. You can make such claims if you target the herbal medicinal products market, but then you also need to comply with relevant legislation. Traceability of oils used in aromatherapy is key. Since aromatherapy relies on the chemical composition of essential oils, product identity and origin is vital. Tips: Focus your exports on the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria, as these are important markets for aromatherapy products. Be aware that for countries where aromatherapy is often marketed and administered as a medicinal product (e.g. France, Germany ), you most likely need to comply with legislation for herbal medicinal products (see Buyer Requirements ). Look for distributors that can maximise your impact and presence on the aromatherapy market. Some manufa cturers may also buy directly from you as a producer in an origin country. Please refer to CBI Trade Statistics for Natural Ingredients for Health Pro ducts for statistics on European markets for herbal medicinal products and food supplements. Tips: Be careful with the claims you make on your essential oil. Consider not making claims at all and sell essential oils as natural ingredients based on proven product identity. If you want to make claims for your essential oils , ensure you can back up these claims to any potential buyer. You need to guarantee safety and efficacy according to the mode of use and the respective legislation as an ingredient/chemical or as a final consumer product. For more information on claims, refer to the Buyer Requirements section of this factsheet. CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 5 Sustainable and ethic al production of essential oils is of particular importance when consumers use them as aromatherapy. Organically produced oils are seen as having a higher quality than conventional ly produced oils. Moreover, many consumers of essential oils for health purp oses are also interested in ethically produced oils. Essential oils used for holistic aromatherapy require a good marketing campaign to show how and fo r which indications they can be used. You can use several elements to build such marketing stories: Along with traceability, traditional usage is important, since aromatherapy oils often lack scientific proof of their effectiveness. Together with the oil' s image, traditional use forms the basis for their use in aromatherapy. Although you cannot make claims which are not backed up by monographs, you can refer to publications on aroma - therapeutical use of your product. At the retail level, essential oils use d in aromatherapy are often marketed without claims, but in conjunction with literature, even in the same display. An oil's origin can be used, especially when this \"fits\" with the indication area it is traditionally used for. For example, an exotic origin can be marketed as a place where you can reduce stress, which would fit with oils targeting stress & anxiety issues (e.g. rose geranium oil from R\u00e9union). Organic or fair trade certification may add value to your oil, but this depends on your (prospectiv e) buyer. What requirements should aromatherapy oils comply with to be allowed on the European market? Which requirements you need to comply with depends on how your essential oil is marketed in Europe. European companies can market essential oils as a food ingredient , medicinal ingredient/product and/or a cosmetic ingredient/product . How essential oils are marketed in Europe (as an ingredient or a consumer product and in which market segment) determines which market access requirements you need to comply with. For some essential oils more than one option exists. This section focuses on the medicinal framework conditions . For their use as food or cosmetic ingredients, please refer to the Module Buyer Requirements for Natural Ingredients for Cosmetics and Natural Colours, Flavours and Thickeners , respectively . For a more detailed overview of the medicinal product framework and the route to market, have a look at the Module Buyer Requirements for Natural Ingredients for Health Products . What requirements do I need to comply with to export natural ingredients? You need to comply with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) . CITES regulates the trade in (for example) wild -collected endangered plants and provides guidance on the species for which trade is prohibited or restricted. Your ingredient might require you to establish Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) agreements . These 'mutually agreed terms' detail the terms and conditions of access and use of genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge and supply of raw materials. You need to ensure sustainable sourcing of your ingredients. This is important to buyer s, as they are facing supply shortages for an ever -increasing number of cultivated, but especially wild -collected species. You do not always have to certify sustainable sourcing ; have a look at these value -addition opportunities in the section Competition . Tips: Demonstrate traceability and sustainable future access to raw materials, particularly with regard to scarce ingredients. For more information on traceability and sustainability, please refer to the Buyer Requirements section below. Tips: Create thematic marketing stories for aromatherapy oils that include how and for what indication these oils were traditionally used. Try to link to available literature, and where available to pharmaceutical monographs. Clearly communicate the country of o rigin so your buyer can communicate these to end - users. Discuss certification options with your buyers before you apply for organic or other certifications. Please refer to CBI Trends for more market trends. CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 6 What requirements do I need to comply with to export essential oils? In principle, essential oils are bound by the legislation on chemical substances. Therefore, with few exceptions, they need to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency under REACH (Registration Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) legislation. If volumes remain under 1 tonne per importer, registration is not required except for the most hazardous chemicals. In all cases, the burden of proof lies with the EU importer/manufactu rer that wishes to employ this exemption (an absence of information on the properties of a substance does not mean an ab sence of hazardous properties). The EU sets requirements on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of chemicals (CLP) . This also includes required symbols and phrases on labels warning users and providing safety advice . These requirements have been adopted from the United Nations ' Globally Harmonised Systems (GHS). What requirements do I ne ed to comply with to enter the EU market for aromatherapy oils marketed as herbal medicinal products? If your (potential) buyer wants to market essential oils as a herbal medicinal product, you also need to comply with EU legislation for herbal medicinal products (Directive 2004/24/EC). This procedure provides a specific, simplified regime for traditional herbal medicinal products which can meet certain requirements. Compliance is still required with the detailed quality, documentation, labelling, packaging, certification and traceability standards as established in the rules governing medicinal products in the European Union . This set of rules also governs marketing authorisation of medicinal products - if and when applicable - to be sold in the EU market. Tips: Conduct a resource assessment and implement a resource management system. If you are an exporter of wild -collected botanicals or their derivatives, take into account the provisions of CITES in order to guarantee the EU entry of your products. Check Annex A and B of Regulation (EC) No 338/97 to ascert ain whether import and export permits are required for your product. You can also contact the local CITES authority . Read more about CITES in the EU Export Helpdesk. Put a proced ure in place to check whether ABS applies. Contact the competent authorities in your country as a starting point. UEBT and FairWild provide thorough information on the practical implications of ABS, as established by the Convention on Biological Diversity . Tips: Familiarise yourself with the REACH regulation ; annexes IV and V list details of exemptions from registration. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) offers guidance on exe mptions . Check the REACH registration status of your essential oil. If your product is not registered , it may need to be (subject to exemption status). REACH registration is an expensive procedure and must be initiated by European manufacturers, EU importers or by an Only Representative of a non -EU manufacturer. Tips: Use the database on classification and labelling on the ECHA website to determine which symbols and warning phrases apply to your product. Refer to the EU Export Helpdesk for more information on REACH and CLP . Get acquainted with the United Nations ' Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Tips: Refer to the WHO herbal monographs (Volume 1 -4) for more information on product identity, safety and efficacy of your essential oils. Provide Material Safety Data Sheet s (MSDS) for handling of the essential o ils as natural ingredients, together with your product specification. Read more about marketing authorisation for pharmaceutical products in the EU Export Helpdesk. Read more about the simplified procedure for homeopathic and herbal produ cts on the website of the European Commission . Consult the EU Export Helpdesk and the CBI Module Buyer requirements: natural ingredients for health products for a full list of requirements for natural ingredients in health products. CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 7 GACP and GMP for essential oils: If your essential oils are marketed as , or used in , medicinal products for hu man use, you need to follow Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). These are established specifically for the industry to ensure your product meets all identity, quality, efficacy and safety requirement s. You can support the implementation of these Good Practices by developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and work instructions (WIN). SOPs should be developed for your specific processes and products, but some institutions are developing SOPs, such as Europam, the Eur opean Herb Growers Association. What additional requ irements do buyers often have? Buyer specifications and requirements: Many buyers have additional quality requirements which can go beyond legislation and standards of an individual product secto r, as they sell essential oils in more than one sector (food, cosmetics and health). These include requirements on active ingredient conten t, contaminants, residues, etc., and are established in buyer specifications. To show that you meet buyers' specifications, they also require well -structured company and product information, including detailed technical data sheets. What are the standar ds and requirements for niche markets? Social and environmental sustainability : If you want to market organic essential oils in the EU, you need to comply with EU requirements on the production and labelling of organic products of agricultural origin. Her bal medicinal products cannot be labelled as organic and fair trade. However, for essential oils used in aromatherapy, organic certification is more common (see Value -addition opportunities below). Verifying and certifying sustainable production represents a niche market, but can add value to your product. For more information on such value addition, please refer to value -addition opportunities in the section Competition . Better -known sustainability standards include: The UNCTAD BioTrade Initiative BioTrade Principles and Criteria or FairWild Principles and Criteria Social: Fa ir Trade certification, such as FLO Fairtrade or FairForLife . Some EU buyers may expect you to comply with their supplier codes of conduct regarding social responsibility , which are often based on ILO labour standards or on Global Compact reporting. Tip: Which guidelines you need to comply with depends on your product: o Raw plant materials: Guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice for Starting Materials of Herbal Origin (GACP). GMP starting material needs to comply with Part II - Basic Requirements for Active Substances used as Starting Materials . o Essential oils and other extracts: GACP or GMP requirements depend on stage of product and intended use. Comply with requirements on page 3 of the EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use, Annex 7: Manufacture of Herbal Medicinal Products . o Develop company specific SOPs and WINs to implement the GACP (and GMP if and when applicable - see above) . Tips: Make sure you meet international product standards and buyer specifications. Include plant identification through a national and/or a company herbarium in your product specifications ; this is important as a reference. Prevent (un -)intended adulteration and contamination by other foreign materials by keeping facilities and equipment clean, and by ensuring full documentat ion and traceability. Establish cost based pricing of essential oils to avoid the need for intentional adulteration. Meet buyer requirements in terms of processing methods for your essential oils. Validate and document distillation and extraction condition s: temperature, pressure/vacuum, etc. Make sure your documentation and labelling comply with the respective legislation and buyer requirements. Information on possible dangerous characteristics of chemical substances must be provided on Material Safety Dat a Sheets (MSDS). Furthermore, it is likely that your buyer req uires test reports. Implement and document Standard Operating Procedures, which provide a lot of trust on the part of buyers that you will keep up with quality standards. CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 8 Quality management: European buyers expect a good and reliable level of quality. Most buyers expect suppliers to at least follow the Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles. Moreover, compliance with quality safety management as specified in ISO 9001:2008 is required for health ingredients. Product standards for essential oils under ISO are also referred to in the product specifications of buyers, so as to assure the quality. Other examples include ISO 31.000 (risk management). What competition do I face on the European market for aromatherapy? As a medical form to treat or prevent health conditions, many alternatives to aromatherapy exist on the European market. These stem from b oth synthetic (e.g. conventional medicine and synthetic food supplements) and natural sources (traditional herbal medicinal products, homeopathy or natural food supplements). Moreover, the popularity of (medical or holistic) aromatherapy in treating or pr eventing illnesses varies depending on the indication area. I n indication areas where aromatherapy has a weak position, competition from other health products will be particularly strong. Aromatherapy is especially strong in infections, such as cough & col d (respiratory system), as well as for stress & anxiety, pain relief and muscle/joint issues . Competition with other health products The competitive position of aromatherapy depends on the type of aromatherapy and its status in a particular country. Use of medical aromatherapy competes with both herbal medicinal products and food supplements. Thi s form of aromatherapy requires the use of licensed practitioners (pharmacy, aromatherapist, depending on the national legislation), and is most commonly practi sed in France and Germany. Here, medical aromatherapy has an advantage over food supplements, wh ich cannot make a medical claim. In most other European countries, the position of medical aromatherapy is less strong , as these countries do not have a tradition of using aromatherapy medically. Alternatively, the use of holistic aromatherapy competes with food supplements but especially with various cosmetics products, and even home fragrances, air fresheners and 'aromatherapy' candles (which have distinctive legal requirements) . The use of this type of aromatherapy is often aimed at general wellbeing, which can be achieved with such other products as well. What is more, with the growing popularity of aromatherapy, consumers are confronted with many products that claim feel -good sensations because of their scent, so knowledge o f the actual the rapeutic benefits of essential oils is less common in Europe. Tips: Discuss with (potential) buyers whether they would be interested in certified sustainable natural ingredients of the above standards. If you choose to obtain a certificate for organic production, find out more about Organic production and labelling . Also for organic production, dedicate the processing plant to the exclusive production of organic ingredients. If this is not possible, ensure thorough cleansing of machin ery and equipment at all times. Consult the Standards Map database for different sustainability and organic standards. For more information on responsible business practices, refer to the UN Global Compact and ISO 26000 as guidance, and use the SEDEX online database, where members can share information on ethical and responsible practices. You can als o use SEDEX to prepare for possible audits/questions from your buyers. Tip: Consider carefully whether to comply with the above standards and certifications. Verify whether your buyer truly demands compliance, whether compliance will facilitate market access or offer you a better price or whether compliance will benefit your company's supply security or internal pr ocesses. Tip: For synthetic and natural alternatives to aromatherapy oils in each indication area, please refer to the CBI Product Factsheets on Stress & Anxiety , Energy , Cognition Health , Obesity and Vascular System . CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 9 Company competition Changing one essential oil for another is not common in aromatherapy. The chemical composition of oils differs and their application in aromatherapy is based on that composition. Consumers might change to another oil which also targets a specific indication. It may be difficult to enter the markets of certain essential oils used in aromatherapy. Examples include lavender, citrus and mint oils. These are traded in large volumes and constitute established and competitive markets, also with substantial production in European countries. Moreover, confusion and challenges on their product identity are a common feature in the market. Value -adding opportunities when competing in the ma rket You can create your own distinct market profile and more attractive products by adding value. You can add value with further processing (e.g. from raw material to extra ct to final product): Processing raw materials into essential oils is guided by the existence of standards, and buyer demands are well understood. However, opportunities to add value to essential oils as ingredient s are often not fully exploited. Proper documentation of your product and proc ess can get you a better price. Marketing finished products is generally beyond the scope of most companies in developing countries. Marketing of aromatherapy products may be an exception, especially if related to a particular tradition of use . South -South trade for expanding regional aromatherapy markets also offers good opportunities for this type of final product, as it is relatively simple and well established. You can also add value by certifying your company according to social and environmental sustainability principles. For aromatherapy oils, organic certification offers a good market potential. Although it still rep resents a niche market share, it is more important in aromatherapy than in other health products. Since consumers and manufacturers of aromatherapy are particularly concerned with the purity of essential oils, organic certification can be used as a guarant ee of the oil's quality. However, the potential of organic certification depends on your prospective buyer. In general, producers with a company image focused on sustainability (ethical/environmental) place more value on certification of their ingredients . Tips: Focus production on essential oils traded in small volumes that have clearly defined properties. Elaborate on these properties and their potential benefits in aromatherapy when commun icating with (prospective) buyers. Please refer to CBI Competition and CBI Top 10 Tips for doing business for more information. Tips: Consider whether your ingredient i s already used in this segment. Check the product identity of your essential oil before relating it to WHO or European Pharmacopoeia herbal monographs , as well as reputable literature for the use and application of your essential oil . Online resources to assist with this include herbal medicinal product manufacturers' w ebsites, EMA monographs , Pharmacopoeia and websites such Medicines Agency , MedlinePlus or Herbmed . Tips: Help manufacturers build their story, e.g. by documenting and visualising your product and your company's unique value propo sition. For use in holistic aromatherapy, images linked to traditional uses and wellbeing can contribute considerably towards your own marketing effort. Final manufacturers can use this information to mar ket the end -product in Europe. Align quality improve ments to your product with buyer requirements (specifications) and their willingness to pay for them. Quality improvements can be costly, and you need to ensure that the potential exists for getting an adequate return on investment. Determine your option t o market finished aromatherapy products. CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 10 What do the trade channels and interesting market segments look like in Europe for aromatherapy? Market segments Genuine and authentic essential oils are commonly sold as natural in gredients or as final consumer products. Some expensive essential oils, such as sandalwood or rose, are also sold in diluted form. These are more commonly used in holistic aromatherapy than in medical aromatherapy. Moreover, essential oils are also used in cosmetics (fragrance, aromatherapy) and food (flavours). These categories form the largest market for essential oils in Europe. Innovation and product development are limited in aromatherapy, as it is very uncommon for new oils to be included. Around 80 essential oils are commonly used in aromatherapy, according to industry experts. In cases where new oils are introduced to aromatherapy, such as Jatamansi from Nepal ( Nardostachys jatamansi ), it takes a long time for the oil to be used due to claim substa ntiation and marketing needs . Market channels Essential oils for use in aromatherapy are exported as genuine and authentic oils and often do not require further refinement or standardisation. They can be sold directly to manufacturers more easily than oth er ingredients, due to the small volumes required. Moreover, they can potentially be marketed as final products (see Competition ). However, it remains common for most SME exporters to export to traders via agents or brokers. Established importers/ distributors are likely to already have registered their imports in accordance with the REACH regulation (where applicable). Tips: Before committing to a certification scheme, always verify your buyer 's interest in certified ingredients: o Organic certification also acts as a quality control system and can help to improve your quality image. o Fair Trade and FairWild certification can help indicate to your buyer that the production of ingredients is generating rural income and does not harm local communities (this could jeopardise the buyer's image). Certification demonstrating sustainable sourcing (e.g. FairWild) can help show potential buyers that you could be a reliable future partner. Tips: For tips on finding buyers, have a look at the CBI Module Finding Buyers. Use your knowledge o f product development activity and potential for marketing your product more s pecifically to the right buyer. Please refer to CBI NIHP Mar ket Channels and Segments , where the various players at the various levels of the value chain are discussed in more depth. This module also gives an overview of the key market characteristics and trends for the herbal medicinal products and food supplement s segments . CBI | Market Intelligence Product Factsheet Aromatherapy in Europe | 11 Useful sources Visiting and, above all, participating in trade fairs is highly recommended as one of the most efficient methods of testing market receptiveness, obtaining market information and finding prospective business partners.
