Audio Bible Context ...18\"Are you still so dull?\" He asked. \"Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him, 19 Cross References \"Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated? \"Are you still so dull?\" He asked. \"Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him, But give as alms the things that are within you, and you will see that everything is clean for you. The voice spoke to him a second time: \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" But the voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.' Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on his opinions. Therefore let no one judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a feast, a New Moon, or a Sabbath. Treasury of Scripture Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats? Jump to Previous [It entereth not into his heart.--The words are not in St. Matthew, and emphasise the contrast with what follows. The \"heart\" is, after the common Hebrew idiom, the symbol of the mind as well as stands for the Hebrew of \"heart.\") Purging all meats.--This also is peculiar to St. Mark, and presents some difficulties. In the commonly received text, the participle is in the neuter nominative, agreeing with the nominative to the verb \"goeth out.\" But in this construction it is difficult to see in what sense that which goeth into the mouth--itself an article of food, with no special character--can be said to purge or cleanse all other forms of food. The better MSS., however, give the participle in the masculine. This has been explained by many as a grammatical anomaly, and the participle being treated as if it agreed (though in a different case) with the word \"draught\" or \"cesspool,\" the latter is said to cleanse all meats, as removing the excreta, or impure parts, from them, and leaving only that which nourishes the body. A far better construction, both as to grammar and meaning, is found by making the word \"purging,\" or better, cleansing, agree with the subject of the so saying, cleanseth all meats.\" So taken, the words anticipate, in almost the same terms, the truth of [Acts 10:15](/acts/10-15.htm), \"What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\" The construction is tenable grammatically, has the support of high authority both ancient and modern, and obviously gives a much better sense. It is a possible conjecture that the words \"cleansing all meats\" may have been, at first, a marginal note (like the addition in [Mark 7:16](/mark/7-16.htm)), attached to \"He saith,\" and have afterwards found their way into the . does not enter (eisporeuetai) Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular [Strong's 1531:](/greek/strongs_1531.htm)To journey in(to), I go in(to), enter, intervene.
