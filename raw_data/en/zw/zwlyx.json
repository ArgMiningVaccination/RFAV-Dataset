Subsequently, BHCS received approval of four additional component plans: Prevention & Early Inte rvention (PEI), Capital Facilities and Technology (CFT) and Innovative Program s (INN), which account for the full MHSA funding received by Alameda County. I. F ULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP (FSP) PROGRAMS IN PROCUREMENT II. W ELLNESS CENTERS FUNDED UNDER PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) III. I NNOVATIVE PROGRAMS FOR WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING , HEALTH & TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED ASIAN-PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATIONS . I. F ULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS IN PROCUREMENT a. Full-Service Partnerships The Full-service Partnerships (FSP) were t he first set of MHSA-funded programs to be implemented upon approval of our Community Se rvices & Supports plan in 2006. This upcoming procurement effort will ensure that the mo st qualified and ex perienced providers continue to utilize the most effective treatment practices for the populations with the highest- need in Alameda County. Several programs hav e been revised and re-categorized here in order to be included in this procurement: Individual Placement Serv ices (IPS) was added as a programmatic requirement for Telecare CHANGES, STRIDES and STAGES. Increased clinical services and supports hav e been added to the Early Intervention for the Onset of First Psychosis & SMI among TAY program. On February 23, 2017 BHCS released of Request for Interest (RFI) #17-03 to identify qualified Bidders interested in partici pating in the Request for Proposal (RFP) for Full Service Partnership (FSP) services. The RFI articulates BHCS' plan to enter into a contract for FSP services for one program per Contra ctor with the following allocation: Population No. of Teams per Program No. of Programs Total Allocation Child/Youth 2 1 $2,235,000.00 TAY 3 1 $3,489,110.00 FEP 1 1 $1,163,037.00 Adult 2 2 $4,652,146.00 Forensic 2 2 $4,652,146.00 Older Adult 2 1 $2,326,073.00 Chronically Homeless 2 2 $4,652,146.00 TOTAL 10 $23,169,658.00 ii Note: Most programs will run tw o FSP teams with no more than 50 clients served per team at any given time except for the Child/Youth, TAY and FEP FSP. It is anticipated that the Request-For-Proposals (RFP) will be released in early FY17-18 with a start date before th e end of the fiscal year. II. W ELLNESS CENTERS FUNDED UNDER PREVENTION & EARLY INTERVENTION (PEI) New PEI data and outcome requirements instituted th is year include the i dentification of clients who are SMI or SED and referral to appropriate se rvices, tracking of timely access to those services and demographic information of clients serv ed. This provides BHCS an opportunity to monitor and access the effectiveness of wellne ss and recovery programs in both providing clients less intensive supportive care and r eady access to higher levels of care when appropriate. In order to institute these additional data requi rements, funding for the Wellness Centers is shifted from Community Services & Supports to PEI. III. I NNOVATIVE PROGRAMS FOR WORKFORCE EDUCATION & TRAINING , MENTAL HEALTH & TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED ASIAN-PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATIONS . Before the end of the fiscal year, Request-Fo r-Proposals will be announced for small, time- limited, innovative approaches to address the following areas: Educational and training opport unities for underrepresented and disadvantaged high school and undergraduate students to gain experience in the public Mental/Behavioral Health areas; Direct and supportive services utilizing web- based and mobile applications that increase access and improve mental health outcomes for consumers and family members; and Culturally-responsive services and organizationa l capacity-building to address the needs of diverse, underserved API consumers and family members. Involvement of Community Stakeholders: The participation of community members in the planning process is formalized in the MHSA Stakeholder Gr oup, comprised of and r epresenting consumers, family members and providers. The Stakehol der Group reviews the effectiveness of MHSA strategies, recommends current and future funding priorities, cons ults with BHCS and the community on promising approaches that have potential for transforming the m ental health systems of care and communicates with BHCS and relevant mental health constituencies. The participating members of the Stakeholder Group during t he planning period are listed in the table below including consumers, family member s and providers with key executive leadership: iii MHSA STAKEHOLDER GROUP *No longer on this group due to retire ment, different role or other transition The initial draft of t he Plan Update was developed by BHCS Exec utive Leadership, planning staff and fiscal staff in consultation with the Stakeholder Gr oup.

COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES Full Service Partnership (FSP) Programs: The following measures are being adopted by all Full Service Partnership programs and wil l be included in future contract language starting in Fiscal Year 17/18: Outcome Measures: 1. At least 85 percent of client s (50% for TAY) shall have a prim ary care within 12 months of enrollment, after being enrolled for at least 12 months. 2. 80 percent of clients shall be in long-term, stable housing within 24 months of enrollment. A. Among FSP partners enrolled for at least six months, more than 80% of them at any point in time will be in a known and non-instit utional living arrangement (General Living Arrangement or Supervised Placement). B. Among FSP partners enrolled for at least six months, at least 60% of partners will have a current living arrangement that is more independent and less restrictive than their living arrangement at the time of admission into the FSP program (Measure based on the FSP housing hierarchy established by the BHCS Housing Services Office and attached). 3.

Homeless Outreach & Stabilization Team (HOST) Program Description: Multi-disciplinary team engages homele ss adults and links them to a range of services with a focus on community services, peer support and the means to obtain and maintain housing. FY 15/16 Progress Report: See ATTACHMENTS: \"Bonita House, HOST Adult Full-Service Partnership Program Outcom es, June 2007-December 2015\". The notable challenge t he program is experiencing is th at our housing budget had not been increased and we no longer have enough housing mo ney to house all 90-95 HOST Partners. FY 16/17+ Update and Plans: Establishment of a Partner Advisory Committee (PAC). The PAC is a group of HOST partner s that meet monthly and advise the program about issues and concerns that they would like addressed. This is an exci ting new development that gives the HOST partners a powerful voice in the continuing developm ent and evolution of the HOST program. For 16/17, HOST currently only ha s enough housing money to meet the needs of 61 partners. As of October 1, 2016, our Shelter Plus Care contract has increased and we will now have the ability to house 70 partners. However, that falls far short of the 93 partners currently enrolled in the program. This housing budget problem will be a si gnificant factor for the rest of this year and next fiscal year. In addition to these concerns, the revenue targets fo r the HOST program have been unrealistic since the program started. HOST has doubled the Medi-Cal revenue es timated in the original RFP, but unfortunately, MAA revenue does not bring in very much money at all. With our outreach capacity now eliminated because we are accepting referrals e xclusively from the Home Stretch list, we do not bill hardly any MAA. FSP 2. North County Se nior Homeless Program Program Description: Multidisciplinary team engages home less seniors and provides housing with community supports. Provides linkage for family members and offers peer support. For previous FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Number of clients served: 46 Number of new enrollments: 8 Number of discharges to lower level of care: 10 Number of clients who avoided psychiatric hospita lizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 75%, 6 of 8 clients - 6 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 12 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients Number of clients who avoided medical hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 6 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgA.

Of participants open at year end 26 (65%) have obtained permanent housing with 18 (45%) no longer using Housing Financial Assistance. Due to ever decreasing affordable housing options in Alameda County, we have seen older adults make greater use of unlicensed board and care units. Our response has been increased outreach to private landlords who are willi ng to work with the HFA subsidy in order to create additional permanent housing opportuni ties for participants. During FY 15-16, NCSHP served 46 older adults. For current FY Number of clients served: 41 Number of new enrollments: 3 Number of discharges to lower level of care: 1 Number of clients who avoided psychiatric hospita lizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 3 of 3 clients - 6 months: 100%, 3 of 3 clients Number of clients who avoided medical hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 3 of 3 clients - 6 months: 100%, 3 of 3 clients Number of clients who retained housing of thei r choice during the follo wing initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 66%, 2 of 3 clients - 6 months: 66%, 2 of 3 clients Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 7 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgA.

The expansion of medical and psychiatric services has been successful with 26 ( 65%) of 40 participants currently seeing the in- house psychiatrist regularly. Additionally, NCSHP has begun a medically focused weekly group to address medical trends seen in parti cipants (diabetes, HPB, etc.). NCSHP continues to use the ACT model to ensure a high level of care to participants and to prevent staff burnout. For upcoming FY 17-18: The NCSHP team will serve a total of 40 partners at any given time in the coming fiscal year. No significant changes planned. FSP 3. Supportive Housing for Transition Age Youth (STAY) Program Description: Provides permanent supportive housing for youth who are homeless, are aged out of foster care, leaving the ju stice system or re sidential treatment. For previous FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Community Impact: During the 15-16 fiscal year, the ST AY Program served a total of 56 unduplicated individuals who were homeless or at risk for homelessness. The program discharged 15 participants during the period, 11 (73%) of which were planned di scharges. Of the 15, 5 (33.3%) exited the program with permanent housing, and 9 (60%) exited to a lower level of care. The STAY Program continued to experience success in engaging participants in employment services using the IPS model for services. Du ring the period, 26 indivi duals participated in IPS services. Of the 26, 15 (58%) were employed for at least some time, with 3 holding down a job for the entire fiscal year. The program received a positive score on the IPS fidelity review conducted in late 2015. The program continued to offer skill building groups for participants focused on ADL's and social skills. During the period, STAY collaborated with a county consumer peer support program (PEERS) to offer an onsite 6-week Wellness and Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) group to support participants to be active agents in the recovery and self-care. The PEERS program has agreed to return to offer subsequent WRAP group series onsite every 6 months. Challenges: The STAY Program experienced increasing difficulty achieving our goals for independently housing participants during the period due to the sh ortage of affordabl e housing in the area. In addition, this past spri ng, a fire at an apartment buildin g housing several STAY participants delayed new placements by diverting time and res ources into shelter and locating new units for the displaced residents. A total of 22 of the 56 ( participants served were placed and maintained in Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 8 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgA. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES permanent or long-term transitional placements in the community. Gi ven the limited availability of affordable permanent housing for STAY partici pants aging out of services, Alameda County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services is in the process of planning a transfer of existing housing subsidy vouchers tied to the ST AY Program into permanent subsid ies offered through the Housing Authority. This will en able our currently housed ST AY participants to maintain their subsidies when they age out of the program . In the future, participants aging out of services will need to apply for placement on a centralized waitlist for subsided units in the county. The STAY program has been assisting participants in increasing their chances of securing permanent housing by providing advance notice of subsidized housing applic ation opportunities and assistance completing required do cuments. The program has hel d three housing workshops for participants during the period timed to aid participant s in meeting the deadlines for multiple housing opportunities. For current FY 16-17 Progress Report: Serving 50-55 TAY. During the first part of FY 16/17, the program has reported improved housing outcomes with 38 (46%) independently housed in permanent or long-term transitional housing, compared with 22-26% from May to August of 2016. Th is improvement was, in part, due to the opening of a new permanent subsidized housing option wh ich prioritized the program's tar get population. Currently, 5 STAY participants inhabit permanent shared apartments in this complex. For upcoming FY 17-18+ Plans: Plan to serve 50-55 TAY. FSP 5. Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) Program Description: FACT is a full service partnership (F SP) program offered by the East Bay Community Recovery Project. The program is contra cted with Behavioral Healthcare Services to provide services to and maintain an active case load of 79 adult participants (age 18-59). FACT has been providing housing and intensive wraparound supportive services to individuals identified by the county as persons who continue to cycle in and out of psychiatric emergency and inpatient services and Santa Rita jail. The progr am provides an ACT level of serv ices to the individuals, partners, enrolled in the program to encou rage and support their wellness and recovery efforts with the goal of improving their ability to function independently in the community and significantly reducing or eliminating the need for psychia tric emergency or inpatient services and the number of incarcerations in the county jail. See ATTACHMENTS: \"East Bay Community Recovery Project, Forensic Assertive Community Treatment, Bi-Annual Monitori ng Report, Jan 1- June 30, 2016\" For previous FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Number of Partner served: Number of new enrollments: 16 Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 9 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgA. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES Number of transitions: 6 Community Impact: REDUCTION in RECIDIVISM Psychiatric Emergency and inpatient units and Jail. Th e program continues to reduce recidivism for its partners as has been the case every year since the programs start in A ugust of 2007. The largest reduction in recidivism is in the number of days spent in jail and the hospital, both saw a reduction of 60%. ENROLLMENT, TRANSITION AND GRADUATION This year we experienced the highest number of enro llments (16) in a single year since bringing the program to capacity in June 2009. This year we had 4 partners who transitioned to a lower level of care. These individuals graduated from the program when they completed the phases of the program, when their applications for the S+C housing subsidy were approved, and when the housing specialists were able to support the partners in se curing a housing unit they could afford and a unit that met their needs for independent living. PROGRAM CAPACITY The FACT program was awarded an increase of funding in December 2015 to expand capacity for the number of partners to be served ( 70-79). This is not a large increase in capacity, however, it is a step in the right direction that has allowed us to increase services to our partner population. We added 1 full time personal service coordinator/ther apist, and increased hours for nursing, psychiatry, and employment. PRIMARY CARE We continue to triage new partners into community based primary care services such as Lifelong Medical Care. We were able to connect 88 % of t he newly enrolled partners with primary care within 12 months of enrollment. The rema ining partners were discharged in a few months' post enrollment or have yet to complete 12 months in the program. We are still moving forwar d with plans for offering primary medical care from our 27 30 Adeline office and are patiently waiting for the MOU to be drawn up and for the medical provider to hire a medi cal practitioner along with a medical assistant. HOUSING The difficulty in housing partners was challenged further this past y ear by the continued highly competitive housing market both in locating unit s and affordability. HCD and the Shelter + Care program worked very closely with the program to review each application on a case by case basis allowing all the subsidy requests to ex ceed the set fair market rate by price units in the same area to determine rent reasonableness. We were able to bring on a few new landlords and several new properties in the latter part of FY 15/16. We were able to house everyone who had been on our waiting list for an extended period of time. The new units were located in prime areas of alameda county and the tenants were extremely excited and gr ateful for the spacious apartments and the calm and serene neighborhoods. EMPLOYMENT This past fiscal year brought changes to the employ ment program as we hi red 2 new employment specialist and with the assistance of the county vocational program we were able to move completely to the IPS model of supported employment. Educational se rvices were transferred to the responsibilities of the personal service coordinators saw the program. The new employees worked closely with the county IPS program supervisor to increase employ er contacts to increase the Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 10 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgA. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES eligible employment positions fo r partners to apply. The employment specialist shared a caseload of over 20 partners who were either working or applying for work POSITVE IMPACT The positive impact of the FACT program is demonstrated through t he aforementioned sections 1-6. Another important impact is t he number of partners\u201426 or 33%\u2014r emaining in the community in permanent subsidized housin g with no jail time since enrolling in the criminal justice behavioral health FACT program. This is up from 23 partners or 27%. These partners are mostly graduates who have already transferred to a lower level of care and may be involved in the community through employment, education, volunteerism and ongoing consumer sponsored so cial and educational trainings and events. The FACT program of the East Ba y Community Recovery Project has positively impacted the west Oakland neighborhood, families, and the community by continuing to instill hope for the individuals we serve and for the families impacted by the behavioral expressions of individuals who are under the influence of alcohol and drug abuse, experi encing mental health symptomatology, and participating in criminal activities. Our provider site in West Oakland has been providing easily accessible in-house or in your house individual-group- family illness education, crisis intervention and treatment services that are diverse, compassionat e, non- judgmental and confi dential. The goal is to facilitate individual recovery and wellness and to create an opportunity for healing families and communities. The programs efforts in reducing reci divism in the utilization of psychiatric emergency, inpatient, and jail services has been a cost saving outcome of t he program allowing the c ounty the possibility of shifting funds away from the jails and hospitals and into community based services that provide illness education and strategies for pr evention that aim to keep individ uals from ever having to utilize these systems. Program Challenges and Strategies: 1a. Challenge - Partner Substance Abuse The primary challenge to the FACT program meeting its outcomes c ontinues to be the pervasive and chronic substance use/addiction that plagues a majo rity, 91% (70 of 77), of the overall program partners. Partners' substance use/ addictions compromise their ability to adhere to basic program instruction or guidelines whether it is taking medication as pr escribed or following through with orders from the court. S ubstance use diminishes a partners func tioning capacity which in most cases keeps them from being able to utilize and benefit from the many resources and opportunities available to them from this MHSA funded programs. The programs' success rate of graduating partners would be exponentially higher if there were substantially more co-occurring mental health s ubstance abuse residential programs, step-down community based recovery support and self-help pr ograms that complement the therapeutic and rehabilitative services of FACT. The outcome of su ch a system of care would provide longer term comprehensive services and or support individuals with their efforts to maintain their personal program for recovery, increase their sober communi ty network and to create a sober history. These challenges, experienced by partner s along with the absence of a comprehensive mental health and co-occurring substance use treatment and services cont inuum of care in this county, significantly decreases the program's capacity for effectiv ely supporting partners in achieving program milestones and successfully achieving their wellness and recovery treatment goals.

Strategy Fortunately, there have always been a percentage of partners who have been able to achieve and maintain their sobriety, achieve and maintain competitive employment, complete the program and live independently in the community. We looked at t he elements of these individual's success and began to look at what we could do to increase partner success. Over the past 1 \u00bd years our strategy consisted of a restructuring the pr ogram staffing roles and responsibilities and patterns\u2014updating the requir ed skills and experience of incoming employees\u2014 and redesigning the program curricul um to increase our ability to address and work with partners co- occurring mental health and substance use conditions and a partner's risk for violence and criminal behaviors. This has led to an increase and diverse pr esentation of individual and group services. We are now offering cognitive behavioral groups that focus on understanding par tner substance use, criminal behaviors and creating pl ans for \"change\" with an increase in individual therapy services to support the co-occurring needs of our partners. We have implemented a policy of not providing support services if a partner comes into the office intoxicated or if a partner is intoxicated when we go to pick them up from their ho mes. Psychiatric, medical tri age, and counseling services may be allowed on a case by case basis. We are determi ned to be consistent with our policy and support partners to the county detox program when intoxicated as a way of providing some extra motivation for sobriety. 2a. Challenge - Partner Substance Abuse and incr eased incidence of partner behavioral issues As a forensic behavioral health program, behavioral issues can be expected; however, these partner violent behaviors continue to occur with increased frequency and aggression, as compared to partner behaviors from previous years in the programs. This increases the need for caution in providing services and the skills required for \"crisis prevention, intervention and management\" services. The team members along with the pr ogram leadership have developed new safety protocols and strategies for implementation. This y ear we have had 2 violent partner outbursts that have traumatized some of the staff and has put t he question of our safety front and center. Substance use disorders play a significant role in the likely increased incidence of partners \"acting out\" behaviors, specifically, their use of derogatory statements (verbal abuse) and use of intimidation and threats of violence with team members is unfortunate, unacceptable and difficult to predict and prevent. Partner intoxication has played a part in mo st of the incidents experie nced by the team in the past, however, this past year saw an unregulated upset sober partner perpetrate violence in our front lobby. The need for safety on the job ( both in the office and the community) has been compromised and requires increased vigilance by team members when working with partners, especially when responding to part ner crises. Fortunately, the actual incidence of these partner behavioral issues occurring, although increasing in frequency, are still an exception to the norm. The program serves as representat ive payee for many of the partner s that are in need of support to budget and manage their money so t hat the bills get paid and the partner has access to funds throughout the full month. This bec omes a problem when partners under the influence come into the office, without prior notice given, demanding access to their money (that they have already spent or are not scheduled to receive). Partners can, on occa sion, get verbally and physically (less frequent) escalated and aggressive to the point where their interactions with team members become volatile, unpredictable and on a few occasi ons unmanageable. The team has been able to prevent or successfully manage partners and their escalati ng behaviors through effective non-violent communication and teamwork.

Strategies The program leadership has integrated risk assessment tool, \"Risk and Responsivity\" into our mental health screening and assessment to begin addre ssing partner behavioral issues through the screening and intake process. In addi tion, this fall will see the intr oduction and administration of the ANSA Needs Assessment. This will support team members in collecting an in-depth history for newly enrolled individuals as to increase our k nowledge of these individ uals while also supporting the development of a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan. This past year we were able to confirm with the adul t system of care director that the program has the authority to refuse a referral of an individual with a history of violence that may compromise our ability to minimize risk in our da ily work. We are also able to refe r program partners, when certain criteria are met, to another organiza tion when we are no longer able to serve an individual due to continued aggressive behaviors that are likely to compromise the safety of staff, partners and visitors to our 2730 Adeline office. The agency is committed to taking steps to ensure the safety of staff by securing the office building and parking lot. We have hired a se curity company to monitor the o ffice and the parking lot for the 2 days of the week (Tuesday and Thursday) when the partners are scheduled to come into the office to pick up checks/money from their sub-payee acc ounts. Having a security officer has helped to instill a sense of safety back into the workplace. Program Curriculum implementation strategies It is our belief that the implement ation of the above strategies along with the implementation of the following program curriculum suggestions and T he TrACT program leadersh ip have been reaching out and soliciting support from ot her programs in and outside of the county and state with the goal of not having to reinvent the wheel in the form of information and ideas on addressing and overcoming the issues/challenges as stated in the previous section. The follo wing is a brief summary of our strategies for a multi-pronged appr oach or course of actions to address and hopefully mitigate the challenges experienced by the program. Comprehensive and measurable needs and strengths assessment The program will be implementing the use of the ANSA (Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment) to increase the quality and depth of the partner assessment to incl ude a thorough collection of risk information both historical and current and criminal information process treatment history information collected to include risk history and current assessment, criminal history and assessment of current needs. Treatment Services The program has have completed a thorough criminal justice m ental health community based treatment literature and program review to procure ideas and examples of best practices and programs with the goal of adopting innovative and evidenced based treatment service and We have researched and reviewed many theor etical approaches to working with our particular population and will be implementing new or updated evidence based strategies and practices, that were alluded to in section 2b, which will increase the quantity, quality and effectiveness of clinical and recovery services provided to the partners in the group and individual therapy and rehabilitation modalities. These strategies and practices are rooted in the traditional mental heal th practice model of cognitive behavioral therapies however, are being presented by the different organizations in a modern form.

Transition to Independence (TIP) Program Description: Provides intensive mental health se rvices to transition-age youth who are experiencing severe mental illness, aged out of foster care, leaving the justice system, or residential treatment. For previous FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: For this fiscal year, TIP served a total of 38 clients, according to the Clinician's Ga teway reports and key event tracking forms. Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) Episodes: 12 Months prior to enrollment: 49 First 12 months of enrollment:21 Decrease in episodes: 28 (57%) Psychiatric Hospital Days: 12 Months prior to enrollment:92 First 12 months of enrollment: 75 Decrease in hospital days: 17 (18%) Hospital Episodes: 12 Months prior to enrollment: 16 First 12 months of enrollment: 14 Decrease in hospital episodes: 2 (13%).

COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES Residential Treatment: 8% Employment: remained the same from last year: 6 clients employ ed (competitive and supported). Education: 1 client graduated from 4 year college. 8 clients enr olled in community college. Primary Physician: 82% had a primary physi cian compared to 83.3% last year. Residential Setting: 28 clients (73%) have been successfully maintained with family. 5 homeless (staff are working to assist with housing). 4 living independently in his or her own apartment. 1 incarcerated. During this reporting period, it is worth noting that 1 of our clients graduated from Mills College and entered into graduate school studying psychology. An other client was able to successfully step down, has permanent housing, is living independently, and successfully manages own finances. Another Client has graduated from high school and has entered into community college and a training program for computer science. Any challenges or barriers with each of the programs and strategies to mitigate those challenges or barriers: While the program was able to reduce psychiatric hos pital admissions for most of our clients, TIP was challenged with the high needs of 4 clients who continued to require more intensive and structured interventions as in hospital or resi dential settings. As a result, our data showed an increase in number of psychiatric hospital days during FY 15-16. Addi tionally, one of the challenges for these clients was the limited access to resi dential drug treatment program that serves monolingual clients. Due to lack of treatment, clients' behaviors while they were under the influence occurred with increased frequency and aggression and at times compromised their ability to adhere to their mental health treatment goals. Another challenge to the program and clients was the lack of af fordable housing and employment opportunities in the Bay Area. In general, most of our clients were re luctant to pursue or to maintain permanent employment for fear of losi ng their SSI and Medi-C al benefits. One of our strategies to mi tigate these problems was by encouraging and supporting clients to complete their educations (with the hope that they can qualify for higher pay ing jobs). Another strategy was to ensure that all clients apply fo r Section 8 (when there is an opening throughout the region) and or MHSA funded housing programs. Staff also actively use 211 and Housing Choices website to assist our clients in findi ng affordable or subsidized housing options. For current FY 16-17 Progress Report: TIP staff is currently at full capacity and this staffing should support excellent client care. TIP remains focus ed on maintaining full enrollment while transitioning clients to lower levels of care when this is appropriate . TIP is in the process of transitions 3 clients to lower levels of care. Simultaneously, we conti nue to provide supportive and assertive outreach to new referrals.

Behavioral Health Court (BHC) Transitional Assertive Community Treatment (TrACT) Team Program Description: TrACT is a full service partnership (FSP) program of the East Bay Community Recovery Project and is the dedicat ed service provider for the Alameda County Behavioral Health Court. TrACT is a program sub-cont racted with Behavioral Healthcare Services to provide services to and maintain an active caseload of 29 adult (age 18-59) participants. TrACT has been providing intensive wraparound mental health, co-occurring substance use and other health related services to participants of t he court program since August 2009. This court- supervised program is for adult individuals ar rested in Alameda County and are awaiting their court appearance either in custody or in the comm unity and have chosen to participate in the court program instead of having their cases proceed in t he regular court process. Eligibility for the program requires that the indivi dual or potential BHC participant have a mental health condition that is severe in degree and persistent in durati on. This condition has to have been a determining factor for the commission of their crime. A partners charge or qualifying charges, as related to their alleged crime, are either reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor or dismissed from their record with their successful completion of TrACT and the BHC program. See ATTACHMENTS: \"East Bay Community Recovery Project, Transitional Assertive Community Treatment, Annual Monitoring Report, July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016.\" For previous FY 15/16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Number of Partner served: 49 Number of new enrollments: Number of transitions: 11 Community Impact: REDUCTION in RECIDIVISM Psychiatric Emergency and inpatient units and Jail. Th e program continues to reduce recidivism for its partners as has been the case every year since the programs start in Augus t of 2009. The largest reduction in recidivism is in the number of days' par tners spent in jail which were 2238 days 12 months prior to enrollment reducing to 376 days 12 months' post enrollment into TrACT. This showed a positive reduction of 83%. Episodes of incarceration were 2nd with 81 episodes 12 months prior to enrollment and then 27 episodes 12 m onths post enrollment which is a reduction of 67%. ENROLLMENT, TRANSITION AND GRADUATION As in FACT this year TrACT experienced the highes t number of enrollments (33) for a single year. This year we had 8 partners who transitioned to a lower level of care. These individuals graduated from the program when they completed their commitment to the co urt and when their applications for the S+C housing subsidy were approved, when the housing specialists were able to support the Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 16 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgA. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES partners in securing a housing unit they could afford and a unit that met their needs for independent living. PROGRAM CAPACITY The TrACT program was awarded an increase of funding in Decem ber 2015 to expand capacity for the number of partners to be served ( 20-29). This is not a large increase in capacity, however, it is a step in the right direction that has allowed us to increase services to our partner population. We added 1 full time personal service coordinator/therapist and 1 full-time employment specialist, and increased hours for nursing, and psychiatry. PRIMARY CARE We continue to triage new partners into community based primary care services such as Lifelong Medical Care. We were able to connect 82 % of t he newly enrolled partners with primary care within 12 months of enrollment. The rema ining partners were discharged in a few months' post enrollment or have yet to complete 12 months in the program. We are still moving forwar d with plans for offering primary medical care from our 27 30 Adeline office and are patiently waiting for the MOU to be drawn up and for the medical provider to hire a medi cal practitioner along with a medical assistant. HOUSING The difficulty in housing partners was challenged further this past y ear by the continued highly competitive housing market both in locating unit s and affordability. HCD and the Shelter + Care program worked very closely with the program to review each applic ation on a case by case basis allowing all the subsidy requests to ex ceed the set fair market rate by price units in the same area to determine rent reasonableness. We were able to bring on a few new landlords and several new properties in the latter part of FY 15/16. We were able to house everyone who had been on our waiting list for an extended period of time. The new units were located in prime areas of alameda county and the tenants were extremely excited and gr ateful for the spacious apartments and the calm and serene neighborhoods. EMPLOYMENT This past fiscal year brought changes to the employ ment program as we hi red 2 new employment specialist and with the assistance of the county vocational program we were able to move completely to the IPS model of supported employment. Educational se rvices were transferred to the responsibilities of the personal service coordinators saw the program. The new employees worked closely with the county IPS program supervisor to increase employ er contacts to increase the eligible employment positions fo r partners to apply. The employment specialist shared a caseload of over 20 partners who were either working or applying for work TRACT PROGRAM IMPACT The TrACT programs primary positive community impact is the ability to reduce partner recidivism to psychiatric emergency, psychiatric inpatient and in carceration services. The program partners were able to significantly increase their time living in the community mostly free from the often paralyzing symptoms of their mental illness that in the past would require a partner to voluntarily or sometimes be 5150'd to be strongly encouraged to utilize p sychiatric emergency services, inpatient hospitalization or in the case of a crime committed arrested and in carcerated to stabilize psychiatrically and behaviorally. Now, the partner s are creating new histor ies for themselves and have become active members participating in and c ontributing to their communities of choice by living independently and participating in various forms of meaningful activities that contribute to their well-being and the wellbeing of the community at large.

Challenge - Partner Substance Abuse The primary challenge to the Tr ACT program meeting its outcomes continues to be the pervasive and chronic substance use/addiction that plagues a ma jority, 77 % (17 of 22), of the overall program partners. Partners' substance use/ addictions compromise their ability to adhere to basic program instruction or guidelines whether it is taking medication as prescribed or following through with orders from the court. S ubstance use diminishes a partners func tioning capacity which in most cases keeps them from being able to utilize and benefit from the many resources and opportunities available to them from this MHSA funded programs. The programs' success rate of graduating partners would be exponentially higher if there were substantially more co-occurring mental health s ubstance abuse residential programs, step-down community based recovery support and self-help pr ograms that complement the therapeutic and rehabilitative services of TrACT. The outcome of such a system of care would provide longer term comprehensive services and or support individuals with their efforts to maintain their personal program for recovery, increase their sober communi ty network and to create a sober history. These challenges, experienced by partner s along with the absence of a comprehensive mental health and co-occurring substance use treatment and services cont inuum of care in this county, significantly decreases the program's capacity for effectiv ely supporting partners in achieving program milestones and successfully achieving their wellness and recovery treatment goals. 1b.

The TrACT program received an in crease in funding (funding relating to the Alameda County version of Laura's Law) this current FY increasing the programs' capacity both in t he quality and quantity of services provided and the number of partners (29) w ho will be eligible for program services. This has enabled the program to increase the num ber of licensed or licensed eligib le direct service provider's, to increase the diversity of services provided (inc luding the increase in the program's capacity for the provision of 1 on 1 counseling). The programs incr eased capacity in the number of participants to be served has helped the program to take more referrals and enroll more partners in the program. This has helped to positively impact our relationships with our community provider's/referral sources that have been wanting to refer potential participants to the program.

Mobile Integrated A ssessment Team for Older Adults Program Description: Increase the access for homebound and/or isolated older adults who are experiencing difficulty accessing mental health services due to barriers associated with aging and mental health stigma. Work wit h First Responders and other community agencies to identify isolated older adults. FY 15/16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : During the fiscal year 2 015-16, the Mobile Mental Health Team provided 57 older adults, over the age of 60 years, with mental health services. The clients received individual/group therapy and medication support. The most common chief complaint on initial assessment was severe depressive disorder (87%); anxie ty disorder (90%); and PTSD (60%). Twenty-four perc ent of the clients were referred from the Afghan Elderly Association and these are older Afghan re fugees who have experienced life trauma. We al so receive about the same number of referrals from th e City of Fremont's Senior Helplin e, a local phone number that screens over 150 calls a month. T he Senior Helpline is a direct referral from the City's Emergency Responders, primarily the Fire Department but al so the Code Enforcement team. This is often how we serve isolated older adults who don't usually s eek services. All clients have complex medical conditions. The most common being Hypertensi on (55%) and Chronic Pain (22%) and are on an average of 8 medications. The Mobile Mental Health program added a Peer Coach service that is available to clients who have a goal in their Treatment Plan to address social isolati on. At the end of its firs t year of operation, the Peer Coach program was evaluated by San Jose St ate. The evaluation ut ilized the General Self Efficacy Scale and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. T he Mental Health Peer Coaching program had a significant impact on reducing loneliness and social is olation in recipients of the program services. There was also a significant positive impact on self -efficacy for both mental health coaches and their assigned peers. The City of Fremont established a contract with Beacon Services as a means to serve individuals who do not meet Specialty Mental Health criteria. FY 16/17 Progress: Many of our clients are referred by First Responders (Fire/Code Enforcement) and have not been connected to mental health services in the past. Clients are often referred to our program in crisis. They are overwhelmed with issues of aging and are experiencing serious symptoms of mental illness. Afte r intensive treatment with the M obile Mental Health Team, the clients are stable but remain uncertain of their ability to manage the increased demands of aging. They are moving towards a time in life of interdependence. This year we will begin the implementation of a 'Step Down' leve l of services so that we can remain connected to the clients and monitor their well-being. We continue to work closely with the Afghan Elder ly Association to support older Afghans with PTSD/Anxiety symptoms. This year we are incr easing the use of interns to develop a health promotion program that will incl ude mental health screening. Fully implement the Peer Coach program: We have trained 14 Peers, who are clients enrolled in our program, and they now all have a peer to support. Th is is a new program and this will be our first full year. We are assessing both the Coach and their peer on self-efficacy and isolation scales. This year we will collect and analyze the data.

We started a 'step-down' program for our clients called R&R (Recovery and Resiliency) program. This program will monitor and s upport MMH clients who are disc harged from MMH but without support could experience severe mental health chal lenges. We now have 10 clients in this new program. This year we are adding a LGBT+ component to our Peer Coach program. We will identify and train two coaches to support older adults with mental illness who have a lived experience as an LGBT+ individual. The Peer Coaches wi ll then offer support to reduce isol ation and improve self-efficacy as part of the treatment team to this underserved population. We are happy to report we have hired a Nurse Practi tioner to assist our Psychiatrist with medication management and monitoring the complex health needs of our clients.

FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: The Court Advocacy Program (CAP) has continued to provide services to individuals involved in the Crim inal Justice System in Alameda County. This has included working as a liaison with the Courts/Attorneys/Community and Family members as well as community providers in helping t hem navigate both the court and the mental health system. They often take on some of the most difficult and chal lenging cases and assist in connecting them to services in the community. Ov er the last year they have been involved with finding appropriate placements for individuals who are being released from the State Hospital s who have been found unlikely to regain competency. They often have to coordinate placement in a matter of days, including housing, connect with a treatment team or facilitate treatment at a sub-acute facility. The CAP staff has been successful in diverting many c lients from jail to comm unity treatment, often allowing Courts the confidence to allow for community placement as opposed to jail time.

CAP have actively referred to BACS-FR EE and assisted with the transition to the community including securing disch arge medications to help with continuity of care. CAP staff has referred clients to the new SSI advocacy programs to help ensure clients resume benefits when returning to the co mmunity. A study showed that obtaining benefits showed a marked reduction in incarcer ation and hospitalizations. The CAP program has not been successful in devel oping a data system to track some of the services that staff provide to the cour t staff. This continues to be a goal. Many of the services provided by CAP staff may not be captured as it may be general information or not related to clients who we would open cases for. FY 16-17 Progress Report: A Mental Health Specialist will be added to the CAP staff Over the next FY year CAP will continue to re view its data forms to make them more \"user friendly\" such as referral forms. CAP staff plans to provide education/trainings for Court Staff about ment al health services and how to access them. (Judges/Public Defenders/District Attorneys).

FY 16/17+ Plans: Over the next three years, the goal is to meet with 900families per year for the next 3 years. The Transition Center's Behavioral Health Clinic ian will also continue to meet with 1 to 2 community providers per month to increase the network of serv ice providers that youth will be connected to upon release. Over the next three years, the Guidance Clinic plans to in crease the number of community service connections for youth and families.

During FY 15-16, the Seneca MST team received training to implement Contingency Management (CM), a substance use treatment model within MST, as part of MST's serv ice delivery for youth needing additional services aimed to address substance-use. The pr otocol for CM requires that MST clinicians begin MST treatment and assess if the youth and family meet cr iteria for CM. Youth and families who meet CM criteria and agree to protocols required for CM are then approved to receive CM by the MST Superviso r and MST Expert Consultant. Two MST bilingual and bicultural Spanish-speaking clinicians were hi red during FY 15-16, increasing service availability for Spanish-speaking families. Challenges/Barriers and Stra tegies to Address Them: A targeted area of growth for MST has been to address the rates in which youth were placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer - a duration of time that precluded further MST involvement. This included youth who were detained at juvenile hall or residential placement. During FY 15-16, 14% of youth who discharged from MST closed due to being placed in a restrictive setting, compared to 11% the previous fiscal year. MST continues to assess factors contributing to the sli ght increase in the number of youth who discharged due to being placed in a restrictive setting and has implemented interventions such as further training for staff to address this issue.

Crisis Stabilization Services - Willow Rock Program Description: This strategy will provide crisis st abilization and acute care to youth ages 12- 17 and their families, moving them towards a reduced level of care. FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: The Willow Rock Crisis Stabilization Unit provided 1303 assessments to adolescents (aged 12-17) in crisis. Of these yout h, 89% were brought to the CSU on an involuntary civil commitment hold (WIC 5585), while 11% were voluntary walk-up clients. Based on the multidisciplinary, comprehensive a ssessment of the yout h's needs, 47% of youth assessed at the CSU were diverted from hospitaliz ation. When asked how welcome staff at the CSU made youth feel, satisfaction surveys of youth served in the CSU show a score of 3.7 out of 4. One youth stated that while at the CSU, \"Everyone was really kind and they explained everything that was going to happen thoroughly and answered all of my questions\". Another youth stated \"They [staff] made me feel like I could talk about anything\". Willow Rock continues to impact the community by participating in Crisis Intervention Training for Alameda County police officers, covering the topic of youth mental health i ssues and providing tours of the facility.

ATOD Network: Training and technical assistance project to improve clinical skills on how to provide evidence-based tobacco dependence treat ment, and implement 2011 BHCS Tobacco Policies and Consumer Treatment Protocols. Program outreach and training is county-wide, and targets/encompasses all age groups and BHCS programs, including cons umer groups. This is a much needed service as those with serious psyc hological distress are underserved in terms of tobacco treatment. For previous FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: ATOD Network: Trained 180 clinicians from a broad s pectrum of Mental Health and SUD programs through 11 multi-agency skill-building trai nings, 8 on-site trainings and provided 169 hours of TA (technical assistance) sessions. Trai ning included one CME training for psychiatrists and one all day training for peer facilitators in the PEERS consumer Tobacco Program. And includes providing training and TA to implement the 2011 BHCS Tobacco Policies and Consumer Treatment Protocols in both multi-agency training settings and at specific provider sites. Impact includes increased clinical capacity to inte rvene with consumers who smoke in settings where clinicians are practicing their clinical skills an d where tobacco policies have been, or are being implemented. Project activity also includes providing intensive TA to 4-5 BHCS tobacco intervention mini-grants designed to improve re cipient agencies' competency in intervening with their clients who smoke. Mini-gr antees collectively provided interv entions to 240 clients in their programs, and continued to strengthen their tobacco policies. M any clients they served decreased their smoking and some quit. Collaborative wo rk with PEERS resulted in PEERS providing 16 tobacco education presentations to over 140 c onsumers in 16 provider programs and beginning to do presentations at board and care provider progr ams. ATOD Project provides evaluation analysis to the PEERS Tobacco Program.

Low Income Heal th Plan Pilot (HPAC) Program Description: Broad array of services to provide increased access of consumers of the system to primary care services. FY 15/16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Pathways to Wellness: We provide approximately 25,000 plus services in a given year that includes connecting moderately to severely clients to outpatient medication support psychiatric services, housing, transportation, and social security benefits. We increased outreach, education and consultation du e to the large volumes of clients we serve within Pathways to Wellness. We admitted over 1200 new clients who are in need of outpatient specialty mental health care. Collaborated with ACBHCS and JGP whereas c lients discharged from JGP are admitted to Pathways to Wellness for initial an assessment within 7 days of discharge. We provided psycho-education to guide clients on recognizing their early signs of potentially severe and disabli ng mental illness.

COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES properly transitioning care to their medical homes. Successfully transitioned approximately 200 clients. Participated in a direct messaging pilot program to support initiatives to improve integration of primary care with mental health care services . Our efforts with primary care/medical homes enabled providers to collaborate and del iver the highest level of care to patients. By having easy access to medical providers, Pathways is able to pl ay a significant role in coordinating care and alleviating client concerns that exacerbate mental illnesses. Overall, the Direct Messaging program increases the level of trust, credibility and long lasting patient-provider relationships. It also creates synergy among a multidisciplinary team and expedites the level of connection and communication among all providers and agenc ies that have patients in common. Clients were provided with resour ces and additional Pathways staff support due to an increase in homelessness, poverty, substance abuse, health re lated issues, and psychiatric hospitalizations as a result of gentrificati on in the Urban Oakland area. We continuously hire staff that reflects the community that we serve to include LGBTQ, other ethnic groups and cultures. The clients we serve have moderate to severe m ental health impairments, therefore their length of stays are lengthier and/or it is difficult to find an alternativ e lower level of care other than level 3 services who are willing to treat clients with severe mental health impairments. Strategies: Utilize nurse practitioners and program nurses to handle demand for services, create weekend and evening schedules for new assessments and cont inue to collaborate with PCP's to ensure warm off hand of client and to facilitate discharge. Recruitment and retention of psychiatrists is becoming more challengin g due to the decline of doctors pursuing this specialty and competit ive salaries being offered with lower. Strategy: Utilize nurse practitioners and program nurses to provide med support services under the guidance of the Medical Director. Long wait times provoke agitation and increase s suffering among clients waiting to be assessed and stabilized. Strategy: Create patient scheduling models that allow for reasonable workloads that improve provider retention while achieving improved quality patient outcomes. STEPS: STEPS served 52 partners, 3 of whom were TAY-age partners and 5 of whom were Older Adult partners. For the FY 15-16, we have had some notable community impacts: We have greatly reduced hospitalizations for the partners served by STEPS. a. in the year prior to admission to STEPS, our partners had a total of 9425 hospital days, out of a possible 19032 days. This gives them a hospitali zation percentage of 49.5%; in other words, our partners spent approximately half of thei r time in hospitals prior to STEPS. b. while in STEPS, our partners had a total of 342 hospital days, out of a possible 10,681 (total member-days provided by STEPS). This hospitalization rate is 3.2% ; in other words, our partners had a 93% (100 - 3.2%/49.5%) reducti on in hospital days during their st ay in STEPS. Many of whom had spent the bulk of their time in the hospitals never returned to the hospital; they stabilized when they had adequate community support. We assisted 11 partners obtain housing while in STEP S. While the majority of our partners were housed prior to their admission to psychiatric fac ilities, 11 suffered from chronic homeless. We assisted 11 obtain transitional and/or permanent housing while in STEPS. We assisted 8 partners in obtaining benefits while in STEPS. While most obtained SSI, we also assisted several in obtaining SSDI, unemployment, and food stamp benefits.

COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES transition to permanent housing and to the community. We supported 4 partners in searching for and obtaining employment. In the past year, the housing cris is within Alameda County has had the largest impact. Many MH partners who were self-sustaining prior to the cr isis were driven to homeless by rising costs of housing. The housing crisis also resulted in many MH clients who were self -sustaining being driven into the shelters; this caused congestion within the s helter system. As a result, shelter beds were at a premium and less available to disc harging MH partners from local hospi tals; this extended stays of MH partners in our local hospitals and in the crisis residential programs. Our strategy to manage this challenge is to link up with AC's new Seeking Sh elter program; it is a clearing house for low-income housing and the shelter systems. We also remain strong advocates for our partners within the existi ng low-income and shelter systems. FY 16/17 Progress: Pathways to Wellness: We plan on servicing approximately 3300 total c lients, 2000 Adults, 480 TAY, 270 Older Adults, and 250 Children. Pathways to Wellness is seeing a significant incr ease in client symptom severity of which more clients are in crisis at admission. Multiple cris is interventions are being completed due to clients who are in need of additional psychiatric care and services. We anticipate needing additional staff in QA/Customer Service to address c oncerns presented by clients in crisis. PCP collaboration is increasing as a direct result of the PCP Pilot Initiative and the addition of the Community Primary Care Coordinator position. Integration of pharmacists into the medication st affing model to provide psychiatric stabilization through medication management. The addition of Intake Engagement Specialist to improve new client show rate and to ensure that the psychiatrists have all nee ded information at admission. STEPS: STEPS will serve even more partners than last y ear. We have completed our expansion and we are operating at our capacity of currently enrolled 28 partners. We currently have 12 partners referred to us with whom we are engaging. We anticipate approximatel y 5 TAY-age partners and 10 Older Adult partners in this fiscal year. In the next year, the housing crisis withi n Alameda County will probably have the largest impact. Many MH partners who were self-sustaining prior to the crisis will continue to be driven to homeless by rising costs of housing. The housing crisis will probably continue to cause congestion within the shelter system. As a result, shelter beds will remain at a premium and less available to discharging MH partners from local hospitals; th is will extend stays of MH partners in our local hospitals and in the crisis residential programs. Our strategy to manage this challenge will be to improve our linkages with AC's new Seeking Shelter program. We will also remain strong advocates for our partners within the existing low-income and shelter systems. In addition, STEPS will strive to be more fully integrated into the crisis services; in other words, we will strive to improve linkages wit h Jay Mahler Recovery Center and Woodroe Place and facilitate rapid placement of at-risk, high utilizers of emergency services.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES Alameda County has implemented a va riety of Prevention and Early In tervention (PEI) programs for the purpose of \"preventing mental illness from becoming severe and disabling and improving timely access for underserved populations.\"1 It's the intention of all PEI pr ograms to emphasize strategies for the goal of reducing negative outcomes that may result from unt reated mental illness: suicide, incarcerations, school failure or dropout, unemployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of children from their homes. California's historic commitment to preventio n and early intervention through Prop 63 moves the mental health system towards a \"help-first\" instead of a \"fail first\" strategy. PEI identifies individuals at risk of or indicating early signs of mental illness or emotional disturbance and links them to treatm ent and other resources. 2 Alameda County's PEI program s create partnerships with schools, justice systems, primary care and a wide range of social services and community groups . In addition to these par tnerships, the county has also placed these preventative and early intervent ion services in convenient places where people go for other routine activities. The MHSA specif ies that all funded PEI Programs must include: Outreach to families, employers, primary care health care providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabling mental illness; Access and linkage to medically necessary care...as early in the onset of these conditions as practicable; Reduction in stigma and discrimination associated with either being diagnosed with a mental illness or seeking mental health services and r eduction in discrimination against people with mental illness (MHSA, Secti on 4, Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) \u00a7 5840(b)). 1 Proposition 63: Mental Health Services Act 2004 2 MHSOAC PEI Fact Sheet, December 2012 Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 42 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB.

In monthly meetings with BRG, team members shared how they used the coaching skills and reflections on what shifted for themselves and their clients, supervisor, supervisee. Notes were analyzed for key themes emerging in the team's reflections. This inquiry found that coaching offered a mindset, orientation, shared language and specific techniques for engaging in empowering relationshi ps and collaboration and movement towards action. 2) Supporting the Emerging Role of an Internal Coach: The role of a 'Coach' within ACBHCS is new and emerging. The inquiry focused on lear ning more about the ways that public sector and non-profit organizations are using an internal coach to integrate coaching and promote a coaching culture. Interviews were conduct ed with 'internal coaches', coach trainers, and beneficiaries of an internal coach (team member s who had received coaching or coach training) Emphasis was on exploring the conditions/ contexts that best support the role.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES Current FY 16-17: Parent Tools to Thrive (PT3) Developed and began implementat ion of Parent Tools to Thrive (PT3). Outcomes Parent Tools to Thrive (PT3) is a 10 se ssion parent developed and par ent led education and support group for parents of children, birth-five. PT3 is for parents who are wondering if their young child's development is progressing as it should, as well as for parents who have identified a specific concern(s) about thei r child. Child development and mental health experts were consultants on the content of PT3. Parent Tools to Thrive (PT3) provides educat ion and support for parents in an atmosphere that feels safe and non-judgm ental. Parents who facilitate PT3 have often expe rienced similar concerns about their children, which contributes to their ability to implement PT3 with empathy and understanding, and speak \"parent to parent.\" Parent Tools to Thrive (PT3) provides education about young children' s challenges, and the system that exists to meet the needs of their ch ildren's challenges. PT3 guides parents on how to advocate for their children, and as a resu lt parents often develop parent leadership skills. BHCS staff and consultants completed a Traini ng of Facilitators and trained a cohort of 11 parents to implement the program. Challenges PT3 was developed with parents from the very beginning process of co nceptualization. One of the challenges we encountered was the time and resources required to coordinate and facilitate planning meetings with mental health providers, family run organization staff, parents and consultants. Given the varianc e in experiences and priorities among the planning teams, the process required more time and intentional strategies to reach consensus on decisions regarding the curriculum. PT3 is being piloted from September 2016-J anuary 2017 by a family-run community-based organization and a Head Start program. PT3 will be finalized in January 2017, and translated into Spanish in Spring 2017.

B/C School-Based Mental Health Consultation Programs Program Description: The School-Based Mental Health (SBMH) consultation program is comprised of three components including: Outreach and Engagement Services located in tw o student health centers in the city of Alameda and a family resource center in the city of Fremont; SBMH Consultation Services in 16 out of the 18 Alameda County sc hool districts, and A Comprehensive School-Based Outreach & E ngagement, Mental Health Consultation and Preventative Counseling Program for the Unaccompanied Immi grant Youth (UIY) population, which is mainly focused in Oakland and Cent ral County. SBBHI: In 2009, Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) launched a School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative (SBBHI), bringing together two divi sions within the Alameda County's local health authority, the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (CHSC) and Behavioral Health Care Services Agency (BHCS) , to create a shared model for building and financing school- based behavioral health systems across the county. Through the SBBHI, Alameda County collaborates with its many partners to provide a range of servic es and supports such as: district capacity building, coordi nation of resources and services, school climate training and funding and treatment and early intervention services. UIY: In response to the increased number of UIY cr ossing the US border, many of whom are locating to Alameda County, Behavioral Health Care Servic es (BHCS) through the Mental Health Services Act allocated $2.5 million over a three year period specifically for UIY in school-based, school-linked and community settings. As part of this funding BHCS contracted with La Familia Counseling Services to launch the Unaccompanied Immigrant Youth (UIY) Ca re Team comprised of 4 Clinicians and 2 Case Managers to serve UIY in areas that have been identified as high need service areas. BHCS also partners with The Center for Healthy Schools and Co mmunities (under health Care Services Agency) and hired and assigned a Senior Cli nical Case Manager (SCCM) to l ead the work of the UIY Care Team, as well as assess, identify, and work wit h schools and community organizations to address the needs of UIY across the county.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES For previous FY 15-16 For current FY 16-17 For upcoming FY 17-18 Outreach and Engagement Services: Fremont Resource Center Approximately 60 parent/caregivers/children were referred to therapy because of their outreach efforts and another approximately 150 potential responders were provided with education and resources on mental health. SBBHI: Through the SBBHI Partnership Coordination of Service Teams (COST) has been rolled out in 157 of 281 schools in the County (56% of all schools now have a COST program) Across the districts 7,228 referrals for behavioral health related needs were given out and 72% of these resulted in a positive connection to services. 2,436 PEI events (trainings, consultation, restorative justice activities, and positive school climate work) took place for a total of 60,116 contacts. (Duplicative count). The most common topics for these events were wellness/self-care, SUD/MH issues, resources/referral, classroom behavior and educational issues. UIY Program: The UIY Care Team provides comprehensive and culturally/linguistica lly competent school- based mental health and case management services to UIY and caregivers where they are needed most. The team is a collaboration between HCSA and La Familia Counseling Services and consists of a Behavioral Health Consultant Lead from the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities and 4 mental health clinicians from La Familia. Outreach and Engagement Services: Approximately 100-230 potential responders will be provided education or referral for mental health resources. Another 800-1,000 will be interacting with Family Resource Specialists who have received Mental Health First Aid training. Additional school staff may be outreached and engaged through the Fremont School District. SBBHI: In FY 16/17 it's expected that the SBBHI partnership will continue to grow with a deeper emphasis on access and linkage to services for school-based youth. This program will be expected to provide approximately 7,000 to 7,500 referrals for behavioral health services with an increase in the % of positive linkages from FY 15/16. Staffing on the UIY Care team was restructured for the 2016-17 year to better support the needs of the UIY community. Staffing now consists of 4 Full-Time, bilingual and bicultural clinicians and two case managers, with an Outreach and Engagement Services: It's estimated to outreach to 140-270 potential responders who will receive substantial education There are also plans to expand some of other services to this site. (Grief and Loss, parenting classes, etc.) so there will be opportunity to screen and outreach to more people on site.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES The UIY Care Team provided 1,680 prevention-oriented activities and events, such as professional leaders consultation, family consultation, one-to-one outreach, prevention visits (i.e. first contact with a youth), psychoeducation workshops, training professional leaders 72 clients received preventative and early intervention treatment. Some challenges include: Outreach: Families with children who are recent arrivals are the most influenced by cultural taboos. Many come with issues that they consider th eir \"secrets\" and it is very difficult to open up and share. Some have faced trauma and come baring scars, inflicted by crossing borders, rapes, wars, domestic violence, etc. It is very difficult for to convince them of the benefits of therapy or of speaking to someone who may be able to help them. In some cases, there are controlling husbands who forbid wives from even considering therapy. By having staff who share their culture and some of their stories it facilitates having conversations that lead to referrals and positive and desired outcomes within the family. UIY: Many school districts in the county still do not have systems in place to track UIY students at registration. Not all UIY have been apprehended and therefore are harder to find. Not all UIY attend school, so it can be difficult to engage them. expectation to serve up to 150 UIY and their support systems per year.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES PEI 2/FSP 16: Early Intervention for the Onset of First Psyc hosis & SMI among TAY Program Description: The PREP (Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis) Program's overarching goal is to identify and intervene with tr ansition age youth (16-24 years) experiencing an initial episode of psychosis associated with schizophr enia and their families. It provides evidence- based treatment and support for youth and families through an intensive outpatient model of care that includes the provision of: algor ithm-based medication management, cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTP), individual placement and support (IPS), assertive outreach, multi-family groups, cognitive remediation and strengt h-based care management services. For previous FY \"East Bay Community Recove ry Project, PREP Alameda County, August 2016.\" Community Impact Of the 48 clients who were enrolled in t he PREP program for at least 12 months: 60% were engaged in school or work after 12 mont hs compared to 42% at baseline, which is a 45% increase. Of these 48 cli ents, 35 chose to participate in PREP Educational/Vocational Services. Of those 35 clients, 77% were in school or working after 12 months in PREP compared to 54% at baseline. Of the clients who did not par ticipate in Ed/Voc services, 15% were in school or working after 12 months co mpared to 8% at baseline. There was a 57% reduction in the hospitalization ra te of PREP clients dur ing the first year of participation in the program. Challenges The targeted number of client hours were not ac hieved. Several factors contributed to this including: a staff therapist resigning in Jan. and a replacement not hired until May, the office moving from Oakland to Hayward that led to fewer clients attending groups and dropping by the office, and a reduction in referra ls from the County Transition A ge Treatment (TAT) team with the first 6 months of 2015 having 28 referrals compar ed to the first 6 months of 2016 receiving 20 referrals. To address these challenges the following steps are being taken: Work with County TAT team to increase referrals Outreach at least 2 times per month to different programs that would be likely referral sources Work on staff retention issues including conduct a staff satisfaction survey and increase in-service trainings Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 53 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES PEI.4 Stigma and Discrimination Reduction Campaign Program Description Program Description: The Alameda County Everyone Count s Campaign's goal is to create welcoming communities by promoting inclusion and eliminating mental health stigma and discrimination. The campaign is run by the consumer led or ganization Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services (PEERS). FY 15-16 The Everyone Counts Campaign aims to reduce stigma and discrimination against people with mental health experiences. It also promotes the empowerment of individuals and communities through various activities that support wellness and recovery. Through the programs in the stigma reduction campaign we have made the following impact: Overcoming Internalized Stigma in the Chinese-American Community: In the Chinese and other Asian Pacific Islander co mmunities, mental health issues are present, but often a taboo. PEERS hosted Overcoming Internaliz ed Stigma support groups for Chinese American mental health consumers t hat supported participants with reducing internalized stigma, while gaining a stronger sense of se lf and integrating back into their community. Two cultural responsiveness trainings with a total of 85 participants were held where the community was educated on mental health topics and shared findi ngs were presented from the support groups to aid the community on supporting loved ones with mental health experiences. They also held 2 support groups (in collaboration with Dr. Larry Yang, Columbia University) where a pre/post survey was used to measure outcomes with a particular focus on measuring internalized stigma. The outcomes of the survey were: Across all participants, an average 33% reduc tion in negative self-esteem after group participation. 4 participants gained full or part time em ployment, 3 participants began volunteering. 4 participants joined together to form a \"sub-group\" to continue the wo rk that they have started in the support group. Challenges/barriers and strat egies to mitigate barriers: There was a delay in finding a location for the s upport groups to meet as the participants expressed not feeling comfortable meeting outside of their own community. They were able to accommodate their participants by finding a location in China Town . In the future, they wil l consider the needs of the specific community that they're serving. Lift Every Voice and Speak (LEVS) Speakers Bureau The Speaker's Bureau offers opportunities for 20 mental health consumers to gain tools that empower members to share their stories of re covery and hope in the community.

Participants felt a sense of community and had a ccess to more resource as a result of this program. Challenges/barriers and strat egies to mitigate barriers: At times participants struggled with interpersonal issues within the group. To resolve this problem, they provided participants tools to overcome these barriers and used parts of the meeting to intentionally build team/community. They will contin ue to use these practices to support healthy group dynamics. Spirituality For many consumers and their families, spirituality is an essential element in an integrated approach to resilience, wellness, and recovery. PEERS hosts monthly peer-led spirituality gatherings that create a nurturing space for 24 participants to di scuss the impact that spirituality has on their wellness. They also collaborated with Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services Department to host a day of prayer for the Mental Health National Day of Prayer where 20 participants from various spiritual walks came together to honor m ental health consumers. Additional outcomes: Increased knowledge of mental health stigma in the spiritual community. Increased awareness of the spiritual practices used to support wellness. Challenges/barriers and strat egies to mitigate barriers: The spirituality gatherings were very impactful spac es that included a small group of participants. Their goal is to reach more mem bers of the spiritual community as they have found that there's a great need to provide such a space where stigma and discrimination in these communities can be addressed. They're working on a targeted outreach plan that would allow them to reach outside of the communities that they generally target. They also would like to hold these gatherings at local religious institutions and spiritual centers. Everyone Counts Campaign Outreach Efforts Outreach efforts through media communications and community outreach enabled the Campaign to expand mental health and stigma reducti on efforts to a broader community. Everyone Counts Campaign website views - 4,610 Subscribers to the Everyone Counts Campaign mailing list - 347 Outreach events - 56 5 Reflections and Expressions events (105 partici pants) where they used creative expression to share the message of well ness and stigma reduction. Challenges/barriers and strategies to mitigate barriers The goal is to increase the number of people we reach through our outreach efforts. They specifically would like to increas e subscribers to the Everyone C ounts Campaign. They'll be working with our communications coordinator to create out reach strategies to expand their reach.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES UNDERSERVED ETHNIC LANGUAGE PO PULATION (UELP) PROGRAMS The UELP programs were designed to provide services to historically underserved populations, which the State defined as: Afghan/So uth Asian, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), Native American, and Latino. Each UELP program is built on a foundation of three core strategies: 1) Education and Outreach, 2) Mental Health Consultation and 3) Preventative Counseling services. These strategies are implemented through a variety of services such as one-to-one outreach events, psycho-educational workshops/classes, consultation sessions, support groups, traditional healing workshops, radio/television/ blogging activities, and short te rm-low intensity early intervention counseling sessions for individuals and families who are exper iencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health challenge or mental illness. In FY 15/16 the data show that thes e UELP providers in total produced: 6,210 prevention events, which is an 11% increase over last year; 40,833 people were served at these pr evention events; ( duplicated count) and 533 unique clients were served through early interv ention services, which almost identical to the number of clients se rved in FY 14/15. Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Servic es developed and implemented a health and wellness survey, which included quality of life and outcome indicators, in the fall of 2015. The survey was disseminated to the UELP community in 11 diffe rent languages: English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Khmer, Nepali, Korean, Thai, and Burmese. Domains Included: Connecting individuals and families with their culture; Forming and strengthening identity; Changing knowledge and perc eption of mental health; Building community and wellness, and Improving access to services and resources. A summary of key findings from the survey (of 318 participants) shows that in connection with receiving UELP services : 84% of clients reported f eeling connected to their culture and community (connection) 89% of clients reported feeling conf ident and good about themselves (identity) 83% of clients believe that stress worries and happiness can impact mental and emotional health (knowledge/perception of MH) 90% of clients reported knowing people wh o will listen and support them (community) 86% of clients reported knowing wher e to get help in a crisis (access) 87% of clients reported knowing how to get services or resources (access) In addition to the above domains, four open-ended questions were also aske d in order to better understand: 1) if and how respondents felt services were beneficial to them; 2) what kind of needs they might still have; 3) if and how their lives would be different if they were not receiving prevention Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 59 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB.

Respondents reported feelings of being unaware of what to do, feelings of being in the dark or ignorant about certain issues had they not been participating in their UELP programs. \"I wouldn't be living each day with more conscience.\" \"I would have been in ignorance.\" Other key themes that generated t en or more responses included: feeling lonely, depressed, sad, worried or anxious; having more problems or being worse off in general, or being uniformed about services, programs and resources available to them. See ATTACHMENTS: \"Alameda County Underserv ed Ethnic Language Population Programs, PEI Community Survey and Focus Group Results FY 2015-16.\" Access to Services for UELP Communities In addition to identifying progress and success th rough the above survey domains the county has also started to analyze early intervention data to determine if access has increased for these historically underserved populations. Four years of data analysis does seem to indicate that access to mental health services has increased for these historica lly underserved populations. BHCS looked at \"access\" in two wa ys: 1) of the people receiving early intervention services, what percent had received services in our system wit hin the past three years and 2) Of the people receiving early intervention services what percent went on to need mental hea lth treatment services. For our first question BHCS took a cohort of 547 early intervention clients from FY 15/16 and looked back five years to see if this cohort had ever been served in our system before. The data found that only 18% of these 547 clients had ever been seen bef ore in our system. This percentage is also similar for FY 14/15 clients. Reas ons for not accessing services are varied but include the areas of no language capacity, cultural issues, fear, stigma, not knowing where to access services, family members trying to support their loved ones themse lves and not meeting Specialty Mental Health criteria. For the second question BHCS took a cohort of 512 early intervention clients from FY 14/15 and looked forward to see what percent went on to need mental health treat ment services. The data found that 10% of the 512 clients went on to receive m ental health treatment serv ices (mainly outpatient services) in either FY 14/15 or FY 15/16. This data indicates that the majori ty of early intervention clients who are experiencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health challenge or mental illness are being able to receive the appropriate level of care from a cultural lens that they are familiar with; and that for those needing a higher level of care are being referred for this care. More information will be shared on this indicator of access as data is available and analyzed. Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 61 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB.

Requests fo r leadership trainings, workshops, and mental health consultations from CBOs, schools, and faith- based institutions continue to grow. This year CyB engaged agencies that tr aditionally are not involved in pr evention services, i.e. Children's Hospital Oakland, Fatherhood Initiatives, Alameda County First Five, Wisdom Keepers, Restorative Justice Programs, and the Ju venile Justice Center. Traditional medicine workshops have received excellent responses from the community and evaluations confirm its success and value to the community. CyB Promotores have been ce rtified to teach MH First Aid, and have trained 60 Spanish speaking community members from vari ous CBOs and schools. CyB Health Promoters have started a Men's Group in Union City, based on their very successful men's group in Oakland. CyB's work with school-age children and their families continued to increase in FY 15-16 due to an overwhelming number of requests from teachers in viting CyB staff to meet with students and their parents, As a result of these pr esentations, the CyB Health Educators have presented several six (6) session workshops for parents and their children titled \" Porque Tenemos Hijos \" (Because We Have Children). Additionally, par ents call requesting parenting serv ices to address the behavioral issues their children are displaying, and request se rvices for their children in order to improve communication and build healt hy family dynamics.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES Challenges: Several challenges continue to be highlighted for FY 15-16 and are expected to continue into FY 16-17. Community requests for services are beyond the re sources that are availa ble through CyB so not all requests for services can be fulfilled. A dditionally linking community members who need treatment services can be challenging as most serv ices have waiting lists for Spanish services due to workforce challenges recruiting fully bilingual staff; stigma of treatment services is also an issue. Maintaining staff who are in par t time positions is an ongoing challenge for which CyB is hoping to mitigate through combining several positions to be able to retain our MH Specialists in this project for longer periods of time. FY 16-17 FY 16-17 For FY 16/17 CyB will strive to expand services into Castro Valley, San Leandro, and San Lorenzo and continue cultivating relationships and alliances in these communities. CyB will also reach out more to the LGBTQQI community to let them k now who they are, what they do and ask how they can build greater trust to work more with members of these communities. Additionally, CyB has f ound a large population of women who feel unapprec iated in their lives, don't have a voice, feel under-valued, isolated, and alone. CyB will work on a plan to begin a women's group, which will focus on building self- esteem, providing educa tion about depression, self-care, and include \"t emezcals\" for women. A temazcal is a type of sweat lodge which originated with pre-His panic Indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. CyB's mental health education efforts continue to produce well informed/trained community members as Promotores (Health Promoters) who are identified as \"change agents.\" CyB trains these community members to identify mental health issues and how to seek help for mental health issues for themselv es, family members or other community members. The community Promotores are critical to the All of the UELP programs, of which CyB is one of, will be put out for public bidding in FY 17/18. Therefore there are no proposed changes for this year.

Outreach, Education and Consultati on for the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Communities Program Description: The UELP program that se rves the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Communities is led by three agencies, Asian Community Mental Health (ACMHS), Center for Emerging Refugees and Immigrants (CERI) and Community Health for Asian Americans (CHAA) and is called \"API Connections\". It's designed to serve a diverse r ange of unserved and underse rved API communities through the provision of culturally responsiv e mental health promot ion/prevention and early intervention services.

These types of programs create opportunities for API communities struggling with onset and/or ongoing mental health challenges to access services in non-stigmatizing, strength amplifying, and community connectivity in a safe, supportive, and welcoming environment. ACMHS also collaborated with First Five of Al ameda County to provide culturally responsive, developmentally appropriate, and social/emotional strengthening parent-child relationship weekly playgroups and psycho-education groups with Viet namese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Cambodian families. They've continued their efforts by hiring Consumer Interns and Peer Specialists with the supervision of a mental health clinician to provide weekly additional outreach to those isol ated at home or fear of accessing services due to stigma. Additionally, they've provided monthly consultation groups for local providers seeking additional guidance and better understanding on best practice for providing cultura lly competent/relevant mental treatment and outr each to the API communiti es in Alameda County. CHAA: Creation of a Tongan men's support group to address issues in the Tongan community. Conversations include domestic violence, traditi onal gender roles, subst ance abuse, parenting and how to better support one's family. A monthly support group has c ontinued with Bhutanese women to discuss trauma, family and community violence, and finding hope. A Monthly Thai culture-based Ethic Class for children has started to hel p them understand their culture and background. This class helps to support intergenerational dialogue and reduce conflict within the family. Multiple outreach events have also taken place across newcomer and refugee communities, which have helped increase community knowledge on where to seek culturally relevant care and support. CERI: CERI hosted monthly multigenerat ional cultural events with at least 45 people in attendance per event. Their mental health professionals facilit ated their elders teaching the youth about Cambodian traditions including Cambodian dance, cooking and story- telling towards the goal of reducing dropout rates in school, gang, and crime and prostitu tion involvement. Youth are more likely to be involved in these activities if they are disconnected from their family and traditions CERI provided 200 hours of home and school visits - helping several of their youth get connected to school counselors so they could get the academic support they needed to succeed in school. Home visits were done with two young men who had probat ion involvement to help them meet their conditions of probation and attend school. CERI also conducted 12 psych- education workshops including: drumming circle and importance of music on physical/ mental health wellness, healthy eat ing, importance of physical activity on mental health, and stigma of mental health and how to normalize mental health needs.

PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES Challenges: The PEI demands from t he API communities well-exceeded the c ontracted amount for this program. API consists of 27% of Alameda County's total popul ation and consists of over 40 distinct language and cultural groups. During FY15-16, ACMHS was over-capacity for Early Intervention services, serving 124 active clients when they're contracted to serve 60. In addition to high needs, the new moderate-severe criteria for spec ialty mental health treatment pr ograms funded by Medi-Cal and the waiting list or lack of language capacity for behavioral services in FQ HCs or HMOs for the mild to moderate has contributed to this increase in demands for UELP Early Intervention service. A major challenge to conducting ongoing community work is helping people understand the importance of mental heal th wellness and prevention. Communities are focused on obtaining a stable job and housing. Wellness and prevention ar e secondary needs. CHAA is addressing this challenge by integrating access to concrete resources while also offering PEI services. They also try to capitalize on local issues that are important to the community and create dialogue spaces that integrate mental health t opics within these issues. An external issue for both of the providers for this program, as well as many others, face is staffing capacity. For FY 15/16, only one of CHAA's staff wa s full-time. The remaining paraprofessional staff were at 50% or less. This is extremely chal lenging given the high need of these unserved and underserved communities and limited resources and language support in other systems. As a result, staff often feel ov erburdened in their community work and have less time to complete paperwork in a timely manner. FY 16-17 FY 16-17 For FY 16/17 API Connections will continue to outreach and engagement multiple un and underserved API communities through collaboration with other agencies, increasing language capacity, assisting in translating mental health wellness products into API languages, hosting support groups, hosting WRAP groups Additionally, on top of ACMHS' bilingual outreach brochures in Chinese, Khmer, Korean and Vietnamese, they continue to disseminate the \"Know the Signs\" statewide suicide prevention brochures in Chinese, Khmer, Korean, Vietnamese, Lao and Tagalog. As part of API Connections CHAA supports mental health and wellness in three priority areas: mind/body healing, social and cultural integration, and fair and equitable work. These areas are critical for th e well-being of refugees and newcomers (a s egment of the API community that CHAA is charged with serving). Their culturally sensitive approaches include: All of the UELP programs, of which these three agencies are, will be put out for public bidding in FY 17/18.

The young women have gay and lesbian friends that attended Oakland Tech High School with her. She wanted her and her friends to have a safe place to study and complete homework, while also providing community for the youth. Two of these youth have since graduated and ar e receiving partial scholarships to attend college. Another one of the youth is completing a full-time 3 month internship at Highland Hospital. All the groups give the children a sense of community, connection to other Cambodian immigrant youth and an adul t who they trust and can confide in when they need extra help. Research shows that having at least one caring adult in a child's life is one of the most important protective factors against a myriad of risky behaviors including alcohol and drug use, risky sexual behaviors, teen pregnancy, etc. PEI 7. Outreach, Education and Cons ultation for the South Asian/Afghan Communities Program Description: The UELP programs that serve the South Asian and Afghan Communities are run by two prominent community -based agencies, the Portia Bell Hume Center and the Afghan Coalition. Both of these agencie s work collaboratively in providin g services to these underserved populations. Examples of their acti vities include (but are not limited to): home visits, gender specific support groups, psycho-educational workshops and pr esentations, mental health consultations, healing practices that address iss ues of trauma, low-intensity ear ly intervention visits and other cultural celebrations.

Through consultation, staff can better help thei r clients and address early mental health needs. Consultation helps strengthen the process by understanding the client's needs. High levels of satisfaction were reported by the staff of agencies where they provided services. Afghan Coalition: The biggest success of the year was that the Afghan Coalition was able to open an Afghan Wellness Center (AWC). This center prov ides a comfortable and pr ivate environment that allows the program to prov ide quality services to clients that address their mental health needs in a culturally sensitive manner. Implementing the appointment system for client services has changed the perspective of the community members toward mental health services from the AWC without f ear of exposure to the community. The clients are very satisfied with the se rvices that are being provided by the program. For example, this year we had a 53-year-old unma rried client. The client lived with her father who was suffering from a mental health challenge. She was very shy and did not want anyone to know about her situation. She st ated that \"at your previ ous location I was not comfortable coming to talk about my problems, but at the new office I feel mo re comfortable sharing my concerns and worries.\" After a few sessions, the client dem onstrated significant positive changes. A second large success of this project was the AW C's tutoring/mentoring pr ogram for Afghan youth. The project worked closely with youth/adults to engage them in activities on both a psychological and intellectual level. The AWC was able to attend to academic concerns while also educating them about mental health and the servic es available to them. Many par ents were pleased and expressed how their children improved not only academically, but also noticed a positive shift in behavior. It was also a successful year fo r the AWC's outreach events. One of the most successful outreach events held was the Ramadan Kick-Off event, which was held in collaboration with the community groups: Afghan Cultural Society, Af ghan Professionals Network, Daunish Cultural Society, Lemar TV and Afghan Seniors Association of the Bay Area. Over 50 youth (5-18) and their families attended. Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 68 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB. PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES Challenges: As with many of the UELP programs the cha llenge of overcoming mental health stigma and engaging communities is always present. These programs have been able to mitigate this challenge through not using labels or mental health jargon and utilizing community leaders to introduce and speak about various ment al health topics. There has also been a challenge around the commitment to long term support groups due to the stigma for mental health that is prevalent in the South Asian community. Interest in \"groups\" is typically expressed at community outreach events but few people t end to actually participate. Instead the Hume Center has provided support th rough workshops which do not require participants to identify themselves as going through a challe nge and yet benefit from in formation and support around it. However there is still a need for more support groups particularly for seniors and parents. So this program will continue to look fo r innovative engagement strategies. Overall an additional challenge for both of these programs as well for other prevention programs with good language capacity is that the needs exceed the services. Many individuals and families have social service, financial, vocational, legal needs that these PEI programs do not work on but because of language capacity the community members seek out these PEI programs. So these ethnic/linguistic focused program s have had to become knowledgeable about all of the different kinds of community resources in order to cr eate good linkages, however this takes a good deal of time. FY 16-17 FY 16-17 Both of these programs rely on outreach to connect with their communities. The approaches that they've utilized is to outreach by using non-psychological terminology to connect with people and help the community overcome the stigma of mental health. Additiona lly, outreach workers have used compassion and to normalize that mental health challenges exist on a spectrum for all individuals as everyone has experienced the ups and downs of mental health , including stress, grief and depression. Also programs use analogies to help explain concepts of mental health for example (when we keep shoving a container with materials it eventually will fill up and the things will start overflowing and we compare this to feelings and how keeping feelings bottled inside will eventually lead to overflowing). The community mental health specialists continue to outreach and engage the various South Asian communities in order to reduce stigma and discrimination, increase access to mental health All of the UELP programs, of which these 2 agencies are part of, will be put out for public bidding in FY 17/18. Therefore there are no proposed changes for this year.

Outreach, Education and Consultati on for the Native American Communities Program Description: The UELP program that serves the Native American Communities is led by the community organization the Native American Health Center (NAHC). This PEI program run by the NAHC is called the \"Native American Prevention Center.\" A majority of the program activities take place on site at the S.A.G.E (Spirit, Art & Cultur e, Guidance and Encouragemen t) Center. To date this program, has been very successful in pr oviding culturally appropriate mental health promotion/prevention and early intervention services to the Native American community. FY 15-16 Impact Total Prevention Contacts: FY 15/16: 3,087 (45% increase from the previous year) 1,235 children and TAY 1,852 adults & older adults Total Prevention Events: 478 Early Intervention (EI) Clients:9 The S.A.G.E. Center has had a number of impactful projects during this time period including: 1) FY 15/16 started off strong with their Gat hering of the Lodges (GOTL) event. GOTL invites community members and substance abuse lodges fr om across California to participate in the celebration of sobriety and well ness. The event hosted upwards of 200 individuals and provided workshops on health and mindfulness exercises to self-care. The event ended traditionally, with the count down and \"shout outs\" celebrati ng individual sobriety from 40 plus years down to the minute. 2) NAHC continues to be successful in using Tradi tional Consultants throughout the year. These consultants are used to provide language to mental health topics that resonate with their members. Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 70 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB. PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES For example, using traditional st ories to explain things often ti mes works better with our members than sharing research. Using la nguage that's relatable and under stood by member's helps with retention and helps to inspire motivation more than research studies or a presentation by someone members do not see themselves in. Challenges: The NAHC PEI program has struggled a bit this year with staff turnover at t he leadership level. New leadership has been hired so it's the hope that this program will continue to thrive. As with many of the UELP programs the challenge of overcoming mental health stigma as well as trauma is always present. This program has been able to mitigate this chall enge through cultural interventions, which alleviate social and health problems in Na tive communities. In the Native worldview, wellness is viewed as \"maintaining balance\" with the nat ural environment and harmony in human relationships. Restoring balance is the goal of ceremonial healing (\"doctori ng\") by traditional medicine people. Native Americans have a relational worldview, rooted in tribal culture. Ever y event in one's circle of life relates to all other events regardless of time and space. Interventions are focused on bringing the person back into balance. FY 16-17 FY 16-17 NAHC continues to use creative strategies to introduce the concept of mental health therapy to members. Traditional arts groups weave in lessons and guest speakers provide introductions to mental health in a setting that's comfortable such as their Men's Drum group. They often have a Mental Health intern sit in on the group and fully participate with the lead facilitator. Through the interns full participation members bu ild relationships and engage on a peer level. These interactions have provided a face to their mental health work. It brings their clinicians out of the office and into interaction with members in different settings. It also allows their members to humanize their behavioral health clinicians and fosters opportunities to build relationships so important to matriculation into therapy services. In FY 16/17 NAHC would also like to increase participation in their we llness program offerings. They have goals to double participation through a series of controlled Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles. NAHC hopes to identify interventions that will engage members into participating in their All of the UELP programs, of which NAHC is one of, will be put out for public bidding in FY 17/18.

Asian Pacific Islander staffing to ACCESS Program Description: In FY 15/16 this Access and Linkage Program was run by the local community-based organization Asian Community Mental Health Services. Due to financial issues and quality of care this program was transferred to Asian Health Services in FY 16/17. However, even with a new provider the progra m intent has remained the same, which is to improve availability of ACCESS information and referral; and brief treatment services by increasing bicultural staff in one Asian Pacific Islander crisis clinic. Services include phone referrals, assessment, outreach and brief crisis stabilization treatment. The overall the goal is for these access and linkage services is to prevent initial or re-occurring psychiatric hospitalizations. FY 15/16 Outcomes, Barriers and Challenges: Impact: For FY 15/16 this ACCESS program provided over 800 screening, information and referrals for the API comm unity. In addition they served 117 uni que clients for short term crisis stabilization services and 4 clients were referred fu rther to their specialty mental health program. Upon discharge, ACMHS often refers clients to multiple other serv ices including: medication management services, family psychotherapy, Level III Services, their own EPSDT program, legal Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 79 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB. PREVENTION & EARLY INVERVENTION PROGRAM SUMMARIES services, prevention programs, community resources, Social Services Administration (SSA) for food stamp benefit information and to their own Spec ialty Mental Health (SMH) program. Challenges: There are many linguistic and cultural ch allenges, however these bullets are the two most prominent ones: Inadequate bilingual API behavioral health providers, and Lack of culturally responsive community wellness/safety net programs for individuals who do not or no longer meet specialty ment al health services criteria. Stigma also continues to be a barrier and challe nge in the Asian and Pacific Islander communities and because of this many do not seek out services. FY 16-17 Plans: As mentioned above in the opening narrative this program moved from Asian Community Mental Health to Asian health Services which has cause a slight disruption in services and documentation of services. However, in the second part of FY 16/ 17 services have stabilized and staff capacity is increasing. For FY 16/17 they expect to screen and provide info rmation to 900 individuals and serve between 120-150 clients. FY 17-18 Plans: For FY 17/18 they estimate to serve 130 clients. This program may go out for a public bidding process in FY 17/18, but this hasn' t yet been completely determined. Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 80 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB.

Latino staffing to ACCESS Program Description: This Access and Linkage Program is run by the community based organization, La Familia, and provides screenings, referr als and crisis stabilization treatment for the Latino community for adults who are 18 and ov er, lack health coverage and are monolingual Spanish speakers. In addition to these core services the program al so provides short term follow-up care when clients are discharged from a psychiatric hos pital. The overall the goal is for these crisis stabilization services to prevent initial or re-occurring psychiatric hospitalizations. For previous FY 15-16 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: For FY 15/16 this ACCESS program received 133 requests for services of which 85 were uninsured. Of the 133 requests we provided direct services to 97 (73%) unduplicated clients. Many uninsured and undocumented clients were also were able to get connected to primary care through referrals from this ACCE SS Program. Primary care refe rrals are mainly to Hayward Wellness and Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center . Through these referrals, many clients successfully applied to Medi -Cal or HealthPac. Upon discharge, this ACCESS Program often refers clients multiple other services including: medication management services, family psychot herapy, Level III Services, their own EPSDT program, legal services, prevention programs, community resources (their own community outreach services and other community programs) and to their own Specialty Mental Health (SMH) program. In 15/16 they referred 3 clients to their SMH program. Challenges: Requests for services exceed thei r capacity to provide services. They only have 1.5 FTE for the ACCESS Program. Most of their ACCESS clients are monolin gual Spanish speakers who are undocumented, making it difficult to refer to public mental health, housing suppor t or employment services. There are not enough appropriate providers in Alameda County who can serve this population due to cultural, linguistic or economic reasons. Be cause of this, there are some cases that we extend treatment beyond stabilization until we can secure appropriate care and find it clinically appropriate to discharge. Stigma continues to be a barri er and challenge in the Spanish speaking community and many do not seek out services. Current FY 16-17: Due to the ongoing increase of the Latino community and lack of Spanish speaking providers in Southern Alameda County, we project an increase of request of services of 5 to 10% a year. This is based on previous year's trends. For FY 16/17 we expect to serve 112 clients. Since July of this year, La Familia started an In Home Outreach Team (IHOT). So linkages and referrals are occurring between this ACCESS progr am and IHOT. They already have one IHOT case who has been open in t heir ACCESS Program. For upcoming FY 17-18: For FY 17/18 we estimate to serve 129 clie nts. No planned changes to the program. Alameda County MHSA FY16-17 Plan Update P. 81 Send comments to mhsa@acbhcs.orgB.

TAY Wellness Resource Center at Youth Uprising Program Description: The TAY Wellness program at Youth Uprising consists of a team of 2 full time mental health clinicians, a mental health intake intern and H&W director. Under the MHSA Wellness contract, these clinicians provided indi vidual, family and group therapy services to TAY ages 13-24, prioritizing uninsur ed TAY between the ages of 16-24. In addition to therapy support the Wellness team supports TAY around basic needs including housing, food and shelter to minimize barriers to therapy engagement associated with these needs. YU Wellness Programs employs innovative approaches to build relationshi ps and offer mental health services packaged as mentoring, arts, recreation, educ ation and simply meeting basic needs. This approach to service delivery result in a broad definit ions of \"client\" and \"engaged\" which allows Wellness services to be delivered to TAY who may not be ready to engage in traditional weekly therapy services. For previous FY 14-15 Current Strengths: Triple C: \" Cool Calm Collective\" Group is YU's alternative to \"Anger Management\". Therapist, Aaron Smith engages TAY in group activiti es around mood management, positive coping and mindfulness. Triple C is offered year round.

This is a relatively new position on the wellness team. This position was added to increase efficiency with referral triage and reducing wait time between referral for service and service c ontact. The current intern is a YU alumni, who is currently in a psychology doctorate program. She is bili ngual and increases program capacity to engage monolingual parents. Current Challenges Staff Vacancy TAY Wellness program is currently understaffed due to a clinician departure in December 2013. The vacancy has been posted. Interviews were conducted and an offer was made to a qualified candidate in February, After some delay, that candidate declined the offer of employment. We are still searching for a qualified clin ician, with priority of adding Spanish language capacity to the wellness team. Group referrals. Only on occasion, have received external referrals for group services. For example, group homes or probation officers will refer TAY for gr oup supports, who are not already engaged in YU Services. Group offers rarely reach full capaci ty and could use an increase of referrals from sources external to YU programming.
