WOODEN & BAMBOO KITCHEN UTENSILS Wooden utensils have had a place in home kitchens long before plastics and harmful chemicals. It's the perfect material when you're looking for a chemical-free, non-toxic solution in the kitchen. Plus, wooden tools can last a lifetime, and even be passed down from generation to generation, if handled properly. Using your grandma's old wooden spoon can add even more love and appreciation to cooking. Wooden utensils work with all types of pots and pans, including cast iron, ceramic and even nonstick, making them versatile and practical. It is also useful to have a variety of wooden utensils of different shapes and sizes. The more you use it, the more you'll find that certain shapes of wooden spoons are better for mixing cake batter, while others are great for stirring risotto to make sure you can get to the edge of the pan. Common woods used for quality utensils tend to be beech, teak and fine olive wood. Tools carved and hand-carved from a single piece of wood are more expensive, but can be unique. Inexpensive utensils are often made of pine or other cheap untreated woods that can split, snap, or stain over time. Bamboo is becoming more and more popular in the kitchen. Often considered more environmentally friendly than traditional wood, bamboo grows rapidly and can be replanted and regenerated at a faster rate than felling large teak and beech trees. Bamboo is also a stronger material that is less likely to break or splinter, and when cared for it will last as long as traditional wooden tools, if not longer.

Glass I love using glass for casseroles because glass retains heat better than metal and is one of the easiest cookware materials to clean. I find this especially helpful during the holidays since I'm cooking my annual family dinner and I'm making a multi-course meal. Cons: It's glass. So handle with care. Drastic temperature changes can cause your bakeware to shatter, so let the dishes cool down before putting them in the freezer. 3. Stainless steel Stainless steel is an excellent choice for cooking and baking because it is durable and non-reactive. As long as the pots and pans you're using are made of high-quality stainless steel, you won't experience any nickel and chrome leaching - something to consider when shopping for a low-priced set. Stainless steel cookware is an easier material to keep and maintain, and you can get a quality, non-toxic cookware set at a more affordable price. When cooking, heat the pan first, then add cold oil to avoid sticking to the pan. When baking, don't forget to grease your pans to prevent sticking, or use my favorite parchment paper to line pans and baking sheets. 4. Copper While copper cookware is a major investment, it's worth every penny. Compared to stainless steel, copper heats up faster and cooks more evenly, allowing you to better regulate the temperature and reduce the chance of overcooking or burning your food. Copper pans also keep warm longer. How is the copper we know and love today different from our grandmother's copper? They are lined with stainless steel. Tip: If copper pans are feeling like a splurge right now, add them to your wish list or special occasion registry. I put the two copper sets below on my wedding registry and received both! One set belonged to my mother and the other belonged to my father-in-law. Fraction! 5. Cast iron Cast iron is durable and another kitchen investment you shouldn't shy away from. I'm a firm believer that every home should own at least one cast iron skillet. There are countless benefits to cooking with cast iron cookware, such as even heat distribution, incredible heat retention, and simple cooking. On some nights, cleanup requires only a quick wipe with a damp or oiled rag. When properly seasoned, your cast iron skillet is naturally nonstick. Plus, the more you use it, the better it gets.
