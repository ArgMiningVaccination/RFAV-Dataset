Read on for more of what you can expect from San Diego assisted living communities. Variety of senior care options on one campus Many of San Diego's assisted living facilities offer multiple senior care services in a single location. Some facilities offer on-site memory care, some exist within an independent living community, and others offer a full range of services. Many assisted living communities even offer on-site therapies, like physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Facilities with all care types on one campus are sometimes called Continuing Care Retirement Communities (or CCRCs). It's worth noting that assisted living facilities licensed as CCRCs usually have an initial buy-in fee in addition to the monthly cost of room, board, and care services. Whether licensed as a CCRC or not, assisted living communities that offer multiple levels of care on one campus enable seniors to age in place worry-free. Seniors who choose these facilities can rest assured their evolving needs will be met, and they will never have to move again if their care needs change. Senior-specific activities and resort-style amenities Seniors who choose assisted living facilities in San Diego are set up to enjoy all that the city and their new lifestyle have to offer. Activities both within and outside of the community, such as fitness classes, volunteer programs, and live on-site entertainment, make for enriching social experiences. Visits to local museums, outings to sunny beaches, and lively tours of SeaWorld San Diego also await residents who want to maximize each moment. Luxe amenities are also found in many of San Diego's assisted living communities. Residents can enjoy on-site fine dining experiences, including full table service in community restaurants with meals crafted by professional culinary chefs. Many also have full service on-site salons, therapy spas, and fitness centers equipped to help seniors maintain optimum levels of health and wellness. Other desirable, high-end amenities found in San Diego's assisted living facilities include heated swimming pools, pristine walking trails, cozy movie theaters, and convenient concierge services. Ocean views and beachfront access Perhaps the most iconic features of San Diego are its many beaches. Seniors will find several assisted living communities that take advantage of this idyllic landscape by providing ocean views, pools, and short walking paths to the nearest sandy beaches. Some even offer exclusive, private beach access and rooftop decks overlooking the ocean. These unique features of the San Diego assisted living lifestyle allow residents to soak up the California sunshine and relax to the sound of the crashing waves, all while receiving care in the community of their choice.
