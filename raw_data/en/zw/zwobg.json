As of August 2013, about 90% of managed care eligible beneficiaries have received services through the managed care program. New Jersey expanded its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act effec tive January 1, 2014. This allow s New J ersey to cover childless adults and parents up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). We anticipate that an additional 300,000 people will enroll in Medicaid and CHIP (Children's Health Improvement Plans) . Managed care promotes preventive care, prov ides care manageme nt services and enables clients to receive coordinated care from a network of diverse providers. The provisions in the managed care contract are aimed at ensuring that enrollees have access to high quality and equitable health care that is patient -centered, culturally competent, and cost -effective and promotes optimal health outcomes. Through collaborations in quality initiatives and monitoring compliance with requirements and standards , DMAHS works cooperatively with contracted Managed Care Organizations ( MCO s) and other stakeholders to promote improvements in care. In compliance with 42 CFR 438.202, the following New Jersey Quality Strategy incorporates the required activities for a comprehensive written strategy for monitoring , asses sing and improving the quality of managed care services offered by all contracted N ew Jersey FamilyCare /Medicaid (NJFC) /M MCO s, as well as the State -contracted Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D -SNPs). Initially, Managed Long Term S ervice s and S upport s (MLTSS) will be offered to eligible members under the NJFC/M Contract. Planning for the implementation of D -SNP MLTSS with a target date of 2015 is underway. New Jersey will seek the input of enrollees , advocacy groups and other stakeholders in the devel opment of the strategy through the Medical Assistance Advisory Committee (MAAC) and the Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) Steering Committee and make it available for public comment before adopted. The MLTSS Steering Committee is comprised o f 15 participants of the Medicaid Long Term Care Funding Advisory Council of New Jersey, managed care organizations and various consumers. The MAAC is comprised of beneficiaries, consumer advocates and providers and i s open to the public at large. These committees serve as the mechanism by which the State obtains the input of the beneficiaries and other stakeholders in the development of the quality strategy , pursuant to 42 CFR 438.202(b) . 42 CFR 438.202 State Responsibilities Each State contracting w ith an MCO or PIHP must do the following: (b) Obtain the input of recipients and other stakeholders in the development of the strategy and make the strategy available for public comment before adopting it in final. 6 The quality strategy ensures that the MCO s comply with all standards established by the NJ DMAHS that are consistent with 42 CFR 438 . The State will conduct periodic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the quality strategy and update it as needed, whenever a significant change has been m ade, as well as provide regular reports on its implementation and effectiveness . For additional information regarding N ew Jersey DMAHS adherence to 42 CFR 438 et seq., refer to Appendix E. Outreach and education about Medicaid managed care continue s in a ll 21 counties through the State's contracted Health Benefits Coordinator (HBC). Members covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) , as well as individuals with special needs and children in foster care are mandated to enroll in managed care. All members, including NJFC/M, D -SNP and MLTSS, will receive written information regarding their appeal and fair hearing rights, upon enrollment into the MCO, and whenever they receive a denial of service or denial of authorization of service. The New Jersey Comprehensive 1115 Medicaid Waiver was approved in October 2012. Implementation of the MLTSS Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) and Nursing Facility (NF) services for new MLTSS members will begin in July 2014. In February 2014, New Je rsey has made the decision that all current nursing facility residents will remain in the fee -for-service program for life and all current special care nursing facility residents will remain in the fee -for-service program for two years. Special care nursi ng facilities are those that provide services to Ventilator, Traumatic Brain/Injury/Coma, Pediatric, HIV (AIDS ), and Neurologically Impaired, young Adult/Huntington's Disease, and Behavioral Management patients . Under this demonstration, New Jersey will o perate a statewide health reform effort that will expand existing managed care programs to include managed long term services and supports (MLTSS) and expand home and community based services to some populations. The 1115 combines, under a single demonstr ation, authority for several existing Medicaid and CHIP waivers and demonstration programs, including: Two Section 1915 (b) Managed Care waiver programs ; Four 1915(c) Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waivers; and Title XIX Medicaid and Title XXI CH IP section 1115 demonstrations. The Comprehensive Waiver also provides additional in -home community supports for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities ; as well as , needed services and additional HCBS supports for children diagnosed with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) , Persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and children with intellectual disabilities with co -occurring mental illness. These programs are administered by the Department of Children (DCF) and Families and the DH S Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD ) and the services are provided through Medicaid fee - for-service. A separate quality strategy will be developed for these populations while aligning with the principles outlined in this strategy. 7 The strategy supports and promotes compliance with Contract requirements that are consistent with federal and State standards. The quality strategy is examined at least annually and updated as need ed based on findings and trends identified through the State's monitori ng activities. All contracted MCOs fall under this Quality Strategy. The strategy complements and aligns with New Jersey's quality strategies for its Programs of All - Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) as well as programs that serve the developmenta lly disabled and intellectually disabled populations. NEW JERSEY DMAHS QUA LITY STRATEGY VISION The right care and supports, for every person, every time, in the appropriate setting that ensures members have access to quality, equitable, p erson -centered, c ulturally -competent and cost -effective care that results in optimal outcomes , including maximum independence and quality of life. GOALS, VALUES AND GU IDING PRINCIPLES GOALS To implement our vision, N ew Jersey has focused on providing all of our members with quality care and services through increased access and appropriate, timely utilization of health care services . These goals guide the program in direction and scope . Goal 1: To improve timely , appropriate access to primary , preventive , and long ter m services and supports for adults and children; Goal 2: To improve the quality of care and services; Goal 3 : To promote p erson -centered health care and social services and supports ; Goal 4: To assure member satisfaction with services and improve qua lity of life . GUIDING VALUES OR PRINCIPLES New Jersey seeks to achieve excellenc e through continuous quality improvement activities; The quality strategy affirms the importance of State oversight to ensure the delivery of high quality, person and family centered, cost effective care for older adults and people with disabilities; The quality strategy uses a multi -discip linary, collaborative approach to identify, assess, measure and evaluate the access, timeliness, availability, level of care and c linical effectiveness of care and services to NJ FC/M members ; Members are supported in taking responsibility for their own health and health care , including the opportunity to self-direct care where appropriate ; Members with institutional level of care needs have the right to choose the setting in which they will receive their services; 8 Providers are accountable for delivering quality services and programs in compliance with federal and State law and regulations; Collaboration among community, State, professional , and advocacy groups creates opportunities to identify and initiate valuable quality improvement activities ; Access to care and services will be equitable; Cultural sensitivity is an essential element in providing quality services to a diverse population and decreasing disparities; Forums for communication that promote an open exchange of ideas while maintaining privacy guidelines, are useful for the identification of issues and to indicate where quality improveme nt activities may be beneficial . QUALITY STRATEGY OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE New Jersey has a consistent and coordinated framework via overarching interagency authority and oversight to deliver timely, appropriate quality health care across all populations, including those members needing MLTSS service s. While there are several State agencies involved in the administration of the HCBS, the DMAHS will maintain authority over the programs and will exercise the appropriate monitoring and oversight. OFFICE OF QUALITY AS SURANCE AND THE EXTE RNAL QUALITY REVI EW ORGANIZATION The OQA meets biweekly with the Island Peer Review Organization (IPRO) as the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) to discuss the status of the quality projects as well as any issues identified. The DMAHS OQA reviews quality and mon itoring reports submitted by the MCOs and the EQRO . Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) performance measures will be received and reviewed by Division of Aging Services (DoAS) and Division of Disability Services (DDS). Specifically, the DoAS will receive and review from the MCOs those MLTSS performance measures related to Level of Care (LOC) and the DDS will receive and review the self-direction data. The DoAS and the DDS will communicate their findings to the OQA -MLTSS unit . INTERNAL QUALITY COMMITTEE (I QC) The Internal Quality Committee, consisting of the Medicaid Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Directors, Office of Managed Health Care (OMHC) , Director s of OQA and OQA -MLTSS will meet on a monthly basis to discuss their analyses of the NJMF/M quality and monitoring reports received, including those related to MLTSS activities and critical incidents. OMHC, DoAS and DDS also will attend the monthly Quality Committee. The Internal Quality Committee will recommend feedback to the MCOs and corrective actions will be requested when necessary . On a quarterly basis, the Internal Quality Committee will make recommendation s to the Interdivisional/Interdepartmental Quality Leadership Conference. 9 INTERDIVISIONAL/INTE RDEPARTMENTAL QUALIT Y LEADERSHIP CONFERE NCE (IQLC) The consist ing of DMAHS OQA; OQA -MLTSS unit; Office of the Chief of ; OMHC; DoAS; DDS; Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD); Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) ; and Department of Children and Families (DCF) will meet quarterly to review the findings and recommendations identified by the IQC during its review of the NJFC/M reports and projects , including those related to MLTSS . The Quality Leadership Co nference will report its findings to the Director of Medicaid including a dashboard of metrics related to the quality and monitoring reports and projects, such as: Performance Measures, Quality Improvement Projects, Critical Incidents, MLTSS Measures and the status of any outstand ing MCO corrective action plans. The Medicaid Director will advise the Quality Leadership Conference of any further action to be taken and in turn the Quality Leadership Conference will advise the Quality Committee. The Quality Leadership Conference will provide an opportunity for dialogue, exchange of information, identification of best practices, discussion of strategies for continuous quality and performance improvement, development of remediation strategies and feedback to participating agencies and pr ogram staff. INVOLVEMENT OF STAKE HOLDERS IN QUALITY M ANAGEMENT The Medicaid Director will report pertinent information regarding NJFC/M quality and access issues , including those related to MLTSS, to the Medical Assistance Advisory Committee (MAAC) on a qu arterly basis. With regard to MLTSS, the Director of the Division of Aging Services and the Director of Medical Assistance and Health Services will report on quality and access issues to the MLTSS Steering Committee . MCO INVOLVEMENT Currently, DMAHS conv enes various meetings with the MCOs that afford them the opportunity to discuss quality matters . These meeting s include: Quarterly Medical Director 's meeting; Managed Care Operations meeting; Care Management meeting; Quarterly Medicaid Director's meeting ; MLTSS Steering Committee and the MAAC , as well as ad hoc teleconferences with the EQRO. MLTSS TRANSITION OVE RSIGHT Prior to the transition into the Comprehensive Waiver, DoAS will conduct pre -transition calls with the MCOs and the Care Management Agenc ies to ensure that the ir lines of communication are established and functioning . There will be a dedicated point person located at DoAS who will relay pertinent information to the OQA -MLTSS unit. To ensure a smooth transition of members from the 1915 C waivers to MLTSS under Managed Care and the expansion of Medicaid eligibility , the DMAHS OMHC , together with the OQA -MLTSS unit will convene a daily Quality Leadership conference call jointly with all of the health plans during the first two weeks after MLTSS go-live, during which time the MCOs will be asked to report concerns and corrective actions to ameliorate them. Thereafter, the State will assess the possibility of decreasing the frequency of meetings to biweekly during the remainder of the first 30 day s of MLTSS implementation. The Quality Leadership 10 Conference will determine the schedule of conference calls beyond the first 30 days. The frequency of meetings during the second month will be based on the Conference 's findings from the previous month. COLLABORATION ON QUA LITY WITH CMS The State will participate in monthly monitoring call s with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to discuss any significant actual o r anticipated issues affecting the Comprehensive Waiver. 11 12 OBJECTIVES Health y New Jersey 2020 is the NJ Department of Health (NJ DOH) health improvement plan and health promotion and disease prevention agenda for the decade. It is modeled after the federal Healthy People 2020 initiative and is the result of a multiyear process th at reflects input from a diverse group of individuals and organizations. It seeks to attain high -quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death; achieve health equity, eliminate disparities and improve health fo r all people; and promote quality of life, healthy development and healthy behaviors across all life stages. In an effort to align our priorities with the NJ DOH Health y New Jersey 2020 , NJ DMAHS has established the following objectives to advance improvem ent in priority areas . New Jersey proposes to have the following rates , listed below , increase by 1-2 percentage point s per year over 5 years . Please see Table 1 - Dashboards of Quality Strategy Objectives in the Improvement section.

HEALTH INFORMATION T ECHNOLOGY DMAHS recognizes the critical role of health information technology (HIT) as a transformation enabler. Current deficiencies in health system integration arising from information silos have impeded care coordination and resulted in duplication of services, medical errors and administrative inefficiencies. DMAHS continues to explore and implement initiatives that will promote health information exchange (HIE), adoption of interoperable electronic health records (EHR) and use of technology tools that will lead to improved program/population management and integrated chronic care management. Key strategies in promoting quality improvement are the assessment and design of New Jersey's Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) and the Master Client Index (MCI) Project. The MITA ass essment is in progress. The MCI Project is currently under development. The MCI is the foundation for accurate data exchange between NJ Medicaid and its partner agencies. The three participating source systems for the MCI project are the NJ MMIS databas e, N ew Jersey Department of Health (DOH) Immunization Registry and the NJ DOH Lead Registry. The MCI will provide the identity management necessary to associate data that resides in Medicaid, Immunization and Blood Lead Screening databases for the same pe rson where the person demographics lack 100% consistency with regard to format and content. The MCI is used to cross - reference client identifiers across each participating information system to uniquely identify each client, perform global searches and mat ching, consolidate duplicate client records, and create complete views of client information and share data easily across multiple facilities and information systems. DMAHS envisions that these initiatives will facilitate the flow of enrollee -centered hea lth information to improve quality, patient safety and cost -effectiveness of health programs. 14 ASSESSMENT A. QUALITY AND APPRO PRIATENESS OF CARE A ND SERVICES EXTERNAL QUALITY REV IEW ACTIVITIES DMAHS is responsible for ensuring that Medicaid MCO s meet qual ity and compliance standards. As part of this process and in accordance with the requirements of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), DMAHS currently contracts with Island Peer Review Organization (IPRO ) as the External Quality Review Organ ization (EQRO) for DMAHS.

The State must make this information available in alternative formats for persons with sensory impairments, when requested. (c) Safeguarding patient identity. The information release d under paragraph (b) of this section may not disclose the identity of any patient. Clinical Sta ndards/Guidelines Per Goal s 1 through 4, each year, contracted MCO s are required to submit an annual work plan that includes a schedule of clinical standards to be developed, medical care evaluations and other key quality assurance activities to be comple ted. The guidelines must meet the requirements of 42 CFR 438.236 for the management of selected diagnoses and basic health maintenance ; be based on valid and reliable clinical evidence or a consensus of health care professionals in a particular field; tak e into consideration the needs of the contractor's enrollees ; and be updated in consultation with contracting health care professionals . All standards, protocols and guidelines are to be reviewed and updated periodically, as appropriate , and must be distributed to all providers and upon request to enrollees or potential enrollees . MCO decisions regarding utilization management, member education, coverage of services, etc . must be consistent with these guidelines. In addition, MCO s are required to have pr ocedures for monitoring the quality and adequacy of medical care including assessing the use of distributed guidelines and assessing possible under -treatment/under -utilization of services. Data on Race, Ethnicity and Primary Language Per Goal s 2 and 3 , each MCO is provided with the race/ethnicity and the primary language spoken of their enrollees via the Plan Selection Form that is processed by the Health Benefits Coordinator (HBC). The Contract requires MCO s to have Member Services staff that include s individuals who speak English, Spanish and any other language that is spoken as a primary language by a population that exceeds five (5) percent of the MCO 's enrollees or two hundred (200) enrollees in the contractor's plan, whichever is greater. Additio nally, the MCO provider networks must include providers who can accommodate the different languages of the enrollees. If the language and/or cultural needs of an enrollee are known to the MCO and the MCO has not received information on the enrollee's sele cted Primary Care Physician ( PCP), the MCO is expected to assign the enrollee to a PCP who is or has office staff who are linguistically and culturally competent to communicate with the enrollee or have the ability to interpret in the provision of health care services and related activities during the enrollee's office visits or contacts. Article 5.14 of the managed care contract details the requirements for the provision of culturally competent services.

QUALITY AND MONITORI NG IMPROVEMENT ACTIV ITIES ASSESSMENT OF MCO OPERATIONS Frequency: Annual Description: The EQRO conducts an annual assessment of MCO operations that includes a review of po licies and procedures and their implementation. The assessment may comprise an offsite and onsite review to determine MCO compliance with State and federal Medicaid managed care regulations, including adherence to and effectiveness of individual MCO Quali ty Assurance Programs (QAP). The assessment is designed to validate, quantify and monitor the quality of each MCO 's structure, processes and outcomes. The time period under review is the 12 months prior to the visit. Each review element will be evalua ted on a three -tiered scoring system. The finding of each element will be one of the following: Met - all requirements within the element are in full compliance 19 Not Met - not all of the requirements within the element are in full compliance N/A - the requirement is not applicable to the MCO being reviewed Year 1, considered the baseline year, involve s a comprehensive review of all requirements for all MCO s. Any MCO s with a compliance rate under 85% must undergo a comprehensive review of all requireme nts in the succeeding year. MCO s with a compliance rate of 85% or better would be subject to only an interim review focusing on areas needing improvement; specifically, those review elements that were Not Met or Not Applicable during the comprehensive rev iew. All MLTSS - related elements will be reviewed annually for the first several years after the implementation of the Comprehensive Waiver, however, to ensure program compliance before being considered eligible for interim review. MCO s that perform well in Year 1 , and therefore , have an interim review in Year 2 would have a full review in Year 3 regardless of the findings of the interim review. The MCO s that receive a full review in Year 2 and subsequently had a compliance rating of 85% or better would h ave an interim review in Year 3. MCO s that continue to receive a compliance rating below 85% would continue to have comprehensive reviews. MCO s have to provide a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) within 45 days of receiving the report to address elements that were not met in the Annual Assessment. The corrective actions are monitored by the OQA. The annual assessment is separated into 1 3 sections by category, as follows: Access Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Quality Management Committee Stru cture Programs for the Elderly and Disabled Provider Training and Performance Satisfaction Enrollee Rights and Responsibilities Care Management and Continuity of Care Credentialing and Recredentialing Utilization Management Administration and Operations Management Information Systems The review explores each MCO 's operations in order to determine whether: Quality of care and services provided enrollees meet professionally recognized standards; Services are rendered in the appropriate setting and are acc essible and timely; Services are appropriate for individual patient needs; Services are provided in accordance with MCO contract and federal and State requirements; There is a potential for under - or over -treatment and/o r under - or over -utilization of services; There are disparities in the delivery of healthcare services. 20 The Annual Assessment of MCO Operations addresses Goals 1 -4 and is designed to show trends, best practices, deficiencies, other areas of concern and opportunities for improvement cov ering all areas of the assessment. The analysis will reflec t: An accurate and reliable description of the care delivered to NJFC /M clients ; A clear identification of instances in which care can be improved and a baseline for future assessments to determin e whether care has been improved ; Priority attention to clinical conditions and health services delivery issues that have the greatest prevalence and incidence, potential for improving health outcomes and possible impact on care ; Discussion of how the MCO is identifying and addressing disparities in health care outcomes ; and A focus on how the MCO evaluates outcomes for its initiatives .

The OQA reviews documentation provided by the MCO on their efforts to educate these providers and how impediments to the screening are addressed annually . This activity addresses Goals 1 and 2. 6. MCO Care for Persons with Disabilities and the Elderly and Initiatives for the Aged Frequency: Annual Description: The MCO Quality Department must promote improved clinical outcomes and enhanced quality of life for elderly enrollees and enrollees with disabilities. This must include: oversight of quality of life indicators, such as: degree of personal autonomy; provision of services and supports that assist people in exercising medical and social choices; self -direction of care t o the greatest extent appropriate; and maximum use of natural support networks. Additionally, the MCO must review: persistent or significant compla ints; quality assurance policies and procedures to ensure that they adequately address the needs of this population; and utilization of services, including any adverse or unexpected outcomes. Annually, using professional standards of practice, t he MCO must: develop written policies and procedures for assessing the quality of complex healthcare/care management; ensur e MCO compliance with the American with Disabilities Act; institut e effective health 36 management protocols for the elderly and disabled enrollee s; and test methods to identify and collect quality measurements, including treatment efficacy related to elderly and disabled populations. Annually, using professional standards of practice, the MCO s are required to implement initiatives tailored for the aged members through the development of programs and protocols approved by New Jersey DMAHS. Specifically, the MCO s must develop program s for the elderly that include: pneumococcal and influenza vaccines; programs for preventive cancer , diabetes, heart disease , depression; cognitive impairments; and initiatives to prevent long term institutionalization; abuse and neglect. These initiatives must include: development, distribution and measurement of PCP compliance with practice guidelin es; educational outreach to members and providers; and access to ambulatory and homebound. If deficiencies or issues are identified by the EQRO, the MCO has 45 days from the date of notification to take appropriate action and document the remedial action. The MCO s are required to monitor and evaluate enrollee outcomes at least annually in the following areas: aspiration pneumonia; injuries; fractures and contusions, decubiti and seizure management. Compliance with these required activities is revie wed by the EQRO during the Annual Assessment of MCO Operations. This activity addresses Goals 1 and 2. DATA ANALYSIS 1. Grievance and Appeals Frequency: Quarterly Description: MCO s are contractually required to submit electronically, using a predefined reporting format, utilization management (UM) and non -UM enrollee complaints, grievance/appeal requests and provider complaints, grievances/appeals and dispositions on a quarterly basis. The reports include information for the reporting quarter and all op en cases to date and indicate the enrollee's name, NJFC /M ID number, date of birth, age, eligibility , category of complaint , as well as the date of the complaints, grievance/appeal, resolution and date of resolution. Complaint, g rievance and appeal catego ries have been standardized to mirror the categories used by the Department of Banking and Insurance (DOBI) . Additional managed long term services and supports categories will be added to the existing member UM, and non -UM reports and provider reports to ensure that these issues are tracked and trended correctly, so that appropriate action can be taken by the State when necessary . The data is archived in database format with basic descriptive statistics generated by reporting period. Individual grievance s are monitored by OQA and OQA -MLTSS for appropriate and timely resolutions. Work plans addressing any outliers will be requested of MCO s as necessary . This activity addresses Goals 1, 2 and 4. 2. Member and Provider Complaints 37 Frequency: Quarterly Descri ption: The OQA and OQA -MLTSS addresses member complaints and provider access to care issues that are received as Director Referrals, written correspondence, NJ FC/M Hotline complaints and telephone inquiries. Member and provider complaints regarding access and quality are tracked in a database that is queried on a quarterly basis with descriptive results detailed in a report each quarter. Analysis of patterns and trends is conducted by the OQA . In April 2009, the OQA in conjunction with the Office of Info rmation Systems (OIS) implemented a new database to track and trend complaints received by the OQA. This data base also has the capability to identify which complaints have been made by MLTSS members, special needs members , duals and those impacted by the managed care transition. This activity addresses Goals 1, 2 and 4. 3. Ratio of Prior Authorizations Denied to Requested Frequency: Quarterly Description: MCO s are required to submit this report on a quarterly basis. The OQA staff evaluates high percent ages of denials based on the number of authorizations requested for areas that stand out as unusual. The MCO is required to provide an explanation for these outliers. Any unacceptable explanations may result in a NOD and request for Corrective Action Plan (CAP) may be issued to the MCO. As of the first quarter of 2009, the report was changed to reflect more accurately the total number of Prior Authorizations (PA) \"resolved,\" not only those denied , as was previously reported. Failure to submit an effecti ve work plan may result in a Notice of Deficiency (NOD) and Request for Corrective Action Plan (CAP). Continued deficiency may result in a Notice of Intent to Sanction (NOIS) followed by a Notice of Sanction (NOS) if the MCO fails to appropriately remedy the issue. For more information regarding see the section of this document Level of Contract Compliance - Methods of Remediation that describes the process for issuing Sanctions. This activity addresses Goals 1, 2 and 4. SATISFACTION SURVEYS 1. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Frequency: Annual Description: The contracted vendor conducts the core Medicaid adult and child Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). The survey allows the State to deter mine the Medicaid 38 managed care populations' perceived satisfaction with the care they are receiving from their MCO s. It measures whether these beneficiaries are getting useful and accurate information from their health plan; whether the MCO is meeting thei r health care needs; whether medical services are being utilized; and ease of access to services. Based on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey Report, each MCO submits a CAP to address the areas which would benefit from improvements. This activity addresses Goa l 4. 2. Survey of New Enrollees Frequency: Quarterly Description: The MCO s are required to survey new enrollee s quarterly to determine enrollees understanding of the MCO 's processes and available services. If there are any gaps in understanding, the enro llee is re - educated by the MCO . Additionally, the MCOs use a language line if there is a language barrier. The reports are reviewed on an Ad Hoc basis. This activity addresses Goal 4. 3. Satisfact ion Survey of Participating Providers Frequency: Annual Description: Each MCO must conduct an annual satisfaction survey using a statistically valid sample of its participating providers who serve the DMAHS managed care enrollees and submit a copy of the survey instrument and methodology to DMAHS . It must incl ude at a minimum: questions that address provider opinions of the impact of the referral, prior authorization and provider processes on behalf of his/her practice/services; reimbursement methodologies; and care management assistance from the contractor. Additionally, the written report must include any corrective actions that need to be taken by the MCO as a result of the findings , timeframe in which the corrective action will be taken by the MCO and the recommended changes as needed for subsequent use. This activity addresses Goals 1 and 2. PERFORMANCE MEASUREM ENT 1. Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment ( EPSDT ) Frequency: Annual Description: 39 The managed care contract has set a performance standard for the delivery of EPSDT services. Enco unter data, lead screening data and HEDIS rates are used in ascertaining compliance to the standard. Under -performance results in the issuance of a Notice of Sanction (NOS) and request for a CAP. This activity addresses Goals 1 and 2. 2. External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) Reports Frequency: Annual Description: Quality Technical Report (QTR): Utilizing the results of existing reports, the EQRO conducts a comprehensive analysis and review of progress and areas of concern as they relate to the qua lity, access and timeliness of care to NJ FC/M enrollees. The MCOs must submit CAPs for any patterns of deficiency that have not already been addressed earlier in the year when OQA had received the individual reports. The report follows the Centers for Me dicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines for Annual Technical Reports. This annual report includes information from the current calendar year and prior 12 -month period. The findings of the comprehensive analysis along with relevant benchmarks and best practices guide recommendations for improvement. This activity addresses Goals 1 and 2. MONITORING OF TRANSI TIONED MEMBERS INTO MANAGED CARE From July 1, 2011, through October, 1 , 2011, approximately 150,000 Fee -for-Service beneficiaries were transitioned into the Managed Care program. These include d the ABD/DDD population and the dual eligible not already enrolled, individuals who were previously exempted from managed care and those enrolled in waiver programs. The transition was accomplished in several enrollment tiers over a four month period and resulted in Contract changes, including two new plan benefit services: Medical Day Care (MDC) and Personal Care Assistant (PC A) coverage for Plan A members; and the Managed Care Organizations ' (MCO s) coverage for most drugs for all enrollees, including DDD members. Atypical antipsychotic and anticonvulsant drugs ordered by a provider must be covered by the MCO . Formulary and p rior authorization requirements apply only when the initial medication tr eatment plan has been changed by the prescriber. Prior to the transition , the OQA planned and implemented a blueprint that was used as a means of written communication between DMAHS and each of the MCO s. The blueprint provided the venue for DMAHS to li st their expectations and for the MCO s to describe their plans to provide accessible, appropriate and timely quality health care to the members impacted by the transition. The complaints and inquiry phone lines were made available for any member or advo cate who ha d an issue with access or quality of care . The same day that the pertinent information was received by the OQA , the MCO was notified with request to resolve the issue . The MCO started working on the resolution the same day as it was received. If a recurring issue was identified, the OQA work ed 40 with the MCO to identify and fix the root cause. The timeframe for resolution varied, depending on the complexity of the complaint. The OQA continues to look for ways to enhance the complaint tracking system, including tracking the complaints of dual eligibles. Currently, the NJFC/M contract, which includes MLTSS population , requires the MCOs to gather data in a number of areas that directly impact dual eligible s: initiatives for the elderly that r equire the ongoing development of programs and protocols including a program to ensure provision of a pneumococcal vaccine and influenza immunizations; a program to ensure the provision of preventive cancer screenings; specific programs for the care of the enrollees identified with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension and depression; and a program to prevent unnecessary or inappropriate nursing facility admissions. These initiatives have been long -standing contract requirements that pre -date the MLTSS and will continue . The NJFC/M contract , including the MLTSS population, requires MCOs to monitor and evaluate enrollee outcomes at least annually in the following areas: aspiration pneumonia; injuries; fractures and contusions, decubiti and seizure management. This activity addresses Goals 1, 2 and 3. COMPREHENSIVE WAIVER MANAGED LONG TERM SE RVICES AND SUPPORTS The New Jersey Comprehensive 1115 Medicaid Waiver was approved by CMS in October 2012. Imple mentation of the Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) and Nursing Facility (NF) services for \"new-to-NF\" members will begin July 2014. Current NF residents will remain fee -for- service for the lifetime of their stay . Current special care NF (SCNF) residents will remain in fee - for-service for two years. (SCNFs are NFs offering a higher level of acuity of care ). Preparation and planning for the administration of Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) were addressed through a steering committee and four work groups (Assuring Access; Assessment to Appeals; Provider Transition ; and Quality and Monitoring). New Jersey's overall goal for MLTSS is to provide quality long term services and supports to individuals of all ages in the most integrated, appropriate setting. The State will build a cost -effective; and therefore, sustainable system to accomplish this goal. New Jersey convened a n MLTSS Steering Committee that was comprised of 15 participants of the Medicaid Long Term Care Funding Advisory C ouncil of New Jersey, managed care organizations and various consumers. The Medicaid Long Term Care Funding Council was established to monitor, assess and advise the commissioner on legislative matters and develop recommendations for a program to recruit and train a stable workforce of home care providers, including recommendations for changes to provider reimbursement under Medicaid home and community based care programs. The steering committee and the four work groups met over a three month period with various stakeholders to gather information to formulate recommendations. The work groups met at least bi -monthly and built a framework for discussion and learning. Stakeholders discussed best practices and information was shared with all work groups on a secure project site. The Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS) offered technical support and Mercer Government 41 Human Services Consulting (Mercer) provided ongoing policy and program development support. The following principles were developed by the steering committee and work groups: Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) is the preferred service delivery method for people receiving MLTSS; Consumer choice and participation in selecting service providers and living settings, to the maximum extent f easible, should be a priority of New Jersey's MLTSS; and Participation of all stakeholders is essential in the planning and implementation of MLTSS. Additionally, the State has contracted with Mercer to facilitate a n MLTSS work group to develop a standard ized MLTSS Care Management framework. The work group identified and discussed the necessary steps to achieve an effective system of providing MLTSS care management. Once the standard framework was established, the State included stakeholders in the proce ss to develop implementation strategies and refine contract language requirements. The State MLTSS work group continues to meet and consists of Mercer, DMAHS, Division of Developmental Disabilities, Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) , Division of Aging Services (DOAS) , and Division of Disability Services (DDS) staff. MLTSS - NURSING FACILITY LEV EL OF CARE ASSESSMEN T When there is a reasonable indication that a member may need MLTSS, a Nursing Facility (NF) level of care (LOC) assess ment must be conducted with the standardized functional assessment tool, \"NJ Choice \". For members newly enrolled in managed care, the State must conduct the LOC assessment; for all members already enrolled in managed care, the MCO must conduct the LOC assessment and forward it to the State for final approval for any member meeting Nursing Facility Level of Care. The timeframe for completing the LOC is within 30 days of the receipt of the referral . At least annually, a ll enrollees receiving MLTSS must be reevaluated by the MCO with final approval by the State . The MCO must not alter the fundamental nature of the NJ Choice tool when accommodating it to their electronic/database needs. The implementation of this activity addresses Goals 1 -4. MLTSS - PLAN OF CAR E All members receiving MLTSS (either HCBS or NF services), must have a plan of care (PoC) developed by the MCO that will demonstrate a person -centered, individualized, on -going strategy that focuses on the member's abilities, needs and preferences. It must take into consideration, the member's current and historical bio -psycho -social and medical needs as well as their level of functioning and support systems. The PoC must emphasize HCBS settings, maximizing health and safety. A back up plan must be developed and incorporated into the PoC to ensure that needed services will continue in the event that regular service providers are temporarily unavailable. During the development of the first PoC and its subsequent reviews and updates, the member wil l be informed of the services available, as well as their rights and responsibilities; and how to recognize and report abuse, neglect and exploitation. Additionally, areas around person -centered processes such as choice of living arrangement (community or nursing facility); self -direction; and setting person -centered goals will be addressed with the member during the PoC and a written copy of the 42 topics discussed and choices made will be given to the member. The MLTSS work group is developing timelines fo r quarterly plan of care reviews and when face -to-face meeting will be done in the home setting or at a location and time of the member's choice. The initial PoC and subsequent PoC reviews will be monitored through care management audits to ensure that th e member's assessed needs are addressed in type, scope, amount and frequency. The implementation of this activity addresses Goals 1 -4. MLTSS - SELF -DIRECTION Members who choose self -direction will have the opportunity to have choice and control over ho w PCA and Home Based Supportive Care services are provided and who provides the m. The services that the member receives through self -direction must be included in the calculations of the member's budget and must reflect the plan for purchasing these neede d services . The State - contracted Fiduciary Intermediary (FI) will help self -direct members with the financial aspects of the program. The FI handles all payroll responsibilities for participants and acts as a bookkeeping service. Self-direction is volunt ary and members may participate in or withdraw from self -direction at any time. Also, a member may be involuntarily disenrolled from the self -direction program if continued participation would not permit the member's health, safety or welfare need s to be met or the member consistently demonstrates the inability to self -direct. The implementation of this activity addresses Goals 3 -4. MLTSS - COST LIMITATIONS Members receiving MLTSS will receive cost -effective placement that most often will be in the commu nity environment. T ypically, t he cost limits will be aligned with the estimated cost associated with their nursing facility level of care assessment. Exceptions to the cost limit provision include: an enrollee is transitioning from institutional care to community -based services; an enrollee experiences a change in health condition that is expected to last no longer than six months; or an enrollee has unique needs for which the State determines an exception must be made to accommodate such needs. MCO fiscal reports demonstrating the expenditures for Home and Community Based Services and Nursing Facility services, per enrollee for MLTSS during a 12 month period as percentages of total MLTSS must be submitted annually to the State. The State also requires c omplete Medicaid Financial Reports from each MCO detailing HCBS and NF costs as required by the contract, as well as, monthly income statements by category of aid detailing: medical expenses, IBNR estimates, member months, and PMPM costs by category of ser vice. Should costs exceed limits as authorized by the State, discussions will take place between the State and the MCOs regarding contract costing, IBNR estimates, care management reviews, and actual vs. planned utilization to remediate the issue. MLTSS - MEMBER REPRESENTATIV E Each contracted MCO will designate a full -time MLTSS Member Representative who will be responsible for the internal representation of member's interests that include such things as: input 43 into planning and delivery of long term ser vices; participation in quality activities; assistance with program monitoring and evaluation; and provision of education to members, families and providers on issues related to the MLTSS program. Additionally , the MLTSS Member Representative will assist the MLTSS members in navigating the MCO's system, including: helping members understand and use the MCO's system; being a resource for the members; providing information; making referrals to appropriate MCO staff members; and facilitating resolution of an y issues. The MLTSS Member Representative will make recommendations to the MCO of any changes needed to improve the MCO's system for members receiving MLTSS and participate as an ex officio member of the MCO's Consumer Advisory Committee. MLTSS - PROVIDE R NETWORKS This demonstration will allow services to be delivered in the most integrated manner that offers the greatest selection of choice in settings of care; giving MLTSS members the flexibility to move from nursing facility to community placement. Th e MLTSS program offers its members accessible, on - going, conflict -free care management, coordination of care and assistance to meet their physical, behavioral, social and functional needs and has built -in monitoring to ensure that any assessed needs are me t in type, scope, amount and frequency. In this way, the MLTSS members will have the opportunity to actively participate in their community and workforce to the greatest extent possible. To ensure a successful shift in setting of care, New Jersey will mo nitor the MCOs' MLTSS provider networks and credentialing processes for adequacy and quality to make certain that the MLTSS members in the community have timely access to qualified providers in the appropriate settings. Access to a robust ancillary networ k, that can deliver such services as home modification or meal services, must be developed by July 1, 2014, and monitored in a manner similar to the current medical provider network. All MLTSS providers must be credentialed in accordance with 42 CFR 438.2 14. In the case of non -licensed or non -certified providers, the MCOs must develop credentialing mechanisms to address this requirement. HMOs must submit strategies to develop an adequate workforce providing MLTSS and describe the nature of their associat ed partnerships, including a process for implementing criminal background checks for all prospective employees/providers with direc t physical access to members . See Article 4.6.1.C of the NJFC/M Contract below. Moreover, MCOs must develop back up plans fo r community services like \"meals on wheels\", etc. to avoid a gap in service to our most vulnerable population for these vital services. NJFC/Medicaid Managed Care Contract 4.6.1.C. For MLTSS providers the Contractor shall: a. Have a credentialing/re -credentialing process meeting the requirements at 42 CFR 438.214, the requirements above, and the credentialing/re -credentialing requirements in Appendix B.4.14 Standard IX for each provider type or service available under MLTSS, including non - licensed/non -certified providers. b. Ensure that all providers who provide direct support and/or services to MLTSS Members have policies and procedures to demonstrate compliance with State requirements to have a pre - employment criminal history check and/or background inv estigation on all staff Members. c. Develop and implement a process to ensure all contracted providers conduct criminal background checks on all prospective employees/providers with direct physical access to MLTSS Members. i. Have a credentialing/re-credentialing process meeting the requirements at 42 CFR 438.214, the 44 requirements above, and the credentialing/re-credentialing requirements in Appendix B.4.14 Standard IX for each provider type or service available under MLTSS, including non - licensed/non -certified providers. ii. Ensure all providers who provide direct support and/or services to MLTSS members comply with State requirements to have a pre -employment criminal history check and/or background investigation on all staff members. MLTSS providers or those who provide services to MLTSS members who are required by state law or regulation to have criminal history background checks shall provide proof of the completion of the CHRI during credentialing process. iii. At minimum, have a re -credentialing pro cess for HCBS providers that shall include verification of continued licensure and/or certification (as applicable) and compliance with policies and procedures identified during credentialing, including criminal history background checks (CHRI). iv. At mi nimum verify monthly that each HCBS provider has not been excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid or NJFamilyCare programs. v. Develop and implement a policy and procedure, approved by the Office of Managed Health Care, to require all cont racted community based providers to certify in writing that they conduct effective, accurate and economical background checks on all prospective employees/providers expected to have direct physical access to MLTSS members. Providers who are required to hav e CHRI checks done as a condition of licensure by the State of NJ and are in good standing and submit documentation to the Contractor of same updated annually or in accord with the time frame established in governing statutes or regulations, shall be deter mined to have met the requirements for CHRI. vi. Ensure that providers who are non -licensed or non -credentialed or who do not have a governing statute to conduct CHRI background checks must undergo state CHRI through the NJ State Police using the Universa l Fingerprint form for Personal Record Review. vii. Have policies and procedures that ensure that no provider shall be permitted to provide any HCBS service with direct physical access to an MLTSS member until appropriate proofs and documentation are subm itted to the Contractor. This documentation shall be provided to the Contractor at credentialing and/or re -credentialing. viii. Requirements for frequency of updates, disqualifying offenses and rehabilitation to be adapted from law/regulation. ix. Shall not permit any providers or their employees or subcontractors to render direct support and/or services to MLTSS members absent such proof. x. Shall not be responsible for conducting CHRI checks, but are required to maintain documentary proof that CHRI che cks are done in compliance with State rule and the NJ FamilyCare MCO contract. xi. Follow state protocols for addressing exception requests for providers/their employees who fail a CHRI within state/federal law or statute. Additionally, the MCOs and th e State will establish and conduct universal MLTSS provider training, including written materials for nursing facilities, assisted living and HCBS providers to address, at a minimum : the credentialing processes ; service authorizations ; continuity of care ; community resources ; options counseling ; claims processes ; cultural competency ; and the responsibility of nursing facility and assisted living providers in the collection of patient payment liability and room and board. The MCOs will conduct provider trai ning with all new MLTSS providers an d on an ongoing basis as needed. 45 MLTSS - INTERAGENCY AUTHORIT Y AND OVERSIGHT New Jersey has a consistent and coordinated framework via overarching interagency authority and oversight to deliver timely, appropriate quali ty health care across all populations, including those members needing MLTSS services. While there are several State agencies involved in the administration of the HCBS, the DMAHS will maintain authority over the programs and will exercise the appropriate monitoring and oversight. The State will establish evidenced -based metrics that can be benchmarked whenever possible and will promote best practices and quality improvement. Data must be collected in a way that will facilitate its sharing across all agen cies responsible for the Medicaid population and to external stakeholders. New Jersey currently has quality measures related to the medical model; however, Measurement Year 2 community -social measures must be developed to track and trend the safety and we lfare of our members as well their degree of choice and satisfaction. MLTSS - EQRO AND STATE QUALITY MONITORING A CTIVITIES In addition to the existing NJFC/M Managed Care Contract requirements, a n MLTSS set of reporting requirements are developed and incl uded in the Contract. As a result, the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) will conduct one, unified set of mandatory external quality review activities outlined in 42 CFR438.358, including the Annual Assessment of Operations , Performance Measures and Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs) , that will review the quality of the NJFC/M plan and the requirements of the MLTSS program. The State is currently in consultation with its EQRO to develop a comprehensive set of MLTSS elements to add to the Annu al Assessment as well as appropriate Performance Measures and QIPs. The Annual Assessment of Operations and the Performance Measures are a way of assessing the MCO's quality of care . The QIPs are a means to bring about improvement. The State's rationale is to assess the performance measure results first to identify where the QIPs would have the greatest impact on improvement . In this way the MCOs, in consultation with the EQRO, will apply quality strategies based on data driven, cause/barrier analysis; using continual monitoring and modify interventions when warranted. This will provide a method to track and trend each MCO's progress with improving the members' health and level of functioning. The Annual Assessment of MCO Operations will be conducted i n 2015. Likewise, the MCOs will submit all quality reports to the State for review and approval ; incorporating MLTSS requirements into the existing quality reports (E.g. Annual Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI); quarterly grievance an d appeals reports, etc.) as well as any new MLTSS -specific requirements. The MCOs will be held to the requirements described i n 42 CFR 438 Subpart D et seq. regarding the availability of services, adequate capacity of services, coordination and continuity of care, coverage and authorization of services. For additional information regarding 42 CFR 438 Subpart D. et seq., refer to Appendix E. The implementation of these activities addresses Goals 1 -4. 46 MLTSS -SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES New Jersey's approach to qua lity assessment and improvement for the entire Medicaid managed care population is to use nationally recognized quality measures whenever possible and to establish performance benchmarks. At this time, however, there are no nationally recognized measures specifically designed for the MLTSS population. Instead, the State is developing MLTSS -specific measures and is consulting with its EQRO in the development of some modified HEDIS measures to include the MLTSS population. Since HEDIS uses a full year of d ata from the previous year, the earliest that the MLTSS -specific measures could be obtained would be HEDIS 2016 (using 2015 data). This activity will address Goals 1 -3. Annually, Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys are condu cted to assess the level of member satisfaction for available Medicaid services. At this time, a sample of the general population of Medicaid members and CHIPRA (Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009) members are surveyed using C AHPS. Additionally, the State is planning to use a Division of Aging Services survey to outreach the MLTSS population. In the future, the State may examine the feasibility of using a n MLTSS -specific survey. This activity will address Goal 4. The appropr iate quality monitoring and improvement activities required by the NJFC/M Contract, as well as the following MLTSS -specific reports will be necessary to address MLTSS requisites in Year 1 of the comprehensive waiver. The State is researching quality of li fe measures to be included in Year 2 and beyond. The implementation of these monitoring activities will address Goals 1 -4.

Quality of Life Measures to begin Year 2 Participant Satisfaction Measure Method Frequency Data Source Who Calculates CRITICAL INCIDENT RE PORTING Critical Incident Management Principles 1. All adults and children receiving MLTSS and Home and Community Based Services should be able to enjoy a quality of life that is free of abuse, n eglect and exploitation. 2. Responsible staff should receive initial and ongoing training to be competent to respond to, report and document incidents, in a timely and accurate manner. 3. Consumers, legal representatives and guardians must be made aware of and h ave available incident reporting processes . 4. Any individual, who in good faith, reports an incident or makes an allegation of abuse, neglect or exploitation will be free from any form of retaliation. 5. Quality starts with those who work most closely with pers ons receiving services. New Jersey Statute and Regulation New Jersey State statute and regulations require reporting abuse, neglect and exploitation. Additionally, New Jersey enacted \"Danielle's Law\" that requires a member of the staff at facilit ies for persons with developmental disabilities or persons with traumatic brain injury ; or a member of the staff at a public or private agency, who in either case works directly with persons with developmental disabilities or traumatic brain injury, shall be re quired to call the 911 emergency telephone service for assistance in the event of a life -threatening emergency at the facility or the public or private agency, and to report that call to the State. MCOs must take steps to educate MLTSS members, their fami ly members, if applicable and providers about how to identify and report abuse, neglect and exploitation, as well as , make their contracted providers aware of their legal responsibility to do so. See New Jersey regulations and Statute listed below. N.J.S.A. \u00a7 52:27D-409. Report of suspected abuse, neglect, exploitation a.

A person who reports information pursuant to this act, or provides information concerning the abuse of a vulnerable adult to the county adult protective services provider, or testifies at a grand jury, judicial or administrative proceeding resulting from the report, is immune from civil and criminal liability arising from the report, information, or test imony, unless the person acts in bad faith or with malicious purpose. d. An employer or any other person shall not take any discriminatory or retaliatory action against an individual who reports abuse, neglect or exploitation pursuant to this act. An empl oyer or any other person shall not discharge, demote or reduce the salary of an employee because the employee reported information in good faith pursuant to this act. A person who violates this subsection is liable for a fine of up to $ 1,000. e.

Critical incidents include but are not limited to: Missing person or Unable to Contact Unexpected death of a member; Missing person or Unable to Contact; Theft with law enforcement involvement; Severe injury or fall resulting in the need for medical treatment; Medical or psychiatric emergency, including suicide attempt; Medication error resulting in serious consequences; Inappropriate or unprofessional conduct by a provider/agency involving the member; Suspected or evidenced physical or mental Abuse, (including seclusion and restraints, both physical and chemical); Sexual abuse and/or suspected sexual abuse; Neglect/Mistre atment, including self -neglect, caregiver overwhelmed, environmental; Exploitation, including financial, theft, destruction of property; Failure of a member's back -up plan; Elopement/wandering from home or facility; Eviction/loss of home; Facility closur e, with direct impact to member's health and welfare; The potential for media involvement; Cancellation of utilities; Natural disaster, with direct impact to member's health and welfare; Other, Explain: Reporting Guideline s Any unexpected death or inc ident with media involvement or the potential for media involvement must be reported to the State by telephone the day the Contractor is notified; using the phone number listed on the Critical Incident Report, and an electronic report is to be submitted wi thin one business day. The Contractor shall submit a report to the State electronically regarding any critical incident listed in Article 9.10.1.D within one business day of detection or notification. Effective steps must be taken immediately to prevent further harm to or by the affected members. In addition to reporting individual incidents electronically within one business day , on a quarterly basis, the MCOs must submit a report to the State in a format approved by the State, describing the critical i ncident by: Member Original Medicaid Identification Number; Date of occurrence; Date the MCO first became aware of the incident; Type of incident; 64 Setting; Type of provider; Short description of the incident; Short description of the immediate actions t aken to protect/halt or ameliorate the harm; Numerator/denominator and % of critical incidents by incident type; and Numerator/denominator and % of members impacted. On an annual basis, the MCOs must submit to the State a summary reflecting their analysis of the critical incident trends, including a description of any policies/procedures that have been or will be changed/adopted to prevent similar incidents in the future; trainings held; and description provider corrective action plans requested. Critical incidents where there is a potential violation of criminal law must be reported to local law enforcement authorities. Also, critical incidents occurring in the NF setting should continue to be reported to the Department of Human Services (see contact information listed below). Department of Health The Nursing Facilities, Assisted Living Facilities, Personal Care Assistants and Medical Day Care Centers are required to report immediately suspected abuse, neglect and exploitation of members to the New Jerse y Department of Health at (609) 633 -8991 and (800) 792 -9770 after business hours, followed by written confirmation within 48 hours.

To file a complaint, call toll free: 1 -877-582-6995; or write the O ffice of the Ombudsman, P.O. Box 852, Trenton, NJ 08625 -0852. Law Enforcement and other State Investigations: The MCOs, their staff and contracted providers are required to cooperate with any investigation conducted by the State or law enforcement authori ties. Managed Care contracted providers : The MCO -contracted providers are required to submit to their MCO a written investigative report regarding the critical incidents as soon as possible but no later than 30 days. The MCO must review 65 the provider's in vestigative report to ensure that the appropriate investigation was conducted and corrective actions were taken within the applicable timeframes . Investigations The MCOs are responsible to conduct their own investigation and must have designated staff t o conduct critical incident investigations who: are adequately trained in how to conduct a critical incident investigation; are not nor have been directly responsible for the authorization of care or care of the member (care management); have sufficie nt authority to obtain information from those involved; and have clinical expertise to evaluate the adequacy of care provided relevant to the critical incident. The investigation must be completed within 30 days unless the findings or information neces sary for completion of the investigation cannot be ob tained within that time frame. In such cases, the investigation must be completed as soon as possible. The MCOs are responsible for identifying and addressing actual or potential quality of care and/or health and safety issues and ensuring that corrective actions are implemented. Note that the MCOs are not responsible for the investigation of critical incidents that occur in the NF setting ; however, they must ensure that they are reported to the proper authority . The MCOs must educate all staff members and contracted MLTSS providers who have any type of member contact, about how to recognize suspected/actual abuse, neglect or exploitation and how to report it and to whom. During the development of th e MLTSS Plan of Care, the members must be counseled on how to recognize suspected/actual abuse, neglect or exploitation and how to report it and to whom and the member is asked to sign that they have received such counseling . Additionally, the MCOs will b e required, as part of its regular monitoring, to track Critical Incident trends internally and develop a system of \"triggering off -cycle recredentialing\" where a pattern has been identified with a particular provider to take appropriate action and notify the State of the MCO's findings. The implementation of these activities addresses Goal s 2, 3 and 4. For the protocol for \"unable to contact\", please see Appendix B; for Contract information regarding critical incidents, please see Appe ndix D. BEHAVIOR AL HEALTH LONG TERM CARE SERVICES There are 100,000 patients discharged from hospitals to nursing facilities in New Jersey annually. All of these individuals and those moving from their home into a nursing facility require a Preadmission Screen and Reside nt Review (PASRR) Level 1 Screening for severe mental illness and or Intellectual Disabilities or Developmental Disabilities (I/DD). The individuals who screen positively for mental illness or (I/DD) require a Level 2 Screen. As of July 1, 2012, the MCO a re responsible for the Level 1 Screening and the State (Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services for mental health 66 and Division of Developmental Disabilities for I/DD) will continue to conduct the Level 2 Screenings to determine the member's Long T erm Care/Behavioral Health (LTC/BH) needs. All LTC individuals must be assessed in collaboration with the member, the member's family and all others involved with the member's care, including other agencies or systems. The strengths and needs of the memb er will be evaluated to determine the types and levels of care needed. Services must be provided in a manner that respects the member's and the family's cultural heritage and makes use of the member's natural supports in the community. As of J uly 1, 2014 , New Jersey will utilize its contracted MCOs to manage all the Medicaid services including home and community based services (HCBS), Nursing Facilities (NF) (for members new to NF) and Behavioral Health (BH) services for those members who qualify for MLTSS level of care. The State will establish specific criteria for the provision and coordination of behavioral health services, to include services that are: Least restrictive; Most integrated setting; and Appropriate to their needs. The contracted MCOs must establish a LTC BH Administrator who will be responsible for coordinating BH services: Across institutional and community settings; Collaborating with LTC and community providers; and the LTC case managers. Additionally, the MCOs must have BH staff who, at a minimum, must have experience in behavioral health care and who will coordinate services with the BH LTC case managers for LTC, acute care and BH , including the ASO. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS O Before the implementation of the Comprehensi ve Waiver, the DDD managed care members received their behavioral health services through the MCO in which they were enrolled. All other managed care members and Fee for Service ( FFS) beneficiaries received their behavioral health services as a FFS carve -out. Formerly, determination of eligibility was completed by the Division of Developmental Disabilities for th ose with Intellectual and other Developmental Disabilities ( I/DD ) population. As of January 1, 2013, the Division of Children's System of Care ( CSOC) under the Department of Children and Families, determines eligibility for developmental services administered by their Administrative Service Organization (ASO), Perform Care. Children and adolescents up to age of 21 years with emotional, developmen tal and behavioral health care issues and their families may be eligible for services that include community -based, in -home, out -of-home residential and family support services. 67 Individual s with I/DD/MI who are 21 years and older and not enrolled in MLT SS will receive their behavioral health services under a DMAHS -contracted Administrative Services Organization (ASO). The Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) and various stakeholders were consulted for their input in the development of the RFP fo r the ASO . The ASO will be responsible for the management of all BH Medicaid covered services and most of the state only funded BH services. When the ASO goes live, it is expected that the ASO and the MCO will coordinate care for individual's transitionin g to and from MLTSS into the ASO. As outlined in the Standard Terms and Conditions, the ASO will be responsible for the following functions: 24/7 call center, member services, screening and assessment, prior authorization, network management, utilizati on management, care management, care coordination, quality management, information technology, data submission and reporting requirements, financial management, development of care models and coordination with MCOs. The ASO will have quality and performan ce measures that are specific to BH and will be defined in the RFP and subsequent ASO contract. In addition to the ASO, the Medicaid Comprehensive Wa iver allows for the provision of Beh avioral Health Homes (BHH). DMAHS in collaboration with the DM HAS is developing a State Plan Amendment to be able to provide BHH services. These services will be monitored and managed by DMHAS and DMAHS until the ASO goes live. Persons enrolled in MLTSS will be eligible for BHH services and there is expected coordinatio n of care of individuals who are transitioning who are in a BHH and the MLTSS program . All members in the MLTSS and D -SNP will receive their behavioral health services through the MCO in which they are enrolled. The implementation of these activities add resses Goals 1 -3. D-SNP In an effort to improve the integration and coordination of health care services, New Jersey has entered into a full benefit Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D -SNP), effective January 2012. This program combines all of the benef its to be rendered under one MCO. D-SNP ELIGIBILITY In order to be considered eligible to enroll in the D -SNP Program, the potential member must meet the following criteria: Have full Medicaid coverage or full Medicaid coverage with Qualified Medicar e Beneficiary eligibility (QMB Plus), Specified Low -Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB Plus), or Other Full Benefit dual eligibility; Show evidence of Part A and Part B coverage; or be enrolled in Medicare Part C coverage; concurrently enrolled in Part D; Reside in the service area defined in the D -SNP contract; and Enroll in the Contractor's Medicare Advantage Product as defined in the D -SNP Contract. 68 Persons not eligible to enroll into the D -SNP program include: Individuals medically determined to hav e End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) at the time of enrollment; Individuals who are only eligible for Specified Low -Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB) Qualified, Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI), Qualified Individual -1 (QI -1) or Qualified Individual -2 (QI-2) and are not otherwise eligible for Medical Assistance; Individuals who become eligible for Medical Assistance only after spending down a portion of their income; Individuals who are residents of State -operated psychiatric facilities; Individuals resi ding in long term care facilities longer tha n Medicare covered limits or institutionalized in an inpatient psychiatric institution or intermediate care facility for the intellectually disabled; Individuals who are eligible for Medical Assistance who are un der 65 years of age, have been screened for breast and/or cervical cancer under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and need treatment for breast or cervical cancer, and are not otherwise covere d under creditable coverage as defined in the Federal Public Health Service Act (Program Status Code 295); Individuals who are presumptively eligible or in Medically Needy or PACE programs; Individuals in out -of-state placements. D-SNP NETWORKS The contra cted MCOs are offering a D -SNP and their provider network s are composed of providers who are participating in both the MCO's Medicaid and Medicare networks. D-SNP BENEFITS D-SNP members will receive the same Medicaid and Medicare benefits covered under those capitated contracts, including care management and behavioral heal th services , as appropriate. There is no cost for joining a D -SNP. Members may choose their MCO as w ell as disenroll at any time. Aside from improved integration and coordination of health care services, other incentives of joining a D -SNP include no copays for prescriptions and incidentals such as passes to gyms. D-SNP Monitoring Since the D -SNP program offers both Medicaid and Medicare benefits, it is administered through a separate contract. Therefore, the State must have its EQRO conduct a separate review of the CMS mandated quality activities. Mandatory EQRO D -SNP activities include: (1) an annual assessment of MCO operations to determine the MCO's compliance with federal CMS standards; (2) validation of performance improvement projects; and (3) validation of the MCO performance measures. Per 42 CFR 438.360 -362, to avoid duplication of activities, CMS gives States the option of using the information obtained from the MCO's Medicare review or private accreditation review, provided 69 that certain conditions are met. Any standards that are used in the place of a Medicaid review must be at least as stringent as the Medicaid standard; must be included in the State's quality strat egy, explaining its rationale for why the standards are duplicative; and must meet with CMS approval. Contingent upon the D -SNP MCOs achieving National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accreditation, New Jersey will seek CMS approval in exercising t he option of using MCO information obtained from a Medicare or private accreditation review to avoid duplication of otherwise mandatory activities, and will comply with 42 CFR 438.360 -362. Please see applicable federal regulations at the end of this secti on. NON -DUPLICATION OF ACTIV ITIES FOR ANNUAL ASS ESSMENT OF MCO OPERATIONS Once the D -SNP MCOs achieve accreditation and have met the conditions outlined in 42 CFR 438.360-362, the State will refer to a crosswalk of the deemable standards. At that time, N ew Jersey will apply Medicare/private accreditation information in its EQRO's review for all Annual Assessment of MCO Operations standards identified in the crosswalk as being \"Met\" or deemable. The MCOs will be required to provide to the EQRO all reports , findings and other results of their Medicare/private accreditation review to ensure that the applicable standards have, in fact, been met by the individual D -SNP MCO. In the meantime, the EQRO will conduct a full Annual Assessment of MCO Operations for each contracted D -SNP. This activity addresses Goals 1 -4. NON -DUPLICATION OF ACTIV ITIES FOR PERFORMANC E MEASURES AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEM ENT PROJECTS After reviewing 42 CFR 438.360 and 438.362 with CMS, it has been determined that New Jersey has not met the conditions to apply non -duplication of activity for performance improvement projects or validation of performance measures. Therefore, the New Jersey EQRO is conduct ing these activities and execut ing an effective program of external quality review. With the assistance and technical advice of its EQRO, New Jersey intends to comply with all CMS requirements, including the non -duplication of activities. This addresses Goals 1 - 4. PERFORMANCE MEASURES SPECIFIC TO D -SNP Currently, on an annual basis, the D -SNP MCOs must submit the following performance measures: Adult BMI Assessment Comprehensive Diabetes Care Colorectal Cancer Screening Glaucoma Screening in Older Adults Care for Older Adults Use of Spirometry Testing in the Assessment and Dia gnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Pharmacotherapy Management of COPD Exacerbation Cholesterol Management for Patients With Cardiovascular Conditions 70 Controlling High Blood Pressure annually Persistence of Beta -Blocker Treatment Afte r a Heart Attack Disease Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis Osteoporosis Management in Women Who Had a Fracture Antidepressant Medication Management Annual Monitoring for Patients on Persistent Medications Use of Appropriate Medic ations for People with Asthma Potentially Harmful Drug -Disease Interactions in the Elderly Use of High -Risk Medications in the Elderly Medication Reconciliation Post -Discharge Follow -up after Hospitalization for Mental Illness Chlamydia Screening Breast Cancer Screening annually Cervical Cancer Screening annually Adult's Access to Preventive/Ambulatory Health Services Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol and Other Drug Dependence Treatment Call Abandonment Call Answer Timeliness Total Membership Frequency of Selected Procedures Inpatient Utilization - General Hospital/Acute Care Ambulatory Care Mental Health Utilization Identification of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Antibiotic Utilization Plan All -Cause Readmissions Board Certification Race/Ethnicity Diversity of Membership Language Diversity of Membership This monitoring activity addresses 1 through 4. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS SPECIFIC TO D-SNP The EQRO will prepare a Quality Technical Report. Initially, New Jersey will require a D-SNP- specific QIP concerning Medication Reconciliation. After the D -SNP Performance Measures have been collected and analyzed, additional D -SNP QIPs may be added to the contract requirements. These quality activities address Goals 1, 2 and 3. As the D -SNP program develops, NJ will add additional quality monitoring activities such as a work plan of QAPI activities, satisfaction surveys , provider network reports and grievances and appeals reports. The implementation of these activities will address Goal s 1-4. 71 Regulations regarding Non-Duplication of Mandatory Activities Annual Assessment of MCO Operations 42 CFR 438.360 Non-duplication of mandatory activities. (a) General rule. To avoid duplication, the State may use, in place of a Medicaid review by the State, its agent or EQRO, information about the MCO obtained from a Medicare or private accreditation review to provide information otherwise obtained from the mandatory activities specifies in 438.358 if the conditions of paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section are met.

B. LEVEL OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE - METHODS OF REMEDIATI ON Per Goals 1, 2 and 3, DMAHS utilizes various strategies to assess the level of compliance and to drive improvements in ensuring access and qu ality of services. The review methods are geared toward using findings from data analysis, monitoring results and feedback from beneficiaries and providers to form strategy development and the policymaking process. Adherence to contract requirements is c losely monitored and gaps in compliance are addressed promptly. When a deficiency in contract compliance is noted, a Notice of Deficiency (NOD) and Request for Corrective Action Plan (CAP) will be issued with a 30 day timeframe for response required from the MCO. In some cases, the exigencies of the matter may require the response timeframe to be less than 30 days. If the CAP proves ineffective, a Notice of Intent to Sanction (NOIS) will be issued; and if necessary, a Notice of Sanction (NOS) will follo w. The timeframes of response for NOIS and NOS are at the discretion of the State. Contract Articles 7.15 and 7.16 below describe the Sanction process. 7.15 SANCTIONS In the event DMAHS finds the contractor to be out -of-compliance with program standards , performance standards or the terms or conditions of this contract, the Department shall issue a written notice of deficiency, request a corrective action plan and/or specify the manner and timeframe in which the deficiency is to be cured. If the contract or fails to cure the deficiency as ordered, the Department shall have the right to exercise any of the administrative sanction options described below, in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available to the Department. The type of action taken shall be in relation to the nature and severity of the deficiency: A. Suspend enrollment of beneficiaries in contractor's plan. B. Notify enrollees of contractor non -performance and permit enrollees to transfer to another MCO without cause. C. Reduc e or eliminate marketing and/or community event participation. D. Terminate the contract, under the provisions of the preceding Article. E. Cease auto -assignment of new enrollees. F. Refuse to renew the contract. G. Impose and maintain temporary management in accordance with \u00a71932(e)(2) of the Social Security Act during the period in which improvements are made to correct violations. H. In the case of inappropriate marketing activities, referral may also be made to the Department of Banking and Insurance fo r review and appropriate enforcement action. I. Require special training or retraining of marketing representatives including, but not limited to, business ethics, marketing policies, effective sales practices, and State marketing policies and regulations, at the contractor's expense. J. In the event the contractor becomes financially impaired to the point of threatening the ability of the State to obtain the services provided for under the contract, ceases to conduct business in the normal course, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or 76 suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or its assets, the State may, at its option, immediately terminate this contract effective the close of business on the date specified. K. Refuse to consider for future contracting a contractor that fails to submit encounter data on a timely and accurate basis. L. Refer the matter to the US Department of Justice, the US Attorney's Office, the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, and/or t he New Jersey Division of Law as warranted. M. Refer the matter to the applicable federal agencies for civil money penalties. N. Refer the matter to the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights where applicable. O. Exclude the contractor from participation in t he Medicaid program. P. Refer the matter to the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.

If contractor does not provide or perform the requirements referred to or listed in this provision; damage to the State may result. B. Proving such damages shall be costly, difficult, and time -consuming. C. Should the State choose to impose liquidated damages, the contractor shall pay the State those damages for not providing or performing the specified requirements; if damages are imposed, collection shall be from the date the State placed the contractor on notice or as may be specified in the written notice. D. Additional damages may occur in specified areas by prolonged periods in which contractor does not provide or perform requirements. E. The damage figures listed below represent a good faith effort to quantify the range of harm that could reasonably be anticipated at the time of the making of the contract. F. The Department may, at its discretion, withhold capitation payments in whole or in part, or offset with advanced notice liquidated damages from capitation payments owed to the contractor. G. The DHS shall have the right to deny payment or recover reimbursement for those services or deliverables which have not been performed and which due to circumstances caused by the contractor cannot be performed or if performed w ould be of no value to the State. Denial of the amount of payment shall be reasonably related to the amount of work or deliverable lost to the State. H. The DHS shall have the right to recover incorrect payments to the contractor due to omission, error, fraud, waste, or abuse, or defalcation by the contractor. Recovery to be made by deduction from subsequent payments under this contract or other contracts between the State and the contractor, or by the State as a debt due to the State or otherwise as provid ed by law. I. Whenever the State determines that the contractor failed to provide one (1) or more of the medically necessary covered contract services, the State shall have the right to withhold a portion of the contractor's capitation payments for the following month or subsequent months, such portion withheld to be equal to the amount of money the State shall pay to provide such services along with administrative costs of making such payment. Any other harm to the State or the beneficiary/enrollee shall be calculated and applied as damage. The 77 contractor shall be given written notice prior to the withholding of any capitation payment. J. Corrective Action and Liquidated Damages. The contractor shall correct or submit a written corrective action plan for any deficiency identified by the Department in writing within ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of the Department's notification or within a time determined by the Department depending on the nature of the issue. For each day beyond that time t hat the Department has not received an acceptable corrective action plan, monetary damages in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100) per day for ten (10) days and two hundred fifty ($250) per day thereafter will be deducted from the capitation payment to the contractor. The contractor shall implement the corrective action plan immediately from the time of Department notification of the original problem pending approval of the final corrective action plan. The liquidated damages shall be applied for failure to implement the corrective action plan from the date of original State notification of the problem. Corrective action plans apply to each of the areas in this Article for potential liquidated damages. Corrective action must be completed within the time period determined and approved by DMAHS in its sole discretion after the date of the final approval of the corrective action plan or monetary damages of $250 per day will be deducted from the capitation payment. K. Self -Reporting of Failures and Noncompliance. Any monetary damages that otherwise would be assessed pursuant to this Article of this contract, may be reduced, at the State's option, if the contractor reports the failure or noncompliance in written detail to DMAHS prior to notice of the noncompliance from the Department. The amount of the reduction shall be no more than ninety (90) percent of the total value of the monetary damages. L. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as relieving the contractor from performing any other contract duty not listed herein, nor is the State's right to enforce or to seek other remedies for failure to perform any other contract duty hereby diminished. C. LEVEL OF IMPACT F ROM USE OF AVAILABLE OR EVOLVING HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLO GY Health information exch ange has been ongoing between DMAHS and NJ DOH for blood lead screening information since 2004 through bi -annual data matching. Through this process, DMAHS has been able to identify children who are lead -burdened or have not received a blood lead screenin g and share this information with contracted MCO s so that necessary follow -up is initiated. Efforts are underway to make the data exchange more automated, accurate and closer to real -time. The MCI project is key to this HIE initiative and will facilitate other efforts related to the HITECH Act, the Affordable Care Act, the new Medicaid Consolidated Eligibility and Enrollment system under development and the collection of quality measures required by CHIPRA legislation. It is anticipated that as the inf ormation infrastructure matures, the ability to provide real time patient information at the point of care to improve quality and safety will also be vastly improved. The eventual measurement and standardization of quality indicators will also help in ass essing program performance, increase transparency, provide valuable information to providers on their performance on key areas and encourage adherence to evid ence-based guidelines. 78 MITA AND THE REPLACE MENT MMIS ON QUALITY The NJ MMIS is a key facet in t he operation of DMAHS pr ograms to deliver high quality, coordinated, person -centered, and cost -effective services. DMAHS completed the Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) State Self -Assessment in 2010 and is currently in the process of pre paring for the re -procurement of the NJ MMIS in SFY 2013. The goal of the procurement is to provide DMAHS with the system infrastructure, technical capabilities and management tools to effectively manage the State Medicaid programs in an era of dynamic h ealth system transformation. The new system, henceforth referred to as the Replacement MMIS, will help ensure that members receive quality, coordinated and person -centered health services, that programs are effectively administered with the help of decisi on support tools, that fraud, waste and abuse are prevented, detected and addressed, and that the system is able to adapt and respond timely to regulatory and policy changes. The Replacement MMIS will enable New Jersey to achieve program goals that are cr itically intertwined with health information technology and electronic exchange of health information to improve health out comes and control program cost. As envisioned, the Replacement MMIS will provide a system infrastructure that takes into account the challenges of health care reform, the newest benefits in health information technology (HIT), and the system and policy changes that will enable the State to implement strategies to improve health care outcomes, realize program efficiencies, and achieve co st savings. Based on the vision articulated by the DMAHS leadership and the input provided by over 200 stakeholders during the requirements analysis phase for the new system, the Replacement MMIS will be able to take full advantage of new technologies to enable the following: Support of dynamic business processes, allowing for the necessary expansion of all system - maintained data elements and fields to accommodate expanding scope, new services, changing requirements, and legislative mandates; Significant r eduction of paper -based processing thus reducing paper waste and also provide economical data archiving by using an Electronic Document Man agement System (E DMS); Better, faster, and easier -to-use technology with less operating and maintenance costs, better financial modeling, budgeting tools, and expenditure control practices; Better communication and data sharing bridges among internal and external users to improve care and member management; and Improved customer service and decision -making tools, enhance d reporting, and better use of staff. Anticipated Benefits The Replacement MMIS will provide the capabilities that will enable the realization of New Jersey's vision, align with the Medicaid Information Technology (MITA) framework and 79 comply with the CMS Seven Conditions and Standards. With these capabilities in place the NJ Medicaid Enterprise will be able to: Ensure provision of coordinated, accountable and patient -focused care; Facilitate data access and health information exchange in real time while ensuring privacy and security; Coordinate with other public health agencies to improve surveillance and population health; Determine availability of services to improve access to care; Promote informed and timely decision -making, both at the policy adminis tration level and at the point of care; Provide data that is timely, accurate, usable, accessible; Improve healthcare outcomes by providing the right information at the right time to support clinical decisions ; Promote member engagement in their health c are; Take advantage of automation and paperless transactions; Accommodate current and future business methods; Monitor and improve programs and determine cost effectiveness; Monitor costs and predict future financial needs; Enhance prevention, detection an d loss recovery related to fraud waste and abuse; Compare service utilization or provider or beneficiary enrollment across state or other geographic boundaries; Participate in health information exchange and the Health Insurance Exchange; Leverage resour ces by maximizing the use of shared services; Support of dynamic business processes, allowing for modifications to accommodate expanding scope, new services, changing requirements, and legislative mandates; and Keep pace with technological innovations that will reduce operating and maintenance costs while enabling better program administration and expenditure control practices. In summary, the Replacement MMIS provides possibilities for business improvement and the flexibility to accommodate evolving busine ss needs and methods. A more adaptable design will 80 better position New Jersey's Medicaid Enterprise for the future and provide the ability to more quickly address Medicaid program needs. IMPROVEMENT Findings from assessment activities are used to determine compliance, gauge progress and identify opportunities for improvement as well as needed changes in the monitoring strategies. These activities also provide valuable information on promising initiatives that can be replicated on a wi der scale. 81 Displayed in Table 1 are performance data on priority areas for measurement for Year 20 12 and corresponding targets objectives for the next five years . The various improvement strategies are anticipated to sustain progress towards the achieve ment of these target goals. TABLE 1 - DASHBOARD QUALITY STRATEGY OBJ ECTIVES Quality Strategy Objective 2012 (Measurement Year 2011) 2013 (Measurement Year 2012) 2014 (Measurement Year 2013) 2015 (Measurement Year 2014) 2016 (Measurement Year 2015) 2017 Target Year (Measurement Year 2016) Trend from 2012- 2017 Children and Adolescent's Access to Primary Care - Total NR 12 - 24 months - 97.42 25 months - 6 years - 91.20 7 - 11 years - 93.24 12 - 19 years - 91.55 Adults' Access to Preventive Care NR Timeliness of 83.44 83.95 Dental Visits -Categories NR 2011 CAHPS 2012 CAHPS Percentage of respondents who responded \"None\" to question UT1. \"In the last 6 months, how many times did you go to an emergency room to get health care for yourself?\" 73 72 Percentage of respondents who responded \"Always\" to composit e questions Adult Q 4 & 6 that asked how often you got health care when needed care right away/an appointment with a doctor/clinic as soon as you thought you needed it. 52 53 Percentage of respondents who responded \"Always\" to composite Ch ild questions Q 4 & 6 that asked how often you got health care for your child when it was needed right away/an appointment with a doctor/clinic as soon as you thought your child needed it. 64 61 Care Management 2011 Measurement 2012 Measurement Year 82 Year Audit Score 66-100 55-100 MLTSS N/A N/A Hospital admissions of members using HCBS - - ER utilization of members using HCBS - - Short stay NF admissions of members using HCBS - - The EQRO is a val uable partner in advancing the quality program. DMAHS has worked closely with the EQRO to fine-tune the various assessment tools and process es used for evaluations . For example, m odifications in the Annual Assessment of MCO Operations include d the revisi on of the document submission tool and report outline to consolidate common themes and improve MCO document submission s for the desk reviews . Additionally, e fforts to enhance the EQRO's evaluation of the QIPs were implemented recently. The new process , which provides more opportunity for feedback and builds MCO capabilities in QIP design , is expected to improve the effectiveness of the initiatives while concurrently streamlining the evaluation process. This process was implemented in 2010. Key to trac king progress is the availability and reliability of data. The creation of the Encounter Data Monitoring Unit (EDMU ), which evaluates encounter data, has helped to ensure that metrics based on encounter data are truly reflective of performance and that da ta submitted by MCO s are complete . With the various efforts to promote health information exchange, DMAHS is taking steps to overcome barriers that impede the flow of data to inform care delivery. The MITA assessment along with the MCI project will allow DMAHS to operate beyond just meeting requirements and optimize processes to achieve goals related to improved health outcomes and program cost - effectiveness. Reports such as the Quality Technical Report, NJ HMO Performance Report and the CAHPS provide va luable and concise insight on overall and comparative performance . DMAHS is working towards increasing the availability of performance indicators in print and other electronic media such as the internet. This will promote accountability, transparency and inform stakeholders of progress in key areas. Collaboration with varied stakeholders is crucial to DMAHS quality improvement efforts. The N ew Jersey Department of Health has been a critical partner in many initiatives that include data sharing for blood lead screening, newborn hearing, immunizations and strengthening linkages to improve health service delivery especially for at risk populations. DMAHS has also collaborated with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Pediatric Denti sts and the Early Head Start (EHS)/Hea d Start (HS) programs to promote the establishment of dental homes. EPSDT standards in the managed care contract require the achievement of the 80% rate for well - visits, dental, immunization and blood lead screening s. Failure to meet the standard may result in corrective action plans (CAPs) or a notice of sanction. Over the years, steady increases in EPSDT rates have been achieved. It is anticipated that improvement will be sustained by holding MCO s to the standar d and through the various quality improvement initiatives. 83 PROCESS FOR QUALITY STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT , REVIEW AND REVISION The Office of Quality Assurance (OQA) within DMAHS develops a quality strategy that is aligned with the vision of the right care , for every person , every time , in the appropriate setting and ensures that members have access to quality, equitable, patient -centered, culturally -competent and cost - effective care that results in optimal outcomes. On an annual basis, the State reviews fin dings from monitoring activities to discern trends, identify emerging issues and assess the effectiveness of the monitoring process and quality improvement activities. Feedback, suggestions and recommendations obtained from staff, MCO s, EQRO and other sta keholders are considered to improve strategies. As appropriate, recommendations for managed care contract amendments are made and work plans or scope of work for the EQRO are updated to make the quality strategies more effective. Enactment or changes in federal or State regulations such as the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) , Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) and updates in CMS guidelines influence quality strategy development. Upon receipt of appropriate guidance, the State determines the necessary adjustments in the quality strategy to comply with the regulatory requirements. The quality strategy is examined at least annually and updated as needed based on findings and trends identified thr ough the State 's monitoring activities. Because the quality strategy and the managed care contract are closely related , changes in either one may result in a corresponding change in the other to ensure alignment. A significant change is one that modifies the quality strategy based on findings identified during monitoring activities that necessitate a contract amendment or require a particular focus or emphasis on an aspect of care . The State tracks and trends relevant data to ensure that quality assuran ce activities are data driven and promote quality improvement . The State also works closely with organizations with technical expertise and resources. These organizations include, but are not limited to, the state contracted External Quality Review Organ ization (EQRO ), Mercer Government Human Services Consulting (Mercer), and the Center for Health Care Strategies (CHCS). On a quarterly basis, DMAHS convenes the Medical Assistance Advisory Committee (MAAC), which is comprised of beneficiaries, consumer advocates and providers and is open to the public at large. The MAAC meetings provide a forum for all interested parties , including individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, to receive updates on DMAHS programs and initiatives and voice concerns, views and recommendations regarding the Medicaid programs. The Medical and Dental Advisory Committee is comprised of medical and dental directors and quality staff of participating NJ Medicaid MCO s who meet regularly to discuss policy and operational issues that affect access and quality of health care services. Ensuring that individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid receive medical and dental benefits is a standing agenda 84 item with this work group. These meetings provide op portunities to obtain input and support for quality initiatives and also promote the sharing of effective and promising practices. DMAHS also collaborates closely with other State agencies such as the Division of Aging Services (DoAS), Department of Chi ldren and Families (DCF) and Department of Banking and Insurance (DOBI). This coordination helps ensure that policies and programs that affect health service delivery are communicated across agencies, reduce duplication of activities and promote cooperati on and transfer of information to facilitate the achievement of common goals. DMAHS continually seeks to expand its collaborative efforts to include other agencies that may enhance its capacity to ensure access to quality health care. CMS will be inform ed of any significant changes in the quality strategy as they occur , including changes made as a result of the Comprehensive Waiver and D -SNPs. The quality strategy , which addresses the comprehensive waiver , must be submitted to CMS for final approval wit hin 90 days before the approval date of the Comprehensive Waiver. The State will provide CMS with quarterly and annual reports on the implementation and effectiveness of the updated quality strategy as it impacts the Comprehensive Waiver. 85 ACHIEVEMENTS AN D OPPORTUNITIES NJ DOH CHILDHOOD LEAD POISO NING SURVEILLANCE SY STEM Efforts to promote data exchange and information flow have improved the delivery of health services. Through a matching of Medicaid information with the NJ DOH Childhood Lead Poisoning S urveillance System, DMAHS has been able to share information with MCO s and providers on which children are lead -burdened or in need of screening so that necessary outreach or follow -up care can be initiated. This has resulted in improved blood lead screen ing rates and timely case management of lead burdened children. The NJ Medicaid average for the 2012 HEDIS Lead Screening in Children measure was 79.74 % and exceeded the national Medicaid average by over eight percentage points. Similar initiatives that facilitate provider access to immunization and newborn hearing screening information available in D OH information systems are also in progress to help inform providers of any needed immunizations or follow -up of children with hearing problems. While progr ess in th ese areas is a notable achievement in advancing delivery of EPSDT services , it also presents an opportunity for improving health information exchange to make it more accurate, closer to real -time and delivered through a web interface that is secur e and overcomes information silos. Benefits from the MCI , which is an integral component in the Electronic Medical Information for Children (eMedIC) Medicaid transformation grant project , will help improve quality of care and support the broader aims of t he ARRA and HITECH Acts. DENTAL DIRECTORY In 2007, NJFC /M worked together with CHC S and the contracted MCO s in a quality improvement project to improve the oral health services for children 0 to 5 years of age enrolled in Medicaid and the State Childr en's Health Insurance Program . This 18 month collaborative began in fall of 2007 and resulted in a Dental Directory of general and pediatric dental providers for children 5 years old and under. The directory lists dentists by county, by city, and lists ha ndicap accessibility, the insurance plans accepted, whether the dentist is a special needs provider and the ages treated. The NJ Smiles Dental Directory is updated annually. CARE MANAGEMENT TOOL With the assistance from CHCS, the State has developed a care management tool that allow s for early identification of members in need of care management services . All new members (except DYSF, DDD and MLTSS eligible members) will be screened using an approved Initial Health Screening tool ( IHS) to quickly ide ntify their immediate physical and/or behavioral health care needs as well as the need for more extensive screening. Any member identified by a health care professional as having potential care management needs , all DDD, Division of Child and Protection and Permanency (DCP&P), formerly known as Division of Youth and Family Services and MLT SS- eligible members will receive a more detailed comprehensive needs assessment (CNA) and an ongoing care coordination and management as appropriate. The IHS tool was su bmitted to and approved by CMS and is currently in its beta test period that commenced on January 2012. Information from the beta test has been received from the MCOs by the OQA and is being trended. 86 MEDICAL HOME Effective, July 2011, the NJ State Medic aid Contract, Section 4.2.10, requires that the contracted MCO s must participate in the Medicai d Medical Home demonstration. Primary care providers must be identified for participation in the demonstration project that provides care to enrollees with a chronic health condition and/or behavioral health condition using a medical home model. Focus is encouraged to the development of Medical Homes for the developmentally disabled and frail elderly. The MCOs will ensure that selected medical homes attain the f ollowing accreditation: NCQA Level I by end of year 1 of the pilot NCQA Level II by end of year 2 of the pilot NCQA Level III is optional The services offered to enrollees participating in the Medical Home demonstration project include: Patient care co ordination through multi -disciplinary teams; Individualized customized care plans that promote self -management; Patient/family education for enrollees with chronic diseases; Home Telephonic communications; Group care; Oral health examina tions; and Culturally and linguistically appropriate care. The MCO s are required to submit for DMAHS review their proposed payment methodologies that support care coordination and reward quality and improved patient outcomes. Additionally, on an annual basis, the MCO will evaluate their medical home programs and report to the State their findings regarding: Cost savings a nd supporting documentation; Types and rate of health screening; Health outcome measures, including: o emergency room visit rates; o hospitalization rates; o avoidable hospital readmission rates; o comparing medical home cohorts; At a minimum, two clinical measures; and Satisfaction measures, e.g. CAHPS measures. The Medical Home will be guided by the Joint Principles of the Patient Centere d Medical Home (PCP CC): 87 Personal physician: each patient has an ongoing relationship with a personal physician trained to provide first contact, continuous and comprehensive care; Physician directed medical practice: the physician leads a team of healt h care members at the practice level who collectively take responsibility for the ongoing care of patients; Whole person orientation: the personal physician is responsible for providing all of the patient 's healthcare need or taking responsibility for app ropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals; Care is coordinated and/or integrated across settings; Quality and safety are assured by planning process, evidence -based medicine, clinical decision -support tools, performance measurement, acti ve participation of patients in decision making, information technology, a voluntary recognition process, quality improvement activities; Enhanc ed access to care is available ( expanded hours, enhanced communication options); Payment must appropriately reco gnize the added value provided to patients who have a patient -centered medical home . NJ ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION DEMONST RATION PROJECT On August 19, 2011, the New Jersey Governor signed into law the Medicaid Accountable Care Organization Demonstrat ion Project. As noted in the law, the goals are to: (1) Increase access to primary care, behavioral health care, pharmaceuticals, and dental care by Medicaid recipients residing in defined regions; (2) Improve health outcomes and quality as measured by objective metrics and patient experience of care; and (3) Reduce unnecessary and inefficient care without interfering with patients' access to their health care providers or the providers' access to existing Medicaid reimbursement systems. The ACO demo nstration will achieve these goals through two overarching strategies articulated in the legislation: Community -based innovation: New Jersey's ACOs will be driven by identified local health care needs, resources, and solutions. Each ACO will consist of a collaboration of practices, hospitals, and community organizations serving all eligible Medicaid beneficiaries in a designated area. Shared savings: ACO will benefit from a value -based purchasing strategy that supports more integrated and coordinate d systems of care. The legislation stipulates that qualified ACOs must seek and be certified by the New Jersey Department of Human Services. Under the law, New Jersey nonprofit corporations that wish to form a community -based ACO must demonstrate the su pport of all general hospitals, no fewer than 75% of qualified primary care providers, and at least four qualified behavioral health care providers located in the designated area served by the ACO. 88 The ACO will be required to provide a comprehensive pla n and processes for accomplishing the Medicaid ACO Demonstration project objectives. As part of certification, the ACO must describe its plan for improving health outcomes and the quality of care by increasing access to primary and behavioral health care services and utilization of preventive care and reducing use of emergency rooms and in -patient care settings for routine care. The ACO's performance will be measured by objective quality benchmarks (Appendix C), as well as patient, and if available caregi ver, experience of care. ACOs will be expected to undertake necessary activities to accomplish these goals, such as: care coordination through multi -disciplinary teams; expansion of the medical home and chronic care models; increased patient medication ad herence and use of medication therapy management services; use of health information technology and sharing of health information; use of open access scheduling in clinical and behavioral health care settings; and services such as patient or family health education and health promotion, home -based services, group care and culturally and linguistically appropriate care. VALUE -BASED PURCHAS ING Beginning on July 1, 2013, New Jersey DMAHS will initiate a performance -based contracting (PBC) incentive program. This program is designed to motivate the MCOs' innovation to improve and sustain improvement in clinical areas that are a priority to NJ DMAHS and DOH's Healthy New Jersey 2020 program and their clients. The clinical priority areas include: birth outcomes , diabetes and obesity. Additionally, part of the incentive will encourage the MCOs to achieve NCQA accreditation. Funding will be provided by setting aside a portion of the capitation rate and a revision of the associated efficiency expectations in SFY 2015. MCOs will have the opportunity to earn PBC amounts based on improved performance measure results from baseline (CY 2013) to measurement year 1 (C Y 2014). In addition to the potential to earn PBC payment based on performance in the clinical priority areas, NJ may establish other means to effect performance improvement (E.g., public dissemination of results, adjustment to enrollment algorithms, etc.). DELIVERY SYSTEM INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM The Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) P rogram is one component of the New Jersey's Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver as approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). DSRIP is a demonstration program designed to result in better care for individuals (including access to care, quali ty of care, health outcomes), better health for the population, and lower costs by transitioning hospital funding to a model where payment is contingent on achieving health improvement goals. This innovative program provides incentives to hospitals to imp rove the quality of care they offer to patients within their community by achieving measureable, incremental clinical outcome results demonstrating the initiatives' impact on improving the New Jersey health care system. The former Hospital Relief Subsidy Fund (HRSF) is being transitioned to a performance -based, competitive DSRIP program. Under the new program, all acute care hospitals will be eligible to receive funding. 89 Hospitals will begin submitting DSRIP applications in September 2013. The state an d CMS will review the applications and determine initial funding opportunities. Through this funding, hospitals have an opportunity to develop projects that advance the health of their communities. As part of DSRIP, hospitals may choose one of eight chro nic diseases or medical conditions on which to focus improvements. Hospitals will choose among the following diseases and conditions: HIV/AIDS, Cardiac Care, Asthma, Diabetes, Obesity, Pneumonia, Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse. The DSRIP program su pports the Healthy New Jersey 2020 vision: \"For New Jersey to be a state in which all people live long, healt hy lives\". DISPARITIES The DMAHS has included language in the July 2014 NJFC/M Managed Care Contract that will require the MCOs to develop a p rogram to identify, prevent and reduce health care disparities. This program shall include, but is not limited to the following: 1. Evidence of a process to identify and evaluate healthcare disparities within the MCO, by subgroups including: gender, rac e, ethnicity, primary language and disability status; 2. Barrier analysis and a written action plan to address the disparities identified; 3. Implementation of an action plan with continuous monitoring of outcomes; and 4. Ongoing evaluation of the effectiv eness of the action plan The program will be evaluated annually during the Annual Assessment of MCO Operations. Failure to submit an effective work plan may result in a Notice of Deficiency (NOD) and Request for Corrective Action Plan (CAP). Continued d eficiency will result in a Notice of Intent to Sanction (NOIS) followed by a Notice of Sanction (NOS) if the MCO fails to appropriately remedy the issue. For more information regarding see the section of this document Level of Contract Compliance - Method s of Remediation that describes the process for issuing Sanctions. LOOKING TOWARD THE F UTURE The D MAH S will continue to collaborate with Division of Developmental Disabilities, Division of Menta l Health and Addiction Services, Division of Aging Servic es and Division of Disability Services, as well as stakeholders to identify areas needing improvement and to develop methods to effect change. The State will continue to take steps to ensure that the NJFC/M, including the MLTSS population and D -SNP p rograms will offer the right care and supports, for every person, every time, in the appropriate setting that ensures members have access to quality, equitable, person - centered, culturally -competent and cost -effective care that results in optimal outcomes, inc luding maximum independence and quality of life. 90 APPENDIX A NJFC /M MANAGED CARE CONTRACT ARTICLE 1 Medically Necessary Services --services or supplies necessary to prevent, evaluate, diagnose, correct, prevent the worsening of, allev iate, ameliorate, or cure a physical or mental illness or condition; to maintain health; to prevent the onset of an illness, condition, or disability; to prevent or treat a condition that endangers life or causes suffering or pain or results in illness or infirmity; to prevent the deterioration of a condition; to promote the development or maintenance of maximal functioning capacity in performing daily activities, taking into account both the functional capacity of the individual and those functional capaci ties that are appropriate for individuals of the same age; to prevent or treat a condition that threatens to cause or aggravate a handicap or cause physical deformity or malfunction, and there is no other equally effective, more conservative or substantial ly less costly course of treatment available or suitable for the enrollee. The services provided, as well as the type of provider and setting, must be reflective of the level of services that can be safely provid ed, must be consistent with the diagnosis of the condition and appropriate to the specific medical needs of the enrollee and not solely for the convenience of the enrollee or provider of service and in accordance with standards of good medical practice and generally recognized by the medical scienti fic community as effective. Course of treatment may include mere observation or, where appropriate, no treatment at all. Experimental services or services generally regarded by the medical profession as unacceptable treatment are not medically necessary fo r purposes of this contract. Medically necessary services provided must be based on peer -reviewed publications, expert pediatric, psychiatric, and medical opinion, and medical/pediatric community acceptance. In the case of pediatric enrollees, this d efinition shall apply with the additional criteria that the services, including those found to be needed by a child as a result of a comprehensive screening visit or an interperiodic encounter whether or not they are ordinarily covered services for all oth er Medicaid enrollees, are appropriate for the age and health status of the individual and that the service will aid the overall physical and mental growth and development of the individual and the service will assist in achieving or maintaining functional capacity. 42 CFR 438.204 (b)(1) Elements of State quality strategies. At a minimum, the State must include the following ... (b) Procedures that -- (1) Assess the quality and appropriateness of care and services furnished to all Medicaid enrollees under the MCO and PIHP contracts, and to individuals with special health care needs. Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.204(b)(1) the State includes the definition of special needs in the Managed Care Contract as follows: Enrollee with Special Needs --for adults, special ne eds includes complex/chronic medical conditions requiring specialized health care services, including persons with physical, mental/substance abuse, and/or developmental disabilities, including such persons who are homeless. Children with special health ca re needs are those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.208(c)(1), t he State uses program status codes and capitation codes to identify enrollees with special health care needs , such as Aged Blind and Disabled, DCP&P, DDD and MLTSS. Additionally, the State provides risk scores of all members to the as signed MCOs. 42 CFR 438.208 Coordination and continuity of care. (c) Additional services for enrollees with special health care needs. (1) Identification . The State must implement mechanisms to identify persons with special health care needs to MCOs, PIHPs and PAHPs, as those persons are defined by the State. These identification mechanisms - (i) Must be specified in the State's quality improvement strategy in 438.202; and (ii) May use State staff, the State's enrollment broker, or the State's MCOs, \"unable to contact\" an MLTSS member must be reported through the Critical Incident Reporting system (CIRS) designated by the State. (CIRs TBD) \"Unable to contact\" shall mean that an MLTSS member is absent without notification from any program or service offered under MLTSS and the provider is unable to identify the location of the member using contact information in the client file. Actions: Provider When notified that an MLTSS member is absent without notification, the provider shall immediately outreach to the client using contact information on file . If no response, contact emergency contacts for that client . If the client is under the Office of Public Guardian (OPG), notify OPG; when under the Bureau of Guardianship (BGS), notify BGS . If unsuccessful to all of the above, notify the member's Managed Care Organization (MCO) care manager/community based Care Manager . File a Critical Incident Report as required through the designated state system to the MCO . MCO If the provider is unsuccessful with outreach attempts, the member's MCO care manager/community based Care Manager shall attempt contact; if contact is not successful, the MCO care manager shall arrange/conduct a home visit to ascertain the safety of the member. If the client is under the Office of Public Guardian (OPG), the MCO care manager shall notify OPG; if the client is under the DDD Bureau of Guardianship, notify BGS. File a Critical Incident Report as required through the designated state system . If, after 24 hours, the individual cannot be contacted or his/her location determined using all of the above, local law enforcement may be notified and their assistance request ed. State If the whereabouts or status of the member cannot be determined using all of the above, a \"Notice of Intent to Terminate\" from MLTSS letter shall be issued to the member and/or his/her authorized representative by the designated State authority and the State shall dis -enroll the individual from MLTSS. If there is no response from the member or the member's authorized representative within (10) business days, the member shall be terminated from MLTSS and the termination will be effective 30 da ys of the date of the Notice of Intent to Terminate.
