This unprecedented growth in our research funding is not a one-off spike but a trend. Between 2004 and 2010, our total research income almost trebled, increasing from $9 million to $25.8 million. in 2010, $12.7 million (49%) of this total was procured from government and other public sector agencies. Most of their grants commissioned research into policy questions of urgent public health interest. To have agencies of the calibre of the National institutes of health in the United States and the Victorian Cancer agency look to our School for answers validates the relevance and excellence of our work. independent reviews of three of our centres in 2010 further confirmed our strong contribution to preventative health. The five-yearly reviews of the Centre for Molecular, Environmental, Genetic and analytic (MEGa) Epidemiology, the McCaughey MElBOURNE SC hOOl OF POPU laTiON hE alTh SUMM aRy REPORT 2010 Head of the Melbourne School of Population Health, Professor Terry Nolan. Centre and the Centre for Women's health, Gender and Society (CWhGS) (detailed in each centre's overview) were extremely complimentary. among other aspects, the reviewers noted their overall success in grant procurement, research output and policy relevance. We also did our own review within the School, prompted by the restructuring of our Master of Public health (MPh) and Master of health Social Sciences (MhSS). Our dynamic, flexible, up-to-date programs respond to the needs of both students and their current and future employers and commence enrolments in 2011. The withdrawal of federal government funding from the consortium in which we had previously delivered a collaborative MPh led to the restructure. Our collaboration with other universities had produced a strong MPh program. however, this fresh start enables us to tailor both programs to maximise our School's resources, including our most powerful asset - our talented staff. Early indications are that our students are very excited by the new programs and enrolments are on track to set a record high. The departure and arrival of leaders within our School allows me to look back and to look ahead: to appreciate the contributions of senior staff leaving and anticipate the fresh perspectives of those arriving. i would like to pay tribute to Professor ian anderson, the former Director of the Centre for health in Society (ChS) and Onemda. his appointment as founding head of Murrup Barak is the culmination of his pioneering work in establishing academic indigenous health within the University of Melbourne through Onemda. Professor anderson's respected standing as a scholar and leader in academia, his valuable contributions to knowledge transfer, and his nationally recognised role as an advisor to governments are just some of his many achievements. he is profiled in the ChS report. also on indigenous health, i congratulate Mr Shaun Ewen on being appointed the inaugural associate Dean (indigenous Development) within the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and health Sciences (MDhS). it is a testament to his very important role in promoting SUMM aRy REPORT The Melbourne School of Population Health's vision is to inculcate a population health approach in all areas of health care and in the community where opportunities for disease and injury prevention exist. What is population health?Population health is an approach to health that aims to improve the health of the entire population and to reduce health inequities among population groups. The study of population health is focused on understanding health and disease in the community, and on improving health and well-being through priority health approaches addressing the disparities in health status between social groups (Australian Institute for Health and Welfare). Our Missi On To conduct and enhance research that addresses issues of population health and health social sciences, and to educate undergraduates and postgraduate students, clinicians, scientists, professionals and public health leaders through the enrichment of our educational programs in public health. The Melbourne School of Population Health aims to strengthen the understanding, capacity and services of society to meet population health needs and to improve the quality and equity of health care. The population health approach recognises that health is a capacity or resource rather than a state, a definition which corresponds more to the notion of being able to pursue one's goals, to acquire skills and education and to grow. This broader notion of health recognises the range of social, economic and physical environmental factors that contribute to health (Public Health Agency of Canada).2Melbourne ScHool of PoP ulaTion HealTH SUMM aRy REPORT the development of indigenous students and his achievements within Onemda, the School and the Faculty. New research territory will open with the arrival in 2011 of Professor Billie Giles-Corti, the new head of the McCaughey Centre. her ground- breaking work at the University of Western australia (UW a) on the impact of the built environment on health behaviours has made her a national leader on these issues. We anticipate that she will inform state government planning in areas such as transportation and urban design. i also appreciate the important contribution of Professor John Wiseman, the inaugural Director of the McCaughey Centre, who has been appointed a Professorial Fellow of the University's new Melbourne Sustainable Society institute. a profile of Professor Wiseman is featured in the McCaughey Centre's report. Thank you to all of our staff for their outstanding efforts this year, and thanks also to our many collaborating partners for their support. HigH ligHts Population Health relocation from 723 Swanston St Works have commenced on level 3 and level B1 of 207 Bouverie St (Building 379) which will see the CWhGS, the Centre for MEGa Epidemiology and South of Grattan Street iT (SGSiT) Cluster moving to these spaces. Works are scheduled to be completed by 4 March 2011 and staff will be relocated by april 2011. centre reviews The Mccaughey centre: VicHealth centre for the Promotion of Mental Health and community Wellbeing was reviewed by Vichealth with University of Melbourne participation (Professor Glenn Bowes (associate Dean (External affairs)), and was rated an outstanding success since its establishment. Major funding secured for the next six years from Vichealth ($3.15m) with significant central University contribution ($212,500). Following founding Director Professor John Wiseman's retirement in November 2010, Professor Billie Giles-Corti (University of Western australia) has been appointed as his successor from July 2011, with associate Professor Tony laMontagne acting as Director in the interim.

Professor billie Giles-corti PhD, the Foundation Director of the Centre for the Built Environment and health at UW a, has been appointed McCaughey Centre Director from July 2011. For the last 15 years, Professor Giles-Corti has been at the forefront of developing a new field in health promotion, focused on understanding environmental factors that contribute to community wellbeing and which influence physical, social and mental health. in recent years, her research has been expanded to include a range of the social determinants of health, including sense of community, social capital, urban design, safety and fear of crime. She has studied the impact of the built environment across the life course from children through to older adults with the aim of influencing urban design policy and practice to create healthy and sustainable communities. She is recognised nationally and internationally for her research. She has over 200 publications, including 126 refereed journal articles, many highly cited, and 73 technical reports with substantial policy impact. She is frequently invited to contribute to international conferences and seminars. in the last five years, she has attracted research funding of about $8 million. Ms rebecca bond took up the position of School Manager in February 2010. Ms Bond joins us with a variety of work experiences. She has worked in the tertiary education sector in the research and student services areas as the Research Manager for the Faculty of Pharmacy (Monash University), Melbourne Graduate School of Education and Melbourne School of Engineering (MSE); and has worked as the Manager, Engineering Student Centre for the past three years.

SUMM aRy REPORT4award for excellence in Doctoral research Dr John burgess (centre for MeGa epidemiology) Dr John Burgess is an exceptionally strong candidate for this award. his PhD examined the relationship between early life factors and asthma in middle-age, using data from the Tasmanian longitudinal health Study. he has already published six journal articles related to his PhD (five as first author), has had a seventh provisionally accepted and has an eighth under review. Most are in very high ranking journals in his field, and several are starting to be quite widely cited. Dr Burgess's thesis received a very positive response from his examiners; one recommended that his PhD be awarded without further examination or amendment and the other asked for minor corrections only. Dr Burgess is exactly the kind of PhD candidate that MSPh is trying to attract, and his achievements should act as an encouragement to others. Dr Burgess well meets the criteria for this award. he has published extensively since the start of his PhD including in high impact journals for asthma and allergy. This has included an invited review in the Journal of Asthma. Both his articles and reviews have been well cited. his review is included in the 20 most read article in the Journal of Asthma. These are impressive achievements that contribute to the profile of MSPh. career Development/new researcher Dr lisa Gibbs (Mccaughey centre) Dr lisa Gibbs readily meets all of the criteria for this award. Since completing her PhD in 2004, she has become recognised as a stellar performer who is integral to MSPh's research profile. She has a passion for her research area - child public health - and has had a key role in a number of projects which have made a substantial difference at a community level and have contributed to the international evidence base in the area. Often these projects have involved the evaluation of complex interventions that involve a number of stakeholders, and Dr Gibbs has managed to apply rigorous methods in a consultative fashion. Dr Gibbs has an exceptionally strong track record and is clearly poised to develop a very strong national and international reputation. She sets a great example for those who work with her. her recent input into the School's DEECD tender was an important contributor to its success. Dr Gibbs easily meets the criteria for this award. her research has involved health promotion programs and their evaluation in local settings that is likely to have an impact on health outcomes as well as contributing to the development of health policy and professional practice (including internationally). her methods appear innovative. She has quickly achieved a good track record for publications, conference presentations including by invitation. She has been successful in attracting a large number of competitive research grants. During the last year, she has successfully led a large research team during of Professor liz Water's absence. These are all impressive achievements that contribute to the profile of MSPh. research Higher Degree (rHD) Supervisionawards criteria The extent and range of supervision activities.

Judges: Professor Nick Crofts, Professor John Mathews, Professor David Studdert and Professor David Dunt. award for excellence in research Higher Degree (rHD) Supervision associate Professor Marilys Guillemin (cHS) associate Professor Marilys Guillemin has shown evidence of supervision practices of the highest quality and a sustained record of outstanding supervision. She is to be particularly commended for her leadership of research in ChS, and for the academic and personal support she has provided for the graduate students who have benefitted from her supervision and mentoring. associate Professor Guillemin's extent and range of her supervision activities is exemplary with eight currently enrolled and 12 completed PhD students. her approach is interdisciplinary in focus. The outcomes for students have been excellent in terms of examiners' comments on their theses and later in terms of their publication of academic papers as well as take- up of academic careers. She has shown support for the development of her students as individuals, as judged by student testimonials as well as support for their later career development. her contribution to the development of excellent supervision practices within the MSPh, MDhS and the wider University is best appreciated from her leadership role within ChS and its large number of RhD students. associate Professor Guillemin has brought intense commitment and passion to her role as teacher, mentor and supervisor of postgraduate students, and has clearly communicated this to her numerous students, whose achievements she is rightly proud of. award for excellence in research Higher Degree Supervision associate Professor Jane fisher (centre for Women's Health, Gender and Society) associate Professor Jane Fisher has shown evidence of supervision practices of the highest quality and a sustained record of outstanding supervision. as coordinator of international programs in the CWhGS, she is to be commended most particularly for her mentorship and supervision of postgraduate students from developing countries, whose field-work has often had to be completed under very difficult social circumstances. associate Professor Fisher similarly has clearly fulfilled all criteria for this award. She has a wide experience of supervising RhD students, including international students for whom English is not their first language. almost all her students have attracted postgraduate research scholarships. her students have published and attended international conferences. She initiated a women's mental health peer review group which meets weekly and is attended by both staff and students at CWhGS. her students have gone on to take up academic careers. She has played a very important role within MSPh as Chair of its RhD Committee, which has introduced a number of new and valuable procedures relating to RhD students. associate Professor Fisher has clearly made a profound difference to the careers and lives of her numerous postgraduate students, with whom she has clearly forged long-term and ongoing relationships. highly useful and relevant research topics, carried through to outstanding conclusions. award for Knowledge Transfer awards criteria impact of knowledge transfer on health outcomes. impact of knowledge transfer on health policy or professional practice. impact of knowledge transfer on knowledge base (paradigm shift, opening up of a new approach, major discovery). Excellence in conceptualisation, development, execution and/or application of innovative and high quality knowledge transfer methods. any other relevant external testament or recognition of significance. Judges: Mr Jerry De la harpe, associate Professor Tony laMontagne, Professor David Studdert and Professor David Dunt. award for excellence in Knowledge Transfer achievement Professor ian anderson, Mr Shaun ewen, Ms odette Mazel, Ms erin nicholls, Ms caitlin ryan, Ms laura Thompson and the leaders in indigenous education (liMe) network (cHS) The work of the liME Network and its associated initiatives has been clearly delineated and described in this application, as have the significant and measurable impacts on both health outcomes and health policy, in improving the efficacy of teaching and learning of indigenous health in australasian medical education. The breadth and thrust of the activities of the liME Network, the implementation of the indigenous health Curriculum Framework (ihCF) and the opportunities offered by the Critical Reflection Tool, seem to have had an integrated and growing impact on improving indigenous health outcomes. indeed, this seems to be best illustrated by the exponential growth in the liME Network membership from 35 to 400 members over a two-year period. The liME Network is engaging with a wide array of key professional groups and stakeholders and, in doing so, making a real difference to health policy and practices that affect the indigenous population. The translational methodologies used are both convincing and effective. it has had demonstrable national and international impacts on policy and practice in the present, and has the potential to deliver on health impacts in the future - in particular in narrowing the disparities in health status between indigenous and non-indigenous australians (i.e., closing the gap). The impact of the liME Network is well recognised and really speaks for itself. it has made a very important contribution to tertiary indigenous health education in australia. its impacts cover all relevant criteria (health outcomes, health policy and professional practice, knowledge base and so on). The liME Project team has made a wonderful contribution to improving the quality of teaching and learning of indigenous health in australasia. award for excellence in Knowledge Transfer achievement Professor elizabeth Waters, Dr rebecca armstrong, Ms Jodie Doyle, Ms belinda Hall and Ms rachel clark (Mccaughey centre)Melbourne ScHool of PoP ulaTion HealTH SUMM aRy REPORT7 SUMM aRy REPORT They have demonstrated genuine translational capabilities with the conduct of the \"KT4lG (Knowledge Translation for local Government) trial\" and evidenced strong and abiding international links through which they have delivered a range of new health initiatives. Collectively, this is an impressive range of structured international relationships, where the applicants seem to be making a difference to health policy in both america and Europe. This is further evidenced by the invitation from the World health Organisation (WhO) to lead its \"Mainstreaming health Promotion\" project. Overall, the application highlights a number of local and international relationships that, prima facie, have strong translational relevance to health policy and outcomes. Moreover, they appear to be making a difference to the methodologies and approaches adopted in health reviews and the presentation of public health evidence. again the contribution of this Cochrane Collaboration Public health Group is extremely well recognised both in terms of published reviews, published protocols as well as protocols currently registered. Media monitoring of the Flexible Working Conditions review in the first month after it publication showed there were 200 stories both in australia and internationally. The publication record is impressive. The extension of Cochrane methodology to public health is a major achievement. Professor liz Waters and team have made a compelling case for the impacts of their knowledge transfer efforts in a number of related areas. The Cochrane Collaboration's Public health Review group is leading the field in terms of the integration of health equity perspectives into the systematic review process. Finally, the request from WhO to conduct a project on mainstreaming health promotion constitutes further evidence of their impact on policy and practice internationally. award for excellence in academic administration awards criteria Excellence in conceptualisation, development, execution and application of innovative and high quality methods. a record of excellent professional performance within the School. Demonstrated potential for further career development. Demonstrated leadership potential. The ability to be a good ambassador for the School. any other relevant external testament or recognition of significance. Judges: Ms Rebecca Bond, Dr Richard Frampton, Professor David Studdert and Professor David Dunt. award for excellence in academic administration Ms Joy Yeadon (centre for Health Policy, Programs and economics (cHPPe))Ms Joy y eadon is the heart and soul of ChPPE. She has been a tireless contributor to the MSPh since its inception, and to the Program Evaluation Unit before that. Ms y eadon is an inspiration to all of us. She shows us how coming to work every day and doing one's job does with diligence, intelligence, and selflessness can have a positive influence on many people and advance the work of the School. The evidence would suggest that Ms y eadon does show innovation, a tremendous example of a dedicated staff member with leadership potential and an ability to be a tremendous role model for other staff.award for excellence in academic administration Ms nancy Palamara (School executive) Ms Nancy Palamara demonstrates the use of high quality methods as part of her work for the School as well as great potential for future leadership. There are clear examples and testaments to her abilities in being an excellent ambassador for the school and her leadership potential is obvious. Ms Palamara is a quite remarkable School Finance Manager. Ms Palamara fitted in immediately, got her head around our finances and quickly gained the trust of all. MSPh's finances are very complicated to say the least. The job requires close attention to detail, including follow-up in order to address errors arising from a number of sources (often external). award for excellence in academic administration Mr brad Morgan (Mccaughey centre) Mr Brad Morgan's enthusiasm and dedication comes through, as does his commitment to his work and the McCaughey Centre. Mr Morgan has had three important roles within MSPh as a Centre Manager. his recent role in developing the MSPh's use of the Travel Portal is notable. Mr Morgan has contributed to the efficient running of both the McCaughey Centre and the School as a whole. With the recent Vichealth review of the McCaughey Centre, Mr Morgan has worked over and above what would be expected to model the future financial arrangements for the Centre. in relation to the School, Mr Morgan has worked collaboratively with the School Managers Group and his work on Electronic Document Management and the Travel Portal in particular has had both School, MDhS and University wide impact (the new ability for staff to attach files to purchasing card systems records is a result of the School's work in raising issues which Mr Morgan has been an integral part of). in relation to the Travel Portal, Mr Morgan is running School wide training sessions for staff and has been helping individual staff (not just within the Centre or MSPh) with managing this new process, has been responsible for raising issues with the Travel Portal team and his attention to detail has been invaluable in formulating new processes for the School to ensure our compliance for this area. Mr Morgan has demonstrated his leadership skills at many levels. award for excellence in academic administration Ms odette Mazel (cHS) Ms Odette Mazel has a role in a critical program and has demonstrated clearly a high level of innovation in her work and a very professional approach in a demanding area. Ms Mazel certainly meets the criteria in her conceptualisation, development, execution and application of innovative and high quality methods; the outcomes for the discipline area and work of liME within Onemda demonstrate this.

The other members of the panel were Professor annette Dobson, Professor David Roder and Professor Peter v isscher. The Centre thanks the members for their helpful and thoughtful contributions. The panel concluded that the Centre's contribution to research and teaching from 2005 to 2009 were outstanding, while making a number of recommendations that the Centre is addressing. as part of the review, the Centre developed a strategic plan for the period 2011-15 that has sections on teaching and learning, research training, research, engagement and organisation. a key component is a plan to improve performance in research training. we constituted a Centre advisory Committee during 2010. Members of the committee are Professor alistair w oodward (University of auckland), Dr Rosemary lester (Department of health, v ictoria), Professor John l ynch (University of adelaide), Professor Julian Peto (london School of hygiene and Tropical Medicine), and Professor Terry Nolan (head of School).

We will contribute to achieving this vision by excellent teaching, research training and research in epidemiology and biostatistics and by translating our research results into practice.Director of the Centre for Molecular, Environmental, Genetic and Analytic Epidemiology, Professor Dallas English. in 2010, the Centre continued to make major contributions to the teaching of the Melbourne School of Population health (MSPh), through delivery of subjects, coordination of four Masters degree programs, including the Master of Public health (MPh), and by playing a leading role in the redevelopment of the MPh following the closure of the v ictorian Consortium for Public health. The Centre has a large research program on the genetic epidemiology of cancer, particularly breast cancer, bowel cancer and melanoma that are funded by the United States of america's Government's National institutes of health (Nih) and the National health and Medical Research Council (NhMRC), and a major program of research on chronic respiratory disease, funded largely by NhMRC grants. in addition, it conducts research on malaria and has collaborations with the Murdoch Child health Research institute on food allergy in children and with the Cancer Council victoria on the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which is a study of genetics and lifestyle and risk of common chronic diseases of mid to late life. in 2010, staff of the Centre (including honorary staff) published 115 peer-reviewed papers in the scientific literature, continuing a long period of productive output. Most of these papers were published in Excellence in Research australia (ERa) a* and a journals, the highest ranked journals for the respective fields. Learning and t eaChing This year has been another successful year in teaching and learning. Our subjects have continued to attract a large number of postgraduate students and continued to obtain consistently high Quality of Teaching (QoT) scores. The number of students choosing an Epidemiology/Biostatistics stream and subjects within the MPh increased from 2009 to 2010. QOT results also improved in a number of Epidemiology and Biostatistics subjects. The focus for many of the Teaching and learning staff in MEGa Epidemiology was the planning for the teaching of Epidemiology and Biostatistics for the revised MPh , commencing in 2011. Plans MEG a32Melbourne School of PoP ulation health MEG a A new study confirming the temporal links between childhood eczema and rhinitis and adult-onset atopic asthma is highlighting the need to rigorously treat childhood allergies. Associate Professor Shyamali Dharmage says this is one of the key implications of new research from MEGA Epidemiology, within the Melbourne School of Population Health. This paper focused on childhood eczema and rhinitis as predictors of atopic (or allergy-triggered) and non-atopic adult asthma. It draws on the valuable resource of the T asmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS), which started in 1968 and profiled the asthma risk of almost all T asmanian children born in 1961. Associate Professor Dharmage is the lead investigator of TAHS, which continues to generate important insights into the complex causal links between childhood allergies and asthma. The lead author of this paper is Ms Pamela Martin, a PhD student based at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI) and jointly supervised between MCRI and MEGA Epidemiology. This paper is soon to be published in the influential Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the highest-ranking allergy journal. It advances international knowledge in this field with a series of notable 'firsts' . It is the first study to show a strong link between eczema and rhinitis measured in childhood, and atopic (allergy-triggered) current asthma at age 44. It is also the first to examine at the population level the relative contributions of combined eczema and rhinitis, with respect to persistent childhood asthma and new-onset asthma later in life. Importantly, it is the first to distinguish between atopic and non-atopic asthma and their occurrence after childhood eczema and rhinitis, as part of the sequence dubbed the 'atopic march' . Among the new study's very significant results was that having both eczema and rhinitis in childhood (before age seven) led to a nine-fold increased risk of current atopic adult asthma. The researchers estimate that up to 30% of current atopic asthma within the larger population sample could be attributed to a history of childhood eczema and rhinitis. The implications of this study are that prevention and rigorous treatment of childhood eczema and rhinitis may prevent adult asthma. Associate Professor Dharmage is concerned that there is less awareness of the importance treatment and prevention of eczema and hay fever, which may prevent potentially debilitating - or even fatal - health implications that lie ahead in adulthood. \"While adult asthma itself is a serious health issue it should also be noted that asthma itself is an established risk factor for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, \" she says. \"These chronic respiratory diseases lead to obstruction of lung function affecting quality of life and productivity as you age. \" T o prevent this sequence of events, interventions that can halt the march from childhood allergies to asthma need to be identified. A MEGA research team has completed a pilot study in 2010 to trial strategies for halting the atopic march. This was led by Research Fellow Dr Adrian Lowe and he will lead a larger trial in 2011. The aim of this work is to establish whether a ceramide-based cream can prevent babies developing eczema and improve their skin barrier function in early life, and thereby prevent subsequent development of asthma. If successful strategies to arrest the atopic march are identified, this could ultimately save lives and health care costs related to asthma management and treatment. In 2000, 454 deaths were attributed to asthma and the total health system cost of asthma was estimated to be $438 million.study Confirms eCzema-asthma Links Associate Professor Shyamali Dharmage.33were developed so the teaching of the core biostatistics and epidemiology material could be taught across the MPh, Master of Epidemiology and Master of Science (Epidemiology). The core subject Biostatistics (formerly a v ictorian Consortium for Public health subject called Statistics) was revised to integrate the direct teaching of ST aTa in computer-based laboratories to the large cohort of students enrolled in the relevant courses. hands on computer-based teaching had not been attempted on such a large scale in the MSPh previously. ahe core subject Epidemiology, which was previously taught by Monash University, is also newly developed for delivery in 2011. as part of this change the subjects of Epidemiology and analytic Methods 1 and 2 were taught for the final time in 2010. in 2010 we welcomed two new teaching staff members: Dr hazel Clothier, who is the subject coordinator for infectious Disease Epidemiology, and Dr Melissa Russell, who taught Study Design in Epidemiology in 2010 and is the new MPh Course Coordinator. Three commencing PhD students were awarded scholarships and Dr John Burgess won the MSPh PhD award for excellence for his PhD, which was completed in 2009. resear Ch Genetic epidemiology we received two grants (aRC and NhMRC) to develop new mathematical techniques, using sophisticated computer programming techniques, to study the role of genes on cancer risk and how to predict breast cancer from a mammogram. This research success highlights a new direction for the Centre in epidemiological research using bioinformatics. we received translation funding from the v ictorian Cancer association to conduct research to determine why men and women, when offered genetic testing for bowel cancer susceptibility, decline to do so, even though it may save their life. This research is critical to identify reasons preventing testing so access can be improved. Statistical Methods inference on causation from elimination of familial confounding (ice falcon)This year, headed by Professor John hopper, we have applied the statistical methods developed in the iCE F alCON project to binary data; parent reports of ever having had asthma/hay fever by age seven (or within two years), and of infantile eczema, for 3696 sibships from the 1968 Tasmanian asthma Study. all three traits had substantial familial associations, and were strongly associated with one another, and the sample size was sufficient for some conclusions to be made from applying the iCE F alCON method. The data were most consistent with eczema in infancy causing a proportion of hay fever with, and perhaps without, asthma in childhood. The association of infantile eczema with childhood asthma without hay fever does not appear to be causal or familial. we have also applied the iCE F alCON method to longitudinal twin data on continuously distributed variables, such as mammographic density, measured 10 years apart by the australian Twins and Sisters Mammographic Density Study. This showed that the data are most consistent with there being genetic factors that cause variation in age-adjusted mammographic density prior to the first measurement, which occurred after the age of 40 years. The data are also consistent with the second value of mammographic density for age, which is an established risk factor for breast cancer, being 'caused' by the first value. That is, there is high tracking (correlation in repeated measures in excess of 0.8). There was no evidence for familial factors causing any of the variation in changes in this risk factor between the two measures. These analyses suggest that the aspect of woman's breast cancer related to mammographic density is established early in life, and other data suggest this is possibly at the time of puberty. Genetic variants and cancer risk we have developed and used state-of-the-art statistical methods to estimate the risks of cancer associated with measured genetic variants. Many of our analyses are based on family data with incomplete genotyping. w e specialise in methods that account for the relatedness of family members and use this lack of genetic independence to enhance statistical power. w e have also extended these methods to give novel statistical tests for parent-of-origin effects and other non-classical genetic phenomena. w e published a number of papers using these methods in 2010, including papers that investigated: a parent-of-origin effect in l ynch syndrome; tumour morphology for breast cancer cases with BRCA1 promoter methylation; a novel high risk mutation in the breast cancer-associated gene PALB2; cancer risks for monoallelic MUTYH mutation carriers; gene by environment interactions in endometrial cancer risks; and cancer risks for MSH6 mutation carriers. improving analysis of Genome-Wide association Studies (GW aS) data This project involves applying ideas from information theory (e.g., minimum encoding inference) and modern logistic regression methods (the adaptive laSSO, non-negative garrote, etc.) to analysis of GwaS data. Together with National iCT australia limited (NiCT a), we are currently developing statistical algorithms for feature ranking and analysis of SNP x SNP interactions as well as marginal SNP effects. The new algorithms are applicable to ultra high dimensional data sets where the number of features is significantly higher than the sample size. The outcome of the project will be software implementing the aforementioned algorithms that will be deployed on the iBM Blue Gene supercomputer, with the help of iBM's supercomputing team. in addition, we are developing permutation-based test statistics for detection of SNPs that are drivers of multiple phenotypes; to date, we have worked on detecting SNPs that are associated with breast cancer as well as mammographic density. Model Selection and Parameter estimation This year Dr Enes Makalic and Dr Daniel Schmidt developed a new Bayesian analysis method for data sets comprising short sequences of correlated measurements from multiple participants, which is useful in certain longitudinal studies. w e have also studied the use of akaike's information Criterion (aiC) to test whether multiple exposures are associated with an outcome. This work has discovered an important flaw with the usual application of MEG a34aiC in this setting and was awarded the best paper award at an international machine learning and data-mining symposium. Further, we have examined modern regression techniques with application to logistic models as well as autoregressive time series models. Data mining and mammographic density in 2010 we began developing a prototype for automatic measurement of mammographic density called CiRRUS for the MaTlaB numerical computing platform. CiRRUS extracts a large number of features from raw mammograms and uses modern machine learning techniques to build predictive models for breast cancer risk. in case/control experiments based on several sets of real mammograms, CiRRUS was shown to be competitive with the current state-of-the-art semi-automated mammographic density measurement methods. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling of antimalarial drugs This year, headed by Dr Julie Simpson, we have developed a prototype for optimal sampling designs for population pharmacokinetic studies of the antimalarial drug, mefloquine, in adults, children and pregnant women. w e have also been validating a mechanistic model that describes the change in the parasite load over time in the presence of antimalarial drugs. Using this model, we have simulated data to identify which is the best antimalarial drug to be co-administered with a new antimalarial treatment that is currently being developed. staff high Lights Dr Melissa Russell commenced as the MPh coordinator in February 2010.

Paracetamol use in early life and asthma: prospective birth cohort study. British Medical Journal. 341: c4616. approximately 20% of australian children are affected by asthma. The prevalence of asthma has increased over the last 40-50 years, and the causes for it are largely unknown. Recently some groups have argued that treating young children with paracetamol has causes asthma. w e believe that this association is probably due to confounding by indication - respiratory tract infections are often treated with paracetamol, early life respiratory tract infections are a strong risk factors for childhood asthma. Using data from the Melbourne atopy Cohort study, a prospective birth cohort of 620 children with a family history of allergic disease, we observed that increasing paracetamol exposure in early life was associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood. however, this association disappeared when we adjusted for the frequency of infections. Furthermore, paracetamol given for non-respiratory illnesses was not associated with increased risk of childhood asthma. in conclusion, paracetamol in early life is unlikely to increase the risk of asthma.

Can early introduction of egg prevent egg allergy in infants? a population-based study. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010; 126:807-13. Egg allergy is the most common food allergy in infants and toddlers, affecting around 8% of infants in v ictoria. Until recently, international guidelines recommended that infants with a family history of allergy delay introducing foods such as egg, peanut and nuts until up to 2-3 years of age. Using data from the healthNuts study, a population-based study involving more than 2500 v ictorian infants, we found that infants introduced to cooked egg between 4-6 months of age were five times less likely to have egg allergy than those introduced to cooked egg after 10 months, irrespective of whether they had a family history of allergy. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods is unlikely to prevent food allergy and may even increase the risk. These findings were published in the top international allergy journal, the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Ms Natalie Tong joined us in the role of Finance & Resources Officer in ChS in 2010, where she is making a significant contribution to the organisational and financial administration of the Centre. in November 2010, we bid farewell to Dr Bill Genat, following his substantial contributions to the indigenous Public health Capacity Building project funded by the Commonwealth Department of health and ageing. On 29 June 2010, Onemda celebrated its 10 th anniversary at Graduate house. The event started with a Welcome to Country by aunty Joy Murphy Wandin and speeches by aunty l ynn Mcinnes and Professor Glenn Bowes, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and health Sciences (MDhS) associate Dean (Engagement). There were also performances by the Koori y outh Will Shake Spears and James henry. The day, attended by 150 invited community and university guests, was enjoyed by all. See pictures next page. We took this opportunity to launch a significant community report in Onemda's history: an Onemda Decade - Ten y ears of Progress in Koori health. The community report traces the beginnings of Koori health research at the University of Melbourne. it describes the collaborations that brought about the establishment of the Unit, and highlights major developments and projects in research, teaching and community development, since 1999. Copies are available in PDF format from our website at http:// www.onemda.unimelb.edu.au/ publications/reports.html or in hard copy from onemda-info@unimelb.edu.au Learning and Teaching Professor Janet McCalman and Dr James Bradley have continued to make substantiail contributions to the teaching and development of the breadth subjects in the University's New Generation undergraduate degrees. These subjects continue to attract a large number of students interested in health from a multidisciplinary perspective. With the commencement of the new four-year Doctor of Medicine program, ChS staff have been actively involved in curriculum development, particularly in the areas of ethics, social sciences, and indigenous health. This is occurring in parallel to the teaching out of the current medical program in which ChS staff have been keen contributors. at a School level, we have been involved in the development and teaching of the Master of health Social Sciences (MhSS), which commenced in 2010. Dr James Bradley is the inaugural course coordinator for the MhSS, and has led the recruitment and commencement of the first cohort of enthusiastic graduate students. in addition, ChS staff have been active contributors to the development of the new Master of Public health (MPh) degree, and collaborating with our School colleagues to develop a new flagship degree. PhD completions We are pleased to acknowledge and celebrate our strong record of attracting high quality PhD students. in 2010 we had a number of new students commence their PhD studies at the Centre. importantly, our completion rate for PhD students also remains high, with two PhD students successfully completing in 2010. This brings the total number of successfully completed PhD students at ChS to 40 since the Centre's establishment of its PhD program in 1999. Dr anna harris, whose PhD thesis was titled international medical graduates in the urban australian hospital: an ethnographic study, completed in 2010. She has also been nominated for the Chancellor's Prize for Excellence. Dr harris is currently undertaking a postdoctoral fellowship at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. Dr Ros MacDougall also completed in 2010 and her thesis was titled The ethical issues associated with medical internship and residency. Dr MacDougall is currently applying for postdoctoral fellowships to pursue her research. We congratulate Dr harris and Dr MacDougall and their supervisors on the successful completion and award of their PhD degrees. Our postgraduate student group continues with its significant contributions to the collegial life of the Centre. Ms Jenni livingston, Ms Kristen Moeller Saxone and Mr Michael livingston were active and enthusiastic postgraduate representatives for 2010, while undertaking their PhD studies. The group organised many successful activities and events; these included a monthly reading group, led by ChS academic staff members; a peer writing group designed to encourage students to write and provide feedback to each other on thesis chapters; a publishing workshop for students and staff led by Dr hans Baer; a training session on using Word for large documents; a seminar with ChS PhD alumni Dr Philomena horsley and Dr Nicky Welch on Is there life after the PhD?, as well as the annual Conversazione, where postgraduate students present their research work in an informal setting.

Drug and alcohol research program This significant and growing research program is led by Professor Robin Room, Professor Marcia langton, Dr Richard Chenhall and Dr Sarah Maclean. Their work includes research and training on policy relevant questions including: reviewing and building the evidence base for alcohol, tobacco and other drug (a TOD) policy initiatives; to provide leadership and build capacity to assess, analyse and inform communities on a TOD impacts and policies; and enhancing australia's profile in international a TOD policy research. Current activities involve research projects working with alcohol, tobacco and other drug issues with various communities, including indigenous and non-indigenous australia, as well as South-East asia and Europe. These studies involve a broad range of issues and methodological approaches with a focus on the a TOD policy impact research, studies of a TOD problems in general, as well as specific populations and a TOD policy and impact research in a global perspective. as part of this research program, Professor Robin Room, Professor Marcia langton and Dr Richard Chenhall presented at a well- attended seminar in September 2010. The topic of the seminar was Alcohol control: drinkers and sellers in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. australians, both indigenous and others, have been concerned about indigenous drinking since soon after Prohibition ended for indigenous australians half a century ago. Many remote indigenous communities have done their best to organise against the flood of alcohol, and governments have joined in, particularly since the howard Government's Northern Territory intervention. Meanwhile, there has been rising concern about drinking, particularly youthful intoxication, in the rest of australia, turning public attention back to issues of control of sellers as well as drinkers. KnOwLedge engageM enT The Centre for Excellence in indigenous Tobacco Control (CEiTC) was pleased to secure another three years of funding ($4.8 million) from the Commonwealth Department of health and ageing, until June 2013. CEiTC, which has been in operation since 2004, works to build national capacity for effective tobacco control to reduce the health, social and financial burden associated with tobacco use in aboriginal and Torres Strait islander communities. CEiTC's primary focus, achieved through a range of different of projects and activities, is in research, policy development and advocacy, with a particular emphasis on knowledge sharing. Going forward, CEiTC's attention has shifted towards developing and delivering training modules for an increased workforce of Tobacco action Workers, who are being employed as part of the Council of australian Governments $100 million agreement to tackle indigenous smoking. in December 2010 CEiTC delivered the first three-day induction training session in Canberra to 25 new Tobacco action Workers and Coordinators. Between 2010 and 2013, CEiTC will work on the indigenous arm of the international Tobacco Control (iTC) Policy Evaluation Project, along with the Menzies School of health Research and Professor Ron Borland from the Cancer Council australia. The iTC project is an international study to measure the impact that key tobacco control policies, which are part of an international agreement called the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control, have on adult smokers. 39CENTRE FOR hEalTh & S OCiETy KeY achieVeMenTS in October 2010 the leaders in indigenous Medical Education (liME) Project was awarded the MSPh a ward for Excellence in Knowledge Transfer.

This Catch 22 situation hints at the complexities ahead for the investigating team behind 'T rust me - I'm a researcher: The role of trust in human research enterprise' . The three-year project by the Centre for Health and Society got underway in 2010, funded by an ARC Discovery Project grant of $250,000. The topic's multi-linked layers and many potential avenues of exploration might partly explain why such an important area has been so under researched, both within Australia and overseas, says one of its co-investigators, Associate Professor Lynn Gillam. She believes the project could be a world first and have significant potential impacts on the practice and policies of research, nationally and internationally. In analysing trust and trustworthiness in human research, the project will particularly focus on the meaning and role of trust between researchers and research participants. The Centre's Director, Associate Professor Marilys Guillemin, Professor Doreen Rosenthal and Mr Paul Stewart are co-investigators. Unlike informed consent, a core component in ethics research that has been well defined, trust is much less tangible, Associate Professor Gillam says. It varies according to the perspective of the researcher or research participant concerned, and may change according to the context and over time. \"On some understandings of trust, it's really an emotion rather than a considered judgement, \" she says, \"and that emotion might be really difficult to shift. Even though people may have had bad experiences they may continue to trust. \" The relationship between trust and informed consent illustrates one of the many potential benefits of the project. In a previous ARC-funded study into human ethics research, the investigators had discovered it was fairly common for a research participant to decline the full information that was offered by the researcher in the process of obtaining a participant's informed consent; the participant preferred to trust the researcher. From an ethical standpoint, this made researchers uncomfortable, Associate Professor Gillam says. \"The researchers feel it puts all the responsibility back in their hands and the participants are saying 'yes' without really knowing what they are getting into. \"One of the specific things that could come out of this is a set of guidelines about how to manage that particular situation, \" she says. \"We could improve our understanding of what informed consent is about and how to do it well if we recognise that it's happening within this context of trust. At the moment it's pretty context free - that's one of the difficulties. \" The importance of context in understanding trust will be highlighted by case studies drawn from two areas: Indigenous research and research involving vulnerable participants, such as young or elderly people. But the investigators first must overcome that initial hurdle. \"We have to find researchers who are willing to trust us and make themselves a bit vulnerable because we're going to speak to their research participants . . . There will be lots of negotiation ahead. \" TruST M e - i'M a re Searcher Associate Professor Lynn Gillam. \"On some understandings of trust, it's really an emotion rather than a considered judgement. \"Melbourne School of PoP ulation health 41CENTRE FOR hEalTh & S OCiETy STaff high LighTS in 2010 Ms Ngarra Murray was honoured as an Emerging leader in the Fellowship for indigenous leadership program. This program assists those with a unique vision for improving the social, economic and emotional well-being of indigenous communities in Victoria. The Emerging leadership program aims to support exceptional people develop their leadership potential and to turn their vision for their community into reality. Recognising her great grandparents Pastor Sir Doug and lady Gladys Nicholls with a memorial led Ms Murray to discover other stories from the community about their family leaders and role models. Ms Murray is currently in the process of developing a publication of past Victorian aboriginal leaders from Victoria and a multi-media website with historical information, images and film. For Ms Murray, this project is about recognising and acknowledging family groups, traditional owners and community past leaders. She hopes that this will be a tool for young people to access information and learn about their family and leaders in their community. at the long Walk Women's luncheon in October 2010, attended by the Governor General, Ms Quentin Bryce aC, Ms Murray spoke about leadership and inspirational aboriginal women. Mr Shaun Ewen was appointed the inaugural MDhS associate Dean (indigenous Development); this is the first appointment of its kind nationally. The position is a reflection of the Faculty's commitment in relation to indigenous development (students, staff, research, teaching and learning, partnerships, symbols and cultural recognition), and is an acknowledgement of Mr Ewen's leadership in this area. We were delighted to celebrate with Dr Therese Riley on her well- deserved promotion to Senior lecturer. associate Professor Jane Freemantle was awarded a 2010 Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and health Sciences annual Excellence award for Contribution to Equity and Staff Development. The award was presented by the Dean, MDhS, Professor James angus, at the 2010 MDhS Equity and Staff Development (ESD) Forum.

Melbourne School of PoP ulation health 42CENTRE FOR hEalTh & S OCiETy A simple 'before and after' comparison charts the impact of Onemda over its first decade. This milestone was achieved in 2010 as its inaugural Director, Professor Ian Anderson, moved on to fresh challenges. Before Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit started in 1999, the six-year program for University of Melbourne medical students included just one two-hour lecture on Aboriginal health. T en years later, Indigenous health is embedded in teaching and academic health agendas, within the University and nationally, thanks largely to Onemda's efforts. Its achievements have been recognised in 2010 with the Norman Curry Award for Innovation and Excellence in T eaching and Learning. Professor Anderson, who headed both Onemda and the Centre for Health and Society within the Melbourne School of Population Health, stepped down as Director of the Centre to become Director of the University's Murrup Barak Melbourne Institute for Indigenous Development in November 2009. In leaving Onemda, he reflected on its early priorities and pioneering leadership of Indigenous health education and research. \"When Onemda was established there was no prior focus within the Faculty around Aboriginal health. It was really important to build the relationships to make this happen within the Aboriginal community and the community agencies, \" he said. \"The second thing was to develop a focus around teaching and learning. \" He likened the integration of Aboriginal health into teaching and learning across the curriculum to \"a narrative thread\" that students could follow through the various programs, and cited the appointment of Shaun Ewen as the University's first senior lecturer in Aboriginal health as a significant milestone.At a national level he pointed to Onemda's influential role in brokering agreements covering Indigenous health content in medical training. By working with the peak body, Medical Deans Australia and New Zealand, Onemda drove the development of a national curriculum framework for Aboriginal health and medical education. This led to the evolution of the LIME (Leaders in Indigenous Medical Education) network, a project he cites as being \"particularly challenging\" but the most rewarding. LIME now operates within all the medical schools, providing a forum to meet and exchange best practice. Onemda has also built a research profile with a particular focus on work in the child health, chronic diseases and workforce space, he said. This has involved national collaborations through the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health. At a personal level, he found it deeply rewarding to have Onemda provide a mentoring role for the growing number of Aboriginal students. \" And we've had a small number of Aboriginal students who were PhD students within Onemda and that has been great to see them move on and become successful. \" His role at Murrup Barak \"broadens the canvas\" , he said. \"One major achievement in 2010 was to have the University agree to a draft reconciliation action plan - that's a fantastic place to start. \" \"We now have the University making a broad commitment to Indigenous development that aligns with the core business of the University and all faculties have a role to play. \" Professor Anderson paid tribute to Onemda staff in building collaborative relationships with diverse communities, from Aboriginal to academic and research interests. \"The capabilities that exist within Onemda have been profoundly important. \" \"I wish all my colleagues at Onemda the very best and it has been an enormous privilege to have worked with them. \"OneMda SeTS indigen OuS heaLTh agenda The inaugural Director of Onemda , Professor Ian Anderson. \"We now have the University making a broad commitment to indigenous development. \" CENTRE FOR hEalTh & S OCiETy 43Year's overview 2010 was another highly successful year for the Centre in teaching, research and knowledge exchange. in November 2010 we underwent our quinquennial review. The review panel included Professor Ruth Fincher (Chair), Professor Glenn Bowes, Professor Dorothy Broom, Professor Martha hickey and Professor Robert Power. The review committee's report was very complimentary, noting in particular the strength of our multi-disciplinary research and our incorporation of gender-focused studies as well as women's health. The report recommended the continuation of the Centre for a further five years before it is reviewed again; a recommendation that was unanimously endorsed by the Faculty Executive Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and health Sciences. as part of the review process we developed a five-year strategic plan in the areas of research, teaching and learning, knowledge exchange and governance, which we are now implementing. last year we were re-designated as a World health Organisation (WhO) Collaborating Centre in Women's health and have developed a workplan with them in the fields of disability, violence and women's health; research capacity building in the region; teaching; and technical advice. This is a fine achievement for the CeNTre For wo MeN's HeaLTH, G eNDer aND so CieTY wHo Collaborating Centre for w omen's Health aNNUaL rePorT 2010 CENTRE'S VISION STATEMENT T o improve women's health and the health of their families and communities by contributing to knowledge about the effects on health and well-being of gender inequity and other social, economic, cultural, psychological and biological factors. CENTRE'S MISSION T o be recognised as an international leader in research, teaching and knowledge exchange about women's health, gender, and society and the leading academic centre in the Asia-Pacific.Director of the Centre for Women's Health, Gender and Society, Professor Anne Kavanagh. Centre and, in part, reflects the leadership that associate Professor Jane Fisher has provided in our international work over the past two years. We continue to have a strong record of success in competitive grant funding. Some highlights include the awarding of three australian Research Council (aRC) linkage projects led by Dr Rebecca Bentley (Housing, Employment and Health), associate Professor Jane Fisher (Fertility Management in Australia) and Professor anne Kavanagh (Gender, Socio-Economic Disadvantage, Mental Health & Disabilities). associate Professor Jane hocking and associate Professor Jane Fisher are lead investigators on two new National health and Medical Research Council (NhMRC) grants, Evaluation of the effectiveness of chlamydia testing in general practice and Matters to women diagnosed with breast cancer during their reproductive years. We have been awarded many other grants and consultancies in collaboration with staff at the Melbourne School of Population health (MSPh), the University and externally. More details of our research achievements are described below in our four theme areas: Cancer and Preventative health; Gender and health inequities; Mental health and Wellbeing; and Sexual and Reproductive health. Learning and Teaching as part of the Centre review process, the review committee assessed the teaching and learning offerings of the Centre between 2005 and 2009. The Centre was found to have high student satisfaction with content of courses, subjects taught and quality of teaching. in addition, staff were commended for showing initiative in proposing and preparing new subjects. however, the Master of Women's health (Japanese) that has been delivered in Japanese in both Japan and australia since 1992 was found not to be viable in the long term, and it was recommended that the Centre consider its future role in this course. We also had the opportunity as part of the review process to devise a five-year strategic plan for teaching and learning, which will guide out activities over the coming years. as well as CENTRE FOR WOMEN'S hEalTh, GENDER a ND SOC iETy44Melbourne School of PoP ulation health CENTRE FOR WOMEN'S hEalTh, GENDER a ND SOC iETy The Centre for Women's Health, Gender and Society is using an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Grant to reveal an untold story. According to Professor Anne Kavanagh, the Centre's Director, there has been little Australian research on the mental health of people with disabilities. The Centre's new research project adds a deeper dimension by examining the importance of gender and socio-economic disadvantage for the mental health of people with disabilities. \"If we can tell a coherent story we can use this as a real way of advocating for change, by providing evidence to support policy and service sector reform, \" she says. \"People in the disability sector have been crying out for this kind of information. They have been telling these stories for a long time and to have some empirical evidence can only help in their endeavours. \" Collaborating partners in the project are Melbourne Citymission, VicHealth and the Victorian Women With Disabilities Network. The project also aims to use the ARC's four-year $200,000 grant to build research capacity in disability-related research and improve the monitoring of disability-related health inequities. \"Disabilities have been a forgotten driver of inequality, \" Professor Kavanagh says. \"Mostly we think of disabilities as the medical condition, a kind of outcome, but I would argue that, for lots of reasons, disabilities are also a cause of poor health. \" People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty because they have less access to the labour market, are more likely to live in poor quality housing and be unable to use transport, she says. \"There's something about the way society is organised that disadvantages these people in ways that then have important effects on their health. \" Professor Kavanagh says it is very important to maintain a gendered understanding of disability and ill health; the project will explore these links. \"We know that women are more likely to have mobility impairments than men, partly because they live longer and are therefore more likely to develop impairments such as osteoporosis, arthritis and vision problems, \" she says. \"In the general population, we know women are more likely than men to live in poverty, to experience insecure employment and poorer quality housing. \" \"The fact that they are more likely to experience both disability and disadvantage is a double whammy for women and likely to be important in describing women's health. \" The project will mostly draw on existing data sources, including Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys and the longitudinal study of Household Income and Labour Dynamics of Australia (HILDA) Survey. Researchers will also interview people with disabilities. Professor Kavanagh expects the research results to be \"really profound\" . \"Preliminary analysis suggests that is the case. \" She hopes the project will help drive reforms in this area. \"There is emerging stronger advocacy for the disability sector and we certainly are getting a lot more advocacy and media attention around mental health. So I think the time is right to push this kind of agenda. \"Projec T To Link gender, menT aL heaLTh and disabi LiTy \"There's something about the way society is organised that disadvantages these people in ways that then have important effects on their health. \"45continuing to offer a high quality teaching and learning experience for our students, we aim to provide more staff with the opportunity to gain and practice skills in teaching, and to continue to take advantage of opportunities to collaborate on MSPh or Faculty teaching initiatives. coursework t eaching We played an active role in the redesign of the Masters of Public health (MPh) and will be an integral part of the teaching staff in the Masters of health Social Sciences to be introduced for the first time in 2011. The Centre will be responsible for the delivery of the core subject, Surveys and Qualitative Methods. Subjects taught in 2010 in either the MPh, or the MhSS were: 505-991 Gender and Health; Women Global Health; 505-994 Behaviour Society and Health; and 505-986 Social Analysis in Health 1. We also had four students undertaking 505-947 Research Project in Women's Health. Their topics included the experiences of female sex workers living with aiDS in Semarang, indonesia, the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy among indigenous women of the Chittagong hill Tracts, Bangladesh, and an analysis of gender in evidence on the health needs of asylum seekers and refugees. a further two students completed their advanced Medical Science year at the Centre (Public Health Perspectives in Women's Health), including a supervised research project and coursework. Japanese Masters Program in 2010, Women and Ageing and Women's Health in Asia and the Pacific were both delivered to students enrolled in the Master of Women's health (Japanese). research cancer and Preventative health Centre staff conduct a wide range of research on cancer, including studies on breast cancer, colorectal and cervical cancer as well as other human papillomavirus (hPV) related cancers. in 2010, Dr louise Keogh in collaboration with associate Professor Mark Jenkins, Dr louisa Flander and Dr Clara Gaff received funding from the Victorian Cancer agency to conduct qualitative research into what people in mutation-carrying families understand about bowel cancer gene testing, personal risk and prevention behaviours. Dr Keogh presented pilot data on this topic at both the Collaborative Groups of the americas in Dallas, Texas, in October, and the Familial Cancer, Research and Practice meeting in New South Wales (NSW) in august. Dr Keogh was invited to speak about genetic testing and insurance at the Clinical Oncological Society of australia's (COSa) annual Scientific Meeting, \"Cancer and Beyond\", in November. Dr Keogh also led international collaboration looking at the disclosure of genetic research results in the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR), through her role as the Chair of the Translational Working group of the Colon CFR. Results of this research were presented at the meeting of Collaborative Group of the americas on inherited Colorectal Cancer in October in Dallas.Professor anne Kavanagh, Dr Carolyn Nickson and Ms Kate Mason continued a program of epidemiological work on the efficacy of the BreastScreen australia program, in collaboration with Professor Dallas English, from the Centre for MEGa Epidemiology, and Dr Graham Byrnes, from the international agency for Research on Cancer. Professor Kavanagh continued her involvement as Chief investigator (Ci) on the National Breast Cancer Foundation lifepool project, which started to recruit BreastScreen Victoria participants into a longitudinal study of breast cancer risk. This research is in collaboration with investigators from the Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, BreastScreen Victoria, the Royal Women's hospital and the Melbourne School of Population health's Centre for MEGa Epidemiology. Professor Kavanagh leads the stream in this study that is investigating how mammographic density affects accuracy of screening and how screening policies might be adapted to improve screening outcomes for women with higher breast density. Dr Nickson continued to lead a research program in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science Software Engineering and the Commonwealth Scientific and industrial Research Organisation's (CSiRO's) australian e-health Research Centre and Centre for informatics, Mathematics and Statistics to devise and test image processing methods to automatically characterise breast density from mammograms. This work was funded by the Victorian Breast Cancer Research Consortium with in-kind contributions from the CSiRO. Dr Nickson also began new collaborations with BreastScreen Victoria and the Medical imaging & Radiation Sciences Faculty Research Group at the University of Sydney to examine how breast radiologists perceive and are affected by dense breast tissue. She presented methods and findings at a range of forums, including CSiRO agencies, the Cancer Council NSW and the international meeting 'Why Study Mammographic Density? a Plan for Future Research and action', for which she was a member of the Scientific Committee. The Centre also contributed to studies of hPV and cancer. associate Professor Jane hocking was an investigator on an aRC linkage grant led by University of New South Wales (UNSW) using mathematical modeling techniques and analysis of existing cancer notification data to explore the potential impact of hPV vaccination on cancers, including cervical cancer, anal cancer and head and neck cancers. Dr Nickson worked on mathematical modelling of hPV and cervical cancer in the context of vaccination and screening with a group based at the Cancer Council NSW. This team was awarded a NhMRC Project Grant to expand this work from 2011, with Dr Nickson as a Ci. Sexual and reproductive health This research theme explores the sexual and reproductive health of young people, sexually transmitted infections and their impact on the lives of young australian men and women, with a particular focus on chlamydia and hPV infection, and the development and evaluation of health promotion programs for pregnancy and early parenthood. associate Professor Jane hocking leads a large international and national team on a Commonwealth Department of health CENTRE FOR WOMEN'S hEalTh, GENDER a ND SOC iETy46and ageing (Doha) project - the australian Chlamydia Control Effectiveness Pilot (aCCEPt). This world first project is being conducted as a randomised controlled trial and aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an organised program of annual chlamydia testing in general practice. General Practice (GP) clinics will receive a multifaceted intervention designed to facilitate increased chlamydia testing in general practice. aCCEPt received additional funding from the NhMRC to fund an extension of the intervention period until end of 2014. Until the end of 2010, GP clinics in 20 postcodes in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland had been recruited to participate in aCCEPt. aCCEPt employs a research team of eight research staff based in Melbourne (Dr Simone Poznanski, Dr Dyani lewis, Ms Chantal Maloney, Dr Jennifer Walker, Ms Eris Smyth, Ms alaina Vaisey, Ms anna Wood), one research officer based in Wangaratta (Ms anne Shaw), Victoria, and a further two research staff based at UNSW in Sydney (Ms lisa Edwards, Ms Rebecca lorch). The design of aCCEPt was presented 12 th international Symposium of human Chlamydial infections in Salzburg in June. The Chlamydia incidence and Re-infection Rates Study (CiRiS) is also headed by associate Professor hocking in collaboration with Professor Christopher Fairley at the Sexual health Unit, MSPh, and other investigators from the Department of General Practice at the University of Melbourne, UNSW and australian National University. Dr Jenny Walker is completing her PhD on CiRiS based at the Centre. This prospective cohort study of young australian women aged 16 to 25 years aimed to determine the incidence of chlamydia infection and was completed in early 2010. This study has generated australia's first community-based estimates of chlamydia incidence and chlamydia re-infection rates, important to determining the optimal interval for chlamydia screening. associate Professor hocking also leads a research project examining the impact of chlamydia on the sexual, reproductive and mental health of Victorians and their health care system. Dr Danielle Newton, a research fellow, coordinates this project and associate Professor Jane Fisher and Dr louise Keogh are also investigators on this project. Gender and health inequities This research theme concentrates on how various social determinants of health, including housing, employment, place, disability and socio-economic position, influence health with a concentration on the ways in which gender and gender relations intersect with each of this determinants. 2010 was the last year of the NhMRC Capacity Building Grant: The australian health inequities program (ahiP), which we held jointly with Flinders University. Over the course of the grant we developed new collaborations in the fields of housing and health and work and health, which have led to the awarding of several major grants. Dr Rebecca Bentley continues her work in the field of housing and health, with strong collaborations with hanover Welfare Services, Vichealth and adelaide University. This has included the production of a major report on housing on health in australia, to be launched by Vichealth in 2011. an aRC linkage grant awarded in 2010 will examine the relationships between precarious housing, employment and health. Professor anne Kavanagh is developing a program in the field of gender, disability and health. One of her interests is in how we improve the monitoring of health inequities related to disability. She prepared a report for Vichealth documenting the routine databases that have collected information on disability and developed recommendations how progress could be made in increasing the availability of sex-disaggregated data on disability. Professor Kavanagh was awarded an aRC linkage grant on gender, disadvantage, disability and mental health in collaboration with researchers from the MSPh, adelaide University, hanover Welfare Services, Women with Disabilities Victoria, and Vichealth. This grant will assess the extent to which the poorer health of people with disabilities may be shaped by the considerable social and economic disadvantage in which they live. in particular, it will focus on how gender shapes the health experiences of people with disabilties. Work continues on aspects of the built environment and health behaviours and cardio-metabolic diseases. Of particular interest is the impact of retail, recreation and transportation local environments. We place a strong emphasis on how the associations between the built environment and health outcomes differ for women and men. This work is conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the Baker iDi heart and Diabetes institute as well as Deakin, harvard and Monash universities and the Queensland University of Technology. Women's Mental health and emotional Wellbeing This program of work includes research projects investigating factors affecting mental health at the individual level (unplanned pregnancy and abortion, exposure to trauma, social correlates of mental health service usage, and mental illness labelling), at the health service level (assisted reproductive technology, pregnancy advisory services, prenatal genetic screening, caesarean section) and at the community level (reproductive decision-making, workplace discrimination during pregnancy and mainstreaming mental health in primary care). The program also includes evaluation research for primary prevention (a universal psycho-educational program for first-time parents of newborns) and secondary prevention (early parenting services, social work program for disadvantaged clients of early parenting services and psycho-educational intervention for pregnant survivors of trauma). it has a growing focus on the mental health of women living in resource-constrained low and lower-middle income settings, including the prevalence and determinants of perinatal mental health problems in women in rural Vietnam, and health service use, mental health and maternal and infant health in rural Pakistan. Outcomes of this program include the development, evaluation and knowledge exchange in varied health care settings and the community, and of interventions addressing key modifiable social Melbourne School of PoP ulation health CENTRE FOR WOMEN'S hEalTh, GENDER a ND SOC iETy47determinants to improve mental health in diverse groups of women during the childbearing year. in May a group of academics and research higher degree students in the group presented a symposium, Challenging myths about women's sexual and reproductive mental health: New evidence across the life course from the Centre for Women's Health, Gender and Society, The University of Melbourne. it included evidence from eight studies that had used diverse methods and included in total more than 8000 women. Together they demonstrated that myths about women's psychological functioning and emotional wellbeing - including their freedom to chose when, if and how many children to have; capacity to form protective attachments to their foetuses; access to maternity leave and entitlements; the causes of emotional distress after childbirth and responsibility for homelessness - are not supported by the evidence. Projects have been initiated and conducted with international, national, state and community partners, including the World health Organisation, the United Nations Population Fund, the Research and Training Centre for Community Development in hanoi, the australian Government Department of Families, housing, Community Services and indigenous affairs, beyondblue the national depression initiative, the Victorian Departments of health and Education and Early Childhood Development, the Royal Women's hospital, Melbourne iVF, the Murdoch Childrens Research institute, Tweddle Child and Family health Services, the Parenting Research Centre, the Salvation army, the Council to homeless Persons, Melbourne Citymission and the Family access Network. communi Ty acTiviTies The Centre continues to have a strong focus on interactions with our key stakeholders, with some examples here. in May, a large number of staff and students presented at the National Women's health Conference in hobart on a range of topics related to women's mental health, women's sexual and reproductive health, and gender and health inequities. in June, Professor anne Kavanagh delivered the lecture Health inequity: where does gender fit in? in the Dean's lecture series. in relation to her work on the insurance implications of genetic testing, Dr louise Keogh spoke at a combined meeting of the Royal Melbourne and austin hospitals Family Cancer Centres. Dr Keogh also appeared in a panel discussion on Feminism and Motherhood organised by facebook group, Cherchez La Femme, at the Fox hotel, Collingwood, in august.. Dr Maggie Kirkman was invited to present a paper on children's experiences of homelessness at the conference on Current Research and advocacy Projects from the Not-For-Profit Sector, hosted by the RMiT School of Global Studies, Social Science and Planning, RMiT University. Staff have also appeared in print media and on radio in relation to a number of key women's health issues, including abortion and chlamydia infections. inviTed conference and Pub Lic Presen TaTions, 2010 bentley r and Baker E .

Delivering sexual health promotion to young people in Australia via text messaging. BMC Public health 10: 792 advances in communication technologies have dramatically changed how individuals access information and communicate. Recent studies have found that mobile phone text messages (SMS) can be used successfully for short-term behaviour change. however there is no published information examining the acceptability, utility and efficacy of different characteristics of health promotion SMS. This paper presents the results of evaluation focus groups among participants who received 12 sexual health related SMS as part of a study examining the impact of text messaging for sexual health promotion to young people in Victoria.

Computer reminders for chlamydia screening in general practice: a randomised controlled trial. Sexually Transmitted Diseases. 37(7):445-50. as chlamydia diagnoses continue to increase in australia and other developing countries, research is needed to investigate different methods for increasing chlamydia screening in an attempt to control continued transmission. This paper describes the results of a randomised controlled trial that aimed to determine whether a computer alert in a patient's electronic medical record could prompt a doctor to increase chlamydia testing among young women in general practice. This trial found a 30% increase in chlamydia testing associated with the alert. This intervention is now being used in a large national trial of chlamydia screening in general practice funded by the Department of health and a geing and the National health and Medical Research Council. inTerna Tiona L visiTors Dr Kelly hobbs, Department of Psychology, Sheffield University, United Kingdom.

The Centre is supported by and works closely with VicHealth, which defines mental health as 'the embodiment of social, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. Mental health provides individuals with the vitality necessary for active living, to achieve goals and to interact with one another in ways that are respectful and just' .Acting Director of the McCaughey Centre, Associate Professor Tony LaMontagne. and service delivery agencies and in other culturally diverse contexts. The Centre hosts a number of major research, policy and knowledge exchange initiatives, including Community indicators Victoria, the Cochrane Collaboration Public health Review Group and the Jack Brockhoff Child health and Wellbeing Program. in mid-2010, the McCaughey Centre underwent a review of its performance and achievements in the period from 2006 to 2010. The review examined the Centre's activities in research, teaching and workforce development, and knowledge translation and exchange, as well as its organisational achievements. The review was successful and resulted in a further six years of Vichealth funding for specified Centre activities, with step-down funding starting at an equal amount to its foundation period (2006-2011) in 2011, stepping down to zero funding in 2017, by which time the Centre is expected to have alternate sources of funding. The diversity of Centre funding has been growing steadily over time. By 2009, more than half of external funding came from sources other than the Vichealth Centre grant, and this continues to grow. The Centre has also seen much change amongst its leadership staff over the past year. Professor John Wiseman, Foundation Director of the Centre, moved on to a new position within the University in late 2010. Professor Wiseman led the Centre from its beginnings in 2006. During his time as Director, he worked to build an inclusive and supportive working environment, and truly embodied the Centre's focus on 'knowledge for the common good' through his research on community wellbeing, and the health impacts of climate change. in recent years, Preofessor Wiseman has formed links with several climate change research centres both within and outside the University, and will continue research in this area in his new position. also due to depart the Centre in June 2011 is Dr Marion Frere, the Centre's first Deputy Director. Dr Frere has led the research in the area of reducing violence as an upstream MCCaUGhEy CENTRE52Melbourne School of PoP ulation health MCCaUGhEy CENTRE There are two ways to tell the story of the evolution of the McCaughey Centre from an idea in 2006 to a significant national and international centre for research on community wellbeing, says its inaugural director, Professor John Wiseman. \"The first way is to talk about the numbers, about the 120 research and evaluation projects worth about $30 million, the 10 National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and seven Australian Research Council (ARC) projects on which Centre staff have been Chief Investigators, the more than 130 peer reviewed publications and over 80 research reports, \" says Professor Wiseman. \"That's the story of outputs and products. \"But the other way to talk about our achievements is in relation to the key areas of work that the Centre focuses on, about how we've been able to build the Centre as a significant platform for research on the key social and economic determinants of community wellbeing. \"When we think about population health, when we talk about health promotion, it's important to understand the social, economic and mental drivers And it's the translation of that research by the Centre that has driven debate. \" Professor Wiseman stepped down from the role of Director of the McCaughey Centre in September 2010. He remains a Professorial Fellow with both the Melbourne School of Population Health, and the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute at the University of Melbourne, where he is concentrating on work around climate change. The McCaughey Centre started with a staff of two - Professor Wiseman and Centre Manager Ms Janine Campbell - and grew to a staff of 17 by its official launch in 2007 . By the end of 2010, it had 34 academic and four professional staff, as well as 10 honorary fellows. Professor Wiseman said the initial research priorities of the Centre included reducing violence and discrimination, increasing social inclusion and addressing the impacts of work stress. The Centre added to this with the Community Indicators Victoria project, providing information about the wellbeing of communities across the state. Then came the group of researchers working on child health and wellbeing, leading to the establishment of the $5 million Jack Brockhoff Child Health and Wellbeing Program. \"For me, what stands out has been the privilege of working with such a great range of researchers and policy thinkers who were really dedicated and committed to improving health equity and wellbeing. It has been inspiring. It has also been terrific to work within the context of the Melbourne School of Population Health, which brings together such a fine mix of people with those commitments. \" And I want to put on record my great appreciation for the initial and ongoing support of both the School and VicHealth, which both gave a very strong endorsement of the Centre in the review process in the middle of 2010. \" Professor Wiseman says the focus on climate change in his new role is a natural extension of his work at the McCaughey Centre. \"I share the view put by the Lancet that climate change is one of the, if not the most, significant heath challenges of the 21st century. I want to focus on developing a better informed public debate on the range of plans and strategies for reducing carbon emissions, and in particular how to get them implemented as opposed to just talked about. \"centre's development much more than a numbers game Founding McCaughey Centre director, Professor John Wiseman (front row, second from right) with the Centre's patron, Dr Jean McCaughey, and Centre staff at its launch in July 2007 .53determinant of mental health and community wellbeing. She has been instrumental in building a vibrant network of family violence research collaborators across the university and in undertaking policy-relevant research on family violence reform. Dr Frere also contributed to the development of Community indicators Victoria, and has recently contributed to the development of the Melbourne School of Population health's (MSPh) new Master of Public health (MPh) program, as well as the School's short course in Population health, developed in partnership with the North Western Metropolitan Region of the Department of health. The McCaughey Centre's new director, Professor Billie Giles-Corti, will commence in July 2011. Professor Giles- Corti comes to us from the Centre for the Built Environment and health at the University of Western australia (UW a), where she was Foundation Director. She is nationally and internationally recognised for her research into environmental factors impacting on community wellbeing and physical, social and mental health. Closely aligning with the goals of the McCaughey Centre, Professor Giles-Corti's key focus is on building knowledge about the social, economic and environmental foundations of community wellbeing. The next few months will bring an exciting time of renewal for the McCaughey Centre, as we welcome Professor Giles-Corti and enter into a new phase in the Centre's history. research in 2010 McCaughey Centre staff produced more than 40 peer reviewed publications and more than 20 non-peer reviewed publications, including a range of research and policy reports. Centre staff also successfully applied for several new research projects and contracts. a range of examples of project achievements and impacts are included below. teaching and Workforce d evelopment The Centre has 10 PhD students currently enrolled, plus two more submitted their PhDs for examination in 2010. in addition, McCaughey Centre academic staff are involved in the co-supervision of over 25 Research higher Degree students across the University of Melbourne and other national and international universities. McCaughey Centre staff have given guest lectures in University of Melbourne postgraduate course work subjects, as well as contributing to the supervision of numerous postgraduate course work theses. Staff have contributed to subjects in the new MPh, as well as courses across the University and at other local universities. During 2010 Centre staff were responsible for developing and running short courses on the following topics: Population health (in partnership with the Department of health in the North West Metropolitan Region). Race, Culture, indigeneity and the Politics of Public health. an introduction to Evidence-informed Public health.knoWledge t ranslation and e xchange in 2010 Centre staff were responsible for many invited public lectures and conference presentations. The McCaughey Centre Seminar Series presented 14 seminars. in addition some staff were engaged in media advocacy, and Centre research has influenced national and other policy (see examples below and in Publication highlights). Centre staff are members of a range of advisory Committees and Boards, including: Foundation house, Dental Sector Capacity Building, Project advisory Group. Douta Galla Community health Services, Talking about Teeth. National Oral health Clearinghouse, Developing Evidence- based Oral health Measures. Vichealth advisory Committee on the Prevention of Violence against Women. Windermere Child and Family Services Board. Centre staff have also been involved in the organisation of a number of research conferences and symposia, including: a symposium on Researching Refugees and asylum Seekers - Ethical Considerations. This symposium took place in November at the University of Melbourne, and was attended by approximately 100 people. a one-day workshop in May on identification and Response to Perpetrators of Family Violence, which brought together international and national experts on perpetrators to speak and workshop with service providers from across australia. a seminar and meeting between Family Violence: actioning interdisciplinary Research (F aiR) and the National association for Preventing Child abuse and Neglect (NaPCaN), as part of child protection week in May. program a rea a chievements Freedom from violence Safety and accountability in families: evidence and research (Safer) This five-year australian Research Council (aRC) linkage project (2007-2012) on learnings from Victorian Family Violence reforms is being undertaken in partnership with the Department of Social Work and the School of Social and Political Sciences at Melbourne University and the Department of Social Work, Monash University. it is funded by an aRC linkage Grant and industry Partners are the Departments of Planning and Community Development, human Services, Justice and Victoria Police. in 2010, SaFER undertook a statewide survey on integrated governance of service delivery in family violence and undertook supported questionnaires with over 130 women who had recent experiences of family violence. family Violence: actioning interdisciplinary research (fair) The F aiR initiative draws together research and evaluation capacity from across the University of Melbourne to prevent and respond to family violence. in 2010 F aiR hosted a major event on the identification and Response to Perpetrators of Family Violence. The one-day workshop brought together over 150 participants MCCaUGhEy CENTRE54from diverse backgrounds (international experts and local service providers) to further thinking on how best to respond to perpetrators in an integrated family violence system. interdisciplinary Seed Grant - intimate Partner Violence and Women's economic Securityintimate partner violence is a major health, social and economic issue with long-term implications for individual women, their children, families and communities and for society as a whole. The cost of violence against women and their children to australia's economy has been estimated at $13.6 billion in 2008-09 *, with nearly one in six women having experienced violence by a current or previous partner in their lifetime. Most will also have been employed at the time of the violence. Women who have experienced intimate partner violence are at risk of low income jobs, disrupted employment, inadequate income support and homelessness even though they may have work histories that are as established as non-abused women. intimate partner violence also manifests itself in the workplace in numerous ways, which have yet to be fully explored in the australian context. This study will examine the consequences of intimate partner violence for women and their dependent children in relation to: health and wellbeing; social and financial security; pathways to employment, training and education; and experiences of employment.(* Commonwealth of australia (2009) The Cost of Violence against Women and their Children, The National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, Department of Families, housing, Community Services & indigenous affairs.) Freedom from discrimination the economic costs of racism in australia This project is designed to produce sustainable benefits to australian society through the provision of important data needed to promote investment in strategies to address race-based discrimination. This will benefit the lives of individuals experiencing race-based discrimination, including those from indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. it will also benefit society as a whole through promotion of social cohesion and community connectedness and the economic benefits resulting from increased productivity and workforce participation and reduced burden on health, social and welfare systems. The project is supported by an aRC linkage Grant, and is in partnership with the australian human Rights Commission and Vichealth. localities embracing and accepting Diversity (leaD) Dr yin Paradies has a significant role in the Vichealth-funded localities Embracing and accepting Diversity (lEaD) program, on which he acts as both a scientific advisor on implementation and a key member of the evaluation team. lEaD is a multi-million dollar place-based intervention to reduce race-based discrimination and support diversity utilising multiple and reinforcing strategies across diverse settings at the individual, organisational and community levels. Social inclusion and connectedness Screen Stories and community connections This Vichealth funded project is being conducted in partnership with the alannah and Madeline Foundation (aMF), VicUrban and the Department of information Systems (University of Melbourne). The aim of this project is to increase understanding through qualitative research methods in domestic and community settings of the ways new media technologies and current forms of wireless and 'broadband' provisioning are being used by families in different geographical settings (urban fringe; inner city) and different socioeconomic circumstances. This will allow for identification of environmental and behavioural factors influencing access to, use of, and experience of technology; and for identification of youth, family and intergenerational issues relating to technology and social inclusion/exclusion. The outcomes of the project are expected to inform the aMF cybersafety campaign to include the community context and to develop broader principles and outcomes for digital wellbeing, participation and literacy of young people and their families. Further, it will contribute to VicUrban's design and construction of the Cardinia Road residential and business precinct being developed, which is situated on the urban fringe of Melbourne's South-East growth corridor. The final report for Screen Stories and Community Connections was delivered to Vichealth in 2010. Economic participation and security Mccaughey centre Workplace health research in 2010 national Men's health Policy & australian human rights and equal opportunity commission GuideMcCaughey Centre workplace heath research has been cited in support of the 2010 National Male health Policy (http://www.health.gov.au/menshealthpolicy). The policy acknowledges that \"employment and working conditions are key determinants of health and health equity\" (page 22 in the main policy document), the background for which is provided in a companion document entitled National Male Health Policy Supporting Document: Healthy Workers. This background document cites and extensively quotes (two quotes of 119 and 50 words) the 2006 Vichealth Workplace Stress report led by associate Professor Tony laMontagne (www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/workplacestress) in support of australian policy positions on the need to address job stressors and other working conditions as important preventable risk factors for mental disorders, cardiovascular disease, and poor health behaviours among working australian males, as well as the need to address both 'lifestyle' health behaviours and workplace risk factors integratively in 'work health programs.' in 2010, the australian human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (hREOC) published a guide entitled Workers with Mental Illness: a Practical Guide for Managers (50 pages, freely available at http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/publications/workers_mental_illness_guide.html). The 2006 Vichealth Workplace Stress in Victoria report led by associate Professor laMontagne is referenced in the section entitled Creating a Safe & Healthy Workplace. This section communicates employers' responsibility to prevent and control work-related contributions to mental illness. Recognising job stress as a major concern in this regard, the Guide references and endorses our finding that combined work- and work-directed intervention strategies are the most effective means of preventing job stress and associated Melbourne School of PoP ulation health MCCaUGhEy CENTRE55mental illness. This change represents a significant extension of hREOC's previous interest in workers with a mental illness (concerning the potential for discrimination against workers with a mental illness, regardless of cause) to proactively highlighting employer duties to provide safe and healthy workplaces under other legal frameworks (occupational health and safety regulations). having hREOC also communicate this message strengthens the likelihood that employers will effectively act to both prevent and accommodate mental illness among working australians. cross-centre collaborative research on Precarious employment (2006-2011)associate Professor laMontagne, Professor anne Kavanagh and Dr Rebecca Bentley (Centre for Women's health, Gender, and Society) continue to work on a NhMRC funded project in collaboration with Flinders University. The project is entitled Changing patterns of work: impacts on physical & mental health & the meditating role of resiliency & social capital. Findings to date include a 2009 publication showing that women in casual or contract jobs were 10 times more likely to experience unwanted sexual advances at work compared to women in more secure permanent full-time positions. On-going analyses include long-term trends in psychosocial working conditions, and the influence of changes in psychosocial working conditions on mental health (using data from the household income & labour Dynamics in australia [hilDa] survey). Several conference papers and seminars were presented by the team this year, and this line of research work will be extended by a new aRC linkage Project funded in 2010 entitled New directions in health inequalities research: Understanding the intersection between housing, employment and health in Australia, led by Dr Bentley and including associate Professor laMontagne and a number of others as Chief investigators. capacity-building in workplace health associate Professor laMontagne is one of four Chief investigators (Ci) on a $1.6 million NhMRC Capacity Building Grant entitled Linking research policy and health services to build a better evidence base for workplace public health (2009-2013). The grant is based at the Monash Centre for Occupational & Environmental health, led by Professor Malcolm Sim, and also includes a UW a collaborator, associate Professor lin Fritschi. The grant provides salaries for PhD students, post-doctoral researchers, and early career researchers in workplace health, broadly conceived Occupational health & Safety (Oh&S), health promotion, physiotherapy and other disciplines, with a Ci-led active mentoring program. a new full-time Research Fellow, Dr Fiona Clay, joined the Centre in January funded in part by the Capacity Buidling Grant. another part-time Research Fellow appointment is also anticipated in the near future. in addition to building capacity in workplace health generally through this effort, this grant is also helping to build the Economic Participation and Security team at the McCaughey Centre. new collaborative research projects in workplace health a number of new research grants involving collaborations with external researchers were awarded to workplace health staff in 2010, including two small grants on job stress and occupational skin hazards from SafeWork australia and the institute for Safety Compensation & Rehabilitation Research (involving associate Professor laMontagne and Dr Tessa Keegel), an aRC Discovery project on migrant worker occupational health (involving associate Professor laMontagne in collaboration with Dr alison Reid and others at UW a), and an NhMRC-funded intervention project to reduce sitting time at work (involving associate Professor laMontagne in collaboration with associate Professor David Dunstan and others at the Baker/iDi). Climate Change and Community Wellbeing liveable and Just The Liveable and Just project, funded by Sustainability Victoria and commissioned by the Victorian local Governance association, was designed to improve local government understanding of the social impacts of climate change. as a result of the project, a toolkit was developed and launched in March 2010. The toolkit consists of four booklets: addressing the social and equity impacts of climate change: The case for local government action. Reducing vulnerability: Strategies for local government to identify and reduce vulnerability to climate change. Engaging communities: Tips for effective and inclusive climate change community engagement. Building resilience: ideas for local government to strengthen community resilience to climate change. Child Health and Wellbeing the thrive Program - building the capacity of family day care schemes to promote the mental health of children living in low socioeconomic areasThis project, led by Dr Elise Davis, aims to design, implement and test the appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, cost and effectiveness of an intervention that builds the capacity of Family Day Care settings to promote children's positive mental health, in partnership with Vichealth, Family Day Care australia and Windermere Family Day Care. collaboration of community-based obesity Prevention Sites (cooPS) The COOPS Collaboration is an initiative being led by a collaborative group from the World health Organisation, University of Sydney and University of Melbourne, with the support of the australian Government Department of health and ageing. With a focus on rigorous evaluation, this project seeks to identify and analyse the lessons learnt from a range of community-based projects designed to prevent unhealthy weight gain, mainly in children and adolescents; identify the elements that make community-based projects successful; and share the knowledge gained with other communities. SPlaSh! SPlaSh! aims to examine the relationships between the impact of policy, industry and environmental factors on key areas of child health inequality in rural areas, namely children's oral health and MCCaUGhEy CENTRE56nutrition. a range of issues have influenced parental choices and patterns of drink consumption, with drought, fluoridation and marketing of drinks influencing children's drinking choice. teeth t ales Teeth Tales is a University - community partnership between the McCaughey Centre, Moreland Community health Service, arabic Welfare, Victorian arabic Social Services and Dental health Services Victoria. The Teeth Tales study explored socio-cultural differences in child oral health care. Teeth Tales worked in partnership with the community and used qualitative research methodologies to explore the social, cultural and environmental determinants of the development of poor child oral health in refugee and migrant communities. This phase of the study was funded by Telstra and Dental health Services Victoria and resulted in the development of a community-based intervention framework to promote equity in child oral health. This intervention framework was awarded aRC funding in 2009 and will be implemented and evaluated over the period 2010-2013. building the capacity of family day carers to promote the mental health of children living in low socioeconomic areas (2010-2012) an aRC linkage project grant was awarded to Dr Elise Davis and team to design, implement and test the appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, cost and effectiveness of an intervention that builds the capacity of Family Day Care settings to promote children's positive mental health, in partnership with Vichealth, Family Day Care australia and Windermere Family Day Care. Bushfire Recovery ProgramThe Jack Brockhoff Child health and Wellbeing Program, McCaughey Centre, is engaged in a program of research studies addressing community health and wellbeing in the context of bushfires. These studies are being conducted with academic colleagues in partnership with community, emergency and government agencies to ensure the relevance of the approach and the findings and immediate translation into targeted outcomes. This program of research provides a means for a coordinated response to bushfires, capitalising on the resources and expertise of all stakeholders. This program was awarded an aRC linkage Project grant in 2010. The 2009 Victorian bushfires caused much loss of life, property destruction, and community disturbance. it is important for promoting better health and strengthening the social and economic fabric that an accurate understanding is achieved of the factors that contribute to optimal recovery from natural disasters. This project will survey people affected by the fires over five years to both profile adaptation after the fires and to identify the individual and community processes that influence outcome. This project, which is being undertaken in partnership by academic, disaster management, health and community organisations, will provide crucial information for shaping policy for disaster management in the years ahead.a key feature of the Bushfire Program of research is the partnership approach. The connection between the research partners and the research participants is considered a valued and ongoing relationship in which there are likely to be shared interests and which will be maintained through ongoing communication and feedback. Knowledge Translation and Exchange cochrane Public health review Group (cPhrG) The Cochrane Collaboration is an international not-for-profit and independent organisation dedicated to making accurate up-to-date information on the effects of healthcare readily available worldwide. it produces and disseminates systematic reviews of healthcare interventions. Cochrane systematic reviews use a rigorous process to identify and synthesise all high-quality studies that address questions of relevance to decision-makers, practitioners and communities *. Professor Elizabeth Waters, as the Coordinating Editor of CPhRG, heads up a strong and distinguished team of local and international collaborators responsible for overseeing the production, editing and publication of public health reviews, with a view to improving health and other outcomes at the population level. achieving official registration in May 2008, CPhRG works closely with public health practitioners, policy makers and researchers to conduct reviews that reflect the evidence needs of those responsible for planning, delivering and funding public health initiatives. (*Cochrane systematic reviews are available on www.thecochranelibrary.org.) improving the reporting of public health intervention research Evidence-based decision-making in public health depends on high-quality and transparent accounts of what interventions are effective, for whom, how and at what cost. improving the quality of reporting of randomised and non-randomised study designs through the CONSORT and TREND statements has had a marked impact on the quality of study designs. however, public health users of systematic reviews have been concerned with the paucity of synthesised information on context, development and rationale, implementation processes and sustainability factors. This project, examines the existing reporting frameworks for research against information sought by users of systematic reviews of public health interventions and suggests additional items that should be considered in future recommendations on the reporting of public health interventions. Knowledge translation strategies for obesity prevention Knowledge Translation for Obesity Prevention (KTOP) is an innovative research partnership project that aims to assess the effectiveness of knowledge translation strategies in Victorian local governments for obesity prevention. These strategies are intended to support the use of research evidence in local government decisions. The first component of the study, a state-wide survey and a series of key informant interviews, is now complete. The survey, which was open to all Victorian local governments, explored the different types of evidence that are used to inform public health planning, policy and practice decisions. Councils also were asked to identify ways in which they could be better supported to use research evidence in their decision-making. The second study component, a cluster randomised controlled trial, began in 2009. informed Melbourne School of PoP ulation health MCCaUGhEy CENTRE57by the initial study components, the trial is evaluating the effectiveness of a number of strategies that are intended to increase the use of research evidence in local government public health decisions. conferences and public presentations McCaughey Centre staff attended a range of local and international conferences throughout 2010, providing an important opportunity for staff to disseminate their research outcomes and learnings, and establish new networks and partnerships with academics from around the world in shared areas of interest. a sample of the conferences, international meetings and forums attended by McCaughey staff are included below: Januarychakraborty K, Gibbs l.

Diversity in health Conference, Melbourne.Melbourne School of PoP ulation health MCCaUGhEy CENTRE59 MCCaUGhEy CENTRE Associate Professor Tony LaMontagne discusses the report on YouTube at www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKWdbRRHf5A&feature=player_embedded Excessive pressure at work is costing Australia's economy $730 million a year due to job-stress related depression, a University of Melbourne and VicHealth report has revealed (www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/ jobstrain). The report, Estimating the Economic Benefits of Eliminating Job Strain as a Risk Factor for Depression, was funded by VicHealth and led by Associate Professor T ony LaMontagne, from the McCaughey Centre, in collaboration with Dr Kristy Sanderson, from the Menzies Research Institute in T asmania. Associate Professor LaMontagne has previously shown that \"job strain\" , where workers have little control over their job while under high pressure to perform, accounts for 17 per cent of prevalent depression in working women and 13 per cent in working men. The $730 million per year job strain price tag includes lost productive time, employee replacement costs, government-subsidised mental health services and medications for depression. It equates to $11.8 billion over the average working lifetime, with the biggest loss accruing to employers. The report also revealed an $85 million cost of absences for depressed workers who do not have access to paid sick leave, which also represents a significant cost to employees.However Associate Professor LaMontagne said the figures underestimated the true costs of depression in the workplace, as other factors that increase the risk of depression such as bullying, sexual harassment and job insecurity were not included in the study. In addition, the study did not include the costs of mental health-related WorkCover claims. Workers' compensation costs totalled about $209 million nationally per year for all 'mental stress' claims, including chronic stress as well as other categories such as occupational violence and bullying. \"Claims thus represent only a fraction of potentially avertable costs, yet they are currently the main drivers of policy, \" he said. \"What we need is a stronger focus on prevention in order to best address this problem. \"These figures represent a significant burden on the Australian economy that is preventable by improving job quality. \"There are legal and ethical reasons for employers to address poor working conditions and to support staff, but these new findings add an economic incentive as well. Employers would be the major beneficiaries of reducing job strain over the long term, because the greatest costs fall on employers due to lost productivity and employee replacement. \"preventable job stress costs $730m a year Associate Professor Tony LaMontagne discusses the report on YouTube at www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKWdbRRHf5A&feature=player_embedded60July Bolton K, Kremer P , Swinburn B, Waters e, Gibbs l, de Silva- Sanigorski a. improving our understanding of childhood obesity and the need for early intervention: nutrition and health behaviours of primary and secondary australian school students. international Congress on Obesity, Stockholm.

This Vichealth-published report led by associate Professor Tony laMontagne in collaboration with two University of Tasmania colleagues found that substantial economic benefits could be realised by preventing job strain-attributable depression, and that most such economic benefits would accrue to employers through gains in productivity costs. The report received substanital media coverage, including TV interviews on aBC2 News Breakfast and Sky Business News. Radio coverage included interviews on various aM and FM stations (e.g., aBC774 Melbourne and aBC NewsRadio Sydney), as well as widespread print coverage, including in the Financial Review with an accompanying commentary from the CEO 62of Vichealth, Todd harper, as well as coverage in The Australian and a front-page story in the MX (Sydney). There were over 80 electronic media/website mentions, including internationally, when tracking ceased mid-November. Davis e, Sawyer M.G, lo SK, Priest n, Wake M. Socioeconomic risk factors for mental health problems in 4-5 year old children: australian population study, academic Pediatrics, 2010; 10(1): 41-47. This paper described the extent to which parent-reported and teacher-reported child mental health problems vary by different indicators of socioeconomic status, using data from the longitudinal Study of australian Children (lSaC). The results demonstrated that the proportions of children scoring in the abnormal range varied according to socioeconomic indicator and mental health subscale. all of the SES indicators independently predicted parent-reported child mental health problems, although odds ratios were generally small to moderate (1.2 to 2.4) and not all reached statistical significance. Behavioural problems showed stronger associations with social disadvantage than emotional problems. Research examining pathways to young children's mental health should include diverse measures of socioeconomic status, particularly of family income and education. The fact that mental health problems were most strongly associated with parent education and income should be of interest to policy-makers, since education and income reflect investments in the lives of our participants' parents during their own childhood and adolescence Kelaher M, Warr D, feldman P & t acticos t . 2010. living in 'birdsville': exploring the impact of neighbourhood stigma in health. Health and Place. 16: 381-388. This paper is the fruit of a long-time cross-centre collaboration between researchers based in the McCaughey Centre and the Centre for health Policy, Programs and Economics (ChPPE). it is one of a series of published papers exploring associations between health and place in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The data were collected as part of the State Government's Neighbourhood Renewal strategy where university-based researchers collaborate with community-based peer- interviewers to conduct bi-annual surveys of 300 residents living in each of the 22 Neighbourhood Renewal sites. This paper brings together quantitative and qualitative analyses, and examines issues of place-based stigma that is widely reported by residents living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods but which, to date, has received limited attention in the public health research. The paper is one of the first studies to use a mixed-methods approach and to explore the quantitative dimensions of perceptions of place-based stigma. The paper identifies associations between perceptions of negative neighbourhood reputation and poorer self- reported health. These associations were more marked for residents from migrant backgrounds, with higher education levels and younger residents. The paper suggests the potent effects of place-based stigma on residents' self-esteem and self-confidence and in limiting social and economical opportunities. The analyses have been critical in establishing a rationale for further research into the personal, social and health effects of living in neighbourhoods that have negative reputations among the wider communities. a successful application to the University of Melbourne interdisciplinary Seed Funding scheme was used to conduct a pilot work for an innovative study that explored the potential for disadvantaged communities to challenge stigmatizing stereotypes. an aRC linkage application has since been submitted to further develop and extend this promising work. if successful, MSPh researchers will be working with researchers from Victorian College of the arts and Music, The Faculty of architecture, Building and Planning, and the Centre for Public Policy.

We made major contributions to the School and to the University through our efforts in research and research training, teaching and learning, and knowledge exchange. Our research inputs and outputs continued to grow in 2010. We received, along with our collaborators, $7 million in research funding, and published 31 peer-reviewed journal articles and 23 major reports (compared with 27 and 12, respectively, in 2009). Some of our newer staff had particular successes here. For example, Dr Matthew Spittal was pivotal to our securing an NhMRC project grant for a study looking at suicide method substitution for individuals over time. Our research training efforts were also impressive. We had 24 students enrolled in PhDs and two enrolled in an MPhil. Three of these students submitted excellent theses and are awaiting their results - Dr Katherine Ong (PhD), Mr Michael Otim (PhD) and Ms Pauline Van Doort (MPhil). Four others who submitted their theses in 2009 were awarded PhDs in 2010 - Dr Kiusiang Tay-Teo, Dr Sonja hood, Dr Noelene Bennett and Dr Stephen lambert. Our teaching and learning activities kept us very busy. We had 196 student enrolments in our postgraduate coursework units in Program Evaluation and health Economics as part of the Master of Public health (MPh). We also had CeNTre For H eaLTH P oLiCY, ProGraMs aND e CoNoMiCs aNNUaL rePorT 2010 The Centre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics (CHPPE) is a multidisciplinary organisation, the core business of which is health services and policy research and health economics. Its staff have expertise in program evaluation, health economics, economic evaluation, health law, epidemiology, social sciences and research methodology, and many have clinical backgrounds. The mission of the CHPPE is to contribute to the health of the community through research, teaching and service relevant to health programs and policy. It aims to do this by advancing relevant knowledge and addressing relevant issues productively and flexibly. It also includes methodological development, exemplary practice and a varied program of teaching and training. It aims to achieve this mission by improving the community's ability to critically evaluate the performance and funding of health policy and health programs.Director of the Centre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics, Professor Jane Pirkis. 12 students undertaking research projects in health economics, and 17 doing so in program evaluation, with a total of 23 students completing their projects in 2010. in addition, a number of our staff were heavily involved in the redevelopment of courses under the Melbourne Model which are to commence in 2011. Professor David Dunt spearheaded the introduction of population health teaching into the new graduate-entry MD, which elevated its status to that of other biomedical disciplines. Professor Dunt, Ms Rosemary McKenzie and Dr arthur hsueh were involved in the redevelopment of the MPh, which will now be entirely based at the University of Melbourne from 2011. We will be coordinating two of the six core MPh subjects (Foundations of Public health and Public health leadership and Management), as well as eight other subjects (health Economics 2, which is new, health Policy and health Systems, which have been significantly redeveloped, and existing subjects health Economics 1, Economic Evaluation 1 and 2 and health Program Evaluation 1 and 2). We continued to play a key role in influencing policy and practice. For example, my own team's work on the evaluations of the Better access initiative and the Better Outcomes in Mental health Care program made important contributions to policy debates about models of delivering primary mental health care. likewise, associate Professor Margaret Kelaher's work on strategies to improve the identification of aboriginal and Torres Strait islander patients in general practice was used as a key resource by Divisions of General Practice in their implementation of Closing the Gap. Dr Diana Bowman was invited to be a Member of the australian Government's National Enabling Technologies Strategy Expert Forum, which was established to assist the Government in identifying opportunities and challenges associated with emerging technologies over the next 5-10 years. Other important highlights of the year include various awards. Dr Marie Bismark won the Graham Rouch Victorian a ward from the CENTRE FOR h EalTh PO liCy, PROGR aMS a ND ECONOM iCS64Melbourne School health CENTRE EalTh PO liCy, PROGR aMS a ND ECONOM iCS Why is it relevant to identify a patient as being Aboriginal or T orres Strait Islander? Researchers working on a project aimed at doing just that often encountered this question, and both health professionals and indigenous communities raised it. However, strong goodwill for the project was generated once the link between identifying Indigenous Australians and providing them with better health care was understood, says one of its lead researchers, Associate Professor Margaret Kelaher, Deputy Director of CHPPE (Centre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics) at the Melbourne School of Population Health. \" As part of the Commonwealth Government's 'Closing the Gap' initiative, new measures were introduced to improve Indigenous people's access to medical services, \" she says. \"One of the major barriers to having people take up some of those services was the problem of identifying who is Indigenous and therefore eligible for them. \" In simple terms, the project's aim was to make it easier for health professionals to ask patients another question, one that could help improve their lifelong health: Are you of Aboriginal or T orres Strait Islander descent? This could lead to preventative health measures, such as immunisations, and/or earlier diagnosis and treatment for chronic diseases like diabetes, for which Indigenous people are at higher risk. CHPPE's involvement was as a member of the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health. The project, Improving the Identification of Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander People in Mainstream General Practice, produced a series of recommendations (see link below) to apply at practice level, community and regional level, and national level. The project's report emphasised that for identification strategies to be effective, they had to be relevant to both health professionals and Indigenous people, attractive to introduce, achievable and necessary. Recommendations for the latter included tightening accreditation to require GPs to do cultural competency training to ensure their practices were safe places for patients to identify themselves as being Indigenous. Consultations with Indigenous leaders had confirmed that the option to do so had to be voluntary. \"From the outset of the project we explored with community leaders what they thought best practice was and they rejected some options, such as putting a permanent marker on your Medicare card, \" Associate Professor Kelaher says. \"This was seen as negative because people don't get to choose under what circumstances they get to identify and it could make them potentially vulnerable to discrimination. \" The researchers identified attitudinal, administrative and organisational barriers to better identification. An organisational barrier at a health clinic, for example, might include poor communication between reception staff and health professionals about a patient's Indigenous status. The project's recommendations have been well received by GPs attending General Practice Network workshops. \"People have been very positive and there have been a whole lot of new Aboriginal health care workers employed as part of the Government's indigenous chronic disease initiative, \" Associate Professor Kelaher says. \"They say they've found the research we did very useful in guiding their activities. \" For a full list of the recommendations, visit the Indigenous health link at: http://www.anu.edu.au/aphcri/Ident IfyIng Ind Igenous patIents a health pr IorIty Associate Professor Margaret Kelaher \"One of the major barriers to having people take up some of those services was the problem of identifying who is Indigenous and therefore eligible for them. \" 65australasian Faculty of Public health Medicine for her study (with Dr Matthew Spittal and Professor David Studdert) examining the characteristics of complaint prone doctors in australia, and i won Suicide Prevention australia's lifetime Research a ward. associate Professor Margaret Kelaher was successful in being awarded an aRC Future Fellowship and Dr helen Jordan was awarded her PhD from the University of Tasmania for her thesis titled Estrogen treatment for tall stature in adolescent girls: short- and long-term effects on the breast. Our PhD students were recognised too - for example, Mr Derek y ee-Tak Cheung received PhiRST (Population health investing in Research Students' Training) funding to attend a suicide prevention conference in Brisbane. i would like to thank all ChPPE staff for their commitment in 2010. Without their unceasing efforts, none of the above achievements would have happened. Next year will be an important one for us because we are one of three centres in the School that will be undergoing a review. i am confident that we will continue to achieve the same sorts of successes next year, and into the future. learnIng and teach Ing The postgraduate teaching program continues to be an important part of ChPPE's work. health policy and health systems complement the longstanding teaching areas of health program evaluation and health economics. Short courses providing non-accredited health program evaluation training meet an important health workforce need and provide a link into accredited programs. in 2010 enrolments were again strong across the Master of Public health (MPh), higher degree and short course offerings. Ongoing demand for advanced training in policy, program evaluation and economic evaluation underpin enrolments, coupled with the state and national reputation of ChPPE as a leader in these fields. ChPPE staff continued to offer their teaching expertise to other faculties at the university and to other institutions. Master of Public health Teaching staff had a particularly busy year as they prepared for the transition in 2011 from the Victorian Consortium of Public health to a stand-alone Melbourne School of Population health MPh. The final year of the Consortium subject health Economics and Program Evaluation, undertaken as a core subject by students from Deakin, la Trobe, Monash and Melbourne universities was once again coordinated by Dr arthur hsueh and Ms Rosemary McKenzie. Professor David Dunt, Ms Theonie Tacticos, and Dr lucio Naccarella (australian health Workforce institute) contributed to the lecture series. a large team of staff experts in health economics and health program evaluation joined the coordinators and lecturers in delivery of tutorials to the 79 students enrolled in the subject. Thanks to Dr Cathy Segan, Ms angeline Ferdinand, Ms Kristen Moeller-Saxone and Mr Peter Feldman for their assistance in health program evaluation tutoring and to Dr Kiusiang Tay-Teo, Ms Catherine Keating, Mr Steve Crowley, Ms Chiara Mariano and Dr Sophy Shih for their assistance with health economics tutoring. ChPPE offered a range of subjects in the MPh: australian health Systems, coordinator Dr helen Jordan (with Professor David Dunt). health Economics, coordinator Dr arthur hsueh.

Delivery of teaching was supported and greatly enhanced by Ms Joy y eadon, who provided comprehensive administrative support across all subjects and short courses. The teaching staff record their appreciation for Ms y eadon's contribution to teaching and learning in ChPPE. The MPh research project streams in health Economics/Economic Evaluation and health Program Evaluation maintained high enrolments as in previous years, reflecting the vocational value students place on these skills in public health. Students undertook research projects with an applied focus in diverse settings, often with the cooperation and support of public health agencies and service providers, with such collaboration providing a further learning experience for students. in 2010, 10 students completed a research project in economic evaluation and 13 completed a research project in program evaluation. Research projects were of a high standard and contributed to health program improvement in australia and overseas.

Short courses The short course in health Program Evaluation: Scoping the Evaluation is coordinated and delivered by Dr helen Jordan, a lecturer at the Centre for health Policy, Programs and Economics and administered by Ms Joy y eadon, Centre administrator. The course typically runs for three days, but shorter courses (one and two-day) were also offered and delivered in 2010 to government agencies across australia. The three-day course was delivered at the Centre for health Policy, Programs and Economics in February, July and November of 2010. Dr Jordan also ran one two-day course for the Menzies Research institute, University of Tasmania; two three-day courses for the NSW Cancer institute, Sydney; one one-day course for aCT health, Canberra; one one-day course for the Mental health Community Coalition aCT health, Canberra; one two-day course for the Department of health, Western australia, Perth; and one two-day course for the National Prescribing Service, Sydney. approximately 150 health professionals working in government, health services, health promotion and the university sector participated. Participants also included health professionals from indonesia. The courses provide an opportunity for practical, workplace-oriented learning about health program evaluation, with a particular emphasis on program evaluation planning and program logic development.

Since its establishment, the ChPPE has attracted over $56 million in funding from key granting bodies such as the National health and Medical Research Council (NhMRC), australian Research Council (aRC) and from organisations such as Commonwealth and state/territory health departments that fund contract research. Over half of this funding has come directly to the ChPPE and the remaining funding has been shared with collaborating agencies. During 2010, $7 million in collaborative research funding was received, with 3-1 directly by ChPPE. Since 2007, ChPPE has focused its research around four work streams: health Economics, law and Public health, Mental health and Primary Care. Details of new and existing research activities are set out below under the four work streams, including major grants awarded.

The following new project commenced in 2010: estimating value for money in rolling-out programs and services in eye disease in indigenous communities in australia. funding body: harold Mitchell Foundation, ian Potter Foundation and Greg Poche Donation via the indigenous Eye health Unit, Melbourne School of Population health. chief investigators: Professor David Dunt, Dr arthur hsueh, Mr alex Brando. Description: This study examines the constraints on the full provision of eye services to aboriginal people particularly in remote locations. it aims to develop estimate funding requirements for a model that will provide an optimal range of services. funding total: $109,510; ChPPE $109,51068Other existing research activities carried over from previous years included: The impact of Chlamydia on the health and health care system of Victorians - an analysis of available data. increasing community pharmacy involvement in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Spinal cord injury and physical activity - nationwide random controlled trial across australia and New Zealand. assessing Cost Effectiveness (aCE) in prevention (funding for two PhD scholarships). Priority setting in aboriginal health: Planning for the prevention of non-communicable diseases in aboriginal and Torres Strait islander Communities (funding for PhD scholarship). law & p ublIc health Early in 2010, Dr Marie Bismark and Dr Diana Bowman joined the law and Public health group. Dr Bismark, a dual-qualified doctor and lawyer, came from private legal practice in Wellington. Dr Bowman, an expert in science and technology regulation, came from the Centre for Regulatory Studies at Monash University. in addition, Ms Paula O'Brien, a Senior lecturer at Melbourne law School, commenced a PhD examining alcohol regulation under the supervision of Professors David Studdert and Robin Room. The law and Public health group launched two externally-funded projects in 2010: learning from Preventable Deaths: a prospective evaluation of reforms to coroners' recommendation powers in Victoria. funding body: australian Research Council (aRC). chief investigators: Professor David Studdert, Professor Jane Pirkis, Professor Graham Sewell (Department of Management and Marketing, University of Melbourne). Partner organisation: Department of Justice, Office of the State Coroner. Description: Coroners in australia investigate nearly 13,000 deaths each year and have a unique vantage point on health and safety risks. The public as a whole will benefit from information that helps translate those insights into system changes that work to prevent injuries and accidents from occurring. This project is designed to produce such information. it will also serve stakeholders at several other levels. By illuminating circumstances in which coroners' recommendations produce positive change, project findings will help coroners shape and disseminate their prevention messages for maximum effect. also, for states interested in modifying or boosting coroners' recommendation powers, our findings will help guide reforms. funding total: $363,296; ChPPE $363,296 rehabilitation and compensation for injured Workers: a review of the australian Schemes. funding body: australian Council of Trade Unions. chief investigators: Dr Diana Bowman and Professor David Studdert. Description: The regulatory regimes that currently govern workers' compensation schemes in australia are complex and vary in form and function. The regulatory burden associated with the patchwork of arrangements, as well as its inefficiency and potential to produce inequity, has long been recognised by stakeholders. The recent harmonisation of occupational health and safety laws appears to have brought a new impetus to the notion of harmonisation for workers' compensation. This project is designed to provide information on the core elements of workers' compensation arrangements in australia, including access to benefits and entitlements, dispute resolution and self-insurance, and to evaluate available scientific evidence regarding 'best practice' in relation to these elements. funding total: $48,319; ChPPE $48,319 in addition, the Group's research projects in the following areas continued during 2010:Melbourne School of PoP ulation health CENTRE FOR h EalTh PO liCy, PROGR aMS a ND ECONOM iCS Complaint prone doctors.

Novel methods for measuring pain-and-suffering in personal injury litigation. health care fraud.69mental h ealth The Mental health Work Stream continues to conduct internationally-recognised projects in the area of mental health and suicide prevention, under the leadership of Professor Jane Pirkis. Several projects were completed in 2010. Ms Justine Fletcher and Dr Kylie King took the lead on an evaluation of the Mental health Professionals Network, a project designed to encourage interdisciplinary networking among mental health care providers. Dr anna Machlin and Ms Jo Christo 'stepped into the breach' when Ms Fletcher and Dr King both went on maternity leave. Dr Susan Day and Professor Jane Pirkis evaluated a pilot project which provided online professional development to mental health workers (the Mental health Professional Online Development Pilot). Evaluation reports on both of these projects were well received by the funding bodies. a number of previously funded projects continued throughout the year. Professor Jane Pirkis continued to conduct a program of work concerned with suicide prevention through her National health and Medical Research Council Senior Research Fellowship, and maintained her involvement with the australian Mental health Outcomes and Classification Network. Ms Justine Fletcher, Dr Bridget Bassilios, Dr Fay Kohn, Dr Kylie King, Mr lennart Reifels and Professor Jane Pirkis continued to work on the ongoing evaluation of the Better Outcomes in Mental health Care program, attracting additional funding for the evaluation of some recent modifications to the program. Mr andrew Dare and Professor Jane Pirkis continued to collaborate with colleagues from Sydney and Canberra to develop the australian health News Research Collaboration; Dr anna Machlin will be joining this collaboration next year. Professor Jane Pirkis, Ms Justine Fletcher, Dr Bridget Bassilios and Dr Fay Kohn were successful in securing funding for an evaluation of the Better access initiative, and Ms Shelby Williamson and Dr Maria Ftanou did an excellent job in running this project with expert assistance from Dr anna Machlin and Ms Jo Christo. Professor Jane Pirkis, Dr Matthew Spittal and Professor David Studdert received an NhMRC grant for a record linkage study investigating suicide method substitution for individuals over time. This new project will commence in 2011. Several new projects began in 2010. Professor Jane Pirkis and Dr Maria Ftanou received additional funding to draw together various components of the evaluation of Better access into a summative evaluation. Professor Jane Pirkis won a tender to develop guidelines for communities on dealing with suicide hotspots and suicide clusters, and Ms Shelby Williamson has taken responsibility for the day-to-day running of this project. These new projects are described in more detail below: Summative evaluation of the better access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and GPs through the Medicare benefits Schedule initiative. funding body: Department of health and ageing. chief investigators: Professor Jane Pirkis, Dr Meredith harris, Professor Wayne hall (University of Queensland), Professor anthony Scott (Melbourne institute of applied Economics, The University of Melbourne). Description: The Better access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (Better access) initiative aims to improve outcomes for people with mental disorders by encouraging a multi-disciplinary approach to their mental health care. it takes the form of a series of new item numbers which have been added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The Department of health and ageing has tendered out a number of components of the evaluation, and this summative evaluation is designed to draw them together into a cohesive whole. funding total: $60,272; ChPPE $60,272 Development of guidelines on managing and preventing suicides at suicide hotspots, and development of a community plan for the prevention and containment of suicide clusters. funding body: Department of health and ageing. chief investigator: Professor Jane Pirkis, Ms Jo Robinson (Centre for y outh Mental health), Ms anne lockley, Mr Derek y ee-Tak Cheung, Ms laurencia Grant (Mental health association of Central australia).Description: This project involves the development of two sets of guidelines for communities: one on managing suicide hotspots; and one on managing suicide clusters. These sets of guidelines will be developed through an iterative process which involves recourse to the scientific literature and extensive consultation with stakeholders. funding total: $252,178; ChPPE $252,178 CENTRE a ND ECONOM iCS70evaluation of Mental health Professional online Development (MhPoD) Pilot. funding body: Department of health. chief investigators: Professor Jane Pirkis, Dr Susan Day. Description: Mental health Professional Online Development (MhPOD) is the product of a national project to develop and implement a web-based, professional development tool for staff from a range of disciplines in public mental health services and others in the health system who work with people who have a serious mental illness. The course is presented as a series of self-paced modules containing multimedia content and it is intended that learners will undertake this as workplace based training. it is particularly relevant to workers in their first two years working in a mental health service. MhPOD consists of 45 topics, and 10 were chosen for a pilot in 11 services spread across australia. Researchers at the ChPPE undertook an evaluation of the six-month pilot. The evaluation used both qualitative and quantitative data to: (i) identify opportunities to enhance MhPOD's usability for learners, educators and administrators; (ii) identify changes in health worker knowledge and understanding as a result of using MhPOD; (iii) identify actions to improve the implementation of MhPOD in mental health services nationally; and (iv) identify whether MhPOD has improved access to evidence-based educational programs for those providing health services to the seriously mentally ill, including those working in rural and remote areas. funding total: $49,260; ChPPE $49,260 existing research activities carried over from previous years included: independent evaluation of the Mental health Professionals Network.

Evaluation of the access to allied Psychological Services component of the Better Outcomes in Mental health Care program. australian Mental health Outcomes and Classification Network. health risk screening of adolescents in primary care: a cluster randomised controlled trial. The australian health News Research Collaboration. prImary c are The Primary Care Work Stream includes evaluations of projects run in general practice and other primary care settings. These projects are frequently aimed at increasing the health and wellbeing of particular consumer groups (e.g., older people, people with diabetes, people with dementia) and/or projects that have a health education focus. 2009 saw major developments in ChPPE's involvement in evaluating and improving aboriginal and Torres Strait islander peoples' health. This has continued and grown in 2010. its focus has also expanded with a number of new studies aimed at increasing acceptance of population diversity and at reducing discrimination in other disadvantaged groups such as Culturally and linguistically Diverse groups. in 2010 the Primary Care Work Stream was successful in attracting approximately $4 million in research funding in conjunction with other colleagues. Some of these projects commenced in 2010 and others will commence in 2011. highlights for the Primary Care stream have included: associate Professor Margaret Kelaher, despite facing very strong competition, was successful in being awarded an aRC Future Fellowship. With other colleagues she has been involved in a large number of indigenous health studies and reducing discrimination (see below). Professor David Dunt oversaw the completion of the evaluation of beyondblue's activities for the years 2005-10 and was involved in mental health studies in a diverse range of groups often with Dr Colleen Doyle e.g. people with dementia and PTSD, with COPD and in adolescents and young adults with cancer. a Research grant from Department of Veterans' affairs on dementia and post traumatic stress disorder has yielded some interesting results despite challenges in recruitment of participants. Dr Sonja hood and Dr Noleen Bennett completed their PhDs and Ms Pauline van Dort submitted her MPhil. Congratulations! Dr Suranganie Wijesundara, a Visiting Fellow from Sri lanka, undertook a project in association with the Victorian hospital acquired infection Surveillance System (ViCNiSS) focussing on infectious disease surveillance in long-term aged care facilities.

Description: Cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks and strokes are important causes of illness and death among indigenous people in australia, Canada and New Zealand. Patients and families play a major role in managing heart disease and stroke. To do this well people must be able to access, understand and act on information for health. The project will work with indigenous primary care services to develop and implement a program with patients and families that will increase knowledge of medications, increase confidence and ability to self-manage CVD, and increase empowerment in interactions with health workers. funding total: $2,003,679; ChPPE nil family t ransitions project - Post-separation parenting arrangements and developmental outcomes for infants and children. funding body: attorney-General's Department via Family Transitions. chief investigators: Dr Jennifer Mcintosh (Family Transitions Pty ltd), Dr Bruce Smyth (la Trobe University) and associate Professor Margaret Kelaher. Description: There has been much interest in impacts on children, both positive and negative, of different patterns of parenting after separation. This is particularly important in australia where the Family law amendment Shared Parental Responsibility act 2006 has led to a shift towards shared parenting arrangements post-separation, ahead of evidence about the developmental implications for children.

(2010) The complementarity of two major Australian primary mental health care initiatives. australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry. 44 (11): 997-1004. OBJECTiVE: Two pivotal australian Government primary mental health reforms are the access to allied Psychological Services (aTaPS) projects, introduced in July 2001 and implemented by Divisions of General Practice, and the Better access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and GPs through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (Better access) program, introduced in November 2006. This research explores the reciprocal impact of the uptake of psychological treatment delivered by these two initiatives and the impact of location (rurality and socioeconomic profile) on the uptake of both programs since the inception of the Better access program. aTaPS session delivery, before and after the introduction of the Better access program, is also examined. METhOD: General Practice Division-level data sources included a minimum dataset containing uptake data of a TaPS services, Medicare Benefits Schedule uptake data supplied by the Medicare Benefits Branch of the Department of health and ageing, a Rural, Remote and Metropolitan area classification, and indices for Relative Socio Economic Disadvantage (iRSED). Regression analyses were conducted to examine the reciprocal impact of the two programs and the impact of rurality and socioeconomic status up to December 2008. RESUl TS: a dramatic uptake of Better access sessions, particularly in urban areas, coincided with a temporary reduction in sessions provided under a TaPS, with an overall small positive relationship detected between the two programs. a greater proportion of a TaPS sessions (45%) have been delivered in rural areas compared with Better access (18%). The combination of socioeconomic profile, rurality, and Better access sessions accounted for a small but significant percentage of variance (7%) in the number of a TaPS CENTRE FOR EalTh PO liCy, PROGR aMS a ND ECONOM iCS78sessions delivered, with a non-significant independent contribution of Better access sessions to the prediction of a TaPS sessions. Weak but significant relationships between a TaPS sessions and each of socioeconomic profile (r = 0.22) and rurality (r = -0.24), respectively, were identified. in comparison, socioeconomic profile, rurality, and a TaPS sessions accounted for a much larger and significant percentage of variance (46%) in number of Better access sessions delivered, with a non-significant independent contribution of aTaPS sessions to the prediction of Better access sessions. Moderate significant relationships between Better access sessions and each of socioeconomic profile (r = 0.46) and rurality (r = -0.66), respectively, were identified. The introduction of Better access appears to have halted the steady increase in the number of a TaPS sessions previously observed. This finding should be interpreted alongside the fact that a TaPS funding is capped. CONClUSiONS: The findings are policy relevant. a TaPS projects have been successfully providing equity of geographic and socioeconomic access for consumers most in need of subsidised psychological treatment. The uptake of psychological treatment under Better access has been dramatic, suggesting that the program is addressing an unmet need. elkin, K., Studdert, D. (2010). Restricted career paths for overseas students graduating from Australian medical schools: legal and policy considerations. Medical Journal of australia. 192 (9):517-519. a sharp increase in the number of students graduating from australian medical schools over the next few years looks set to outpace available intern positions. Graduating overseas students will be the first to miss out. While this treatment of overseas students is unlikely to be found unlawful, questions of fairness remain. From a policy standpoint, the bottleneck in intern places could be quite damaging as: it encourages australian-trained medical graduates with high-quality training and culturally-relevant skills to leave; and it extinguishes a valuable opportunity to steer some of these graduates into geographical areas with the greatest medical workforce needs. Jayaratne, K., Kelaher, M., Dunt, D. (2010). Child Health Partnerships: a review of program characteristics, outcomes and their relationship. BMC health Services Research. 10: 172. BaCKGROUND: Novel approaches are increasingly employed to address the social determinants of health of children worldwide. Such approaches have included complex social programs involving multiple stakeholders from different sectors jointly working together (hereafter Child health Partnerships). Previous reviews have questioned whether these programs have led to significant improvements in child health and related outcomes. We aim to provide definitive answers to this question as well as identifying the characteristics of successful partnerships. METhODS: a comprehensive literature search identified 11 major Child health Partnerships in four comparable developed countries. a critical review is focused on various aspects of these including their target groups, program mechanics and outcomes. RESUl TS aND CONClUSiONS: There was evidence of success in several major areas from the formation of effective joint operations of partners in different partnership models to improvement in both child wellbeing and parenting. There is emerging evidence that Child health Partnerships are cost-effective. Population characteristics and local contexts need to be taken into account in the introduction and implementation of these programs. Kelaher, M., Warr, D., feldman, P ., t acticos, t . (2010). Living in 'Birdsville': Exploring the impact of neighbourhood stigma on health. health and Place. 16: 381-388. aiMS: The stigma of living in a disadvantaged area is a consistent theme in discussions with residents of neighbourhood renewal (NR) areas in Victoria, australia. Despite this, stigma is rarely examined explicitly in studies of neighbourhood disadvantage and health. This study will address four questions: (1) how do residents of disadvantaged areas describe their experiences of neighbourhood stigma? (2) Do experiences of neighbourhood stigma vary within neighbourhoods? (3) is neighbourhood stigma related to health? (4) is the relationship between neighbourhood stigma and health explained by other social factors that may contribute to poorer health? DESiGN: Cross-sectional community interviews comparing people living in NR areas (n = 4029) to people living in other parts of the same local government areas (lGas) (n = 1857). Recruitment was achieved using community interviewers in NR areas and stratified random sampling in lGas. MaiN OUTCOME MEaSURES: a neighbourhood stigma variable, self-reported health, and satisfaction with life. RESUl TS: about half (47.7%) of residents living in NR neighbourhoods compared to 9.4% of residents living elsewhere in the same lGas felt that their neighbourhoods did not have a good reputation in surrounding areas. in NR areas, reported neighbourhood stigma was higher among people born in a non-English speaking country, receiving benefits or pensions, educated above year 10, or who reported having a disability. Reported neighbourhood stigma decreased with age. Stigma was associated with being in fair/poor health status (OR = 1.33, 1.06-1.89) and life satisfaction (OR = 0.66, 0.55-0.8). CONClUSiONS: Neighbourhood stigma may be a useful addition to the portfolio of variables that describe 'place' and its relationship with health. Studdert, D., Gurrin, l., Jatkar, U., Pirkis, J. (2010). Relationship between vehicle emissions laws and incidence of suicide by motor vehicle exhaust gas in Australia, 2001-06: An ecological analysis. PloS Medicine. 7 (1): e1000210 BaCKGROUND: Globally, suicide accounts for 5.2% of deaths among persons aged 15 to 44 years and its incidence is rising. in australia, Melbourne School of PoP ulation health CENTRE FOR h EalTh PO liCy, PROGR aMS a ND ECONOM iCS79suicide rates peaked in 1997 and have been declining since. a substantial part of that decline stems from a plunge in suicides by one particular method: asphyxiation by motor vehicle exhaust gas (MVEG). although MVEG remains the second most common method of suicide in australia, its incidence decreased by nearly 70% in the decade to 2006. The extent to which this phenomenon has been driven by national laws in 1986 and 1999 that lowered permissible levels of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions is unknown. The objective of this ecological study was to test the relationship by investigating whether areas of australia with fewer noxious vehicles per capita experienced lower rates of MVEG suicide. METhODS aND FiNDiNGS: We merged data on MVEG suicides in australia (2001-06) with data on the number and age of vehicles in the national fleet, as well as socio-demographic data from the national census. Poisson regression was used to analyse the relationship between the incidence of suicide within two levels of geographical area - postcodes and statistical subdivisions (SSDs) - and the population density of pre-1986 and pre-1999 passenger vehicles in those areas. (There was a mean population of 8,302 persons per postcode in the study dataset and 87,413 persons per SSD.) The annual incidence of MVEG suicides nationwide decreased by 57% (from 2.6 per 100,000 in 2001 to 1.1 in 2006) during the study period; the population density of pre-1986 and pre-1999 vehicles decreased by 55% (from 14.2 per 100 persons in 2001 to 6.4 in 2006) and 26% (from 44.5 per 100 persons in 2001 to 32.9 in 2006), respectively. area-level regression analysis showed that the suicide rates were significantly and positively correlated with the presence of older vehicles. a percentage point decrease in the population density of pre-1986 vehicles was associated with a 6% decrease (rate ratio [RR] = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [Ci] 1.05-1.08) in the incidence of MVEG suicide within postcode areas; a percentage point decrease in the population density of pre-1999 vehicles was associated with a 3% decrease (RR = 1.03; 95% Ci 1.02-1.04) in the incidence of MVEG suicide. CONClUSiONS: areas of australia with fewer vehicles predating stringent CO emission laws experience lower rates of MVEG suicide. although those emission laws were introduced primarily for environmental reasons, countries that lack them may miss the benefits of a serendipitous suicide prevention strategy. staff The ChPPE comprises 38 full time and part time staff, consisting of 35 academic and three professional staff.

In its Australian programs the Centre, in collaboration with the Victorian T ranscultural Psychiatry Unit, focuses on the development of effective mental health systems for a culturally and linguistically diverse society. Internationally the Centre's focus is on building capacity for mental health system development in low and middle-income countries and in post-disaster and post-conflict settings. Both locally and internationally the Centre contributes to strengthening leadership for mental health system development.Director of the Centre for International Mental Health, Associate Professor Harry Minas. collaboration between World Vision australia, W orld h ealth Organisation (W h O) Sri l anka and C i M h , was completed. h 4S achieved its objective of establishing functioning community mental health systems in all three Districts of the Southern Province of Sri l anka, where they did not previously exist. The substantial gains made by the project will be sustained through government commitment to supporting the new programs. Based on the experience of h 4S, planning for work in the war-ravaged Northern and Eastern was done during the 7 th international Mental h ealth System Development Conference, which was opened by the Governor of Victoria and the Chancellor of the University. i n March 2010 the third in-country l eadership for Mental h ealth Program was launched in Nigeria, with such programs having previously been developed with C i M h 's close involvement in i ndia and i ndonesia. a lthough mental disorders are a major public health problem and the development of mental health services has been a low priority everywhere, CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh Associate Professor Harry Minas (left), Mr Alex Chernov, Chancellor of the University, and Professor David De Kretser, Governor of Victoria, at the opening of the 7th International Mental Health System Development Conference.82Melbourne School of Po Pu lation he alth CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh there is a growing understanding of the importance of population mental health and increased attention to the need to develop effective mental health systems. C i M h 's international mental health programs have been consolidated and are informed by a clear conceptual framework, that links research, education and training and knowledge transfer (research and education for development) in pursuing C i M h 's goals. C i M h is recognised as a global leader in mental health system development. i t was selected, in a competitive process, to host the Secretariat of the Movement for Global Mental h ealth for three years from 2011.Significant successes were also achieved in C i M h 's multicultural mental health work. Plans began to be made for the transformation of the successful a ustralian Mental h ealth l eadership Program (run in collaboration with the Universities of Queensland, Sydney and the Sunshine Coast, and Barwon h ealth in Victoria) into a program focused specifically on leadership for multicultural mental health. The renewed program will contribute directly to the implementation of a key workforce component of the Victorian Mental h ealth Reform Strategy. a lso as a part of the Strategy, C i M h was invited to co-chair (with the Victorian Multicultural Commission) a Migration Mental h ealth Taskforce, reporting directly to the Victorian Mental 83health Minister's Mental health Reform Council. it is anticipated that this T askforce will contribute significantly to ensuring that implementation of the Mental h ealth Reform Strategy will include specific attention to the important issue of cultural diversity. a n important term of reference for the Taskforce is to make recommendations to the Minister for Mental h ealth on the restructuring of the Victorian Government's investments in multicultural mental health. This is expected to lead to significant re-organisation of Victoria's multicultural mental health efforts. C i M h 's high profile work on behalf of asylum seekers continued in a very difficult political environment. a s Chair of the Research Sub-Group of the i mmigration Minister's Council on i mmigration Services and Status Resolution, a ssociate Professor Minas has focused on the need for the Department of i mmigration and Citizenship to establish an immigration detention research program in order to generate evidence to inform this most contentious area of national policy and practice. Together with the Foundation for Survivors of Torture, C i M h commenced a research project exploring mental health issues in young refugees. The C i M h Director, also Director of the Victorian Transcultural Psychiatry Unit (VTPU), initiated a process of evaluation of the VTPU's programs, in service development and in education and training. Reports of these projects will be published in 2011. i n 2010 C i M h , in collaboration with he a ustralian i ndian Society of Victoria, embarked on an important new stream of multicultural mental health research, focusing on the neglected area of domestic violence in Victoria's immigrant communities. This work has received funding support from Victoria's l egal Services Board. The announcement by the Commonwealth Department of h ealth and a geing that the contract for the management of the national Multicultural Mental h ealth a ustralia project would be re-tendered was followed by the establishment of a national consortium of agencies, including C i M h and VTPU, to bid for this program. C i M h is confident that the consortium will be recognised as the preferred group to manage this important national multicultural mental health program.

LeAr n I ng And TeA CHI ng The approach of C iMh in pursuing its vision is \"research and education for development\". The focus of C i M h learning and teaching programs has been a series of short course professional development programs that build capacity for mental health system reform and development in a ustralia and internationally. Participants in these programs are almost invariably professionals with whom C i M h is collaborating in development projects, and the training is a key capacity building component of these projects. The programs vary in duration: the one-year a ustralian Mental h ealth l ealth l eadership Program; two-week programs in leadership for mental health run in collaboration with partners in i ndia, i ndonesia and Nigeria; and a two-day workshop for senior psychiatry trainees. t he a ustralian Mental h ealth l eadership program The a ustralian h ealth l eadership Program ( a usM hl P), established in 2005 and offered annually, is a collaborative program of C i M h ( h arry Minas), Queensland Centre for Mental h ealth Research, University of Queensland (Professor h arvey Whiteford), The Brain and Mind Research i nstitute, University of Sydney (Professor i an h ickie), the University of the Sunshine Coast (Professor John Mendoza) and Barwon h ealth and Deakin University (Professor Tom Callaly). The program is designed for mental health professionals working in the a ustralian mental health system who are committed to making a contribution to mental health reform in a ustralia at an organisational, system or policy level. The course is available to graduates in medicine, allied health professions, nursing, science or social science, who have relevant professional work experience and a commitment to mental health systems development. Managers, clinical leaders and academics at all levels are encouraged to apply. Since its inception in 2005, the a usM hl P has been offered annually. Four three-day workshops were held in 2010, two in Melbourne (Mental h ealth l eadership and Management, Team Building and Change Management), one in Sydney (Mental h ealth System Reform) and one on the Sunshine Coast (Mental h ealth Policy). The participants in the program carry out a project as part of the program. These projects were presented at the end of program in a Completion Seminar in Melbourne. t he i nternational Mental h ealth l eadership Program: iM hl P 2010 The i nternational Mental h ealth l eadership Program (iM hl P) was established in collaboration with the Department of Social Medicine, h arvard Medical School, in 2001. Funding for the 2010 CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh84program was from three sources: atlantic Philanthropies (National Mental h ealth Taskforce for Community Mental h ealth System Development in Vietnam), the a us ai D Vietnam project, and the a us ai D a ustralian l eadership award Fellowships program. The program brought together iM hl P Fellows from i ndia and Vietnam to study mental health system development in the two countries. Mental health leadership programs in i ndia, i ndonesia and n igeria These courses have been designed and developed with colleagues in i ndia, i ndonesia and Nigeria and are designed to to equip participants in the methods to develop and scale up interventions for people with mental disorders in communities, based on a population model. Each program is of two weeks' duration and has drawn on the long experience of running the iM hl P in Melbourne. Participants are generally from a wide variety of professional backgrounds (including mental health professionals, general physicians, policy makers, representatives of funding agencies, humanitarian agency workers, Non-Government Organisation (NGO) staff, epidemiologists, anthropologists and members of the user community) and there are usually 25-30 participants in each program each year.

The training program is organised around the key reform priorities of the Victorian Mental h ealth Reform Strategy. The program enables senior trainees to fulfill College requirements for the leadership and management component of their training, and is accredited by the relevant College training committees. The program included teaching sessions and small group workshops on: i ntroduction to l eadership and Management; Mental h ealth Promotion and Early i ntervention; Quality i mprovement; a ddressing the Needs of Vulnerable Groups; Service Planning and Clinical Governance; Continuing Medical Education; Review and Program Evaluation. transcultural Psychiatry Selective C i M h and VTPU jointly teach the subject Transcultural Psychiatry in the University of Melbourne Master of Psychiatry and Monash Master of Psychological Medicine program. u niversity b readth Subject C i M h contributes to teaching in the subject h uman Rights and Global Justice.Melbourne School of Po Pu lation he alth CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh Above: The Leadership for Mental Health program in Ibadan, Nigeria Left: The iMHLP 2010 fellows and faculty.85re se ArC H An d Men T AL HeA LTH sy sTeM de ve Lo pMenT in 2010 C iMh has generated a total of $3.2 million in new external research and development grants. a ctive projects in 2010 included the following: t he Mental h ealth for the South ( h 4S) project, Southern province, Sri l anka. f unding body: World Vision arry Minas.

This has been achieved with a relatively small investment over a short period (in development terms). The outcomes of this project serve to instill confidence in undertaking such mental health system development projects even in difficult circumstances. The lessons that have been learned from h 4S will be valuable in the further development and implementation of mental health system development activities in the North and East of Sri l anka, and in other low-resource and post-conflict environments.

The Indonesian province this year started a program to achieve this goal but much more needs to be done, cautions Associate Professor Harry Minas, the Director of the Centre for International Mental Health within the Melbourne School of Population Health. After six years of collaborating with his Indonesian colleagues over the issue, Associate Professor Minas justifiably says that Aceh's new program, Aceh Free Pasung, to which he had been appointed technical advisor, is a major mental health and human rights advance. The program locates and releases these patients and brings them for free treatment to the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. Following Aceh's lead, Indonesia's Ministry of Health has also committed to ending pasung throughout the country by 2014. However, Associate Professor Minas's relief is tempered by concern at what lies ahead for these severely ill patients, who have been confined for up to 15 years and bear the scars of their ordeal. In most cases, family members fearing physical harm from their mentally ill relative have enforced the pasung practice. Associate Professor Minas applauds the program, with reservations. \"What the Government of Aceh is doing is impressive but we have consistently said the practice will not be eliminated unless there is some really good research on what are the social and economic factors that lead families and communities to this obviously end-of-the-line option, and to understand what is needed for sustainable release from pasung. \" About 200 pasung patients were located in rural Aceh. Their families are not bad people, he says. \"They are scrabbling out a living, are very poor, they need all hands on deck to survive. They can't afford to have a family member devoted full time to the mentally ill relative's welfare and being responsible for the ill person's safety and the safety of others. \" He does not know whether Aceh has succeeded in meeting its commitment to end pasung in the province by the end of 2010 because there is no follow up monitoring or treatment. \"There is a danger the government will say, 'We've succeeded, we've taken everybody we could find out of stocks, or unchained them. We've done our job' . But it's what happens in the medium to long term that is important, \" he says.He fears that as the government's message that pasung is unacceptable gets through it could drive the practice underground because without ongoing support and accessible and affordable mental health services families won't be able to cope. Pasung graphically demonstrates what happens when there are no basic health services available. \" Aceh Free Pasung is a very significant program because it's an example of necessary action to eliminate human rights abuses and governments assuming responsibility for taking that action. That's not so common. \" Getting funding to ensure the program is sustainable is the next challenge. \"It would be a very great pity if it were not possible to find support for ensuring that all of the issues around this practice are understood so they can be moved into practice and policy. \"Freedo M A FIr sT sTe p Fo r AC eH' s Me nT ALLy ILL Left: A young man with schizophrenia who had been chained for years by the neck, wrists and ankles (written consent given for publication of image).87leadership in research and training for mental health system development.

Key A C HI eveM enTs The international standing of C iMh is indicated by two invitations and a global role for C i M h . The Director General of the World h ealth Organisation invited the Director of C i M h to serve for a second term, for the maximum allowable period of three years, as a member of the Director General's prestigious i nternational Expert Panel on Mental h ealth and Substance a buse. On 9 October a ssociate Professor Minas was invited to address the h ealth Commission of the i ndonesian National Parliament on the issue of mental health legislation. MGM h Secretariat Towards the end of 2010, in a competitive process that included candidate centres in China and Brazil, C i M h was selected by the more than 1,000 members of the Movement for Global Mental h ealth (MGM h ) to host the MGM h Secretariat from 2011 to 2013. The responsibilities of the Secretariat include oversight of the planning for the Second Global Mental h ealth Summit, to be held in Cape Town, South a frica, in October 2011, and the launch of the Second l ancet Series on Global Mental h ealth. Selection of the Centre to host the Secretariat highlights the global leadership of the Centre in this rapidly developing field. Pasung Based on research carried out by C i M h and the University of i ndonesia, and technical advice from the C i M h Director, the Province of a ceh embarked on an ambitious program to end restraint and confinement in the community of people with serious mental illness - the Aceh Free from Pasung program. a ceh's lead has inspired the Government of i ndonesia to act on human rights. On World Mental h ealth Day 2010 the Minister of h ealth announced a national program to eliminate this most serious of human rights abuses from the whole of the country by 2014, the Indonesia Free from Pasung program. C i M h is a key advisor to this national human rights program. These developments constitute a major human rights advance in i ndonesia and promise to eliminate one of the most egregious forms of human rights abuse of people with metal illness.Melbourne School of Po Pu lation he alth CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh Mr Saifuddin, Director of the Mental Hospital Banda Aceh, and Mr Irwandi Yusuf, Governor of Aceh, release a man from restraints at the forml launch of the Aceh Free from Pasung program in March 2010.91 CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh h4S The Mental h ealth for the South project in Sri l anka demonstrated that the approach taken by C i M h to community mental health system development - integrating research, leadership development, partnerships and knowledge exchange - produces excellent results. The objective of developing and implementing a model of community mental health services, in line with the National Mental h ealth Policy of Sri l anka, has largely been achieved. a comprehensive community- focused model of mental health service has been established in all three districts of Southern Province. This includes an acute inpatient unit in the district general hospitals of h ambantota and Matara as well as in Galle; intermediate care facilities at Unawatuna and Ridyagama, which previously housed long stay patients with chronic illness but are being transformed into residential rehabilitation facilities; community outreach clinics in most Divisions in each district, treating large numbers of patients in the community; a national toll-free telephone mental health advice and counselling service; a basic mental health information system has been developed in each district; and functioning procedures for inter-sectoral coordination including health, social affairs, justice, education and the police.

(2010). \"Determinants of psychological morbidity in survivors of the earthquake and tsunami in a ceh and Nias.\" International Journal of Mental Health Systems 4. b ackground: The goal of this study was to collect information to inform the design of a mental health response following the massive December 2004 earthquake and tsunami in a ceh and North Sumatra, i ndonesia. a s well as exploring the effect on mental health of direct exposure to the tsunami the study was designed to examine the effect on mental health of immediate post-disaster changes in life circumstances (impact). Methods: i nformation was collected from a sample of 783 people aged 15 years and over in earthquake and tsunami-affected areas of a ceh and Nias, 616 i nternally Displaced Persons ( i DPs) and 167 non- i DPs. The structured questionnaire that was designed for data collection consisted of demographic information, measures of disaster exposure and of changes in life circumstances (impact), the extended version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), and a brief measure of resilience. Group comparisons, contrasting responses of i DPs and non- i DPs, were by chi-square for frequency Structure and outcomes of the Mental Health for the South project, Southern Province, Sri Lanka. 92data and t-tests for ordinal or continuous data. hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the relative contributions to psychopathology of demographic variables and measures of exposure, impact and resilience. r esults: h igh rates of psychopathology, including symptoms of anxiety and affective disorders and post-traumatic stress syndrome, were recorded in the overall sample, particularly in i nternally Displaced Persons ( i DPs) who experienced more substantial post- disaster changes in life circumstances (impact). The i DP group experienced significantly more SRQ symptoms than did the non- i DP group. Demographic factors alone accounted for less two percent of variance in SRQ-scores. h igher SRQ-20 scores were observed among women, those with lower education, those with diminished resilience beliefs, those experiencing high scores on disaster impact, those experiencing direct exposures to the disaster, and due to (unmeasured) conditions related to being an i DP . The greatest effect among these was due to disaster impacts. The pattern was similar when considering post-traumatic stress symptoms separately. c onclusions: Negative changes in a person's life circumstances following a disaster appear to have as important an effect on psychopathology as the direct experience of the disaster. a meliorating the extent and duration of post-disaster negative changes in life circumstances may play an important role in prevention of post-disaster psychological morbidity. c olucci e , Kelly CM, Minas h , Jorm a F, Nadera D. (2010). \"Mental h ealth First a id guidelines for helping a suicidal person: a Delphi consensus study in the Philippines.\" International Journal of Mental Health Systems 4. b ackground: This study aimed to develop guidelines for how a member of the Filipino public should provide mental health first aid to a person who is suicidal. Methods: The guidelines were produced by developing a questionnaire containing possible first aid actions and asking an expert panel of 34 Filipino mental health clinicians to rate whether each action should be included in the guidelines. The content of the questionnaire was based on a systematic search of the relevant evidence and claims made by authors of consumer and carer guides and websites. The panel members were asked to complete the questionnaire by web survey. Three rounds of the rating were carried and, at the end of each round, items that reached the consensus criterion were selected for inclusion in the guidelines. During the first round, panel members were also asked to suggest any additional actions that were not covered in the original questionnaire (to include items that are relevant to local cultural circumstances, values, and social norms). Responses to these open-ended questions were used to generate new items. r esults: The output from the Delphi process was a set of agreed upon action statements. The Delphi process started with 138 statements, 48 new items were written based on suggestions from panel members and, of these 186 items, 102 met the consensus criterion. These statements were used to develop the guidelines appended to this paper. The guidelines are currently being translated into local languages. c onclusions: There are a number of actions that are considered to be useful for members of the public when they encounter someone who is experiencing suicidal thoughts or engaging in suicidal behaviour. a lthough the guidelines are designed for members of the public, they may also be helpful to non-mental health professionals working in health and welfare settings. c olucci e , Kelly CM, Minas h , Jorm a F, Chatterjee S.

Melbourne School of Po Pu lation he alth CENTRE FOR iN TERN aTiO Na l MENT a l hEa lTh93Year's overview The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) has been in operation since 1917 as a specialised unit for the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmissible infections (STIs). It is the only centre that provides full-time, free sexual health services to the people of Victoria. The services provided by MSHC include general clinics for the management of STIs and a variety of specialist clinics. In 2001, the first Director was appointed with a dual role at both the Melbourne School of Population Health (MSPH) and the Centre. In 2003, the Centre became part of Alfred Health. The Centre has provided high quality care to 22,392 individual clients who registered in 2010, with a total of 35,630 consultations. One of its key roles is to promote sexual health and disseminate information and education materials to the general public and health care providers (e.g. General Practitioners (GPs) in diagnosing and treating STIs. MSHC provides wide reaching support to GPs through various means such as an extensive web page and 1800 telephone number directly to a sexual health physician. The MSHC website at www.mshc.org.au is comprised of information divided into three major sections: General Public. Health Professionals. Research and Education. seX U aL H eaL TH UN iT aN NUaL rePo rT 2 010 The University of Melbourne's Sexual Health Unit (SHU) is situated in the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), which is also a division of the Alfred Health Network. The vision of the MSHC is to be a leader in the management and prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and its mission is to maximise sexual health through innovation and excellence in public health, education, clinical care and research. Director of the Sexual Health Unit, Professor Christopher Fairley. There are also interactive online services provided: For the general public: www.checkyourrisk.org.au (Check your Risk) to check risk of exposure to an STI. www.healthmap.org.au (Health Map) for HIV positive people to find out what tests are needed and also what issues should be on the agenda at the next visit to the doctor or clinic. Health Map asks questions about health and provides a personal report, based on expert advice. This report directs users to chosen websites for particular needs, and provides some facts and a \"to do\" list for medical care. www.letthemknow.org.au (Let Them Know) for assisting heterosexuals diagnosed with chlamydial infections on how to inform their partners about their possible risk of infection. The site has numerous tools including examples of conversations, emails, SMS and letters to communicate the information as well as fact sheets, and a phone number (03 9341 6242) to listen to a short recorded message about chlamydia. www.testme.org.au (TESTme) provides STI testing through telephone or webcam consultations for rural Victorians living at least 150kms from Melbourne. The TESTme nurse holds a 1800 number for potential clients to call; the caller is then triaged over the telephone to find out if they are eligible for the service. If the caller is eligible, an appointment will be offered and the consultation can take place by telephone or webcam. For general practitioners: www.mshc.org.au/GPassist (GP Assist) provides a mechanism to improve partner notification through providing the www.mshc.org.au/GPassist web address on laboratory reports of positive results of common STIs. Accessible information about treatment of the more common STIs and simple tools such as partner letters and fact sheets for GPs to use in discussing partner notification are also available at this site.SEXUAL HEALTH UNIT 94LEARNING AND TEACHING In collaboration with the MSPH the Centre offers a number of postgraduate courses, postgraduate subjects and short courses in sexual health. These have been well attended and provide the Victorian community with a highly trained workforce that improves the quality of sexual health services outside the Centre. Many of the research projects of higher degree candidates enrolled through the MSPH are aimed at enhancing the services and promotion of sexual health offered at MSHC. Master of Public Health (MPH)Many students undertaking the MPH select sexual health subjects as part of their masters degree. These subjects have become increasingly popular and as a result of this, there is now a formal Sexual Health Stream within the MPH. This enables students to pursue research projects in Sexual Health as part of their MPH program. The research project in sexual health is part of the MPH and continues to be popular with students. Many students who complete a research project in sexual health also succeed in getting a paper published in a peer reviewed journal from their project. In 2010, four MPH students successfully submitted papers to academic sexual health journals for publication. Postgraduate Certificate of Public Health (Sexual Health) This course continues to attract students from a variety of professional backgrounds. This Postgraduate Certificate has become a valued qualification for nurses, doctors and other health professionals and public health practitioners wanting to specialise in sexual health. Many of the subjects can be taken by distance education and so enable rural practitioners and practitioners from interstate to take the qualifications. Semester 1 - Control of Sexually Transmissible Infections 505-531. Semester 1 - Sexually Transmissible Infections 505-432/532. Semester 1 - Clinical Sexual and Reproductive Health for nurses 505-434/534. This subject is also accredited by the Royal College of Nursing as a Pap smear provider course and by the Department of Health (DoH), Victorian Government, as a pre and post test HIV and Hepatitis C counselling course for nurses. It is becoming increasingly popular and is oversubscribed with a waiting list. It is unique in enabling nurses to pursue postgraduate qualifications as well as professional development accreditation at the same time in the field of sexual health. Often nurses who are doing the subject as a professional development course are introduced to postgraduate education and public health for the first time and many decide to pursue further qualifications in this area.

Importantly, its cause and whether it is sexually transmitted is unknown, according to the Sexual Health Unit's Dr Catriona Bradshaw, principal researcher of the WOW (Women on Women's Health) project. \"It's a very common disease. We see prevalences of 10% in Australian women attending general practices but this rises to 30% within the lesbian population - and we don't know why. We wonder if that is related to the fact that it is more easily transmissible between women than between men and women. \" The WOW study is focusing on BV in the lesbian community. Since March 2010, WOW has recruited more than 300 participants. The recruitment drive has been innovative: festivals like Mardi Gras and Midsumma, advertising on lesbian Internet dating sites and other gay media. Participants commit to regularly posting in self-administered swabs during the two-year study. The swabs are tested for BV and, if diagnosed, participants receive treatment. \" A key objective of our BV research is to determine what factors or behavioural practices are associated with the development of BV in women and their female partners and this will help us understand whether it is an STI. If it's an STI, this has enormous implications for improving our management of this common infection and for prevention, \" Dr Bradshaw says. While BV is still not considered an STI, it certainly co- exists with all the other STIs, she says. \"We see it in sex workers, we see it other groups that have a high prevalence of STIs often due to factors such as poor access to healthcare, so BV is common in women in developing countries and in Indigenous populations. The exceptions to this are lesbians, who don't have a high prevalence of STIs. \" Another reason for focusing on women is that there is no diagnostic method that can be applied to men - so the BV status of men remains a mystery, much like the disease itself. What is known is that BV can have serious health implications. In pregnancy it increases the risk of miscarriage, pre-term delivery and low birth weight, and it also increases the risk of sexual acquisition of HIV and other STIs. Why has BV remained under the STI radar? Dr Bradshaw says that in previous trials, after treatment with antibiotics, up to 50% of women got the disease again within six months. \"But when we give those antibiotics to male partners in randomised trials it doesn't seem to make any difference to the recurrence rates in women. So usually, if a disease is sexually transmitted, if you treat the woman and you treat the man, you eradicate it from a relationship. So those treatment trials were used as evidence that this is not a sexually transmitted disease. \" However, Dr Bradshaw suggests that perhaps the treatments used were not sufficiently effective to eradicate BV in either women or men, given that we don't actually know the cause. \"We might not be treating men or women correctly - we might be partially treating them but not completely treating them. \" Bv: THE STI you HA vE wH EN you DoN'T HAvE A N S TI?

MSHC has a key role at CERSH, with the Director holding Chair of the CERSH Advisory Group, providing expertise and leadership. Our nursing team manager and members of the nursing team provide support and clinical expertise in negotiating strategies aimed at building critical mass in sexual health nursing in Northeast Victoria. MSHC staff members had 35 abstracts accepted (15 oral and 20 posters) for presentation at the Sexual Health Conference, Sydney, 2010. The Australasian Chapter of Sexual Health Medicine annual update in sexual health was held in Melbourne in May 2010 and was by all measures a success with around 200 registrants attending the day. The number of registrations was encouraging, exceeding expectations, and is indicative of the level of interest there is in sexual health and the demand that exists for educational events such as these. Of the 12 speakers, seven were from MSHC. 10 sexual health videos were developed for health professionals and are located on the MSHC website at http://mshc.org.au/healthpro/OnlineEducation/Videos/tabid/510/Default.aspx or on Youtube at http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=supermshc&aq=f Dr Melanie Bissessor obtained the Fellowship of Australian Chapter of Sexual Health Medicine (FAChSHM).

Mr Huachun Zhou was awarded a PHIRST (Population Health Investing in Research Students' Training) scholarship in 2010 to fund registration of Australasian Hepatitis Conference, 2010 and obtained Knowledge Transfer Project funding in 2010 to develop sexual health information packages for female sex workers in Victoria in English, Thai, simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese and Korean. New Express Service (NETS) was implemented in June for asymptomatic heterosexual clients requiring STI screening for chlamydia and who may also request HIV and syphilis screening although their stated risk factors indicate they are at low risk for these infections. This is the 6 th year that MSHC has hosted 'Sex Talk'. 'Sex Talk' is a free one day forum that provides interested health care professionals with an annual update of epidemiological trends in STIs/HIV and other emerging information. A diverse range of 65 health professionals ranging from nurses, GPs, to Aboriginal health workers, and hailing from as close as Parkville to as far away as Sydney, took part. 2010 Conferences and public presentations What's new in Sexual Health?

PU bl ICATI o N HIGH l IGHTS Study: Young pregnant women's views on the acceptability of screening for chlamydia as part of routine antenatal care. b ilardi J e , De JS, Chen MY. BMC Infectious Diseases, 2010; 10:505 Untreated chlamydial infection among pregnant women has been associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and infant. Like most women, pregnant women infected with chlamydia do not report genital symptoms, and are therefore unlikely to be aware of their infection. A cross-sectional study of 100 pregnant women aged 16-25 years attending antenatal services across Melbourne were invited to participate in a face-to-face, semi-structured interview on the acceptability of screening for chlamydia during pregnancy (31 women were infected with chlamydia). Women had low levels SEXUAL HEALTH UNIT 98of awareness of chlamydia before the test, retained relatively little knowledge after the test and commonly had misconceptions around chlamydia transmission, testing and sequelae. There was a strong preference for urine testing over other methods of specimen collection. Women who tested positive for chlamydia had mixed reactions, however, most felt relief and gratitude at having had chlamydia detected and reported high levels of partner support. Chlamydia screening as part of routine antenatal care was considered highly acceptable among young pregnant women who recognised the benefits of screening and strongly supported its implementation as part of routine antenatal care. The acceptability of screening is important to the uptake of chlamydia screening in future antenatal screening strategies. Study: Men who have sex with men prefer rapid testing for syphilis and may test more frequently using it. Lee DM, Chen MY, f airley CK, Cummings R, Bush M and Read T. Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 2010; 37 (9): 557-558 Syphilis has re-emerged among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Australia and internationally, with over-representation among HIV-positive MSM. Syphilis is believed to increase the risk of HIV transmission. Despite public health measures aimed at reducing syphilis, reported rates remain high among MSM. Studies suggest that more frequent screening of MSM and HIV-positive MSM results in increasing early detection of early, asymptomatic syphilis and are likely to reduce transmission of infection. We undertook rapid syphilis testing of MSM using the Determine Syphilis TP immunoassay to ascertain their views on rapid testing and whether these would increase screening for syphilis. Most indicated a preference for rapid testing over conventional serology. Most also indicated that they would test for syphilis more frequently if rapid syphilis testing was available in a clinic setting. Rapid, or point of care, testing for syphilis, which can be undertaken in clinical and nonclinical settings, has the potential to increase the uptake and frequency of syphilis screening and reduce the number of syphilis infected individuals who do not return for their results. Study: Australian men who have sex with men prefer rapid oral HIV testing over conventional blood testing for HIV. Chen MY, b ilardi J e , Lee D, Cummings R, Bush M and f airley CK. Int J STD AIDS, 2010; 21 (6): 428-430 This study examined the views of 172 community-based Australian men who have sex with men (MSM) on the acceptability and potential uptake of rapid oral testing for HIV in clinic and home- based settings. Men were asked to complete a questionnaire that sought their views on rapid testing for HIV. When asked about which HIV test they would prefer in a clinic setting, 64% indicated a preference for rapid oral HIV testing and 74% indicated that if rapid oral HIV testing was available at a clinic they would test for HIV more frequently. If rapid oral HIV testing was available for home testing, 63% of men indicated it would be likely they would test themselves for HIV and 61% indicated they would test more frequently. Overall, MSM expressed a preference for rapid oral HIV testing and would test more frequently if testing was available for clinic or home use in Australia. Study: Telling partners about chlamydia: how acceptable are the new f airley CK, JS, Chen MY. BMC Infectious Diseases, 2010; 10:58 The newer technologies of email and SMS have been used as a means of improving partner notification rates. This study explored the use and acceptability of different partner notification methods to help inform the development of strategies and resources to increase the number of partners notified. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 40 people who were recently diagnosed with chlamydia from three sexual health centres and two general practices across three Australian jurisdictions. Most participants chose to contact their partners either in person (56%) or by phone (44%). Only 17% chose email or SMS. Participants viewed face-to-face as the \"gold standard\" in partner notification because it demonstrated caring, respect and courage. Telephone contact, while considered insensitive by some, was often valued because it was quick, convenient and less confronting. Email was often seen as less personal while SMS was generally considered the least acceptable method for telling partners. There was also concern that emails and SMS could be misunderstood, not taken seriously or shown to others. Despite these, email and SMS were seen to be appropriate and useful in some circumstances. Letters, both from the patients or from their doctor, were viewed more favourably but were seldom used. These findings suggest that many people diagnosed with chlamydia are reluctant to use the new technologies for partner notification, except in specific circumstances, and our efforts in developing partner notification resources may best be focused on giving patients the skills and confidence for personal interaction.SEXUAL HEALTH UNITMelbo U rNe SC H ool of Po PUlA TI o N H eAl TH CENTRE FOR hEalTh & S OCiETy 99Year's overview This year, ViRGo continued to provide key information regarding the impact of the 2009 influenza pandemic in australia and provided advice on future strategies to mitigate such events, locally and internationally. Ensuring the safety of both pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines was another active area, with Professor Terry Nolan leading the australian Technical advisory Group on immunisation's (a TaGi) rapid investigation into an apparent increase in paediatric influenza vaccine-associated febrile convulsions, and Dr Jodie McVernon contributing to an influenza Vaccine Expert Panel that advised the Therapeutic Goods administration. We also conducted research to inform optimal scheduling of vaccines within the National immunisation Program (NiP), with a particular focus on pertussis and meningococcal disease. RESEARCH Pandemic H1N1 influenza (i) National pandemic (H1N1) influenza serosurveillance study - this government-funded project, led by the University of Melbourne, involved collaboration with the australian Red Cross Blood Service and World health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on influenza.

(ii) Learning from the 2009 pandemic response - we reported on several National health and Medical Research Council (NhMRC) urgent h1N1 influenza projects. These included observations of compliance with school closure and quarantine measures implemented during the Victorian epidemic; macroeconomic impact of mild and potentially more severe pandemics in the australian setting; and recommendations for capacity building efforts in preparedness for future pandemics, given the likely impacts of diagnostic and drug delivery constraints on efforts to limit influenza transmission. (iii) Preparing for future pandemics - a national consortium of modellers, led by the University of Melbourne, provided decision support to the australian Government Department of health and ageing's Office of health Protection through the 2009 pandemic response. The University of Melbourne was further contracted by the National Emergency Management agency of Mongolia to conduct risk-assessment modelling to inform future preparedness activities specific to that country's unique infrastructural and population challenges, based on evaluation of the 2009/10 pandemic response. Pertussis (i) Birth dose pertussis study -ViRGo was one of several trial centres around australia to be involved in a study, led by the National Centre for immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCiRS), evaluating the safety and antibody response to an initial dose of pertussis vaccine given to babies in the first days of life. This study continues to recruit in 2011 and will provide valuable information regarding the potential for newborn immunisation to help protect against this life-threatening disease during the vulnerable first few months of life.

Dr Jodie McVernon and research fellow Dr James McCaw visited Mongolia when the Melbourne School of Population Health's VIRGo was commissioned by the World Bank to take part in an avian and human influenza pandemic preparedness project. Ulaanbaatar, one the world's coldest capitals with winter lows of -16 degrees Celsius, was swathed in a 37 degree summer heat wave when the pair arrived in July 2010 for an intensely busy two weeks. Health authorities were still regrouping from the impact of a H1N1 pandemic and a severe outbreak of Influenza B, which were both over by the time the VIRGo team visited. Mongolia's health authorities already had an excellent epidemiological surveillance system that revealed a surprising story, says Dr McVernon. \" Among the challenges unique to Mongolia, the big thing is space. Australia has two people per square kilometre, Mongolia has one, \" she says. \"In this enormous country, most of the population live in three cities. \"Before we went we thought it would take ages for flu to spread but what we found from the surveillance data was that yes, it was a bit slower in the provinces but once there was a flu outbreak in Ulaanbaatar, the flu was all over the country in a couple of weeks. \"This is because there is huge mobility of people and Ulaanbaatar is a really important hub, with a major east-west road, and another north-south road going down to China and that is how the flu mostly got in. \"Y ou could see quite clearly how important geography was to the flu's spread. \" The project's emphasis on bird flu was due to the large migratory bird populations that pass through the country's north en route to Lake Baikal in Siberia. Avian flu-infected birds had been detected in Mongolia. \"Our part of the project was to help plan what to do if the avian flu got into the human population, \" Dr McVernon says. \"How could we reduce the impact? And what interventions were needed to reduce its spread.\"We visited hospitals, family medicine clinics, and spoke to people in the health department and in flu surveillance, and we were based in the National Emergency Management Agency which coordinates a whole of society response. \" VIRGo's track record in helping Australian governments to deal with pandemic preparedness had prompted the World Bank to enlist VIRGo's expertise. \"This project fit our own emphasis on developing pragmatic and feasible strategies that suit the limited resources available and the setting, \" she says. \"The World Bank was very pleased with the detail and the quality of our work and they felt that it set an important precedent because the WHO (World Health Organisation) tends to apply a 'one size fits all' approach to pandemics in developing countries. But this was something where we worked with the people on the ground to identify their specific strengths and capabilities and built on that. \"VIRGo HE lpS MonGol IA plAn foR pAndEMIC Dr James McCaw and Dr Jodie McVernon in the national dress of Mongolia. 101led analysis of three population surveys of immunity to pertussis collected by NCiRS over the past two decades. her work provided new insights into a current sustained national outbreak of this infection, and will be used in development of mathematical models to predict the likely impact of possible vaccine schedule changes.

VaCCiNE a ND iMMUN iSaTiON RESE aRCh GROUP105Year's overview The Indigenous Eye Health Unit was founded in January 2008. The Unit's goal is to \"Close the Gap\" for vision, and to do this a five-year program has been embarked upon to address the gross disparities in eye health between Indigenous Australians and the mainstream population. This program is reliant on the development of a well-reasoned, evidence-based blueprint for new policy to deliver sustainable quality eye care to Indigenous Australians. The key expected outcomes of the Unit's research are: A comprehensive assessment of the state of eye health across the Indigenous population of Australia and a clear prioritisation of appropriate and specific intervention strategies. Accessible, affordable, appropriate and sustainable solutions developed and implemented to overcome the current eye health inequalities. The elimination of trachoma in Australia. A major reduction in the prevalence of vision loss in Indigenous Australians. A body of research work to lead changes in Australia's health policy, bringing improved eye health and vision to Indigenous Australians.iN DiGeN oUs eYe H eaL TH UN iT aN NUaL rePo rT 2 010 The Indigenous Eye Health Unit undertakes high quality research and policy development in Indigenous eye health to provide an evidence base to assess the needs in Indigenous eye health and prioritise specific intervention strategies. Director of the Indigenous Eye Health Unit, Professor Hugh R Taylor AC. To date, we have undertaken a three step process to develop the evidence to inform policy. This comprises: A national survey of Indigenous eye health to define the size of the problem. Health services research to establish currently available eye services, barriers to eye care and best practice. Development of costed, evidence-based policy recommendations. In 2010, good progress was made in all these areas and the findings of this work have laid the foundation for our ongoing activities. Natio Na l Survey of i Nd igeNo uS ey e Healt H This survey, which was completed in 2009, examined nearly 3000 Indigenous children and adults in 30 sites across the country. The key findings were: Indigenous children start life with five times less poor vision than mainstream. Indigenous adults have six times more blindness than mainstream, but 94% of this is unnecessary. One third of adults have never had an eye exam and have not received the \"simple\" eye care they need; glasses, cataract surgery, diabetic eye exams, or trachoma control. The summary report is available via the Indigenous Eye Health Unit website www.iehu.unimelb.edu.au Healt H Se rvice S reS earc H The main messages from the health services research that we have undertaken over the last two years have allowed us to: Quantify the underutilisation of existing eye services by Indigenous people in more populated areas. In addition, identify the need to increase outreach eye services some four- or five-fold in more remote areas. InD IGE nO U s EyE HE AlT H U nI T 106'Clean faces, strong eyes' is a simple message that is delivering powerful benefits to children in remote Aboriginal communities. Under a project led by Professor Hugh T aylor of the Indigenous Eye Health Unit at the Melbourne School of Population Health, the slogan headlines the T rachoma Story Kits being distributed to Aboriginal communities, schools and health centres in three states. The kits are the basis of a health promotion campaign to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, trachoma. T rachoma affects 7% of children in very remote regions and is a major cause of blindness in Indigenous Australians. The kits' co-developers were the Katherine West Health Board and the Centre for Disease Control, Department of Health and Families Northern T erritory. The simplicity of the slogan belies the complexity of the grassroots consultation behind the kits' development. The process ensured that the kits' messages were clear, culturally appropriate and understood, and well received, Professor T aylor says. \"It took about a year of sitting down with community groups, school principals and health care workers. \" This included the valued contribution of community elders from the Ngumpin Reference Group. Ngumpin represents leaders of the seven Indigenous communities the team visited around the Northern T erritory town of Katherine. The result is an integrated package of materials that are easy to read, and meld clinical and cultural knowledge and practices, using lively images to engage children and their families. The T rachoma Story Kit's 'toolbox' is tailored to suit clinics, communities and schools using resources such as flip charts, posters, and stickers for children, lesson plans for teachers and online tutorials for clinicians. The philanthropic backing of the projected expedited its roll-out. \"If you have to write a grant to ARC or NHMRC it might take two years to get the funding. But having the philanthropic funding allowed us to get right on and do it, \" Professor T aylor says. \"It also gave us the flexibility to get back and forth to communities multiple times. People had faith in us and that enabled us to really move ahead. \" The Melbourne Football Club is also supporting the project, sending Indigenous footy heroes Liam Jurrah, Aaron Davey and Austin Wonaeamirri to promote the message in remote communities. The kits have been a big \"hit\" with their target audiences. By the end of 2010 over 300 kits had been distributed across the Northern T erritory, Western Australia and South Australia. And teachers have added their own imaginative tweaks, using computer SMART Boards to digitise kit images. This gives students heightened interactivity; they can colour in the screen images and hear sound effects linked to the content. Professor T aylor has found the enthusiastic adoption of the kits highly rewarding. \"It's having put in the work and then seeing how people have taken the kits up and used that material - it's terrific. T o see them being used widely is also very satisfying. We're really waiting for the real proof of the pudding and that's for the rates of trachoma to decrease in these kids. I would hope we'd see things starting to improve by the end of 2011. \"Simple meSSa ge deliver S ' Str oNg eyeS ' The Trachoma Story Kit for Schools InD IGE nO U s EyE HE AlT H U nI TMelbourne School of Po Pu lation he alth 107 Demonstrate that effective services are closely linked with Aboriginal Medical s ervices and need excellent coordination at all levels of care. Gather evidence for world's best practice in the treatment of trachoma and the detection of diabetic eye disease. In 2010, the Indigenous Eye Health Unit has focused on distilling the main messages from these various areas of research to create a number of reports that feed into policy research and development. Many aspects of these research findings were assembled in an executive summary report entitled Provision of Indigenous Eye Health Services that was launched in May 2010 by the Federal Minister for Indigenous Health, the Hon Warren s nowdon MP . Also released at that time were the full component reports Access to Eye Health Services among Indigenous Australians, Diabetic Retinopathy. Accuracy of Screening Methods for Diabetic Retinopathy: A Systematic Review and Outreach Eye Services in Australia. These reports are all available via the Unit website at www.iehu.unimelb.edu.au h ealth Service u tilisation In 2010, Associate Professor Margaret Kelaher finalised her research on the equity of access to eye health services at a community level by examining the relationship between the percentage of Indigenous people living in an area, socioeconomic status and remoteness with the utilisation of and availability of ophthalmic and optometric services. Despite a number of Government initiatives to improve Indigenous peoples' access to eye health services, there remain significant inequities in access and availability. This research was published in a report entitled Access to Eye Health Services among Indigenous Australians, which is available via the Unit website at www.iehu.unimelb.edu.au i ndigenous e ye e vidence Mapping Professor Russell Gruen and Dr Peter Bragge have been working on comprehensive reviews of the research literature of eye care for Indigenous peoples, examining screening for diabetic retinopathy and the control of trachoma. A comprehensive report on the accuracy of screening methods for diabetic retinopathy was published in 2009, and a similarly comprehensive review of trachoma treatments, Trachoma. Antibiotic Treatments of Trachoma: A Systematic Review, was published in 2010. Both reports are available via the Indigenous Eye Health Unit website at www.iehu.unimelb.edu.au h istory of i ndigenous e ye h ealth Policy Mr Graham Henderson and Ms Jilpia Jones (formerly of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres s trait Islander s tudies) have been working with Professor Ian Anderson to prepare an historical review of the development of the policy in eye health programs. They have been examining the drivers and key barriers that led to the formation and implementation of the current policies, undertaking a literature review and conducting interviews with key people who have been involved in the sector over a number of years. This work, which is to be published in early 2011, will inform us as to how things came to be the way they are and what has driven and facilitated the development of new policy. de velopme Nt of iNte rveNti oN S trategie S & po licy rec omme N datio NS This major focus of our work in 2010 was assisted by the appointment of the Unit's newly established Poche Fellows (generously supported by Mr Greg Poche AO). The Poche Fellows, Mr Mitchell Anjou, Ms Andrea Boudville, Ms Robyn Mc n eil and Mr Colin Garlett, have been examining the barriers experienced by Indigenous Australians in accessing eye care, and in work also supported by Mr Poche members of the Centre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics (Professor David Dunt, Dr Arthur Hseuh and Mr Alex Brando) have started to examine the health economics aspect of eye care policy development. There are four key aims of this phase of this research: Identify the specific limitations and restrictions of the current funding mechanisms that support visiting eye care services to remote areas (Medical s pecialist Outreach Assistance Program - M s OAP , and Visiting Optometrist s cheme - VO s ). Identify barriers to access for Aboriginal people to existing eye care services in urban and rural areas and ways to overcome them. Identify key components to enhance the pathway of care for the provision of eye services through Aboriginal Health s ervices and at a regional level. Identify the health economic implications of the proposed policy changes. r emote and Visiting Services - Service Provision There is a marked shortage of optometric and ophthalmic services into more remote areas. Efficient outreach eye care services need proper coordination and sustainable funding. To this end, we are focusing on identification of the specific limitations and restrictions of the current funding mechanisms that support visiting eye care services to remote areas, including the Medical s pecialist Outreach Assistance Program (M s OAP) and Visiting Optometrist s cheme (VO s ), with a view to increasing the availability of these services some four-fold. Pathway of c are - Service Delivery The patient pathway of care is being explored through all project consultations undertaken in rural and visiting services and urban and rural services and in discussions with Government and other stakeholders. It is becoming quite clear that efficient and effective coordination is needed at all stages of the referral network and that many people are involved in providing care and services throughout the pathway of care. Integrated and sustainable models are being sought to enhance this process. u rban and r ural Services - Service u tilisation The n ational Indigenous Eye Health s urvey ( n IEH s ) findings demonstrated that despite geographical location relating to remoteness, the prevalence of eye health problems were not statistically different. In urban and rural areas, where services were InD IGE nO U s EyE HE AlT H U nI T 108locally available, there remains an issue of utilisation of available services. This phase of our research is intended to explore the barriers to accessing eye health care services in urban and rural areas and identifing enabling solutions by examining areas where good utilisation is occurring. It is also anticipated that local solutions can be developed with communities participating to improve access and utilisation of eye care services for Indigenous people in these communities. The last project is being conducted in Victoria, but its findings will be combined with those of the two other studies to develop national recommendations for the development and enhancement of the provision of eye care to Indigenous Australians. Specific diS eaS e pr ogram S Trachoma control, particularly through the Katherine West project, was another main focus for the Unit in 2010. This also includes Professor Taylor's input into the national program to eliminate blinding trachoma that was announced by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in February 2009. We are working with the Katherine West Health Board and the n orthern Territory Department of Health and Families (Alice s prings) on a healthy skin and healthy eyes project to raise awareness about trachoma and produce materials to support health promotion and education programs in the communities in this region. We have prepared a suite of materials for regional trachoma control programs and health promotion and education tools to support the screening, treatment and community awareness raising on the importance of keeping kids faces clean to reduce the spread of trachoma infection. These Trachoma s tory Kits, which combine clinical and cultural knowledge and practice, were launched by Hon Warren s nowdon MP at the Katherine West Health Board on 5 August 2010. In addition, in 2010 the Melbourne Football Club committed to support trachoma elimination in Australia. Unit staff and members of the Melbourne Football Club visited yuendumu in May 2010 and conducted very well received health education activities and football clinics. Indigenous players l iam Jurrah and Aaron Davey are program ambassadors and in 2011, through a DVD, posters and an ambitious live link up with schools, they will be taking the key messages of trachoma elimination to Indigenous school children in many remote communities across the n orthern Territory.adv ocacy Advocacy continued throughout the year as an important part of our remit to brief s tate and Territory ministers, senior health bureaucrats, n on-Government Organisations ( n GOs) and local community-controlled health organisations on our research and policy recommendations to close the gap for vision. ad vi So ry Board Professor Terry nolan (Chair) Professor Ian Anderson Professor Glenn Bowes Mr T revor Buzzacott Professor John Funder AO Mrs Janet Hirst Professor Barry Jones AO Ms Jilpia Jones AM Mr David Middleton Mr Reg Richardson AM Professor Hugh R.
