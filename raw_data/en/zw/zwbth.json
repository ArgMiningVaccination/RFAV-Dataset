Hi Delilah, what was your thought process behind starting your own business? Funny thing is, I was never the kid (or adult) who had the dream of \"I want to be a business owner one day\". Owning my own business presented itself as an essential element for me to be able to live out my purpose, and I just had to accept that. I'm a very against the grain kind of person, very innovative, and I don't follow norms. We all enter this world with beautiful gifts to share, and as I progressed further into adulthood it became increasingly clear to me that there's no way I'll be able to share my gifts if I follow societal norms and do what everyone else is doing. I'm a registered dietitian and a reiki energy healer. My approach to nutrition, as you can probably imagine, is quite holistic and unique. Even though spirituality and holistic wellness are gaining lots of traction, what I do as a holistic dietitian is still considered pretty fringe; especially when you step outside of the LA wellness bubble. I was not happy working as a regular dietitian, following the standard western approach to health. I could see that my clients were not getting the best help possible from me, and that bothered me to no end. That was when reiki entered my life and filled the gap. By combining energy healing and nutrition coaching, I'm able to facilitate deep level, long lasting diet and lifestyle changes for my clients. This looks like powerful mindset shifts, food freedom, and increased body confidence and self esteem. My most recent endeavor is my newly launched brand called Bisa which is a line of vegan dietary supplements. I recognized that the dietary supplement industry is in desperate need of nutrition supplements created by a qualified nutrition expert who is also environmentally conscious. This is how Bisa was born and I'm thrilled to be able to offer nutritional support to the public from this new angle. Can you give our readers an introduction to your business? Maybe you can share a bit about what you do and what sets you apart from others? I'm a registered dietitian who takes a mind-body-spirit approach to nutrition. I specialize in vegan and vegetarian nutrition for pregnancy and postpartum. I also support clients dealing with other female reproductive health issues such as as PCOS, and clients who need support with chronic diseases such a type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Essentially, I combine textbook nutrition knowledge with reiki energy healing to provide the most comprehensive and individualized nutrition coaching. In addition to running a nutrition private practice, I also founded a vegan dietary supplement company. It's no secret that the dietary supplement industry is highly unregulated. Practically anyone can sell supplements these days, and with no nutrition expertise. Bisa, my brand of vegan dietary supplements, is a line of nutrition supplements created by an actual, qualified nutrition expert. Doctors are not nutrition experts, and nutritionists don't meet the same qualifications as registered dietitians. The public needs nutrition supplements created by a dietitian because we are the only ones who have dedicated our career to ensuring that we provide evidence based nutrition guidance to the public. Bisa supplements are backed by science and are carefully crafted with the ideal forms and dosages to promote optimal health. Let's say your best friend was visiting the area and you wanted to show them the best time ever. Where would you take them? Give us a little itinerary - say it was a week long trip, where would you eat, drink, visit, hang out, etc. LA has so much to offer from city life to scenic views of nature. I'd make sure that my guest gets a taste of both while visiting. In terms of nature, I'd have to take my friend to the beach in Malibu. I prefer the less crowded beaches so we head out to something like El Matador or Point Dume. For city adventures, we'd spend time checking out shops and cafes around DTLA, Silverlake, and Melrose. And of course, we'd keep our tummies full with plenty of vegan eats from vegan restaurants in each neighborhood. The Shoutout series is all about recognizing that our success and where we are in life is at least somewhat thanks to the efforts, support, mentorship, love and encouragement of others. So is there someone that you want to dedicate your shoutout to? I'm shouting out my tribe! I'm a firm believer in the power of surrounding yourself with living examples of what you desire for yourself. I'm incredibly blessed to be surrounded by a phenomenal group of women whom I admire and strive to be like. There is so much I learn from them which benefits both my personal and professional growth. Frankly, the entrepreneur path of owning your own business can be lonely at times. So it's really important for me to maintain these close friendships so that I can gather motivation and inspiration from other women who are also following this same entrepreneurial path.
