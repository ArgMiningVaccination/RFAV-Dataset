A typical consult with Ness the Naturopath will involve using iridology, tongue and nail analysis as well as thorough dietary and lifestyle assessment. Depending on individual outcomes, a better health program will be designed for each client to help them achieve a balanced, happy, healthy lifestyle. Initial consultations 1hr to 1 1/2hrs. Aromatherapy and aromatic herbs have been used for thousands of years. The wonderful benefits of aromatherapy can be experienced through using topical applications, direct inhalation or by vaporising in a diffuser to release fragrance into the air around you. As a certified Aromatherapist, I can guide you in the benefit of essential oils and other plant based aroma compounds, to help reduce stress and anxiety, and restore physical and emotional wellbeing.
