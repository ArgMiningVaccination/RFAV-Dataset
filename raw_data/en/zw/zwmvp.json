The high-intensity proton beams provide a large neu-trino flux, sampled by a near detector system consisting ofa combination of capable precision detectors, and by the massive far detector system located deep underground. This conguration sets up DUNE as a machine for discovery, asit enables opportunities not only to perform precision neu- trino measurements that may uncover deviations from (corresponding author) be-mail: alex.sousa@uc.edu ce-mail: jaehoon@uta.edupresent three-flavor mixing paradigm, but also to discover new particles and unveil new interactions and symmetries beyond those predicted in the Standard Model (SM).

C (2021) 81:322 Page 7 of 51 322 1 Introduction The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation, long-baseline (LBL) neutrino oscillation experiment, designed to be sensitive to toeoscillation. The experiment consists of a high-power, broadband neu-trino beam, a powerful precision near detector (ND) complex located at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, in Batavia, Illinois, USA, and a massive liquid argon time-projectionchamber (LArTPC) far detector (FD) located at the 4850 ft level of Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), in Lead, South Dakota, USA. The baseline of 1285 km pro-vides sensitivity, in a single experiment, to all parameters governing LBL neutrino oscillation. The deep underground location of the FD facilitates sensitivity to nucleon decay andother rare processes including low-energy neutrino detectionenabling, for instance, observation of neutrinos from a core- collapse supernova. Owing to the high-power proton beam facility, the ND consisting of precision detectors capable of off-axis data tak- ing and the massive FD, DUNE provides enormous oppor- tunities to probe phenomena beyond the SM traditionallydifcult to reach in neutrino experiments. Of such vast, rich physics topics that profoundly expand those probed in the past neutrino experiments, this paper reports a selection ofstudies of DUNE's sensitivity to a variety of BSM particlesand effects, initially presented in the physics volume of the DUNE Technical Design Report (TDR) [ 1] recently made available. Some of these phenomena impact the LBL oscil-lation measurement, while others may be detected by DUNE using specic analyses. Section 2describes some of the common assumptions and tools used in these analyses. Section 3discusses sensitivity to sterile neutrinos, Sect. 4looks into the effect of non-unitary of the neutrino mixing matrix, Sect. 5describes sensitivity to non-standard neutrino interactions, Sect. 6discusses sen- sitivity to CPT and Lorentz violation, Sect. 7describes the sensitivity to new physics by measuring neutrino trident pro- duction, Sect. 8discusses various dark matter searches that could be performed by DUNE, Sect. 9describes sensitivity to baryon number violation by one and two units, and Sect. 10 lists some other possible avenues for BSM physics searches. These studies reveal that DUNE can probe a rich and diverse BSM phenomenology at the discovery level, as in the case of searches for dark matter created in the high-powerproton beam interactions and from cosmogenic sources, or bysignicantly improving existing constraints, as in the cases of sterile neutrino mixing, non-standard neutrino interactions, CPT violation, new physics trident pro-duction, and nucleon decay.Table 1 LArTPC ND properties used in some of the BSM physics analyses Properties Values Active volume 7 m wide, 3 m high, 5 m long Fiducial volume 6 m wide, 2 m high, 4 m longTotal mass 147 tonFiducial mass 67.2 tonDistance from target 574 m 2 Analysis details The BSM searches presented in this paper span a wide vari- ety of physics topics and techniques. The analyses rely on neutrino beam data taken at the ND and/or FD, atmospheric or other astrophysical sources of neutrinos, or signal from thedetector material itself, as in nucleon decay searches. Thissection summarizes some of the common assumptions and tools used in the analyses, with more details provided in the following sections. 2.1 Detector assumptions The DUNE FD will consist of four 10 kt ducial (PD systems) [ 2-4]. In these analyses, we assume all four modules have identical responses. All of the analysesdescribed will use data from the FD, except for the analysespresented in Sects. 7,8.1, and 10.3, which use data exclu- sively from the ND. The ND will be located at a distance of 574 m from the target. The ND concept consists of a modular LArTPC, a magnetized high-pressure gas argon TPC and a beam mon- itor. The combination of the rst two detectors is plannedto be movable to sample the off-axis neutrino spectrum to reduce flux uncertainties, a concept called DUNE-PRISM [1]. Since the ND conguration, however, was not yet nal- ized at the time these studies were performed, we adoptedonly the LArTPC component of the detector and its du- cial volume. In the analyses presented here, the LArTPC is assumed to be 7 m wide, 3 m high, and 5 m long. The ducialvolume is assumed to include the detector volume up to 50 cm of each face of the detector. The ND properties are given in Table 1. The signal and background efciencies vary with the physics model being studied. Detailed signal and back- ground efciencies for each physics topic are discussed along with each analysis. 2.2 Neutrino beam assumptions The analyses described in Sects. 3,4,5, and 6are based on analysis of neutrino beam data at both the ND and FD. The 123 322 Page 8 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 DUNE neutrino beam is produced using protons Main Injector and a traditional horn-focusing system[5]. The polarity of the focusing magnets may be reversed to produce a neutrino- or antineutrino-dominated beam. This optimized beam conguration includes a three-horn focus-ing system with a 1 m long target embedded within the rsthorn and a decay pipe with 194 m length and 4 m diameter. The neutrino flux produced by this beamline is simulated at a distance of 574 m downstream of the neutrino target for theND and 1285 km for the FD. Fluxes have been generated for both neutrino mode and antineutrino mode using G4LBNF [1,6], a Geant4 -based simulation [ 7-9]. Results based on beam neutrino data are given for a 300 kt \u00b7 MW\u00b7year exposure. With the current deployment plan [ 1], this exposure will be achieved in approximately 7 years oncethe beam is operational. For results not based on beam data,the exposure is given in units of kt \u00b7year in each relevant section. 2.3 Tools In the analyses presented in Sects. 3,4,5, and 6,t h es i m u l a - tion of the DUNE experimental setup was performed with theGeneral Long-Baseline Experiment Simulator (GLoBES) software [ 10,11]. Unless otherwise noted, the neutrino fluxes used in the BSM physics analysis are the same as those usedin the DUNE LBL three-flavor analysis [ 1]. The congura- tion of the beam used in ND analyses is assumed to be a 120 GeV proton beam with 1.2 MW beam power at 56%uptime, providing 1 .1\u00d710 21POT/year. Cross-section les describing neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) interactions with argon are generated using Generates Eventsfor Neutrino Interaction Experiments (GENIE) [ 12,13]v e r - sion 2.8.4. The true-to-reconstructed smearing matrices and the selection efciency as a function of energy for various signal and background modes are generated using nominalDUNE MC simulation. A 40 kt ducial mass is assumed for the FD, exposed to a 120 GeV, 1 .2 MW beam. The eand \u00afeappearance signal modes have independent normalization uncertainties of 2% each, while and\u00afdisappearance sig- nal modes have independent normalization uncertainties of 5%. The background normalization uncertainties range from5 to 20% and include correlations among various sources ofbackground. More details can be found in Ref. [ 1]. The neutrino trident search presented in Sect. 7and the baryon number violation analyses presented in Sect. 9use samples of simulated and reconstructed signal and back- ground events, produced using standard DUNE detection simulation and reconstruction software. Further details aregiven in those sections. For analyses that use neither GLoBES nor the standard DUNE simulation and reconstruction software, such as thedark matter analyses described in Sect. 8and several of theanalyses described in Sect. 10, details are given in the relevant sections. 3 Sterile Neutrino Mixing Experimental results in tension with the three-neutrino-flavor paradigm, which may be interpreted as mixing between the known active neutrinos and one or more sterile states, haveled to a rich and diverse program of searches for oscillations into sterile neutrinos [ 14,15]. DUNE is sensitive over a broad range of potential sterile neutrino mass splittings by lookingfor disappearance of CC and NC interactions over the longdistance separating the ND and FD, as well as over the short baseline of the ND. With a longer baseline, a more intense beam, and a high-resolution large-mass FD, compared toprevious experiments, DUNE provides a unique opportunity to improve signicantly on the sensitivities of the existing probes, and greatly enhance the ability to map the extendedparameter space if a sterile neutrino is discovered. In the sterile neutrino mixing studies presented here, we assume a minimal 3+1 oscillation scenario with three active neutrinosand one sterile neutrino, which includes a new independentneutrino mass-squared difference, m 2 41, and for which the mixing matrix is extended with three new mixing angles, 14, 24,34, and two additional phases 14and24. Disappearance of the beam neutrino flux between the ND and FD results from the quadratic suppression of the sterile mixing angle measured in appearance experiments, e, with respect to its disappearance counterparts, 24for LBL experiments, and ee14for reactor experiments. These disappearance effects have not yet been observed and are intension with appearance results [ 14,15] when global ts of all available data are carried out. The exposure of DUNE's high- resolution FD to the high-intensity LBNF beam will also allow direct probes of non-standard electron (anti)neutrinoappearance. DUNE will look for active-to-sterile neutrino mixing using the reconstructed energy spectra of both NC and CCneutrino interactions in the FD, and their comparison to the extrapolated predictions from the ND measurement. Since NC cross sections and interaction topologies are the same forall three active neutrino flavors, the NC spectrum is insensi-tive to standard neutrino mixing. However, should there be oscillations into a fourth light neutrino, an energy-dependent depletion of the neutrino flux would be observed at the FD,as the sterile neutrino would not interact in the detector vol- ume. Furthermore, if sterile neutrino mixing is driven by a large mass-square difference m 2 411e V2, the CC spec- trum will be distorted at energies higher than the energy cor- responding to the standard oscillation maximum. Therefore, CC disappearance is also a powerful probe of sterile neutrinomixing at long baselines. 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 9 of 51 322 We assume the mixing matrix augmented with one sterile state is parameterized by U=R34S24S14R23S13R12[16], where Rijis the rotational matrix for the mixing angle ij, and Sijrepresents a complex rotation by the mixing angle ijand the CP-violating phase ij. At long baselines the NC disappearance probability to rst order for small is then oscillation probability for CC probability, similarly approximated by: P()1sin2223sin231 +2s i n2223sin224sin231 described by: sin2214sin241. (3) Figure 1shows how the standard three-flavor oscillation probability is distorted at neutrino energies above the stan- dard oscillation peak when oscillations into sterile neutrinos are included. The sterile neutrino effects have been implemented in GLoBES via the existing plug-in for sterile neutrinos and non-standard interactions [ 17]. As described above, the ND will play a very important role in the sensitivity to sterile neu-trinos both directly, for rapid oscillations with m 2 41>1e V2 where the sterile oscillation matches the ND baseline, and indirectly, at smaller values of m2 41where the ND is cru- cial to reduce the systematic uncertainties affecting the FD to increase its sensitivity. To include these ND effects in these studies, the most recent GLoBES DUNE conguration lesdescribing the FD were modied by adding a ND with corre-lated systematic errors with the FD. As a rst approximation, the ND is assumed to be an identical scaled-down version of the TDR FD, with identical efciencies, backgrounds andenergy reconstruction. The systematic uncertainties origi- nally dened in the GLoBES DUNE conceptual design report (CDR) conguration already took into account the effect ofthe ND constraint. Thus, since we are now explicitly sim- ulating the ND, larger uncertainties have been adopted but partially correlated between the different channels in the NDand FD, so that their impact is reduced by the combinationFig. 1 Regions of L/Eprobed by the DUNE detector compared to 3-flavor and 3 +1-flavor neutrino disappearance and appearance proba- bilities. The gray-shaded areas show the range of true neutrino ener-gies probed by the ND and FD. The top axis shows true neutrinoenergy, increasing from right to left. The top plot shows the probabili-ties assuming mixing with one sterile neutrino with m 2 41=0.05 eV2, corresponding to the slow oscillations regime. The middle plot assumesmixing with one sterile neutrino with m 2 41=0.5e V2, corresponding to the intermediate oscillations regime. The bottom plot includes mix-ing with one sterile neutrino with m 2 41=50 eV2, corresponding to the rapid oscillations regime. As an example, the slow sterile oscilla- tions cause visible distortions in the three-flavor survival probability (blue curve) for neutrino energies 10 GeV, well above the three-flavor oscillation minimum 123 322 Page 10 of 51 Eur.

The full set of systematic uncertainties employed in the sterile neutrino studies is listed in Table 2. Finally, for oscillations observed at the ND, the uncer- tainty on the production point of the neutrinos can play an important role. We have included an additional 20% energy smearing, which produces a similar effect given the L/E dependence of oscillations. We implemented this smearing in the ND through multiplication of the migration matrices provided with the GLoBES les by an additional matrix withthe 20% energy smearing obtained by integrating the Gaus- sian c(E,E/prime)1 (E) 2e(EE/prime)2 2((E))2, E/prime, where Eis the true neutrino energy from simulation. By default, GLoBES treats all systematic uncertainties included in the t as normalization shifts. However, depend- ing on the value of m2 41, sterile mixing will induce shape distortions in the measured energy spectrum beyond simplenormalization shifts. As a consequence, shape uncertainties are very relevant for sterile neutrino searches, particularly in regions of parameter space where the ND, with virtually in-nite statistics, has a dominant contribution. The correct inclu- sion of systematic uncertainties affecting the shape of the energy spectrum in the two-detector t GLoBES frameworkused for this analysis posed technical and computational chal-lenges beyond the scope of the study. Therefore, for each limit plot, we present two limits bracketing the expected DUNE sensitivity limit, namely: the black limit line, a best-case sce-nario, where only normalization shifts are considered in a ND + FD t, where the ND statistics and shape have the strongest impact; and the grey limit line, corresponding to aworst-case scenario where only the FD is considered in the t, together with a rate constraint from the ND. Studying the sensitivity to 14, the dominant channels are those regarding edisappearance. Therefore, only the eCCsample is analyzed and the channels for NC and CC dis- appearance are not taken into account, as they do not influ-ence greatly the sensitivity and they slow down the simu-lations. The sensitivity at the 90% condence level (CL), taking into account the systematic uncertainties mentioned above, is shown in Fig. 2, along with a comparison to current constraints. For the 24mixing angle, we analyze the CC disappear- ance and the NC samples, which are the main contributorsto the sensitivity. The results are shown in Fig. 2, along with comparisons with present constraints. In the case of the 34mixing angle, we look for disappear- ance in the NC sample, the only contributor to this sensitivity.The results are shown in Fig. 3. Further, a comparison with previous experiments sensitive to ,mixing with large mass-squared splitting is possible by considering an effectivemixing angle , such that sin224|U4|2|U4|2= cos414sin2224sin234, and assuming conservatively that cos414=1, and sin2224=1. This comparison with pre- vious experiments is also shown in Fig. 3. The sensitivity to34is largely independent of m2 41, since the term with sin234in Eq. ( 1), the expression describing P(s), depends solely on the m2 31mass splitting. Another quantitative comparison of our results for 24 and34with existing constraints can be made for projected upper limits on the sterile mixing angles assuming no evi-dence for sterile oscillations is found, and picking the value ofm 2 41=0.5e V2corresponding to the simpler counting experiment regime. For the 3 +1 model, upper limits of 24<1.8(15.1)and34<15.0(25.5)are obtained at the 90% CL from the presented best(worst)-case scenario DUNE sensitivities.

As an illustration, Fig. 4also shows DUNE's discovery potential for a scenario with one sterile neutrino governed by the LSND best-t [19]. A small 90% CL allowed region is obtained, which can be compared with the LSND allowed region in the same gure.Fig. 3 Comparison of the DUNE sensitivity to 34using the NC sam- ples at the ND and FD with previous and existing experiments.

Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 4 Non-unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix A generic characteristic of most models explaining the neu- trino mass pattern is the presence of heavy neutrino states, additional to the three light states of the SM of particlephysics [ 20-22]. These types of models imply that the 3 \u00d73 Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix is not unitary due to mixing with additional states. Besides the type- I seesaw mechanism [ 23-26], different low-scale seesaw models include right-handed neutrinos that are not- so-heavy, with mass of 1-10 TeV [ 27], and perhaps detectable at collider experiments. These additional heavy leptons would mix with the light neutrino states and, as a result, the complete unitary mixing matrix would be a squared n\u00d7nmatrix, with nthe total number of neutrino states. Therefore, the usual 3 \u00d73P M N S matrix, which we dub Nto stress its non-standard nature, will be non-unitary. One possible general way to parameterize these unitarity deviations in Nis through a triangular matrix [28] 1 N= 1 ee 00 e1 0 e 1 U, (6) with Urepresenting the unitary PMNS matrix, and the ij representing the non-unitary parameters.2In the limit where ij=0,Nbecomes the usual PMNS mixing matrix. The triangular matrix in this equation accounts for the non- unitarity of the 3 \u00d73 matrix for any number of extra neutrino species. This parameterization has been shown to be par- ticularly well-suited for oscillation searches [ 28,31] since, compared to other alternatives, it minimizes the departuresof its unitary component Ufrom the mixing angles that are directly measured in neutrino oscillation experiments when unitarity is assumed. The phenomenological implications of a non-unitary lep- tonic mixing matrix have been extensively studied in fla- vor and electroweak precision observables as well as in theneutrino oscillation phenomenon [ 26,28,32-52]. For recent global ts to all flavor and electroweak precision data sum- marizing present bounds on non-unitarity see Refs. [ 46,53]. Recent studies have shown that DUNE can constrain the non-unitarity parameters [ 31,52]. The summary of the 90% CL bounds on the different ijelements proled over all other parameters is given in Table 3. These bounds are comparable with other constraints from present oscillation experiments, although they are not com- 1For a similar parameterization corresponding to a (3+1)and a(3+3)- dimensional mixing matrix, see Refs. [ 29,30]. 2The parameterization in Ref. [ 28] uses iiinstead of . The equivalence between the two is as follows: ii=1 andij=.Table 3 Expected 90% CL constraints on the non-unitarityparameters from DUNEParameter Constraint ee 0.3 0.2 0.8 e 0.04 e 0.7 0.2 petitive with those obtained from flavor and electroweak pre- cision data. For this analysis, and those presented below, wehave used the GLoBES software [ 10,11] with the DUNE TDR conguration presented in Ref. [ 1] and assumed a data exposure of 300 kt \u00b7MW\u00b7year. The standard (unitary) oscil- lation parameters have also been treated as in [ 1]. The uni- tarity deviations have been included both by an independent code (used to obtain the results shown in Ref. [ 52]) and via the Monte Carlo Utility Based Experiment Simulator (Mon- teCUBES) [ 54] plug-in to cross validate our results. Conversely, the presence of non-unitarity may affect the determination of the Dirac charge parity (CP)-violating phase CPin LBL experiments [ 50,52,53]. Indeed, when allowing for unitarity deviations, the expected CP discovery poten- tial for DUNE could be signicantly reduced. However, thesituation is alleviated when a combined analysis with the constraints on non-unitarity from other experiments is con- sidered. This is illustrated in Fig. 5. In the left panel, the dis- covery potential for charge-parity symmetry violation (CPV) is computed when the non-unitarity parameters introduced in Eq. ( 6) are allowed in the t. While for the Asimov data all ij=0, the non-unitary parameters are allowed to vary in the t with 1 priors of 101,1 02and 103for the dotted green, dashed blue and solid black lines respectively. For the dot-dashed red line no prior information on the non-unitarityparameters has been assumed. As can be observed, without additional priors on the non-unitarity parameters, the capa- bilities of DUNE to discover CPV from CPwould be seri- ously compromised [ 52]. However, with priors of order 102 matching the present constraints from other neutrino oscil- lation experiments [ 31,52], the sensitivity expected in the three-flavor model is almost recovered. If the more stringentpriors of order 10 3stemming from flavor and electroweak precision observables are added [ 46,53], the standard sensi- tivity is obtained. The right panel of Fig. 5concentrates on the impact of the phase of the element ein the discovery potential of CPV fromCP, since this element has a very important impact in theeappearance channel. In this plot the modulus of ee, andehave been xed to 101,1 02,1 03and 0 for the dot-dashed red, dotted green, dashed blue and solidblack lines respectively. All other non-unitarity parameters 123Eur.

See the text for details Fig. 6 Expected frequentist allowed regions at the 1 , 90% and 2 CL for DUNE. All new physics parameters are assumed to be zeroso as to obtain the expected non-unitarity sensitivities. A value 23=0.2350.738 rad is assumed. The solid lines correspond to the anal- ysis of DUNE data alone, while the dashed lines include the presentconstraints on non-unitarity. The values of 23are shown in radians have been set to zero and the phase of ehas been allowed to vary both in the t and in the Asimov data, showing the most conservative curve obtained. As for the right panel, itcan be seen that a strong deterioration of the CP discovery potential could be induced by the phase of e(see Ref. [52]). However, for unitarity deviations of order 102,a s required by present neutrino oscillation data constraints, the effect is not too signicant in the range of CPfor which a3exclusion of CP conservation would be possible and it becomes negligible if the stronger 103constraints from flavor and electroweak precision data are taken into account. Similarly, the presence of non-unitarity worsens degen- eracies involving 23, making the determination of the octant or even its maximality challenging. This situation is shown in Fig. 6where an input value of 23=42.3was assumed. As can be seen, the t in presence of non-unitarity (solidlines) introduces degeneracies for the wrong octant and even for maximal mixing [ 31]. However, these degenera- cies are resolved upon the inclusion of present priors on thenon-unitarity parameters from other oscillation data (dashedlines) and a clean determination of the standard oscillation parameters following DUNE expectations is again recovered. The sensitivity that DUNE would provide to the non- unitarity parameters is comparable to that from present oscil- lation experiments, while not competitive to that from flavor and electroweak precision observables, which are roughlyan order of magnitude more stringent. On the other hand, the capability of DUNE to determine the standard oscillation parameters such as CPV from CPor the octant of23would by unitarity devia- tions in the PMNS matrix. This negative impact is however signicantly reduced when priors on the size of these devia- tions from other oscillation experiments are considered, anddisappears altogether if the more stringent constraints from flavor and electroweak precision data are added instead. 5 Non-standard neutrino interactions Non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), affecting neutrino propagation through the Earth, can signicantly modify the 123 322 Page 14 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 7 Allowed regions of the non-standard oscillation parameters in which we see important degeneracies (top)and the complex non-diagonalones (bottom). We conduct theanalysis considering all the NSIparameters as are taken from [ 78] data to be collected by DUNE as long as the new physics parameters are large enough [ 55]. Leveraging its very long baseline and wide-band beam, DUNE is uniquely sensitive to these probes. NSI may impact the determination of currentunknowns such as CPV [ 56,57], mass hierarchy [ 58,59] and octant of 23[60]. If the DUNE data are consistent with the standard oscillation for three massive neutrinos, off-diagonalNC NSI effects of order 0.1 G Fcan be ruled out at the 68 to 95% CL [ 61,62]. We note that DUNE might improve current constraints on |/epsilon1m e|and|/epsilon1m e|, the electron flavor- changing NSI intensity parameters Eq. 8), by a factor 2-5 [55,63,64]. New CC interactions can also lead to modi- cations in the production, at the beam source, and the detec- tion of neutrinos. The ndings on source and detector NSIstudies at DUNE are presented in [ 65,66], in which DUNE does not have sensitivity to discover or to improve bounds on source/detector NSI. In particular, the simultaneous impacton the measurement of CPand23is investigated in detail. Depending on the assumptions, such as the use of the ND and whether NSI at production and detection are the same, theimpact of source/detector NSI at DUNE may be relevant. Wefocus our attention on the propagation, based on the results from [ 65]. NC NSI can be understood as non-standard matter effects that are visible only in an FD at a sufciently long baseline. They can be parameterized as new contributions to the mat- ter potential in the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect(MSW) [ 67-72] matrix the mixing matrix, for which we use the standard parameterization found, e.g., in [73], and the /epsilon1-parameters give the magnitude of the NSI rel- ative to standard weak interactions. For new physics scalesof a few hundred GeV , a value of |/epsilon1|of the order 0.01 or less is expected [ 74-76]. The DUNE baseline provides an advantage in the detection of NSI relative to existing beam-based experiments with shorter baselines. Only atmospheric- neutrino experiments have longer baselines, but the sensi- tivity of these experiments to NSI is limited by systematiceffects [ 77]. In this analysis, we use GLoBES with the MonteCUBES C library, a plugin that replaces the deterministic GLoBES minimizer by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodthat is able to handle higher dimensional parameter spaces. In the simulations we use the conguration for the DUNE TDR [ 1]. Each point scanned by the MCMC is stored and a frequentist 2analysis is performed with the results. The analysis assumes an exposure of 300 kt \u00b7MW\u00b7year. In an analysis with all the NSI parameters free to vary, we obtain the sensitivity regions in Fig. 7. We omit the super- script mthat appears in Eq. ( 8). The credible regions are shown for different condence levels. We note, however, that constraints on /epsilon1/epsilon1coming from global t analy- sis [55,64,78,79] can remove the left and right solutions of /epsilon1/epsilon1in Fig. 7. In order to constrain the standard oscillation parameters when NSI are present, we use the t for three-neutrino mix- ing from [ 78] and implement prior constraints to restrict the region sampled by the MCMC. The sampling of the param-eter space is explained in [ 62] and the priors that we use can be found in Table 4. The effects of NSI on the measurements of the standard oscillation parameters at DUNE are explicit in Fig. 8, where we superpose the allowed regions with non-negligible NSI and the standard-only credible regions at the 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 15 of 51 322 Table 4 Oscillation parameters and priors implemented in MCMC for calculation of Fig. 7 Parameter Nominal 1 Free Fig. 8 Projections of the standard oscillation parameters with nonzero NSI. The sensitivity regions are for 68, 90, and 95% CL. The allowedregions considering negligible NSI (standard oscillation (SO) at 90%CL) are superposed to the SO + NSI blue lled areas we assume only standard oscillation. In the regions delimited by the red, black dashed, and green dottedlines we constrain standard oscillation parameters allowing NSI to vary freely. An important degeneracy appears in the measurement of the mixing angle 23. Notice that this degeneracy appears because of the constraints obtained for /epsilon1/epsilon1shown in Fig. 7. We also see that the sensitivity of the CP phase is strongly affected. The effects of matter density variation and its average along the beam path from Fermilab to SURF were studied considering the standard neutrino oscillation framework withthree flavors [ 80,81]. In order to obtain the results of Figs. 7 and8, we use a high-precision calculation for the baseline of 1285 km and the average density of 2 .848 g/cm 3[80]. The DUNE collaboration has been using the so-called PREM [ 82,83] density prole to consider matter density vari- ation. With this assumption, the neutrino beam crosses a fewconstant density layers. However, a more detailed densitymap is available for the USA with more than 50 layers and 0.25\u00d70.25 degree cells of latitude and longitude: The Shen- Ritzwoller or S.R. prole [ 80,84]. Comparing the S.R. with the PREM proles, Ref. [ 81] shows that in the standard oscil- lation paradigm, DUNE is not highly sensitive to the densityprole and that the only oscillation parameter with its mea-surement slightly impacted by the average density true value is CP. NSI, however, may be sensitive to the prole, particu- larly considering the phase e[85], where /epsilon1e=|/epsilon1e|eie, to which DUNE will have a high sensitivity [ 55,61-64], as we also see in Fig. 7. In order to compare the results of our analysis predictions for DUNE with the constraints from other experiments, we use the results from [ 55]. There are differences in the nominal parameter values used for calculating the 2function and other assumptions. This is the reason why the regions in Fig. 9 do not have the same central values, but this comparison gives a good view of how DUNE can substantially improve the bounds on, for example, ,m2 31, and the non- diagonal NSI parameters. NSI can signicantly impact the determination of cur- rent unknowns such as CPV and the octant of 23. Clean determination of the intrinsic CP phase at LBL experiments, such as DUNE, in the presence of NSI, is a formidable task [86]. A feasible strategy to disambiguate physics scenarios at DUNE using high-energy beams was suggested in [ 87]. The conclusion here is that, using a tunable beam, it is possi- ble to disentangle scenarios with NSI. Constraints from other experiments can also solve the NSI induced degeneracy on 23. 6 CPT and Lorentz violation Charge, parity, and time reversal symmetry (CPT) is a cor- nerstone of our model-building strategy. DUNE can improve the present limits on Lorentz and CPT violation by severalorders of magnitude [ 88-95], contributing as a very important experiment to test these fundamental assumptions underlying quantum eld theory. CPT invariance is one of the predictions of major impor- tance of local, relativistic quantum eld theory. One of the predictions of CPT invariance is that particles and antiparti- cles have the same masses and, if unstable, the same lifetimes.To prove the CPT theorem one needs only three ingredients [88]: Lorentz invariance, hermiticity of the Hamiltonian, and locality. Experimental bounds on CPT invariance can be derived using the neutral kaon system [ 96]: |m(K 0)m(K0)| mK<0.6\u00d71018. (9) 123 322 Page 16 of 51 Eur. Phys. J.

The left half of the gure shows constraints on the standard oscillation parameters, written in the bot-tom of each comparison. The ve comparisons in the right half show constraints on non-standard interaction parameters This result, however, should be interpreted very carefully for two reasons. First, we do not have a complete theory of CPT violation, and it is therefore arbitrary to take the kaonmass as a scale. Second, since kaons are bosons, the termentering the Lagrangian is the mass squared and not the mass itself. With this in mind, we can rewrite the previous bound as: |m 2(K0)m2(K0)|<0.3e V2. Modeling CPT violation as differences in the usual oscillation parameters between neutrinos and antineutrinos, we see here that neutrinos cantest the predictions of the CPT theorem to an unprecedented extent and could, therefore, provide stronger limits than the ones regarded as the most stringent ones to date. 3 In the absence of a solid model of flavor, not to mention one of CPT violation, the spectrum of neutrinos and antineu- trinos can differ both in the mass eigenstates themselves aswell as in the flavor composition of each of these states. It isimportant to notice then that neutrino oscillation experiments can only test CPT in the mass differences and mixing angles. An overall shift between the neutrino and antineutrino spectrawill be missed by oscillation experiments. Nevertheless, such a pattern can be bounded by cosmological data [ 97]. Unfor- tunately direct searches for neutrino mass (past, present, andfuture) involve only antineutrinos and hence cannot be used to draw any conclusion on CPT invariance on the absolute mass scale, either. Therefore, using neutrino oscillation data,we will compare the mass splittings and mixing angles ofneutrinos with those of antineutrinos. Differences in the neu- trino and antineutrino spectrum would imply the violation of the CPT theorem. In Ref. [ 93] the authors derived the most up-to-date bounds on CPT invariance from the neutrino sector using the same data that was used in the global t to neutrino oscillationsin Ref. [ 98]. Of course, experiments that cannot distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos, such as atmospheric data from Super-Kamiokande [ 99], IceCube-DeepCore [ 100, 3CPT was tested also using charged leptons. However, these measure- ments involve a combination of mass and charge and are not a directCPT test. Only neutrinos can provide CPT tests on an elementary massnot contaminated by charge.101] and ANTARES [ 102] were not included. The complete data set used, as well as the parameters to which they are sensitive, are (1) from solar neutrino data [ 103-112]:12, m2 21, and13; (2) from neutrino KamLAND reac- tor antineutrino reactor antineutrino experiments Daya [ 122], Double Chooz [ 123]:13andm2 31; and (5) from and T2K [ 116,117]: 23,m2 31, and13.4 From the analysis of all previous data samples, one can derive the most up-to-date (3 the moment it is not possible to set any bound on ||, since all possible values of orare allowed by data. The pre- ferred intervals of obtained in Ref. [ 98] can only be obtained after combining the neutrino and antineutrino data samples.The limits on ( m 2 31)and( m2 21)are already better than the one derived from the neutral kaon system and should be regarded as the best current bounds on CPT violation on themass squared. Note that these results were derived assuming the same mass ordering for neutrinos and antineutrinos. If the ordering was different for neutrinos and antineutrinos, thiswould be an indication for CPT violation on its own. In the following we show how DUNE could improve this bound. Sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to measure CPT vio- lation in the neutrino sector is studied by analyzing neu- 4The K2K experiment took data only in neutrino mode, while the NOvA experiment had not published data in the antineutrino modewhen these bounds were calculated. 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 17 of 51 322 Table 5 Oscillation parameters used to simulate neutrino andantineutrino data for the parameters separately. We the neutrino being parameterized by the usual 21,m231,and. Hence, antineutrino oscil- lation is described by the same probability functions as neu- trinos with the neutrino parameters replaced by their antineu- trino counterparts.5To simulate the expected neutrino data signal in DUNE, we assume the true values for neutrinos andantineutrinos to be as listed in Table 5. Then, in the statis- tical analysis, we vary freely all the oscillation parameters, except the solar ones, which are xed to their best t val-ues throughout the simulations. Given the great precision in the determination of the reactor mixing angle by the short- baseline reactor experiments [ 121-123], in our analysis we use a prior on 13, but not on 13. We also consider three different values for the atmospheric angles, as indicated in Table 5. The exposure considered in the analysis corresponds to 300 kt \u00b7MW\u00b7year. Therefore, to test the sensitivity at DUNE we perform the simulations assuming x=|xx|=0, where xis any of the oscillation parameters. Then we estimate the sensitivitytox/negationslash=0. To do so, we calculate two 2-grids, one for neu- trinos and one for antineutrinos, varying the four parameters of interest, in this case the atmospheric oscillation parame-ters. After minimizing over all parameters except xand x, we calculate 2(x)=2(|xx|)=2(x)+2(x), (11) where we have considered all the possible combinations of |xx|. The results are presented in Fig. 10,w h e r ew ep l o t three different lines, labelled as \"high\", \"max\" and \"low.\"These refer to the assumed value for the atmospheric angle: in the lower octant (low), maximal mixing (max) or in the upper octant (high). Here we can see that there is sensitivity neitherto(sin 213), where the 3 bound would be of the same order as the current measured value for sin213, nor to , where no single value of the parameter would be excluded atmore than 2 . 5Note that the antineutrino oscillation probabilities also include the standard change of sign in the CP phase. Fig. 10 The sensitivities of DUNE to the difference of neutrino and antineutrino parameters: ,( m2 31),(sin213)and(sin223) for the atmospheric angle in the lower octant (black line), in the upperoctant (light gray line) and for maximal mixing (dark gray line) On the contrary, interesting results for ( m2 31)and (sin223)are obtained. First, we see that DUNE can put stronger bounds on the difference of the atmospheric mass splittings, namely ( m2 31)< 8.1\u00d7105, improving the current neutrino bound by one order of magnitude. For theatmospheric angle, we obtain different results depending on the true value assumed in the simulation of DUNE data. In the lower right panel of Fig. 10we see the different behavior obtained for 23with the values of sin223from Table 5, i.e., lying in the lower octant, being maximal, and lying in the upper octant. As one might expect, the sensitivity increases withsin223in the case of maximal mixing. However, if the true value lies in the lower or upper octant, a degenerate solution appears in the complementary octant. In some types of neutrino oscillation experiments, e.g., accelerator experiments, neutrino and antineutrino data are obtained in separate experimental runs. The usual procedure followed by the experimental collaborations, as well as theglobal oscillation ts as for example Ref. [ 98], assumes CPT invariance and analyzes the full data sample in a joint way. However, if CPT is violated in nature, the outcome of the joint data analysis might give rise to what we call an \"imposter\"solution, i.e., one that does not correspond to the true solution of any channel. Under the assumption of CPT conservation, the 2func- tions are computed according to 2 total=2()+2(), (12) 123 322 Page 18 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 11 DUNE sensitivity to the atmospheric angle for neutrinos (blue), antineutrinos (red), and to the combination of both under theassumption of CPT conservation (black) and assuming that the same parameters describe neutrino and antineutrino flavor oscillations. In contrast, in Eq. ( 11) we rst proled over the parameters in neutrino and antineu- trino mode separately and then added the proles. Here, we shall assume CPT to be violated in nature, but perform ouranalysis as if it were conserved. As an example, we assumethat the true value for the atmospheric neutrino mixing is sin 223=0.5, while the antineutrino mixing angle is given by sin223=0.43. The rest of the oscillation parameters are set to the values in Table 5. Performing the statistical anal- ysis in the CPT-conserving way, as indicated in Eq. ( 12), we obtain the prole of the atmospheric mixing angle pre-sented in Fig. 11. The proles for the individual reconstructed results (neutrino and antineutrino) are also shown in the g- ure for comparison. The result is a new best t value atsin 2comb 23=0.467, disfavoring the true values for neutrino and antineutrino parameters at approximately 3 and more than 5, respectively. Atmospheric neutrinos are a unique tool for studying neu- trino oscillations: the oscillated flux contains all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos, is very sensitive to matter effects and to both m2parameters, and covers a wide range of L/E. In principle, all oscillation parameters could be measured, with high complementarity to measurements performed with a neutrino beam. Studying DUNE atmospheric neutrinos isalso a promising approach to search for BSM effects suchas Lorentz and CPT violation. The DUNE FD, with its large mass and the overburden to protect it from atmospheric muon background, is an ideal tool for these studies. The effective eld theory describing CPT violation is the Standard-Model Extension (SME) [ 124], where CPT vio- lation is accompanied by Lorentz violation. This approachintroduces a large set of neutrino coefcients governing corrections to standard neutrino-neutrino and antineutrino- oscillations between neu-trinos and antineutrinos, and modications of oscillation-free Fig. 12 Estimated to Lorentz and violation with atmo- spheric neutrinos in the non-minimal isotropic Standard Model Exten-sion. The sensitivities are estimated by requiring that the Lorentz/CPT-violating effects are comparable in size to those from conventional neu-trino oscillations propagation, all of which incorporate unconventional depen- dencies on the magnitudes and directions of momenta and spin. For DUNE atmospheric neutrinos, the long available baselines, the comparatively high energies accessible, andthe broad range of momentum directions offer advantagesthat can make possible great improvements in sensitivities to certain types of Lorentz and CPT violation [ 90-92,125-128]. To date, experimental searches for Lorentz and CPT viola-tion with atmospheric neutrinos have been published by the IceCube and Super-Kamiokande collaborations [ 129-131]. Similar studies are possible with DUNE, and many SMEcoefcients can be measured that remain unconstrained to date. An example of the potential reach of studies with DUNE is shown in Fig. 12, which displays estimated sensitivities from atmospheric neutrinos in DUNE to a subset of SME coefcients controlling (rotation-invariant) viola- tions in the Sun-centered frame [ 132]. The sensitivities are estimated by requiring that the Lorentz/CPT-violating effects are comparable in size to those from conventional neutrino oscillations. The eventual DUNE constraints will be deter-mined by the ultimate precision of the experiment (which is set in part by the exposure). The gray bars in Fig. 12show existing limits. These conservative sensitivity estimates showthat DUNE can achieve rst measurements (red) on somecoefcients that have never previously been measured and improved measurements (green) on others, that have already been constrained in previous experiments but that can bemeasured with greater sensitivity with DUNE. To illustrate an SME modication of oscillation probabili- ties, consider a measurement of the atmospheric neutrino andantineutrino flux as a function of energy. For deniteness, we adopt atmospheric neutrino fluxes [ 133], evaluated using the NRLMSISE-00 global atmospheric model [ 134], that result from a production event at an altitude of 20 km. Assuming 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 19 of 51 322 Fig. 13 Atmospheric fluxes of neutrinos and antineutrinos as a func- tion of energy for conventional oscillations (dashed line) and in thenon-minimal isotropic Standard Model Extension (solid line) conventional oscillations with standard three-flavor oscilla- tion parameter values [ 135], the fluxes at the FD are shown in Fig. 13. The sum of the eand\u00afefluxes is shown as a function of energy as a red dashed line, while the sum of the and\u00affluxes is shown as a blue dashed line. Adding an isotropic non-minimal coefcient for Lorentzviolation of magnitude c (6) e=1\u00d71028GeV1changes the fluxes from the dashed lines to the solid ones. This coefcient is many times smaller than the current experimental limit.Nonetheless, the flux spectrum is predicted to change signif- icantly at energies over approximately 100 GeV, changing the expected number of events. 7 Neutrino tridents at the near detector Neutrino trident production is a weak process in which a neutrino, scattering off the Coulomb eld of a heavy nucleus, generates a pair of charged leptons [ 136-144], as shown in Fig.14. Measurements of muonic neutrino tridents ( + the DUNE ND will lead to a sizable production rate of trident events (see Table 6), offering excellent prospects to improve the above measure- ments [ 148-150]. A deviation from the event rate predicted by the SM could be an indication of new interactions medi-ated by the corresponding new gauge bosons [ 151]. Fig. 14 Example diagrams for muon-neutrino-induced trident pro- cesses in the Standard Model. A second set of diagrams where thephoton couples to the negatively charged leptons is not shown. Analo-gous diagrams exist for processes induced by different neutrino flavorsand by antineutrinos. A diagram illustrating trident interactions medi-ated by a new Z /primegauge boson, discussed in the text, is shown on the top right Table 6 Expected number of SM and\u00af-induced trident events at the LArTPC of the DUNE ND per metric ton of argon and year ofoperation Process Coherent Incoherent The main challenge in obtaining a precise measurement of the muonic trident cross section will be the copious back-grounds, mainly consisting of CC single-pion production events, NN/prime, as muon and pion tracks can be eas- ily confused in LArTPC detectors. The discrimination powerof the DUNE ND LArTPC was evaluated using large sim-ulated data sets of signal and background. Each simulated event represents a different neutrino-argon interaction in the active volume of the detector. Signal events were generatedusing a standalone code [ 148] that simulates trident produc- tion of muons and electrons through the scattering of and eon argon nuclei. The generator considers both the coher- ent scattering on the full nucleus (the dominant contribu- tion) and the incoherent scattering on individual nucleons. Background events, consisting of several SM neutrino inter-actions, were generated using GENIE. Roughly 38% of the 123 322 Page 20 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 15 Event kinematic distributions of signal and background considered for the selection of muonic tridentinteractions in the ND LArTPC:number of tracks (top left), anglebetween the two main tracks(top right), length of the shortesttrack (bottom left), and thedifference in length between thetwo main tracks (bottom right).The dashed, black vertical linesindicate the optimal cut valuesused in the analysis generated events have a charged pion in the nal state, lead- ing to two charged tracks with muon-like energy deposition pattern (d E/dx), as in the trident signal. All nal-state par- ticles produced in the interactions were propagated throughthe detector geometry using the Geant4 -based simulation of the DUNE ND. Charge collection and readout were not sim- ulated, and possible inefciencies due to mis-reconstructioneffects or event pile-up were disregarded for simplicity. Figure 15shows the distribution (area normalized) for sig- nal and background of the different kinematic variables used in our analysis for the discrimination between signal andbackground. As expected, background events tend to con- tain a higher number of tracks than the signal. The other distributions also show a clear discriminating power: theangle between the two tracks is typically much smaller in the signal than in the background. Moreover, the signal tracks (two muons) tend to be longer than tracks in the background(mainly one muon plus one pion). The sensitivity of neutrino tridents to heavy new physics (i.e., heavy compared to the momentum transfer in the pro- cess) can be parameterized in a model-independent wayusing a modication of the effective four-fermion interaction Hamiltonian. on the case of muon neutrinos inter-acting with muons, the vector and axial-vector couplings can be written as g V =1+4s i n2W+gV and gA =1+gA , (13) where gV andgA represent possible new physics contributions. Couplings involving other combinations of lepton flavors can be modied analogously. Note, however,that for interactions that involve electrons, very strong con- straints can be derived from LEP bounds on electron contact interactions [ 152]. The modied interactions of the muon- neutrinos with muons alter the cross section of the N +Ntrident process. In Fig. 16we show the regions in the gV vs.gA plane that are excluded by the existing CCFR measurement CCFR/SM CCFR=0.82\u00b10.28 [146] at the 95% CL in gray. A measurement of the N +Ncross section with 40% uncertainty (obtained after running for 6 years in neutrino mode or, equivalently, 3 years in neutrino mode and 3 years in antineutrino mode) at the DUNE ND could cover the blue hashed regions (95% CL). These numbers show that a measurement of the SMdi-muon trident production at the 40% level could be possi- 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 21 of 51 322 Fig. 16 95% CL sensitivity of a 40% (blue hashed regions) and a 25% (dashed contours) uncertainty measurement of the N+N cross section at the DUNE near detector to modications of the vec-tor and axial-vector couplings of The grayregions are excluded at 95% CL by existing measurements of the crosssection by the CCFR Collaboration. The intersection of the thin blacklines indicates the SM point. A 40% precision measurement could bepossible with 6 years of data taking in neutrino mode ble. Our baseline analysis does not extend the sensitivity into parameter space that is unconstrained by the CCFR measure-ment. However, it is likely that the use of a magnetized spec- trometer, as it is being considered for the DUNE ND, able to identify the charge signal of the trident nal state, along witha more sophisticated event selection (e.g., deep-learning-based), will signicantly improve separation between neu- trino trident interactions and backgrounds. Therefore, we also present the region (blue dashed line) that could be probedby a 25% measurement of the neutrino trident cross section at DUNE, which would extend the coverage of new physics parameter space substantially. We consider a class of models that modify the trident cross section through the presence of an additional neutral gauge boson, Z /prime, that couples to neutrinos and charged leptons. A consistent way of introducing such a Z/primeis to gauge an anomaly-free global symmetry of the SM. Of particular inter- est is the Z/primethat is based on gauging the difference of muon- number and tau-number, LL[153,154]. Such a Z/primeis rel- atively weakly constrained and can for example address the longstanding discrepancy between SM prediction and mea- surement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,(g2) [155,156]. The LLZ/primehas also been used in models to explain Bphysics anomalies [ 157] and as a portal to dark matter (DM) [ 158,159]. The N+N trident process has been identied as an important probe ofFig. 17 Existing constraints and projected DUNE sensitivity in the LLparameter space. Shown in green is the region where the (g2)anomaly can be explained at the 2 level. The parameter regions already excluded by existing constraints are shaded in grayand correspond to a CMS search for pp a BaBar search for e+e+Z/prime++ [161] previous measurement of the trident cross section [146,151] (\"CCFR\"), a measurement of the scattering rate of solar neu- trinos on electrons [ 162-164] (\"Borexino\"), and bounds from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [ 165,166] (\"BBN\"). The DUNE sensitivity shown by the solid blue line assumes 6 years of data running in neutrino mode,leading to a measurement of the trident cross section with 40% precision gauged LLmodels over a broad range of Z/primemasses [151,157]. In Fig. 17we show the existing CCFR constraint on the model parameter space in the mZ/primevs.g/primeplane, where g/primeis the LLgauge coupling, and compare it to the region of parameter space where the anomaly in (g2)= 2acan be explained. The green region shows the 1 and 2preferred parameter space corresponding to a shift a=aexp aSM =(2.71\u00b10.73)\u00d7109[167]. In addition, constraints from LHC searches for the Z/primein the pp+Z/prime++process [ 160] (see also [151]) and direct searches for the Z/primeat BaBar using the e+e+Z/prime++process [ 161]a r e shown. A Borexino bound on non-standard contributions toneutrino-electron scattering [ 162-164] has also been used to constrain the L Lgauge boson [ 166,168,169]. Our reproduction of the Borexino constraint is shown in Fig. 17. For very light Z/primemasses of O(few MeV) and below, strong constraints from measurements of the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom during Big Bang Nucleosyn- thesis (BBN) apply [ 165,166]. Taking into account all rele- vant constraints, parameter space to explain (g2)is left below the di-muon threshold mZ/prime/lessorsimilar210 MeV. The DUNE sensitivity shown by the solid blue line assumes a measure-ment of the trident cross section with 40% precision. 123 322 Page 22 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 8 Dark matter probes Dark matter is a crucial ingredient to understand the cos- mological history of the universe, and the most up-to-date measurements suggests the existence of DM with a ( c)o f0 of this situa- tion, a tremendous amount of experimental effort has gone into the search for DM-induced signatures, for example, DM direct and indirect detections and collider searches. How-ever, no \"smoking-gun\" signals have been discovered thus far while more parameter space in relevant DM models is simply ruled out. It is noteworthy that most conventional DMsearch strategies are designed to be sensitive to signals from the weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), one of the well-motivated DM candidates, whose mass range is from afew GeV to tens of TeV . The non-observation of DM via non-gravitational interactions actually motivates unconventional or alternative DM search schemes. One such possibility is a search for experimental signatures induced by boosted, hencerelativistic, DM for which a mass range smaller than that of the weak scale is often motivated. One of the possible ways to produce and then detect rela- tivistic DM particles can be through accelerator experiments, for example, neutrino beam experiments [ 3,171-174]. Due to highly intensied beam sources, large signal statistics isusually expected so that this sort of search strategy can allowfor signicant sensitivity to DM-induced signals despite the feeble interaction of DM with SM particles. DUNE will per- form a search for the relativistic scattering of light-mass darkmatter (LDM), whose lowest mass particle is denoted as throughout this section, at the ND, as it is close enough to the beam source to sample a substantial level of DM flux,assuming that DM is produced. Alternatively, it is possible that boosted dark matter (BDM) particles are created in the universe under non-minimal dark-sector scenarios [ 175,176], and can reach ter- restrial detectors. For example, one can imagine a two- component DM scenario in which a lighter component ( )i s usually a subdominant relic with direct coupling to SM parti-cles, while the heavier (denoted as throughout this section) is the cosmological DM that pair-annihilates directly to a lighter DM pair, not to SM particles. Other mechanisms suchas semi-annihilation in which a DM particle pair-annihilates to a (lighter) DM particle and a dark sector particle that may decay away are also possible [ 177-179]. In typical cases, the BDM flux is not large and thus large-volume neutrino detec-tors are desirable to overcome the challenge in statistics (for an exception, see [ 180-183]). Indeed, a (full-fledged) DUNE FD with a ducial mass of 40 kt and quality detector performance is expected to possess competitive sensitivity to BDM signals from var- ious sources in the current universe such as the galactichalo [ 175,181,184-188], the sun [ 178,179,184,187,189],and dwarf spheroidal galaxies [ 188]. Furthermore, the Proto- DUNE detectors have taken data, and we anticipate prelimi-nary studies with their cosmic data. Interactions of BDM with electrons [ 175] and tigated for Cherenkov detectors, such as Super-Kamiokande,which recently published a dedicated search for BDM in theelectron channel [ 190]. However, in such detectors the BDM signal rate is shown to often be signicantly attenuated due to Cherenkov threshold, in particular for hadronic channels.LAr detectors, such as DUNE's, have the potential to greatly improve the sensitivity for BDM compared to Cherenkov detectors. This is due to improved particle identication tech-niques, as well as a signicantly lower energy threshold for proton detection. Earlier studies have shown an improvement with DUNE for BDM-electron interaction [ 188]. We consider several benchmark DM models. These describe only couplings of dark-sector states including LDM particles. We consider two example models: (i) a vector portal-type scenario where a (massive) dark-sector photon Vmixes photon Z/primesce- nario. DM and other dark-sector particles are assumed to be fermionic for convenience. Benchmark Model (i) The relevant interaction Lagrangian is given by [ 185] Lint/epsilon1 2VF+gD\u00afV +g/prime dark- sector photon and the SM photon, respectively. Here we have introduced the kinetic mixing parameter /epsilon1, while gDandg/prime D parameterize the interaction strengths for flavor-conserving (second operator) and flavor-changing (third operator) cou- plings, respectively. Here and/primedenote a dark matter parti- cle and a heavier, unstable dark-sector state, respectively (i.e., M/prime>M), and the third term allows (boosted) transition to/primeafter a scattering (i.e., an \"inelastic\" scattering process). This model introduces six new free parameters that may be varied for our sensitivity analysis: dark photon mass MV, DM mass M, heavier dark-sector g/prime D.W e shall perform our analyses with some of the parameters xedto certain values for illustration. Benchmark Model (ii) This model employs a leptophobic Z /prime mediator for interactions with the nucleons. The interaction Lagrangian for this model \u00af5 axial. fdenotes the quark flavors in the SM sector. The dark matter states are denoted by 123Eur. Phys. J.

( 14), specically where only one DM particle is relevant. We also dene the dark ne structure constant Dg2 D/(4). We assume that is a fermionic thermal relic - in this case, the DM/dark photon masses and couplings will provide a target for which the relic abundance matches the observedabundance in the universe. Here, the largest flux of dark pho-tons Vand DM to reach the DUNE ND will come the decays of light pseudoscalar mesons (specically 0and mesons) that are produced in the DUNE target, as well asproton bremsstrahlung processes p+pp+p+V.F o r the entirety of this analysis, we will x D=0.5 and assume that the DM mass Mis lighter than half the mass of a pseu- doscalar meson mthat is produced in the DUNE target. In this scenario, is produced via two decays, those of on-shell Vand those of off-shell V. This production is depicted in Fig.18. The flux of DM produced via meson decays - via on-shell (16) 6See Ref. [ 191] for a complete derivation of these expressions, includ- ing those for meson decays via off-shell V.

For the range of dark photon and DM masses in which DUNE will set a competitive limit, the DM flux due to meson decays will dominate over the fluxdue to proton bremsstrahlung. Considering DM masses in the1-300 MeV range, this will require production via the 0andmesons. Our simulations using Pythia determine that c04.5 and c0.5. If the DM reaches the near detector, it may scatter elas- tically off nucleons or electrons in the detector, via a t- channel dark photon. Due to its smaller backgrounds, wefocus on scattering off electrons, depicted in the bottom panel of Fig. 18.

We canexploit the difference between the scattering angle and the energy of the electron to distinguish between signal and the background from neutrino-electron scattering (discussed inthe following) events. The background to the process shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 18consists of any processes involving an electron recoil. As the ND is located near the surface, background 123 322 Page 24 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 events, in general, can be induced by cosmic rays as well as by neutrinos generated from the beam. Since the majority ofcosmic-induced events, however, will be vetoed by triggers and timing information, the dominant background will be from neutrinos coming in the DUNE beam. The two neutrino-related backgrounds are escatter- ing, which looks nearly identical to the signal, and eCCQE scattering, which does not. The latter has a much larger rate (10 times higher) than the former, however, we expect that using the kinematical variable Ee2 eof the nal state, where eis the direction of the outgoing electron relative to the beam direction, will enable us to exploit the differences inthe scattering angle of the electron from the DM interactions to reduce a substantial fraction of the eCCQE background [192]. While spectral information regarding Eecould allow a search to distinguish between eandescattering, we expect that uncertainties in the flux (both in terms of over- all normalization and shape as a function of neutrino energy)will make such an analysis very complicated. For this rea- son, we include a normalization uncertainty of 10% on the expected background rate and perform a counting analysis.Studies are ongoing to determine how such an analysis may be improved. For this analysis we have assumed 3.5 years of data col- lection each in neutrino and antineutrino modes, analyzingevents that occur within the ducial volume of the DUNE near detector. We compare results assuming either all data is collected with the ND on-axis, or data collection is dividedequally among all off-axis positions, 0.7 year at each position i, between 0 and 24 m transverse to the beam direction (in steps of 6 meters). We assume three sources of uncertainty:statistical, correlated systematic, and an uncorrelated system- atic in each bin. For a correlated systematic uncertainty, we include a nuisance parameter Athat modies the number of neutrino-related background events in all bins - an overallnormalization uncertainty across all off-axis locations. We further include an additional term in our test statis- tic for A, a Gaussian probability with width A=10%. We also include an uncorrelated uncertainty in each bin, which we assume to be much narrower than A. We assume this uncertainty to be parameterized by a Gaussian withwidth fi=1%. After marginalizing over the corre- sponding uncorrelated parameters, the test of DM scattering events, cal- culated assuming is equal to some reference value 0/lessmuch1. N iis the number of escattering events expected in detec- tor position i, and rm iis the number of years of data collec- tion in detector position iduring beam mode m(neutrino or antineutrino mode). If data are only collected on-axis, thenthis test statistic will be dominated by the systematic uncer- tainty associated with A. If on- and off-axis measurements are combined, then the resulting sensitivity will improve sig-nicantly. We present results in terms of the DM or dark photon mass and the parameter Y, where Y 2D/parenleftbiggM MV/parenrightbigg4 . (19) Assuming MV/greatermuchM, this parameter determines the relic abundance of DM in the universe today, and sets a theoret- ical goal in terms of sensitivity reach. We present the 90% CL sensitivity reach of the DUNE ND in Fig. 19. We assume D=0.5 in our simulations and we display the results xing MV=3M(left panel) and M=20 MeV (right panel). We also compare the sensitivity reach of this analysis with otherexisting experiments, shown as grey shaded regions. We fur- ther show for comparison the sensitivity curve expected for a proposed dedicated experiment to search for LDM, LDMX-Phase I [ 193] (solid blue). From our estimates, we see that DUNE can signi- cantly improve the constraints from LSND [ 194] and the MiniBooNE-DM search [ 195], as well as BaBar [ 196]i f M V/lessorsimilar200 MeV. We also show limits in the right panel from beam-dump experiments (where the dark photon is assumed to decay visibly if MV<2M)[197-202], as well as the lower limits obtained from matching the thermal relic abun- dance of with the observed one (black). The features in the sensitivity curve in the right panel can be understood by looking at the DM production mech-anism. For a xed mass, as M Vgrows, the DM pro- duction goes from off-shell to on-shell and back to off- shell. The rst transition explains the strong feature near MV=2M=40 MeV, while the second is the source for the slight kink around MV=m0(which appears also in the left panel). 8.2 Inelastic boosted dark matter search at the DUNE FD We consider an annihilating two-component DM scenario [176] in this study. The heavier DM (denoted ) plays a role of cosmological DM and pair-annihilates to a pair of lighterDM particles (denoted ) in the universe today. The expected 123Eur. Phys. J.

We assume D=0.5i n both panels, and MV=3M(M=20 MeV) in the left (right) panel,respectively. Existing constraints are shown in grey, and the relic den- sity target is shown as a black line. We also show for comparison thesensitivity curve expected for LDMX-Phase I (solid blue) [ 193] flux near the earth is given by [ 175,181,187] F1=1.6\u00d7106cm2s1\u00d7/parenleftbigg/angbracketleftv/angbracketright 5\u00d71026cm3s1/parenrightbigg \u00d7/parenleftbigg10 GeV M/parenrightbigg2 , (20) where mis the mass of and/angbracketleftv/angbracketrightstands for the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of \u00af\u00af in the current universe. To evaluate the reference value shown as the rst prefactor, we take M=10 GeV and /angbracketleftv/angbracketright=5\u00d71026cm3s1, the latter of which is consis- tent with the current observation of DM relic density assum- ingand its anti-particle \u00afare distinguishable. To inte- grate all contributions over the entire galaxy, weassume the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM halo prole [203,204]. In this section we assume the BDM flux with a M dependence given by Eq. ( 20) for the phenomenological analysis. The BDM that is created, e.g., at the galactic center, reaches the DUNE FD detectors and scatters off either elec-trons or protons energetically. In this study, we focus on elec- tron scattering signatures for illustration, under Benchmark Model (i) dened in Eq. ( 14). The overall process is summa- +e (orp) e(orp)+/prime(+V()+e++e),(21) Fig. 20 BDM signal under consideration where /primeis a dark-sector unstable particle that is heavier thanas described earlier. A diagrammatic description is shown in Fig. 20where particles visible by the detector are circled in blue. In the nal state of the e-scattering case, there exist three visible particles that usually leave sizable (e-like) tracks in the detectors. On the other hand, for the p-scattering case we can replace ein the left-hand side and the rst ein the right-hand side of the above process by p. In the basic model, Eq. ( 14), and given the source of BDM at the galactic center, the resulting signature accompanies a quasi-elastic proton recoil [ 205] together with a pair of e+e tracks. As we have identied a possible inelastic BDM ( iBDM) signature, we are now in a position to discuss potential SMbackground events. For the DUNE detector modules located 1480 m deep underground, the cosmic-induced back- grounds are not an issue except the background inducedby atmospheric neutrinos. The most plausible scenario for 123 322 Page 26 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 background production is that an atmospheric neutrino event involves the creation of multiple pions that subsequentlydecay to electrons, positrons, photons, and neutrinos. Rel- evant channels are the resonance production and/or deep inelastic scattering (DIS) by the CC eor\u00afescattering with a nucleon in the LAr target. Summing up all the resonanceproduction and DIS events that are not only induced by e or\u00afebut relevant to production of a few pions, we nd that the total number of multi-pion production events is at most20(kt\u00b7year) 1[206], based on the neutrino flux calcu- lated in Ref. [ 133] and the cross section in Ref. [ 207]. In addition, the charged pions often leave long enough tracksinside the detector so that the probability of misidentifying thee \u00b1from the decays of \u00b1with the iBDM signal events would be very small. Some quasi-elastic scattering events byatmospheric neutrinos may involve a detectable proton recoiltogether with a single e-like track, which might behave like backgrounds in the proton scattering channel. However, this class of events can be rejected by requiring two separatede-like tracks. Hence, we conclude that it is fairly reasonable to assume that almost no background events exist. See also Ref. [ 206] for a more systematic background consideration for the iBDM signals. We nally present the expected experimental sensitivi- ties of DUNE, in the searches for iBDM. We closely follow the strategies illustrated in Refs. [ 181,205] to represent phe- nomenological interpretations. In displaying the results, we separate the signal categories into - Scenario 1: M V>2M, experimental limits for V invisible applied. - Scenario 2: MV2M, experimental limits for V e+eapplied. We develop an event simulation code using the ROOT package with the matrix elements for the scattering and the/primedecays implemented. Once an event is generated, we require that all the nal state particles should pass the(kinetic) energy threshold (30 MeV for electrons and pro- tons) and their angular separation from the other particles should be greater than the angular resolution (1 for elec- trons and 5f o rp r o t o n s )[ 206]. We rst show the results for Scenario 1 in the left pan- els of Fig. 21, taking a parameter set, M=0.4G e V g/prime D=1. brown-shaded region shows the latest limits set by var- ious experiments such as the xed-target experiment NA64 [208] at the CERN SPS and the B-factory experiment BaBar [209]. Note that some of the limits are from ongoing experi- ments such as NA64 which will collect more data in the next years and improve their sensitivity reaches. The blue solidand the green solid lines describe the experimental sensitiv-ity 7of DUNE FD to the e-scattering and p-scattering signals, respectively, under a zero background assumption. The asso-ciated exposure is 40 kt \u00b7year, i.e., a total ducial volume of 40 kt times one year of running time. For Scenario 2 (the right panels of Fig. 21), we choose a different reference parameter set: M =2G D=1. The current lim- its shaded regions), from various xed target exper- iments, B-factory experiments, and astrophysical observa-tions, are taken from Refs. [ 210,211]. In both scenarios, the proton scattering channel enables us to explore different regions of parameter space as it allowsheavier /primeto be accessible which would be kinematically for- bidden to access in the electron scattering channel. Inspired by this potential of the proton scattering channel, we studyother reference parameters and compare them with the orig-inal ones in the top panels of Fig. 21, and show the results in the bottom panels. We see that different parameter choices in the proton scattering channel allow us to cover a wider ordifferent range of parameter space. We next discuss model-independent experimental sensi- tivities. The experimental sensitivities are determined by thenumber of signal events excluded at 90% CL in the absence of an observed signal. The expected number of signal events, N sig, is given by Nsig=/epsilon1FA(/lscriptlab)texpNT, (22) where NTis the number of target particles T,/epsilon1is the cross section of the primary scattering T/primeT,Fis the flux of ,texpis the exposure time, and A(/lscriptlab)is the acceptance that is dened as 1 if the event occurs withinthe ducial volume and 0 otherwise. Here we determine the acceptance for an iBDM signal by the distance between the primary and secondary vertices in the laboratory frame,/lscript lab,s o A(/lscriptlab)=1 when both the primary and secondary events occur inside the ducial volume. (Given this deni- tion, obviously, A(/lscriptlab)=1 for elastic BDM.) Our notation /epsilon1includes additional realistic effects from cuts, threshold energy, and the detector response, hence it can be understood as the ducial cross section. The 90% CL exclusion limit, N90 s, can be obtained with a modied frequentist construction [ 212,213]. We follow the methods in Refs. [ 214-216] in which the Poisson likelihood is assumed. An experiment becomes sensitive to the signalmodel independently if N sigN90 s. Plugging Eq. ( 22) here, we nd the experimental sensitivity expressed by 7This is dened as the boundary of parameter space that can be probed by the dedicated search in a given experiment at 90% CL, practicallyobtained (2021) 81:322 Page 27 of 51 322 Fig. 21 The experimental sensitivities in terms of reference model parameters MV/epsilon1forM=0.4G e V , M=5M e V , M=10 MeV (top-right panel). The left panels are forScenario 1 and the right ones are for Scenario 2. The bottom panels compare different reference points in the p-scattering channel. See the text for the details /epsilon1FN90 s A(/lscriptlab)texpNT. (23) Since /lscriptlabdiffers event-by-event, we take the maximally possible value of laboratory-frame mean decay length, i.e., \u00af/lscriptmax labmax /prime\u00af/lscriptrestwhere max /primeis the maximum boost factor of /primeand\u00af/lscriptrestis the rest-frame mean decay length. We empha- size that this is a rather conservative approach, because theacceptance Ais inversely proportional to /lscript lab. We then show the experimental sensitivity of any kind of experiment for a given background expectation, exposure time, and numberof targets, in the plane of \u00af/lscript max lab/epsilon1\u00b7F. The top panel of Fig. 22demonstrates the expected model-independent sen- sitivities at the DUNE experiment. The green (blue) line isfor the DUNE FD with a background-free assumption and 20 (40) kt \u00b7year exposure. The bottom panel of Fig. 22reports model-dependent sen- sitivities for \u00af/lscript max lab=0 m and 100 m corresponding to theexperiments in the top panel. Note that this method of presen- tation is reminiscent of the widely known scheme for show- ing the experimental reaches in various DM direct detec- tion experiments, i.e., MDMDMtarget where MDMis the mass of DM and DMtarget is the cross section between the DM and target. For the case of non-relativistic DM scatter- ing in the direct-detection experiments, MDMdetermines the kinetic energy scale of the incoming DM, just like Msets out the incoming energy of boosted in the iBDM search. 8.3 Elastic boosted dark matter from the sun In this section, we focus on Benchmark Model (ii) described by Eq. ( 15). This study uses DUNE's full FD event generation and detector simulation. We focus on BDM flux sourced by DM annihilation in the core of the sun. DM particles can be captured through their scattering with the nuclei within thesun, mostly hydrogen and helium. This makes the core of the 123 322 Page 28 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 22 Top: model-independent experimental sensitivities of iBDM search in \u00af/lscriptmax lab/epsilon1\u00b7Fplane.

The BDM flux is =fA 4D2, (24) where Ais the annihilation rate, and D=1 AU is the distance from the sun. fis a model-dependent parameter, where f= 2 for two-component DM as considered here. For the parameter space of interest, assuming that the DM annihilation cross section is not too small, the DM distri-bution in the sun has reached an equilibrium between cap-ture and annihilation. This helps to eliminate the annihilation cross section dependence in our study. The chain of processes involved in giving rise to the boosted DM signal from the sunis illustrated in Fig. 23. Two additional comments are in order. First, the DM par- ticles cannot be too light, i.e., lighter than 4 GeV [ 217,218], otherwise we will lose most of the captured DM through evaporation rather than annihilation; this would dramatically reduce the BDM flux. Additionally, one needs to check thatBDM particles cannot lose energy and potentially be recap-tured by scattering with the solar material when they escape from the core region after production. Rescattering is foundto be rare for the benchmark models considered in this study and we consider the BDM flux to be monochromatic at its production energy. The event rate to be observed at DUNE is R=\u00d7 SM\u00d7\u00d7NT, (25) where is the flux given by Eq. ( 24),SMis the scatter- ing cross section of the BDM off of SM particles, is the efciency of the detection of such a process, and NTis the number of target particles in DUNE. The computation of theflux of BDM from the sun can be found in [ 179]. The processes of typical BDM scattering in argon are illus- trated in Fig. 24. We generate the signal events and calculate interaction cross sections in the detector using a newly devel-oped BDM module [ 12,13,219] that includes elastic and deep inelastic scattering, as well as a range of nuclear effects. This conservative event generation neglects the dominant contri-butions from baryon resonances in the nal state hadronic invariant mass range of 1.2-1.8 GeV , which should not have a major effect on our main results. The interactions are takento be mediated by an axial, flavor-universal Z /primecoupling to both the BDM and with the quarks. The axial charge is taken to be 1. The events are generated for the 10 kt DUNE detector module [ 220], though we only study the dominant scattering o f fo ft h e40Ar atoms therein. The method for determining the efciency is described below. The number of target argon atoms is N=1.5\u00d71032assuming a target mass of 10 kt. The main background in this process comes from the NC interactions of atmospheric neutrinos and argon, as they share the features that the timing of events is unknown in advance(unlike events of neutrinos produced by the accelerator), andthat the interactions with argon produce hadronic activity in the detector. We use GENIE to generate the NC atmospheric neutrino events. This simulation predicts 845 events in a 10 ktmodule for one year of exposure. The nite detector resolution is taken into account by smearing the direction of the stable nal state particles,including protons, neutrons, charged pions, muons, elec- trons, and photons, with the expected angular resolution, and by ignoring the ones with kinetic energy below detectorthreshold, using the parameters reported in the DUNE CDR[3]. We form as the observable the total momentum from all the stable nal state particles, and obtain its angle with respect to the direction of the sun. The sun position is simulated withthe SolTrack package [ 221] including the geographical coor- dinates of the DUNE FD. We consider both the scenarios in which we can reconstruct neutrons, according to the param-eters described in the DUNE CDR, and in which neutrons will not be reconstructed at all. Figure 25shows the angular distributions of the BDM signals with mass of 10 GeV anddifferent boost factors, and of the background events. 123Eur. Phys. J.

We predict that 104 .0\u00b10.7 and 79.4\u00b10.6 background events per year, in the scenarios with and without neutrons respectively, survive the selection in aDUNE 10 kt module. The resulting expected sensitivity is presented in Fig. 26 in terms of the DM mass and the Z /primegauge coupling for poten- tial DM boosts of =1.25,2,10 and for a xed mediator mass of MZ/prime=1 GeV. We assume a DUNE livetime of one year for one 10 kt module. The models presented here arecurrently unconstrained by direct detection searches if the thermal relic abundance of the DM is chosen to t current observations. Figure 27compares the sensitivity of 10 years of data collected in DUNE (40 kt) to re-analyses of the resultsfrom other experiments, including Super Kamiokande [ 222] and DM direct detection, PICO-60 [ 223] and PandaX [ 224]. An extension to this study can be found in Ref. [ 225].8.4 Summary of dark matter detection prospects We have conducted simulation studies of the dark matter models described in Eqs. ( 14) and ( 15) in terms of their detection prospects at the DUNE ND and FD. Thanks toits relatively low threshold and strong particle identication capabilities, DUNE presents an opportunity to signicantly advance the search for LDM and BDM beyond what has beenpossible with water Cherenkov detectors. In the case of the ND, we assumed that the relativistic DM is being produced directly at the target and leaves anexperimental signature through an elastic electron scattering. Using two constrained parameters of the light DM model and a range of two free parameters, a sensitivity map wasproduced. Within the context of the vector portal DM modeland the chosen parameter constraints along with the electron scattering as the signal event, this result sets stringent limits 123 322 Page 30 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 25 Angular distribution of the BDM signal events for a BDM mass of 10 GeV and different boosted factors, , and of the atmospheric neutrino NC background events. represents the angle of the sum over all the stable nal state particles as detailed in the text. The amount ofbackground represents 1-year data collection, magnied by a factor 100,while the amount of signal reflects the detection efciency of 10,000MC events. The top plot shows the scenario where neutrons can bereconstructed, while the bottom plot represents the scenario withoutneutrons on DM parameters that are comparable or even better than recent experimental bounds in the sub-GeV mass range. By contrast, in the case of the FD modules, we assumed that the signal events are due to DM coming from the galac- tic halo and the sun with a signicant boost factor. For theinelastic scattering case, the DM scatters off either an elec- tron or proton in the detector material into a heavier unstable dark-sector state. The heavier state, by construction, decaysback to DM and an electron-positron pair via a dark-photonexchange. Therefore, in the nal state, a signal event comes with an electron or proton recoil plus an electron-positron pair. This distinctive signal feature enabled us to perform(almost) background-free analyses. As ProtoDUNE detectors are prototypes of DUNE FD modules, the same study was conducted [ 186] and corre- sponding results were compared with the ones of the DUNE FD modules. We rst investigated the experimental sensitiv- ity in a dark-photon parameter space, dark-photon mass M V versus kinetic mixing parameter /epsilon1. The results are shownFig. 26 Expected 5 discovery reach with one year of DUNE livetime for one 10 kt module including neutrons in reconstruction (top) andexcluding neutrons (bottom) separately for Scenarios 1 and 2 in Fig. 21. They suggest that DUNE FD modules would probe a broad range of unexploredregions; they would allow for reaching 12 orders of mag- nitude smaller /epsilon1values than the current limits along MeV to sub-GeV-range dark photons. We also examined model-independent reaches at DUNE FD modules, providing limits for models that assume the existence of iBDM (or iBDM- like) signals (i.e., a target recoil and a fermion pair). For the elastic scattering case, we considered the case in which BDM comes from the sun. With one year of data, the 5sensitivity is expected to reach a coupling of g 4 Z/prime= 9.57\u00d71010for a boost of 1.25 and g4 Z/prime=1.49\u00d71010 for a boost of 10 at a DM mass of 10 GeV without including neutrons in the reconstruction. 9 Baryon number violating processes Unifying three of the fundamental forces in the universe, the strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions, is a sharedgoal for the current world-wide program in particle physics. Grand unied theories (GUTs), extending the SM to include a unied gauge symmetry at very high energies (more than10 15GeV), predict a number of observable effects at low 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 31 of 51 322 Fig. 27 Comparison of sensitivity of DUNE for 10 years of data col- lection and 40 kt of detector mass with Super Kamiokande, assuming 10and 100% of the selection efciency on the atmospheric neutrino anal-ysis in Ref. [ 222], and with the reinterpretations of the current results from PICO-60 [ 223] and PandaX [ 224]. The samples with two boosted factors, =1.25 (top) and =10 (bottom), are also presented energies, such as nucleon decay [ 226-230]. Since the early 1980s, supersymmetric GUT models were preferred for anumber of reasons, including gauge-coupling unication, natural embedding in superstring theories, and their abil- ity to solve the ne-tuning problem of the SM. Supersym-metric GUT models [ 231-239] generically predict that the dominant proton decay mode is pK +, in contrast to non-supersymmetric GUT models, which typically predictthe dominant decay mode to be pe +0. Although the LHC did not nd any evidence for supersymmetry (SUSY) at the electroweak scale, as was expected if SUSY were to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the SM, the appeal of aGUT still remains. In particular, gauge-coupling unication can still be achieved in non-supersymmetric GUT models by the introduction of one or more intermediate scales (see, forexample, [ 240]). Several experiments have sought signatures of nucleon decay, with the best limits for most decay modes set by the Super-Kamiokande experiment [ 241-243], which features the largest sensitive mass and exposure to date.The excellent imaging, as well as calorimetric and particle identication capabilities, of the LArTPC technology imple-mented for the DUNE FD will exploit a number of comple- mentary signatures for a broad range of baryon-number vio- lating processes. Should nucleon decay rates lie just beyondcurrent limits, observation of even one or two candidateevents with negligible background could constitute com- pelling evidence. In the DUNE era, two other large detectors, Hyper-Kamiokande [ 244] and JUNO [ 245] will be conduct- ing nucleon decay searches. Should a signal be observed in any single experiment, conrmation from experiments using different detector technologies and nuclear targets, and there-fore subject to different backgrounds, would be very power- ful. Neutron-antineutron ( n\u00afn) oscillation is a baryon num- ber violating process that has never been observed but ispredicted by a number of BSM theories [ 246]. In this con- text, baryon number conservation is an accidental symmetry rather than a fundamental one, which means baryon numberviolation does not stand against the fundamental gauge sym- metries. Discovering baryon number violation would have implications on the source of matter-antimatter symmetryin our universe given Sakharov's conditions for such asym- m e t r yt oa r i 247]. ( n\u00afn) process violates baryon number by two units and, therefore, could also have further implications forthe smallness of neutrino masses [ 246]. Since the n\u00afntran- sition operator is a six-quark operator, of dimension 9, with a coefcient function of dimension (mass) 5, while the pro- ton decay operator is a four-fermion operator, of dimension 6, with a coefcient function of dimension (mass)2, one might naively assume that n\u00afnoscillations would always be sup- pressed relative to proton decay as a manifestation of baryon number violation. However, this is not necessarily the case; indeed, there are models [ 248-251] in which proton decay is very strongly suppressed down to an unobservably smalllevel, while n\u00afnoscillations occur at a level comparable to present limits. This shows the value of a search for n\u00afn transitions at DUNE. Searches for this process using bothfree neutrons and nucleus-bound neutron states have been carried out since the 1980s. The current best 90% CL limits on the (free) neutron oscillation lifetime are 8 .6\u00d710 7sf r o m free n\u00afnsearches and 2 .7\u00d7108s from nucleus-bound n\u00afn searches [ 252,253]. As with nucleon decay, searches for n\u00afn oscillations performed by DUNE and those performed bySuper-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and the EuropeanSpallation Source [ 246] are highly complementary. Should a signal be observed in any one experiment, conrmation from another experiment with a different detector technology andbackgrounds would be very powerful. 123 322 Page 32 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 9.1 Event simulation and reconstruction To estimate the sensitivity to baryon number violation in DUNE, simulation of both signal and background events is performed using GENIE version 2.12.10. For nucleon decay,a total of 68 single-nucleon exclusive decay channels listedin the 2016 update of the PDG [ 135] are available in GENIE. The list includes two-, three-, and ve-body decays. If a bound nucleon decays, the remaining nucleus can be in anexcited state and will typically de-excite by emitting nuclear ssion fragments, nucleons, and photons. At present, de- excitation photon emission is simulated only for oxygen. Thesimulation of neutron-antineutron oscillation was developed [254] and implemented in GENIE. Implementing this pro- cess in GENIE used GENIE's existing modeling of Fermimomentum and binding energy for both the oscillating neu-tron and the nucleon with which the resulting antineutron annihilates. Once a neutron has oscillated to an antineutron in a nucleus, the antineutron has a 18 /39 chance of annihilat- ing with a proton in argon, and a 21 /39 chance of annihilating with a neutron. The energies and momenta of the annihila- tion products are assigned randomly but consistently withfour-momentum conservation. The products of the annihila- tion process follow the branching fractions (shown in Table 9) measured in low-energy antiproton annihilation on hydrogen[254]. The default model in GENIE for the propagation of parti- cles inside the nucleus is hA2015, an empirical, data-driven model that does not simulate the cascade of hadronic interac-tions step by step, but instead uses one effective interaction to represent the effect of nal-state interactions (FSI). Hadron- nucleus scattering data is used to tune the predictions. The dominant background for these searches is from atmo- spheric neutrino interactions. Backgrounds from neutrino interactions are simulated with GENIE, using the Bartolmodel of atmospheric neutrino flux [ 255]. To estimate the event rate, we integrate the product of the neutrino flux and interaction cross section. Table 8shows the event rate for dif- ferent neutrino species for an exposure of 10 kt \u00b7year, where oscillation effects are not included. To suppress atmospheric neutrino background to the level of one event per Mt \u00b7year, which would yield 0.4 events after ten years of operation witha 40 kt ducial volume, the necessary background rejection is 1(1/288600 )=13\u00d710 6=0.999997, where back- ground rejection is dened as the fraction of background thatis not selected. These analyses assume that the detector is successfully triggered on all signal events, and that the PD system cor- rectly determines the event start time ( t 0). Two distinct meth- ods of reconstruction and event selection have been applied in these analyses. One employs 3D track and vertex recon- struction provided by Projection Matching Algorithm (PMA)[1], a standard DUNE reconstruction algorithm. PMA wasTable 8 Expected rate of atmospheric neutrinointeractions in 40Ar for a 10 kt\u00b7year exposure (not including oscillations)CC NC Total 1038 398 1436 \u00af 280 169 449 e 597 206 803 \u00afe 126 72 198 Total 2041 845 2886 designed to address transformation from a set of indepen- dently reconstructed 2D projections of objects into a 3D rep- resentation. This algorithm uses clusters of hits from 2D pat-tern recognition as its input. The other reconstruction method involves image classication of 2D images of reconstructed hits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The twomethods are combined in the form of a multivariate analysis, which uses the image classication score with other physical observables extracted from traditional reconstruction. 9.2 Nucleon decay Because of the already stringent limits set by Super- Kamiokande on pe +0and the unique ability to track and identify kaons in a LArTPC, the initial nucleon decay studies in DUNE have focused on nucleon decay modes fea-turing kaons, in particular pK +. The experimental signature of this channel is a single K+originating inside the ducial volume of the detector. The kaon typically stopsand decays at rest with a lifetime of 12 ns. The most com- mon decay mode, K ++, results in a monoenergetic muon with momentum of 236 MeV/c. In the next most prob-able decay, K ++0, the two pions are produced back to back. In a water Cherenkov detector, the kaon is typi- cally below Cherenkov threshold, and only the kaon decay products are observed. In DUNE's LArTPC, the kaon can bedetected and identied by its distinctive dE/dxsignature, as well as by its decay [ 256]. For a proton decay at rest, the outgoing kaon is monoen- ergetic with kinetic energy of 105 MeV and momentum of 339 MeV /c. In bound proton decay, the momentum of the kaon is smeared by the Fermi motion of the protons insidethe nucleus. FSI between the outgoing kaon and the residualnucleus may reduce the kaon momentum, and may also mod- ify the nal state, by ejecting nucleons for example. Protons ejected from the nucleus can obscure the dE/dxmeasure- ment of the kaon if the tracks overlap. The K +may also charge exchange, resulting in a K0in the nal state. The K+ cannot be absorbed due to strangeness conservation and the lack of S=1 baryons. The residual nucleus may also be in an excited state, producing de-excitation photons. The main backgrounds in nucleon decay searches are interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. For p K+, 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 33 of 51 322 the background is neutrino interactions that mimic a sin- gleK+and its decay products. Because the kaon is not detected in a water Cherenkov detector, neutrino inter- actions that produce a single K+and no other particles above Cherenkov threshold are an irreducible background.This includes charged-current reactions Cabibbo-suppressed nK+n, where the nal-state muon and kaon are below threshold, as well as neutral-current pro- cesses like pK+followed by pwhere thedecay products are threshold. Strangeness is always conserved in neutral-currents, so kaons produced in NC interactions are always accompanied by a hyperon oranother kaon. Water Cherenkov detectors and liquid scintil- lator detectors like JUNO can also detect neutron captures, which provide an additional handle on backgrounds, manyof which have nal-state neutrons. However, neutrons canalso be present in pK +signal due to FSI, and the rate of nucleon ejection in kaon-nucleus interactions is not well understood. Nuclear de-excitation photons are also typ-ically produced, but these are similar in both proton decay and atmospheric neutrino events. In the Super-Kamiokande analysis of pK +the time difference between the de- excitation photons from the oxygen nucleus and the muon from kaon decay was found to be an effective way to reduce backgrounds [ 241]. In JUNO, the three-fold time coincidence between the kaon, the muon from the kaon decay, and theelectron from the muon decay is expected to be an important discriminant between signal and background [ 245]. The possibility of using the time difference between the kaon scintillation signal and the scintillation signal from the muon from the kaon decay has been investigated in DUNE. Studies indicate that measuring time differences on the scaleof the kaon lifetime (12 ns) is difcult in DUNE, independent of photon detector acceptance and timing resolution, due to both the scintillation process in argon - consisting of fast(ns-scale) and slow ( s-scale) components - and Rayleigh scattering over long distances. In a LArTPC, a charged particle traveling just a few cm can be detected, and the other particles produced in associationwith a kaon by atmospheric neutrinos are generally observed. However, with FSI the signal process can also include nal- state protons, so requiring no other nal-state particles willreject some signal events. Furthermore, charged-current quasi-elastic scattering (CCQE), np, can mimic theK++decay when the proton is mis-reconstructed as a kaon. The kaon reconstruction is especially challenging for very short tracks, which may traverse only a few wires. The dE/dxsignature in signal events can be obscured by addi- tional nal-state protons that overlap with the start of the kaon track. Without timing resolution sufcient to resolve the 12 ns kaon lifetime, the dE/dxprole is the only dis- tinguishing feature. The background from atmospheric neu-Fig. 28 Kinetic energy of kaons in simulated proton decay events, pK+, in DUNE. The kinetic energy distribution is shown before and after nal state interactions in the argon nucleus trino events without true nal-state kaons, which is impor- tant given the presence of was neglected in previousestimates of pK +sensitivity in LArTPC [ 257]. Other backgrounds, such as those initiated by cosmic-ray muons, can be controlled by requiring no activity close tothe edges of the time projection chambers (TPCs) and bystringent single kaon identication within the energy range of interest [ 77,258]. FSI signicantly modify the observable distributions in the detector. For charged kaons, the hA2015 model includes only elastic scattering and nucleon knock-out, tuned to K +C data [ 259,260]. Charge exchange is not included, nor are strong processes that produce kaons inside the nucleus, such as +nK+. Figure 28shows the kinetic energy of a kaon from pK+before and after FSI as simulated with hA2015. Kaon interactions always reduce the kaon energy, and the kaon spectrum becomes softer on average with FSI. Of the kaons, 31.5% undergo elastic scattering resulting in events with very low kinetic energy; 25% of kaons have akinetic energy of 50 MeV. When the kaon undergoes elas- tic scattering, a nucleon can be knocked out of the nucleus. Of decays via this channel, 26.7% have one neutron comingfrom FSI, 15.3% have at least one proton, and 10.3% have two protons coming from FSI. These secondary nucleons are detrimental to reconstructing and selecting K +. Other FSI models include the full cascade, and predict slightly different nal states, but existing data lack power to favor one model over another. MINERvA has measured the differential cross section for charged-current K+production by neutrinos on plastic scintillator (CH) as a function of kaon energy, which is sensitive to FSI, and shows a weak prefer- ence for the GENIE hA2015 FSI model over a prediction with no FSI [ 261]. Compared to the kaon energy spectrum measured by MINERV A, FSI have a much larger impact on pK+in argon, and the differences between models are less signicant than the overall effect. 123 322 Page 34 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 29 Tracking efciency for kaons in simulated proton decay events, pK+, as a function of kaon kinetic energy (top) and true path length (bottom) The kaon FSI in Super-Kamiokande's simulation of p K+in oxygen seem to have a smaller effect on the outgoing kaon momentum distribution [ 241] than is seen here with the GENIE simulation on argon. Some differences are expecteddue to the different nuclei, but differences in the FSI modelsare under investigation. Kaon FSI have implications on the ability to identify p K +events in DUNE. Track reconstruction efciency for a charged particle x\u00b1is dened as /epsilon1x\u00b1=x\u00b1particles with a reconstructed track events with x\u00b1particle. (26) The denominator includes events in which an x\u00b1particle was created and has deposited energy within any of the TPCs.The numerator includes events in which an x \u00b1particle was created and has deposited energy within any of the TPCs, and a reconstructed track can be associated to the x\u00b1particle based on the number of hits generated by that particle alongthe track. This efciency can be calculated as a function of true kinetic energy and true track length. Figure 29shows the tracking efciency for K +from pro- ton decay via pK+as a function of true kinetic energy and true path length. The overall tracking efciency for kaons from proton decay is 58.0%, meaning that 58.0% of all thesimulated kaons are associated with a reconstructed track inFig. 30 Particle identication using PIDA for muons and kaons in simulated proton decay events, pK+, and protons in simulated atmospheric neutrino background events. The curves are normalized byarea the detector. From Fig. 29, the tracking threshold is approx- imately 40 MeV of kinetic energy, which translates to 4.0 cm in true path length. The biggest loss in tracking efciency is due to kaons with <40 MeV of kinetic energy due to scattering inside the nucleus. The efciency levels offto approximately 80% above 80 MeV of kinetic energy; this inefciency even at high kinetic energy is due mostly to kaons that decay in flight. Both kaon scattering in the liquid argon(LAr) and charge exchange are included in the detector sim- ulation but are relatively small effects (4.6% of kaons scatter in the LAr and 1.2% of kaons experience charge exchange).The tracking efciency for muons from the decay of the K + inpK+is 90%. Hits associated with a reconstructed track are used to cal- culate the energy loss of charged particles, which providesvaluable information on particle energy and species. If the charged particle stops in the LArTPC active volume, a com- bination of dE/dxand the reconstructed residual range ( R, the path length to the end point of the track) is used to dene a parameter for particle ID (PID). The parameter, i/angbracketrightbigg , (27) where the median is taken over all track points ifor which the residual range Riis less than 30 cm. Figure 30shows the PIDA performance for kaons (from proton decay), kaon decay), and protons pro-duced by atmospheric neutrino interactions. The tail with lower values in each distribution is due to cases where the decay/stopping point was missed by the track reconstruction.The tail with higher values is caused when a second particle overlaps at the decay/stopping point causing higher values of dE/dxand resulting in higher values of PIDA . In addition, ionization fluctuations smear out these distributions. 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 35 of 51 322 PID via dE/dxbecomes complicated when the recon- structed track direction is ambiguous, in particular if addi-tional energy is deposited at the vertex in events where FSI is signicant. The dominant background to pK +in DUNE is atmospheric neutrino CC quasielastic (QE) scatter-ing, np. When the muon happens to have very close to the 236MeV /cmomentum expected from a K+decay at rest and is not captured, it is indistinguishable from the muon resulting from pK+followed by K++. When the proton is also mis-reconstructed as a kaon, this back- ground mimics the signal process. The most important difference between signal and this background source is the direction of the hadron track. For an atmospheric neutrino, the proton and muon originate from the same neutrino interaction point, and the characteristicBragg rise occurs at the end of the proton track farthest fromthe muon-proton vertex. In signal, the kaon-muon vertex is where the K +stops and decays at rest, so its ionization energy deposit is highest near the kaon-muon vertex. To take advan-tage of this difference, a log-likelihood ratio discriminator is used to distinguish signal from background. Templates are formed by taking the reconstructed and calibrated energydeposit as a function of the number of wires from both the start and end of the K +candidate hadron track. Two log- likelihood ratios are computed separately for each track. Therst begins at the hadron-muon shared vertex and movesalong the hadron track (the \"backward\" direction). The sec- ond begins at the other end of the track, farthest from the hadron-muon shared vertex, moves along the hadron trackthe other way (the \"forward\" direction). For signal events, this effectively looks for the absence of a Bragg rise at the K +start, and the presence of one at the end, and vice versa for background. At each point, the probability density for signal and background, Psigand Pbkg, are determined from the templates. Forward and ratiosare computed as L fwd(bkwd)=/summationdisplay ilogPsig i Pbkg i, (28) where the summation is over the wires of the track, in either the forward or backward direction. Using either the forward or backward log-likelihood ratio alone gives some discrim-ination between signal and background, but using the sum gives better discrimination. While the probability densities are computed based on the same samples, dening one endof the track instead of the other as the vertex provides more information. The discriminator is the sum of the forward and backward log-likelihood ratios: L=L fwd+Lbkwd. (29)Fig. 31 Boosted Decision Tree response for pK+for signal (blue) and background (red) Applying this discriminator to tracks with at least ten wires gives a signal efciency of roughly 0.4 with a background rejection of 0.99. A Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) classier is used for event selection in the analysis presented here. The software package Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT(TMV A4) [ 263] is used with AdaBoost as the boosted algo- rithm. The BDT is trained on a sample of MC events (50,000 events for signal and background) that is statistically inde- pendent from the sample of MC events used in the analysis(approximately 100,000 events for signal and 600,000 events for background). Image classication using a CNN is per- formed using 2D images of DUNE MC events. The imageclassication provides a single score value as a metric of whether any given event is consistent with a proton decay, and this score can be used as a powerful discriminant forevent identication. In the analysis presented here, the CNNtechnique alone does not discriminate between signal and background as well as a BDT, so the CNN score is used as one of the input variables to the BDT in this analysis. Theother variables in the BDT include numbers of reconstructed objects (tracks, showers, vertices), variables related to visi- ble energy deposition, PID variables [ PIDA ,E q .( 27), and L,E q .( 29)], reconstructed track length, and reconstructed momentum. Figure 31shows the distribution of the BDT output for signal and background. Backgrounds from atmo-spheric neutrinos are weighted by the oscillation probabilityin the BDT input distributions. Figure 32shows a pK +signal event. The event display shows the reconstructed kaon track in green and thereconstructed muon track from the kaon decay in red; hits from the Michel electron coming from the muon decay can be seen at the end of the muon track. Figure 33shows an event with a similar topology produced by an atmospheric neutrino interaction, np. This type of event can be selected in the pK+sample if the proton is misidentied as a kaon. Hits associated with the reconstructed muon track 123 322 Page 36 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 32 Event display for an easily recognizable pK+signal event.

Hits associated with thereconstructed muon track are shown in red, and hits associated withthe reconstructed kaon track are shown in green. Hits from the decayelectron can be seen at the end of the muon track are shown in red, and hits associated with the reconstructed proton track are shown in green. Hits from the decay electron can be seen at the end of the muon track. The proton decay signal and atmospheric neutrino back- ground events are processed using the same reconstruction chain and subject to the same selection criteria. There are two preselection cuts to remove obvious background. Onecut requires at least two tracks, which aims to select events with a kaon plus a kaon decay product (usually a muon). The other cut requires that the longest track be less than 100 cm;this removes backgrounds from high energy neutrino inter-actions. After these cuts, 50% of the signal and 17.5% of the background remain in the sample. The signal inefciency at this stage of selection is due mainly to the kaon trackingefciency. Optimal lifetime sensitivity is achieved by com- bining the preselection cuts with a BDT cut that gives a signal efciency of 0.15 and a background rejection of 0.999997,which corresponds to approximately one background event per Mt \u00b7year. The limiting factor in the sensitivity is the kaon tracking efciency. The reconstruction is not yet optimized, and theFig. 33 Event display for an atmospheric neutrino interaction, n p, which might be selected in the pK+sample if the proton is misidentied as a kaon.

To understand the poten- tial improvement, a visual scan of simulated decays of kaonsinto muons was performed. For this sample of events, with kaon momentum in the 150 MeV /cto 450 MeV /crange, scanners achieved greater than at recogniz-ing the K ++e+decay chain. The inefciency came mostly from short kaon tracks (momentum below 180 MeV /c) and kaons that decay in flight. Note that the lowest momentum kaons ( <150 MeV /c) were not included in the study; the path length for kaons in this range would also be too short to track. Based on this study, the kaon tracking efciency could be improved to a maximum value of approxi-mately 80% with optimized reconstruction algorithms, where the remaining inefciency comes from low-energy kaons and kaons that charge exchange, scatter, or decay in flight. Com-bining this tracking performance improvement with some improvement in the K/pseparation performance for short tracks, the overall signal selection efciency improves from15% to approximately 30%. 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 37 of 51 322 The analysis presented above is inclusive of all possible modes of kaon decay; however, the current version of theBDT preferentially selects kaon decay to muons, which has a branching fraction of roughly 64%. The second most promi- nent kaon decay is K ++0, which has a branching fraction of 21%. Preliminary studies that focus on recon-structing a +0pair with the appropriate kinematics indi- cate that the signal efciency for kaons that decay via the K++0mode is approximately the same as the sig- nal efciency for kaons that decay via the K++ mode. This assumption is included in our sensitivity esti- mates below. Because the DUNE efciency to reconstruct a kaon track is strongly dependent on the kaon kinetic energy as seen in Fig.29, the FSI model is an important source of systematic uncertainty. To account for this uncertainty, kaon-nucleonelastic scattering ( K +p(n)K+p(n)) is re-weighted by \u00b150% in the simulation. The absolute uncertainty on the efciency with this re-weighting is 2%, which is taken as thesystematic uncertainty on the signal efciency. The dominant uncertainty in the background is due to the absolute normal- ization of the atmospheric neutrino rate. The Bartol grouphas carried out a detailed study of the systematic uncertain- ties, where the absolute neutrino fluxes have uncertainties of approximately 15% [ 264]. The remaining uncertainties are due to the cross section models for neutrino interactions. Theuncertainty on the CC0 cross section in the energy range relevant for these backgrounds is roughly 10% [ 265]. Based on these two effects, a conservative 20% systematic uncer-tainty in the background is estimated. With a 30% signal efciency and an expected background of one event per Mt \u00b7year, a 90% CL lower limit on the proton lifetime in the pK +channel of 1 .3\u00d71034years can be set, assuming no signal is observed over ten years of running with a total of 40 kt of ducial mass. This calculationassumes constant signal efciency and background rejectionover time and for each of the FD modules. Additional running improves the sensitivity proportionately if the experiment remains background-free. Another potential mode for a baryon number violation search is the decay of the neutron into a charged lepton plus meson, i.e., ne K+. In this mode, B=L, where Bis baryon number and Lis lepton number. The current best limit on this mode is 3 .2\u00d71031years from the FREJUS col- laboration [ 266]. The reconstruction software for this anal- ysis is the same as for the pK+analysis; the analysis again uses a BDT that includes an image classication score as an input. To calculate the lifetime sensitivity for this decay mode the same systematic uncertainties and procedures areused. The selection efciency for this channel including the expected tracking improvements is 0.47 with a background rejection of 0.99995, which corresponds to 15 backgroundTable 9 Effective branching ratios for antineutron annihilation in40Ar, as implemented in GENIE Channel The lifetime sensitivity for a 400 kt \u00b7year exposure is 1 .1\u00d71034years. 9.3 Neutron-antineutron be detected via the sub- antineutron annihilation with a neutron or a proton.Table 9shows the effective branching ratios for the antineu- tron annihilation modes applicable to intranuclear searches, modied from [ 253]. It is known that other, more funda- mentally consistent branching fractions exist [ 267,268], but the effects of these on nal states is believed to be minimal. The annihilation event will have a distinct, roughly spherical signature of a vertex with several emitted light hadrons (aso-called \"pion star\"), with total energy of twice the nucleon mass and roughly zero net momentum. Reconstructing these hadrons correctly and measuring their energies is key to iden-tifying the signal event. The main background for these n\u00afn annihilation events is caused by atmospheric neutrinos. As with nucleon decay, nuclear effects and FSI make the picture more complicated. As shown in Table 9, every decay mode contains at least one charged pion and one neutral pion. The pion FSI in the hA2015 model in GENIE include pion elastic and inelastic scattering, charge exchange and absorption. Figure 34shows the momentum distributions for charged and neutral pions before FSI and after FSI. These distribu- tions show the FSI makes both charged and neutral pions lessenergetic. The effect of FSI on pion multiplicity is also rather 123 322 Page 38 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 34 Top: momentum of an individual charged pion before and after nal state interactions. Bottom: momentum of an individual neutral pionbefore and after nal state interactions signicant; 0.9% of the events have no charged pions before FSI, whereas after FSI 11.1% of the events have no charged pions. In the case of the neutral pion, 11.0% of the events have no neutral pions before FSI, whereas after FSI, 23.4%of the events have no neutral pions. The decrease in pion mul-tiplicity is primarily due to pion absorption in the nucleus. Another effect of FSI is nucleon knockout from pion elastic scattering. Of the events, 94% have at least one proton fromFSI and 95% of the events have at least one neutron from FSI. Although the kinetic energy for these nucleons peak at a few tens of MeV, the kinetic energy can be as large as hundredsof MeV. In summary, the effects of FSI in n\u00afnbecome rele- vant because they modify the kinematics and topology of the event. For instance, even though the decay modes of Table 9 do not include nucleons in their decay products, nucleonsappear with high probability after FSI. A BDT classier is used. Ten variables are used in the BDT as input for event selection, including number ofreconstructed tracks and showers, variables related to vis- ible energy deposition, PIDA and dE/dx, reconstructed momentum, and CNN score. Figure 35shows the distribu- tion of the BDT output for signal and background. Figure 36shows an n\u00afnsignal event, n\u00afnn 00+. Hits associated with the back-to-back tracks of the chargedpions are shown in red. The remaining hits are from the show-Fig. 35 Boosted Decision Tree response for n\u00afnoscillation for signal (blue) and background (red) Fig. 36 Event display for an n\u00afnsignal event, n\u00afnn00+.

The topology of this event is consis-tent with charged pion and neutral pion production. Figure 37 shows an event with a similar topology produced by a NC DIS atmospheric neutrino interaction. This background eventmimics the signal topology by having multi-particle produc- tion and an electromagnetic shower. The sensitivity to the n\u00afnoscillation lifetime can be cal- culated for a given exposure, the efciency of selecting signal 123Eur. Phys. J.

The bottom view is induction plane one, the middle isinduction plane two, and the top is the collection plane. This event mim-ics the n\u00afnsignal topology by having multi-particle production and electromagnetic showers events, and the background rate along with their uncertain- ties. The lifetime sensitivity is obtained at 90% CL for thebound neutron. Then, the lifetime sensitivity for a free neu- tron is acquired using the conversion from nucleus bounded neutron to free neutron n\u00afnoscillation [ 269]. The uncer- tainties on the signal efciency and background rejection are conservatively estimated to be 25%. A detailed evaluation of the uncertainties is in progress. The free n\u00afnoscillation lifetime, n\u00afn, and bounded n\u00afn oscillation lifetime, Tn\u00afn, are related to each other through the intranuclear suppression factor Ras 2 n\u00afn=Tn\u00afn R. (30) The suppression factor Rvaries for different nuclei. This suppression factor was calculated for16O and56Fe [269]. The Rfor56Fe, 0.666\u00d71023s1, is used in this analysis for40Ar nuclei. More recent work [ 268] gives a value of R for40Ar of 0 .56\u00d71023s1, which will be applied in future analyses. The best bound neutron lifetime limit is achieved using a signal efciency of 8.0% at the background rejectionprobability of 99.98%, which corresponds to approximately 23 atmospheric neutrino background events for a 400 kt \u00b7year exposure. The 90% CL limit of a bound neutron lifetime is6.45\u00d710 32years for a 400 kt \u00b7year exposure. The corre-sponding limit for the oscillation time of free neutrons is cal- culated to be 5 .53\u00d7108s. This is approximately an improve- ment by a factor of two from the current best limit, which comes from Super-Kamiokande [ 253]. 10 Other BSM physics opportunities 10.1 BSM constraints with tau neutrino appearance With only 19 -CC and \u00af-CC candidates detected with high purity, we have less direct experimental knowledge of tauneutrinos than of any other SM particle. Of these, nine -CC and\u00af-CC candidate events with a background of 1.5 events, observed by the DONuT experiment [ 270,271], were directly produced though DSmeson decays. The remaining 10 - CC candidate events with an estimated background of two events, observed by the OPERA experiment [ 272,273], were produced through the oscillation of a muon neutrino beam. From this sample, a 20% measurement of m2 32was per- formed under the assumption that sin2223=1. The Super- Kamiokande and IceCube experiments developed methods tostatistically separate samples of -CC and \u00af-CC events in atmospheric neutrinos to exclude the no-tau-neutrino appear- ance hypothesis at the 4.6 level and 3.2 level respectively [274-276], but limitations of Cherenkov detectors constrain the ability to select a high-purity sample and perform preci- sion measurements. The DUNE experiment has the possibility of signicantly improving the experimental situation [ 277]. Tau-neutrino appearance can potentially improve the discovery potentialfor sterile neutrinos, NC NSI, and non-unitarity. This channelcould also be used as a probe of secret couplings of neutrinos to new light bosons [ 278]. For model independence, the rst goal should be measuring the atmospheric oscillation param-eters in the appearance channel and checking the consis- tency of this measurement with those performed using the disappearance channel. A truth-level study of selection in atmospheric neutrinos in a large, underground LArTPC detector suggested that -CC interactions with hadronically decaying -leptons, make up 65% of total -lepton decays [ 135], can be selected with high purity [ 279]. This analysis suggests that it may be possible to select up to 30% of-CC events with hadronically decaying -leptons with minimal neutral-current background. Under these assump-tions, we expect to select 25 -CC candidates per year using the CPV optimized beam. The physics reach of this sample has been studied in Refs. [ 280,281]. As shown in Fig.38(top), this sample is sufcient to simultaneously con- strain m2 31and sin2223. Independent measurements of m2 31and sin2223in theeappearance, disappearance, andappearance channels should allow DUNE to constrain 123 322 Page 40 of 51 Eur. Phys. J.

Adapted from Ref. [ 280]. Bottom: The expected sensitivity for the appearance channel using 350 kt \u00b7year of atmospheric exposure |Ue3|2+|U3|2+|U3|2to 6% [ 280], a signicant improve- ment over current constraints [ 49]. However, all of the events in the beam sample occur at energies higher than the rst oscillation maximum due tokinematic constraints. Only seeing the tail of the oscillation maximum creates a partial degeneracy between the measure- ment of m 2 31and sin2223. Atmospheric neutrinos, due to sampling a much larger L/Erange, allow for measuring both above and below the rst oscillation maximum with appearance. Although we only expect to select 70-CC and\u00af-CC candidates in 350 kt \u00b7year in the atmospheric sample, as shown in Fig. 38(bottom), a direct measurement of the oscillation maximum breaks the degeneracy seen in the beam sample. The complementary shapes of the beam andatmospheric constraints combine to reduce the uncertainty on sin 223, directly leading to improved unitarity constraints. Finally, a high-energy beam option optimized for appear- ance should produce 150 selected -CC candidates in oneFig. 39 Sensitivity to the LED model in Refs. [ 282-284] through its impact on the neutrino oscillations expected at DUNE. For comparison,the MINOS sensitivity [ 285]i sa l s os h o w n year [ 3]. These higher energy events are further in the tail of the rst oscillation maximum, but they will permit a simulta- neous measurement of the cross section. When analyzed within the non-unitarity framework described in Sect. 4,t h e high-energy beam signicantly improves constraints on the parameter due to increased matter effects [ 280]. 10.2 Large extra-dimensions DUNE can search for or constrain the size of large extra- dimensions (LED) by looking for distortions of the oscilla-tion pattern predicted by the three-flavor paradigm. These distortions arise through mixing between the right-handed neutrino Kaluza-Klein modes, which propagate in the com-pactied extra dimensions, and the active neutrinos, which exist only in the four-dimensional brane [ 282-284]. Such distortions are determined by two parameters in the model,specically R, the radius of the circle where the extra- dimension is compactied, and m 0, dened as the lightest active neutrino mass ( m1for normal mass ordering, and m3for inverted mass ordering). Searching for these distor- tions in, for instance, the CC disappearance spectrum, should provide signicantly enhanced sensitivity over exist- ing results from the MINOS/MINOS+ experiment [ 285]. Figure 39shows a comparison between the DUNE and MINOS [ 285] sensitivities to LED at 90% CL for 2 d.o.f represented by the solid and dashed lines, respectively. Inthe case of DUNE, an exposure of 300 kt \u00b7MW\u00b7year was assumed and spectral information from the four oscillation channels, (anti)neutrino appearance and disappearance, were included in the analysis. The muon (anti)neutrino fluxes,cross sections for the neutrino interactions in argon, detector energy resolutions, efciencies and systematical errors were taken into account by the use of GLoBES les prepared forthe DUNE LBL studies. In the analysis, we assumed DUNE simulated data as compatible with the standard three neu- trino hypothesis (which corresponds to the limit R0) and we have tested the LED model. The solar parameters 123Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Page 41 of 51 322 were kept xed, and also the reactor mixing angle, while the atmospheric parameters were allowed to float free. In general,DUNE improves over the MINOS sensitivity for all values ofm 0and this is more noticeable for m0103eV, where the most conservative sensitivity limit to Ris obtained. 10.3 Heavy neutral leptons The high intensity of the LBNF neutrino beam and the pro- duction of charm mesons in the beam enables DUNE to search for a wide variety of lightweight long-lived, exotic particles, by looking for topologies of rare event interac-tions and decays in the ducial volume of the DUNE ND.These particles include weakly interacting heavy neutral lep- tons (HNLs) as right-handed partners of the active neutri- nos, light super-symmetric particles, or vector, scalar, and/oraxion portals to a Hidden Sector containing new interactions and new particles. Assuming the heavy neutral leptons are the lighter particles of their hidden sector, they will only decayinto SM particles. The parameter space that can be explored by the DUNE ND extends into the cosmologically relevant region, and will be complementary to the LHC heavier masssearches. Thanks to small mixing angles, the particles can be stable enough to travel from the production in the proton target to the detector and decay inside the active region. It is worthnoting that, differently from a light neutrino beam, an HNL beam is not polarized, due to the large mass of the HNLs. The correct description of the helicity components in the beamis important for predicting the angular distributions of HNL decays, as they might depend on the initial helicity state. More specically, there is a different phenomenology if thedecaying HNL is a Majorana or a [ 286,287]. Typical decay channels are two-body decays into a charged lepton and a pseudo-scalar meson, or a vector meson if the mass allows it, and three-body leptonic decays. A recent study illustrates the potential sensitivity for HNL searches with the DUNE ND [ 287]. The sensitivity for HNL particles with masses in the range of 10 MeV to 2 GeV ,from decays of mesons produced in the proton beam dump that produces the pions for the neutrino beam production, was studied. The production of D smesons gives access to high mass part of the HNL production. The dominant HNLdecay modes to SM particles have been included, as well as the basic detector constraints, and dominant background processes have been considered. The experimental signature for these decays is a decay-in- flight event with no interaction vertex, typical of neutrino- nucleon scattering, and a rather forward direction withrespect to the beam. The main background to this search comes from SM neutrino-nucleon scattering events in which the hadronic activity at the vertex is below threshold.Charged-current quasi-elastic events with pion emissionfrom resonances are background to the semi-leptonic decay channels, whereas misidentication of long pion tracks asmuons can constitute a background to three-body leptonic decays. Neutral pions are often emitted in neutrino scatter- ing events and can be a challenge for decays into a neutralmeson or channels with electrons in the nal state. We report in Fig. 40the physics reach of the DUNE ND in its current conguration without backgrounds for a Majorana and a Dirac HNL. The sensitivity was estimated assuming atotal of 1 .32\u00d710 22POT, i.e., for a running scenario with 6 years with a 80 GeV proton beam of 1.2 MW, followed by six years of a beam with 2.4 MW, but using only the neutrinomode conguration, which corresponds to half of the total runtime. As a result, a search can be conducted for HNLs with masses up to 2 GeV in all flavor-mixing channels. The results show that DUNE will have an improved sensi- tivity to small values of the mixing parameters |U N|2, where =e, , , compared to the presently available experimen- tal limits on mixing of HNLs with the three lepton flavors.At 90% CL sensitivity, DUNE can probe mixing parameters as low as 10 91010in the mass range of 300-500 MeV for mixing with the electron or muon neutrino flavors. In theregion above 500 MeV the sensitivity is reduced to 10 8for eNmixing and 107forNmixing. The Nmixing sensi- tivity is weaker but still covering a new unexplored regime. Alarge fraction of the covered parameter space for all neutrinoflavors falls in the region that is relevant for explaining the baryon asymmetry in the universe. Studies are ongoing with full detector simulations to val- idate these encouraging results. 10.4 Dark matter annihilation in the sun DUNE's large FD LArTPC modules provide an excellent set- ting to conduct searches for neutrinos arising from DM anni- hilation in the core of the sun. These would typically result in a high-energy neutrino signal almost always accompaniedby a low-energy neutrino component, which has its origin in a hadronic cascade that develops in the dense solar medium and produces large numbers of light long-lived mesons, suchas +and K+that then stop and decay at rest. The decay of each+andK+will produce monoenergetic neutrinos with an energy 30 or 236 MeV, respectively. The 236 MeV flux can be measured with the DUNE FD, thanks to its excellentenergy resolution, and importantly, will benet from direc- tional information. By selecting neutrinos arriving from the direction of the sun, large reduction in backgrounds can beachieved. This directional resolution for sub-GeV neutrinos will enable DUNE to be competitive with experiments with even larger ducial masses, but less precise angular informa-tion, such as Hyper-K [ 304]. 123 322 Page 42 of 51 Eur. Phys. J. C (2021) 81:322 Fig. 40 The 90% CL sensitivity regions for dominant mixings |UeN|2 (top left), |UN|2(top right), and |UN|2(bottom) are presented for DUNE ND (black) [ 287]. The regions are a combination of the sen- sitivity to HNL decay channels with good detection prospects.Theseare Nee,e, , 0,e,a n d . The Majorana neutrinos (solid) and Dirac neutrinos (dashed),assuming no background. The region excluded by experimental con-straints (grey/brown) is obtained by combining the results from PS191[288,289], peak searches [ 290-294], CHARM [ 295], NuTeV [ 296],DELPHI [ 297], and T2K [ 298]. The sensitivity for DUNE ND is com- pared to the predictions of future experiments, SBN [ 299] (blue), SHiP [300] (red), NA62 [ 301] (green), MATHUSLA [ 302] (purple), and the P h a s eI Io fF A S E R[ 303]. For reference, a band corresponding to the contribution light neutrino masses between 20 and 200 meV in a singlegeneration see-saw type I model is shown (yellow). Larger values of themixing angles are allowed if an extension to see-saw models is invoked,for instance, in an inverse or extended see-saw scheme 11 Conclusions and outlook DUNE will be a powerful discovery tool for a variety of physics topics under very active exploration today, from the potential discovery of new particles beyond those pre- dicted in the SM, to precision neutrino measurements thatmay uncover deviations from the present three-flavor mix- ing paradigm and unveil new interactions and symmetries. The ND alone will offer excellent opportunities to searchfor light DM and to measure rare processes such as neu- trino trident interactions. Besides enabling its potential to place leading constraints on deviations from the three-flavoroscillation paradigm, such as light sterile neutrinos and non-standard interactions, DUNE's massive high-resolution FD will probe the possible existence of baryon number violating processes and BDM. The flexibility of the LBNF beamlineopens prospects for high-energy beam running, providing access to probing and measuring tau neutrino physics withunprecedented precision. Through the ample potential for BSM physics, DUNE offers an opportunity for strong col-laboration between theorists and experimentalists and willprovide signicant opportunities for breakthrough discover- ies in the coming decades.
