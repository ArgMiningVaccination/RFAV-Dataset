That's why we love natural clean aromatherapy brand [Made by Coopers](https://madebycoopers.com/). If you're yet to try Made by Coopers, here's what you need to know. They are a UK based brand with an incredible range of clean beauty and aromatherapy. Their handmade plant-based products are cruelty-free and suitable for vegans. From relaxing candles, to bath salts, they have everything you need to unwind and re-charge. We chatted to to the company's co-founder, Clare Cooper to talk about the inspiration behind the company and love of clean beauty: When and why did you start the company? We started just over a year ago, after returning from a three-month yoga trip around India. During our trip, we stayed in an Ayurvedic retreat. It was at this retreat we saw first-hand the benefits of medicines obtained through plants and the healing effects they can bring to your mind as well as body. After returning we were inspired to start our own brand with the emphasis on emotional wellbeing. What was your inspiration? Our inspiration comes from the Ayurvedic ways on treating the body and mind. Ayurvedic health means to balance the body, mind, spirit, and social wellbeing. This is what inspires us and we focus on combining emotional and physical well-being in our product range and whole ethos. Tell us about your products We started our range with just 6 candles and 6 atmosphere mists. Now we have a pillow mist which is our best seller, bath salt blends, body oils and body scrubs. We make all our products in small batches using clean, natural ingredients. Why do you love natural and clean beauty? Plants have everything we need to have great skin, balance emotions and provide a wholesome diet. We really don't need all these extra chemicals or animal products in our lives, so try to live as chemical-free as possible in a world full of pollution and hidden chemicals in food etc. What do you do to relax and unwind? We love to hang out on the south coast and will be relocating soon! What's your favourite natural remedy? We recently made a balm, just for our house hold made with eucalyptus and rosemary. This blend is a great remedy, especially for aches and pains. Thanks to Clare to talking time to chat to us!
