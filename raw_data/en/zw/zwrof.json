Welcome to the Eastern Region - Northeast Area Our only role as representatives for the Northeast area of the Anthroposophical Society is to support the life of anthroposophy in New England. We aspire to connect members and friends of anthroposophy with the many initiatives taking place in our area and to encourage you to take part! While we have no legal or administrative duties, we do carry news of the life of anthroposophy in New England to the General Council. In this way, we become part of the larger life of anthroposophy in the United States. We hope that you find what you are looking for here. Many study groups are meeting throughout New England. Please contact your state representative to learn where they are.
