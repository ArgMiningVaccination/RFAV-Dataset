EDF Renewables is already one of the UK and Ireland's leading renewable energy companies, developing, building, operating and maintaining innovative wind, solar and battery storage projects. Working closely with our R&D division, we're developing future innovations, including hydrogen technology. We're also investing in decarbonising the UK's transport sector and developing vital power infrastructure for charging electric vehicles. Continuous project growth and environmental protection Our rapidly expanding portfolio of projects spans Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland and includes: - 34 onshore wind farms, including 59 turbines at Dorenell Wind Farm near Dufftown, Scotland - currently our largest European onshore wind farm - Two major offshore wind developments at Neart na Gaoithe, Scotland and Codling Wind Park, Ireland - Our first solar farm of grid-scale at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, - Plans for a major solar farm and battery storage project at Longfield, Essex - A 22-turbine wind farm development at Garn Fach, mid-Wales - A UK-wide pipeline of grid-scale battery storage and electric vehicle charging infrastructure - Pivot Power's Energy Superhub - The world's first integrated approach to decarbonising power, heat and transport for the city of Oxford. Through these ground-breaking projects, our expert team is helping England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales to achieve their ambitious low-carbon targets - and we want to do even more. Accessible and affordable low-carbon clean energy We're passionate about creating a future where clean, low-carbon energy is accessible and affordable for everyone, and we want to do this as quickly as we can. By helping individuals, communities and businesses to become greener, we're playing our part in our shared mission to transform the economy and create new sustainable employment. A huge part of our success is down to the communities we are part of and work closely with. Every EDF Renewables project has a community benefit fund allowing around millions of pounds to be invested every year in projects that local communities care about. EDF Renewables UK is also supporting the next generation. Our apprenticeship scheme is up and running, with our first group of eight apprentices being supported to spend three years at college to learn the practicalities of becoming specialist maintenance technicians for the renewables sector. These roles are fundamental to the success of the business, ensuring that there will be highly skilled members of the team able to keep our assets in great shape and sustain them into the future. EDF Renewables and a green future We believe that clean energy technologies have the potential to power our daily lives: from generating and storing low-carbon electricity to heating and lighting our homes or travelling to work by electric bus or car. At EDF Renewables UK and Ireland, we want to make renewable energy accessible and affordable for everyone, and we want to do it soon by building a business that attracts and retains the best talent. We know that we can do it, but we know that it will not be easy. We'll have to disrupt the status quo and act with pace - but we're up to the challenge. By working across our teams and in partnership with communities, suppliers, businesses and public sector agencies we can help tackle some of today's key challenges, such as energy security and energy price certainty. With our range of renewable energy projects, we can provide a range of cost-effective and tailor-made solutions, such as power purchase agreements. By finding and delivering the right projects, we will not only grow our business but will also help the UK and Ireland stay at the forefront of the energy revolution. "}
