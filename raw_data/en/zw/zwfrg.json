On February 20, The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/measles-outbreak.html) that the number of measles cases in the United States has soared to more than 120. This report comes just days after the wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Bill Shine ranted against vaccinations in a [series of tweets](https://twitter.com/DarlaShine/status/1095679791154581506). Despite [eradicating](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) a number of diseases, particularly the [Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html) -- has come under fire in the past several decades. In 1998, when measles was all but eradicated in the United States, former doctor Andrew Wakefield published a study in The Lancet linking autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to the MMR vaccine. The study was eventually retracted and its claims roundly debunked, but sadly, the myths persist: One [2016 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869767/) found that a primary reason parents refuse to vaccinate their children is a fear of \"autism, brain damage, or behavioral problems\" as a side effect of the vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, serious side effects from any vaccine are [extremely rare](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm). So why, then, do people continue to not vaccinate? Social scientists say that cognitive biases are to blame. \"From a psychological perspective, parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are likely falling victim to several errors in thinking, or cognitive biases,\" says Dr. Rachelle M. Smith, Chair of Social Sciences and Associate Professor of Psychology at Husson University in Bangor, ME. \"Cognitive biases frequently occur when an individual doesn't have enough information or has strong emotions related to a complex decision.\" The subject of vaccines involves complex medical science, so the mechanism of how they work and what's in them can be hard for a layperson to understand. Additionally, because public safety is involved (particularly the safety of children, who are more vulnerable to disease), strong emotions abound. As a result, people are likely to fall prey to a number of cognitive biases when deciding whether or not to vaccinate. Here are just five examples. 1. Cognitive dissonance. \"Cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual has conflicting thoughts or behavior. To ease the discomfort, the individual either needs to change the behavior or change the belief,\" says Smith. For a parent who hears about the efficacy of vaccines but also worries they may harm their child, they may decide that vaccines don't work in order to eliminate the dissonance. \"Though these conclusions are incorrect, choosing to believe them makes parents feel better about their choices to not vaccinate,\" says Smith. 2) Omission bias. \"One interesting bias I've come upon is the omission bias,\" says Dr. Nidhi Ghildayal, researcher and PhD in Public Health at the University of Minnesota. In regard to vaccines, the omission bias occurs when \"parents believe that the act of vaccinating, which they may have heard has a small chance of [side effects], is worse than simply not committing any action, even if the potential consequences of this non-action pose a significantly higher risk.\" In other words, not vaccinating can feel safer because it's an inaction - even though the risks involved in that inaction are greater. 3) Confirmation bias. Parents who choose not to vaccinate may also rely on confirmation bias to justify their decision, says Smith. \"Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret or focus on information which supports our existing beliefs,\" she says. Although everyone falls victim to confirmation bias some of the time, parents who choose not to vaccinate \"frequently turn a blind eye to the copious research and evidence that shows the necessity of vaccines, and instead focus on any evidence that supports what they believe in order to feel better about their decision,\" Smith says. 4) Availability heuristic. \"The availability heuristic is another common cognitive bias in which individuals tend towards remembering or rehashing rare or distant instances in which vaccines have failed, as opposed to understanding and retaining all the instances in which vaccines have worked and prevented illness,\" Ghildayal says. \"Media and social circles are much more likely to bring up these rare occurrences, so an individual is much more likely to have those cases in the front of their mind.\" 5) Illusory correlation. The illusory correlation is a belief that a relationship exists between two variables when in reality, it probably doesn't. \"Parents may choose to believe that children who show symptoms of autism have been influenced by vaccinations, since the symptoms and the vaccinations tend to occur around the same time,\" says Smith, even though the connection between autism and vaccinations has been debunked. \"A preconceived belief about the connection between vaccination and autism leads parents to use any incidence where autism and vaccination co-occur to confirm their bias and to support their choice to not vaccinate.\" For more information on vaccines and public "}
