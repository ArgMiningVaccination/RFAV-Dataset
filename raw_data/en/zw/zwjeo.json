According to a Jan. 23 Health Advisory issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"no source case for the outbreak has been identified.\"(2) Demonizing of Parents and Their Children The U.S. has a population of more than 320 million people and 38 million people live in California, so it is curious why a handful of measles cases prompted one California newspaper to quickly place blame on parents making informed vaccine choices, calling them \"ignorant\" and engaged in a \"self-absorbed rejection of science.\"(3) Astroturfers(4) and trolls(5,6) saw that kind of talk as a green light to do more of it on public comment boards, suggesting that children with vaccine-related brain injuries are genetic mutants and calling mothers of vaccine injured children \"liars\" and \"witches.\"(7) Pediatrician Leads Blame and Shame Game Dr. James Cherry,(8) a prominent UCLA pediatrician and infectious disease \"expert\", publicly joined in the blame and shame game, hurling insults at parents declining to give children every one of the government recommended 69 doses of 16 vaccines, including two MMR shots. Dr. Cherry said, \"There are some pretty dumb people out there,\"(9) and \"Some people are just terribly selfish.\"(10) Name-calling is a convenient way to deflect attention from inconvenient truths about vaccine failures and the dissolving myth of vaccine acquired herd immunity.(11) A Very Highly Vaccinated U.S. Population Case in point: there were 644 cases of measles reported in America in 2014,(12) even though 95 percent of children entering kindergarten(13) have gotten two doses of MMR vaccine, which is also true for 92 percent of school children ages 13 to 17 years.(14) Plus, less than one percent of children under age three are completely unvaccinated and 92 percent of them have gotten one or more MMR shots.(15) In some states, the MMR vaccination rate is approaching 100 percent.(16) According to Dr. Cherry, measles vaccine acquired herd immunity is in effect with a measles vaccination rate of more than 90 percent.(17) Well, that has been true in America since 1981 with one dose of MMR vaccine(18) and since 2000 for two doses of MMR vaccine, which is one reason why the CDC declared measles eradicated from the U.S. in 2000.(19) But, clearly, measles virus has not been eradicated from the U.S., just like measles has not been eradicated from any other country and emerging scientific evidence suggests it never will be\u2014no matter how many doses of MMR vaccine are mandated for every man, woman and child in the world.(20,21,22,23) Flu Shots That Don't Work Perhaps public health officials would prefer that the media and the public focus on a handful of measles cases at Disneyland and not focus on the fact that millions of Americans have gotten flu shots that don't work and health care workers are being fired if they don't get flu shots that don't work.(24,25) If you got a flu shot this year, it will do absolutely nothing to protect you from the influenza strain making most people sick.(26,27,28) Worse, scientists have confirmed that the more often you get an annual flu shot, the less effective it is! (29,30) How many vaccinated people are attending schools, going to grocery stores, and working in hospitals and doctors' offices without a clue they are infected with and shedding and transmitting influenza virus because they only have mild flu symptoms or no symptoms at all?(31,32) And it is anybody's guess how many children are getting sick after live virus influenza vaccine is sprayed up their noses(33) or are shedding vaccine strain live virus that could make other people sick.(34,35) Pertussis Vaccine Failing The pertussis vaccine is failing, too.(36,37) Like measles, in recent years there have been huge increases in reports of B. pertussis whooping cough among children and adults in California and other states, and many of those people have been vaccinated.(38,39) That was true for pertussis outbreaks in the U.S. 30 years ago, too.(40,41) Now public health officials are finally admitting the truth that many scientists have been publishing for a long time: you can be fully vaccinated for pertussis, get infected and show atypical or no symptoms and spread whooping cough to vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.(42,43,44) In fact, Dr. Cherry himself admits that there are millions of undiagnosed B. pertussis whooping cough cases every year in America,(45) even though 95 percent or more of America's school children have gotten multiple doses of pertussis containing vaccinations.(46) In 2013, Dr. Cherry wrote, \"Neither B. pertussis infection or pertussis vaccination elicit long-lasting immunity. Infection and illness repeatedly occur in all ages throughout life.\"(47) So much for the myth of pertussis vaccine acquired herd immunity.(48) Measles Vaccine Failing It isn't very scientific to blame pertussis or influenza outbreaks on unvaccinated people. And it isn't very scientific to blame measles outbreaks on unvaccinated people, either. In some outbreaks of measles in California last year, nearly 20 percent of the people had been vaccinated.(49) The CDC says that 12 percent of the measles cases associated with Disneyland were vaccinated, some of them with at least two doses of MMR vaccine.(50) Measles' vaccine acquired herd immunity is a dissolving myth, too.(51,52,53) Public health doctors are scrambling to explain leaks in measles vaccine immunity(54,55) and have come up with this lame excuse: they say they just discovered that one measles vaccinated adult in 10 is now susceptible to measles because vaccine immunity wears off.(56) They call it \"waning immunity.\"(57) More MMR Shots Coming? Now get ready for the sucker punch: Dr. Cherry told a TV network last week that the solution to waning measles vaccine immunity is to \"give additional doses\" of MMR vaccine to adults.(58,59) That's right. Let's just mandate more MMR shots for millions of Americans and make Merck's stockholders really happy.(60) But who is Dr. Cherry kidding? We all know that adults are way too hard to pin down - unless you threaten them with loss of a job or medical care or put them in prison\u2014so I predict that the third MMR shot will more likely target high school students and people trying to get a college education.(61) Dr. Cherry's solution to reported measles cases at Disneyland reminds me of when doctors told parents in 1990 that they didn't realize one dose of MMR vaccine would fail to provide lifelong immunity after all, so kids are going to have to get a second dose of MMR.(62) Inconvenient Scientific Truths About Measles Vaccine The inconvenient scientific truth about measles in Disneyland and around the world is that public health doctors do not know how many vaccinated people can be infected with measles, show few or no symptoms and transmit measles to other people.(63) Government health officials do not conduct routine active surveillance of vaccinated people to find out if they are experiencing asymptomatic or atypical measles and transmitting it to others. In addition, there are published studies demonstrating that people given live virus measles vaccine can be infected with vaccine strain measles virus and shed vaccine strain measles virus.(64,65,66) Health officials do not conduct routine active surveillance of people getting live MMR vaccine to monitor for vaccine strain measles virus infection, shedding and the potential for transmission. Using Disneyland to Move the Goalposts The hype about 51 cases of measles reportedly linked to Disneyland(73) has more to do with covering up vaccine failures and propping up the dissolving myth of vaccine acquired herd immunity than it does about protecting the public health. It has a lot to do with defensive doctors trying to blame a minority of parents who are refusing to place irrational faith in them and their moving goal posts,(74) and are choosing instead to think and act rationally.(75) That third MMR shot is coming to America and so is a massive Pharma-led lobby attempt to demonize and punish(76,77) all Americans who defend the human right to exercise informed consent to medical risk-taking, including vaccine risk-taking.(78) The calls to strike down those who do not use every dose of the growing list of government-mandated vaccines, is on a fast track.(79,80) It will include banning the unvaccinated from exercising the right to get a public education, medical care,(81) employment, and many other human and civil rights. Americans Have a Choice to Make The battle lines are clearly drawn. Now Americans have a choice to make: will we stand up and fight to protect our human right to make voluntary decisions about which vaccines we buy and use, or will we permit liability free drug companies and government health officials to take that freedom from us?(82) Go to [NVICAdvocacy.org](https://nvicadvocacy.org/) < [http://www.nvicadvocacy.org](http://www.nvicadvocacy.org/)/> and learn how you can take action to protect vaccine exemptions in your state. Learn more about the risks and complications of measles and measles vaccine on [NVIC.org](https://nvic.org/). And if you or your child has been vaccinated and the vaccine failed to protect you or caused harm, you can make a report to NVIC < [http://www.nvic.org/reporting-systems.aspx](http://www.nvic.org/reporting-systems.aspx)> and share your experience with others on [NVIC.org](https://nvic.org/) < [http://nvic.org](http://nvic.org/)/>. It's your health. Your family. Your choice. Protect Your Right to Informed Consent and Defend Vaccine Exemptions With all the uncertainty surrounding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, it's critical to protect your right to make independent health choices and exercise voluntary informed consent to vaccination. It is urgent that everyone in America stand up and fight to protect and expand vaccine informed consent protections in state public health and employment laws. The best way to do this is to get personally involved with your state legislators and educating the leaders in your community. THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY. National vaccine policy recommendations are made at the federal level but vaccine laws are made at the state level. It is at the state level where your action to protect your vaccine choice rights can have the greatest impact. It is critical for EVERYONE to get involved now in standing up for the legal right to make voluntary vaccine choices in America because those choices are being threatened by lobbyists representing drug companies, medical trade associations, and public health officials, who are trying to persuade legislators to strip all vaccine exemptions from public health laws. Signing up for NVIC's free Advocacy Portal at [www.NVICAdvocacy.org](https://www.nvicadvocacy.org/) gives you immediate, easy access to your own state legislators on your Smart Phone or computer so you can make your voice heard. You will be kept up-to-date on the latest state bills threatening your vaccine choice rights and get practical, useful information to help you become an effective vaccine choice advocate in your own community. Also, when national vaccine issues come up, you will have the up-to-date information and call to action items you need at your fingertips. So please, as your first step, sign up for the NVIC Advocacy Portal < [http://nvicadvocacy.org/members/Home.aspx](http://nvicadvocacy.org/members/Home.aspx)>. Share Your Story with the Media and People You Know If you or a family member has suffered a serious vaccine reaction, injury, or death, please talk about it. If we don't share information and experiences with one another, everybody feels alone and afraid to speak up. Write a letter to the editor if you have a different perspective on a vaccine story that appears in your local newspaper. Make a call in to a radio talk show that is only presenting one side of the vaccine story. I must be frank with you; you have to be brave because you might be strongly criticized for daring to talk about the \"other side\" of the vaccine story. Be prepared for it and have the courage to not back down. Only by sharing our perspective and what we know to be true about vaccination will the public conversation about vaccination open up so people are not afraid to talk about it. We cannot allow the drug companies and medical trade associations funded by drug companies or public health officials promoting forced use of a growing list of vaccines to dominate the conversation about vaccination. The vaccine injured cannot be swept under the carpet and treated like nothing more than \"statistically acceptable collateral damage\" of national one-size-fits-all mandatory vaccination policies that put way too many people at risk for injury and death. We shouldn't be treating people like guinea pigs instead of human beings. Internet Resources Where You Can Learn More I encourage you to visit the website of the non-profit charity, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), at [www.NVIC.org](https://www.nvic.org/) < [http://www.nvic.org](http://www.nvic.org/)/>: NVIC Memorial for Vaccine Victims < [http://www.nvic.org/Vaccine-Memorial.aspx](http://www.nvic.org/Vaccine-Memorial.aspx)>: View descriptions and photos of children and adults, who have suffered vaccine reactions, injuries, and deaths.

Vaccine Freedom Wall < [http://www.nvic.org/Forms/Cry-For-Vaccine-Freedom-Wall.aspx](http://www.nvic.org/Forms/Cry-For-Vaccine-Freedom-Wall.aspx)>: View or post descriptions of harassment and sanctions by doctors, employers, and school and health officials for making independent vaccine choices. Connect with Your Doctor or Find a New One That Will Listen and Care If your pediatrician or doctor refuses to provide medical care to you or your child unless you agree to get vaccines you don't want, I strongly encourage you to have the courage to find another doctor. Harassment, intimidation, and refusal of medical care is becoming the modus operandi of the medical establishment in an effort to stop the change in attitude of many parents about vaccinations after they become truly educated about health and vaccination. However, there is hope. At least 15 percent of young doctors recently polled admit that they're starting to adopt a more individualized approach to vaccinations in direct response to the vaccine safety concerns of parents. It is good news that there is a growing number of smart young doctors, who prefer to work as partners with parents in making personalized vaccine decisions for children, including delaying vaccinations or giving children fewer vaccines on the same day or continuing to provide medical care for those families, who decline use of one or more vaccines. So take the time to locate a doctor, who treats you with compassion and respect and is willing to work with you to do what is right for your child. 1 Xia R, Lin RG.
