And with good reason \u2014 they can be used to make homemade cleaning and beauty products, to naturally scent your home or laundry, and even for natural remedies. But is it possible to find excellent quality essential oils for affordable prices? Yes, you can get top-notch essential oils without breaking the bank! Today I'm sharing the 6 best brands for affordable essential oils in 2023 and what makes them worth recommending. This post may contain affiliate links. If you click one of them, I may receive compensation at no additional cost to you. Please see my full [disclaimer](https://saraheverafter.com/disclaimer/) for more information. Does It Really Matter Which Brand of Essential Oil You Choose? When I first started buying essential oils, I literally just went on Amazon and chose oils that were inexpensive and seemed to have decent reviews. I didn't really know what I was doing and I ended up buying from companies that I've since learned have reputations for selling oils tainted with synthetic ingredients. Yikes! These days I'm much choosier about the oils I use. I now know that it's important to have respect for the potency of essential oils and be sure that you're using good quality oils and [understand how to use them safely](https://saraheverafter.com/essential-oil-safety/). Should You Buy Cheap Essential Oils? Most of us enjoy getting a good deal and saving money. So it can be tempting to choose the cheapest essential oils we can find. But here are a couple of important things to keep in mind: First, many companies have tried to cash in on the popularity of essential oils by providing sub-par quality oils or synthetic oils at much lower prices, without informing the consumer about what they're doing. Some of the synthetics and residues that may be included in lesser-quality oils not only dilute the effectiveness of the oils, but can even be harmful! Since you're using oils to improve your health and well-being, you don't want to risk doing the opposite just to save a little money. Additionally, if you find cheap essential oils (even from a good brand) at a discount store, it's important to know that essential oils do [have a shelf life](https://www.aromaweb.com/articles/essentialoilshelflife.asp). They can also break down more quickly if they're not stored properly. When you purchase directly from a reputable supplier, they can provide information such as the date of distillation so you know how fresh the oils are. You can also have confidence that they have stored the oils in optimal conditions. But when you purchase from a discount store or grocery store or Amazon means you're taking a chance on purchasing oils that have lost their efficacy or have even gone bad. So yes, the truth is that it really does matter which brand of oils you choose to buy! What to Look for In an Essential Oil Brand This doesn't mean that you have to purchase the most expensive oils in order to get good quality, it just means you need to be discerning about the brand you purchase from. So how can you figure out which brands are on the up-and-up? I've listed some great options below, but first let's talk about some of the characteristics you want to look for. Why Are Some Essential Oil Brands So Expensive? Some of the most popular essential oils companies out there \u2014 such as DoTerra and Young Living \u2014 offer oils that seem to be priced much more highly than other options. Why is that? Well, for one thing, they are Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) companies. This impacts you as the consumer because their prices are going to reflect the fact that many levels of sellers (plus the parent company) need to earn a profit from their sale. You may opt to purchase from one of these brands because you love their oils and blends or other products, just know that there are other options for good quality oils. Purchasing from a reputable non-MLM essential oil company directly means much less of a markup \u2014 aka, much more affordable oils. So don't feel that you have to pay the highest prices to get great quality oils! By ordering from a company directly, with no middleman, you can get a great balance of quality and pricing. Purity and Quality Testing The best brands are transparent about where their oils are sourced from, how they're distilled, and what the results of their quality testing are. There are so many brands out there that offer their Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) results online right from their sales pages that any brand that doesn't make their quality testing results readily available should make you think twice. Sustainable and Traceable Sourcing Does the brand make known where they are sourcing their oils from? Do they farm the plants themselves? What type of quality testing do they do if they're purchasing the raw materials from elsewhere? The raw ingredients make a difference in the quality of the essential oil, so a company that is transparent and ethical about their sourcing is a good sign. Each oil description should include the latin name of the plant, the country of origin, which part of the plant the oil was extracted from, and the method of extraction. Manufacturing Methods and Other Certifications Is the company transparent about how they prepare their oils? What methods do they use? Some methods may leave traces of other chemicals in the oil, so this is important to know! It's a really good sign when a company goes to the lengths necessary to meet third-party standards such as [Good Manufacturing Process (GMP)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/pharmaceutical-quality-resources/current-good-manufacturing-practice-cgmp-regulations) Certification. And if you're interested in supporting brands that use ethical and sustainable practices, look for certifications such as [FairTrade](https://www.fairtradeamerica.org/the-standards/) or [Leaping Bunny](https://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/what-we-do/corporate-partnerships/leaping-bunny-programme). If they claim to offer organic oils, those oils should always be [USDA Certified Organic](https://www.usda.gov/topics/organic). Education Just because essential oils are \"natural\" does NOT mean you can throw caution to the wind when using them! These are potent extracts and using them improperly can be harmful. It's so important to educate yourself about how to use each oil safely. You need to understand the dilution rate for each specific oil, whether it's safe to use with children or when pregnant or breastfeeding, whether it can be safely used topically, and so on. Good essential oil companies make it easy for you to find safety and usage information, both on their labeling and as you're shopping their website. That being said \u2014 I also highly recommend that you always do your own research about the safety of the oils you're using to make sure that you are using them in a way that is safe and effective for you and your family! You can learn more about [good sources of essential oil safety information in this post](https://saraheverafter.com/essential-oil-safety/). Pricing Variations You get what you pay for \u2014 that's as true of essential oils as it is of anything else. So an essential oil that costs considerably less than anything else on the market is a warning sign. So is a brand that offers all of its oils at the same price. Some plants are more plentiful and easier to harvest than others, and the prices of various oils should reflect these variations. On the other hand, you don't have to pay exorbitant prices to get great quality oils. A lot depends on the type of company you're ordering from. The Best Affordable Essential Oil Brands of 2023 So what brands will give you the best balance of quality and pricing, while also adding in transparency, ethical practices, and consumer education? Below you'll find six affordable essential oil brands to check out this year! 1. Plant Therapy So far I have ordered most of my oils through Plant Therapy. I first discovered their oils on Amazon, but I've since come to prefer purchasing directly from their website. Here's why: - Quality \u2014 Plant Therapy is transparent about the third-party quality testing of their oils \u2014 you can view their GC/MS results for each oil as you're shopping. (See the photo below for where to find this info as you're shopping.) They also have both [GMP and Leaping Bunny certification](https://www.planttherapy.com/why-plant-therapy), and their organic oils are certified USDA Organic. - Pricing \u2014 I feel their prices are very reasonable. They match the quality of the oils (eg, Rose Otto costs more than Lavender) but without the added costs you find with MLMs. And if you order through their website, they offer free shipping (no order minimum required!) and they have a rewards program called PT Perqs that allows you to earn credit toward future purchases. They also run frequent sales and deals that you can take advantage of. - Selection \u2014 Plant Therapy offers a wide range of individual oils and blends, plus products like lotions, candles, cleaning products, diffusers, diy ingredients, and more. - Special lines for kids, pets, etc... \u2014 Plant Therapy offers a range of KidSafe oils \u2014 so if an oil doesn't have that rating, you know to think twice before using it on or around your children! I especially like that they include a KidSafe logo right on the bottles of oils considered safe for children and that the oils that are in their KidSafe line actually come with white tops, rather than black, making it easy to find them in your collection. They also have Pup & Pony safe oils for those looking to use oils on their dogs or horses. - Education \u2014 Maybe my favorite thing about Plant Therapy is the emphasis they put on educating consumers about how to use oils safely. They provide so much useful education right at your finger tips as you're shopping for oils! For example, they make a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) Report available for each oil. They also offer a Product Sheet with dilution and usage information for many of their oils. And the labels on their actual bottles also provide detailed dilution rate information. You can also check out [their blog](https://blog.planttherapy.com/blog/), with tons of informative information, and [their Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/planttherapy/), where they do regular live videos to educate followers about using essential oils. I think you can see why I've been so happy ordering my oils through Plant Therapy! They also have excellent customer service. I recently had trouble placing an order and their rep solved the problem so quickly \u2014 even though it was a Sunday and I wasn't expecting a response until the next day! I'm not an affiliate for any of the companies mentioned in this post, but I do have a refer-a-friend code from Plant Therapy that they give all their customers. If you want to give them a try and save a little money, [you can click here to get $10 off your first order of $25 or more!](http://rwrd.io/7j8qsvm) 2. REVIVE Essential Oils REVIVE is the other company I've been enjoying ordering oils from lately, especially some of their blends. REVIVE is a newer company, but they are dedicated to offering high-quality oils at a reasonable price point. - Quality \u2014 REVIVE's oils are all either from plants that are organic or were grown in the wild. So every single oil on their site is pesticide free! They offer transparent GC/MS test results and you can email them a specific lot number from a bottle to receive the results for that specific bottle. Their third-party testing is done by Dr. Pappas and his company Essential Oil University. Dr. Pappas is well-known as a chemist with decades of experience testing essential oils, so that provides a lot of confidence in the quality of REVIVE's oils. - Pricing \u2014 I find REVIVE's pricing to be very reasonable, comparable to PT's. Again, the prices vary depending on the preciousness of the oil you're purchasing, which is always a good sign. They offer free shipping on all orders in the US and Canada and they have a 100-day hassle free return policy. They also run regular sales and specials, but they do not have a rewards program at this time. - Selection \u2014 REVIVE has a wide selection of single oils and blends, plus diffusers and diy ingredients, products like hand soaps and sanitizers, and more. If you are switching from one of the big MLM brands, they also have a [handy comparison page](https://www.revive-eo.com/compare-blends/)where you can find their version of popular DOTERRA and Young Living blends. - Special lines for kids, pets, etc... \u2014 REVIVE does not currently have a separate line for children or pets and they do not include this information on their labels, which I think is one thing they could improve on. - Education \u2014 REVIVE does offer basic usage and safety information as you're shopping for each oil, but I don't feel it is an thorough as what PT offers. [Their blog](https://www.revive-eo.com/blog/)has lots of helpful articles and information though! Overall, I am super impressed with REVIVE's quality and pricing, and since I always do my own safety and usage research anyway, I'm not too bothered that they don't always offer as much of this information as I'd like. They also have some blends that sound amazing. (Like Tumble & Tidy to use on [wool dryer balls](https://saraheverafter.com/essential-oils-and-wool-dryer-balls/), Copaiba & Coffee for a coffee shop vibe at home, and Into the Woods for a breath of fresh air.) They are also known for having amazing customer service. And \u2014 this is a small point \u2014 but I love their sleek packaging. [You can learn more about REVIVE here.](http://www.revive-eo.com) 3. Aromatics International The best thing about Aromatics International is that their oils are sourced for professional aromatherapists. Aromatics International is connected to the Aromahead Institute, which is a respected online school for aromatherapists to receive education that will allow them to become certified. While their prices are a little higher than some of the other choices listed here, your can't beat their quality. - Quality \u2014 Again, because AI is sourcing oils for aromatherapists, they place an emphasis on quality. They only source oils that have been extracted from plants that have not been sprayed or treated with any chemicals and rigorously tested. And you can easily access the GC/MS reports for each batch of their oils as you're shopping. - Pricing \u2014 AI's prices are slightly higher than what you'll find from Plant Therapy or REVIVE, however I think this is a fair reflection of their commitment to sourcing the best oils for professional aromatherapists. They offer free shipping on orders of $35 or more and they have a great rewards program too. - Selection \u2014 Their selection of single oils and blends is excellent \u2014 there are a few singles that I haven't found through other companies. They also offer hydrosols, carrier oils, diffusers, and supply kits for students entering Aromahead's aromatherapy programs. - Special lines for kids, pets, etc... \u2014 While AI doesn't offer special lines for children or pets, they do provide comprehensive information about usage and dilution as you're shopping, with details about whether an oil is appropriate for children and at what dilution rate. - Education \u2014 As you can see from the screenshot above, AI shares detailed safety and usage as you're shopping. They quote [Tisserand and Young's Essential Oil Safety book](https://amzn.to/3drV7f1), which is considered the top-notch source of safety information about oils. I especially appreciate that they include details other companies do not \u2014 such as contraindications for certain medical conditions or medications. They also have amazing articles on their [blog](https://www.aromatics.com/blogs/wellness/), informative [Learning Guides](https://www.aromatics.com/pages/learning-guides), and if you really want to learn about essential oils, you can take the [free course through Aromahead](https://courses.aromahead.com/introduction-to-essential-oils). I haven't ordered through Aromatics International yet, but they are at the top of my wishlist. I especially would like to try their hydrosols, which come in glass spray bottles rather than plastic. And they have a couple of single oils that I haven't been able to find through Plant Therapy or REVIVE thus far. [Learn more about Aromatics International on their website here.](https://www.aromatics.com/) Honorable Mentions The three brands listed above are my top recommendations for essential oils because of their blend of quality, transparency, pricing, and education. However, there are a few more brands that I think are worth at least a mention: 4. Edens Garden If you are looking for a woman- or family-owned essential oil business to support, check out Edens Garden! - Quality \u2014 Their oils are sustainably and ethically sourced and they share transparent GC/MS test results. They offer what's called the EDENS pledge, which stands for their determination to be: Effective, Dedicated, Educated, Natural, and Safe. - Pricing \u2014 Their prices are comparable to PT's and they offer free shipping (!) on all orders in the US. They also have a nice rewards program you can take advantage of. - Selection \u2014 Edens Garden has a wide selection of single oils, but they are better known for their synergy blends, of which they have many! They also offer diffusers, some products for home and body, and other accessories. - Special lines for kids, pets, etc... \u2014 Edens Garden offers an \"Ok for Kids\" line of oils. This makes it easy to find both single oils that are considered safe to use with children age 2 and over, as well as a line of blends specifically designed for children. They also place an Ok for Kids logo right on these oil bottles. - Education \u2014 One thing I really like about EG is how much information they provide as you're shopping. For example, you can see below how much safety and usage information they provide for their Basil Essential Oil. I think Edens Garden could be another great place to start if you're new to essential oils, especially because they provide so much education as you shop. [Check out Edens Garden oils right here.](http://www.edensgarden.com) 5. Jade Bloom Essential Oils Jade Bloom was founded by a group of naturalists dedicated to making quality essential oils available at the lowest possible prices. - Quality \u2014 Jade Bloom sources pure essential oils from organic or wild-crafted sources around the world. They have a tool that allows you to enter the batch number located on the bottom of each bottle to see the GC-MS report and COA (Certificate of Analysis) for that specific batch of oil. - Pricing \u2014 True to their stated mission, Jade Bloom's pricing is reasonable and it accurately reflects the difference in value between various oils. They have a rewards program you can take advantage of, free returns with the first 120 days after your purchase, and free shipping for orders over $35. - Selection \u2014 Jade Bloom's selection is quite good, with both single oils and blends, plus personal care products like shampoo, deodorant, and more. - Special lines for kids, pets, etc... \u2014 Jade Bloom offers a Sensitivity Line of prediluted blends they say are suitable for children, the elderly, or anyone with particularly sensitive skin. - Education \u2014 They do offer some basic usage and safety information as you are shopping, although again, not as much as with PT. However, the cool thing that Jade Bloom offers is what they call [Jade Bloom University](https://university.jadebloom.com/). This is a free online course about essential oils that you can take to earn rewards points worth up to $32 to spend toward their products! NOTE: I will say that I didn't agree with all of the information shared in the course \u2014 they recommend internal use with some of the oils which is something I personally am no longer comfortable with. But I did appreciate learning more about the characteristics of various oils! I think you will find their pricing reasonable and you can save a little extra if you put the time into taking the JBU class! 6. Rocky Mountain Oils Another great option for affordable essential oils is Rocky Mountain Oils. One thing I really like about this company is that they are [switching over to recycled materials packaging and that they recycle their used glass bottles](https://www.rockymountainoils.com/environmental-sustainability/) \u2014 and will even recycle yours for you if you send them in. (Even if they're from a different brand!) - Quality \u2014 RMo offers transparent GC/MS testing results and mark each bottle so that you can easily look up the specific results for the oil you have purchased. - Pricing \u2014 Their prices are reasonable, although maybe slightly higher than the companies listed above. But they do have a 90-day no-hassle return policy and they offer free shipping on orders over $25 for customers in the US. They also have an \"Oilty Club\" that allows you to earn points toward future purchases. - Selection \u2014 RMO has a wide range of single oils and blends and they also offer diffusers, a personal care line, and more. They also make it easy to find dupes for blends from DoTerra and Young Living on their [comparison page here](https://www.rockymountainoils.com/compare.html). - Special lines for kids, pets, etc... \u2014 I like that they have an RMO Kids line that is more highly diluted and suitable for children and that each roller is labelled as such. - Education \u2014 RMO offers some safety and usage information for each oil, but still not as detailed as PT's. (Can you tell why I'm such a fan of PT?!) You can also find some good articles [on their blog](https://www.rockymountainoils.com/learn/). I haven't personally tried RMO, but I know a lot of people are big fans and I wanted to share them as an option for affordable oils! [Give Rocky Mountain Oils a try here!](https://www.rockymountainoils.com/) Which Affordable Essential Oil Brand Will You Try First?
