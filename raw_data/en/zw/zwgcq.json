It recognizes that our thoughts, emotions, and memories are not confined to the mind alone, but are also stored and expressed in our bodies and nervous systems. Drawing on research on the hierarchy between emotion, cognition, and behaviour this approach emphasizes the significant impact our automatic biological responses have on our emotional and physiological regulation and how this affects our cognition, emotion, and behaviour (Selvam, 2022). Understanding the role of the autonomic nervous system plays in trauma, these therapies address difficulties through the concept of titration to avoid setbacks or re-traumatization. As Payne, Levine & Crane-Godreau (2015, p. 10) write, \"trauma must be approached very slowly, \"drop by drop,\" so as to avoid unnecessary distress, flooding and potential re-traumatization.\". Somatic psychotherapy has a great focus on identifying and building resources and promoting resiliency in individuals as it explains that getting in touch with a sense of embodied inner safety is a crucial first step towards restoration of balance in the nervous system, or 'trauma healing' (Porges, 2017; Levine, 2015). Distinction between abstract mental states of positive feelings and embodied feeling states is important, and as such slowing down and taking time to feel into, and abide in, the positive sensations is crucial as this allows the nervous system to begin to regulate and the body to experience safety again. Trauma, which in this definition is any event that overwhelms our capacity to cope with life and which leaves lasting impacts on our physical, emotional, and mental well-being, is a core area of focus in somatic psychotherapy. Symptoms such as chronic back issues, migraines, chronic anxiety, anger, and depression have been addressed through these approaches (Mat\u00e9, 2022; Selvam, 2022; Levine, 2015; Van der Kolk, 2014). Mindfulness Meditation Mindfulness meditation, a practice that emphasizes non-judgmental attention to our experiences, can play a crucial role in promoting our well-being. By focusing on the breath, bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions, mindfulness meditation trains the mind to be present and aware, free from being entangled in the drama and pain of automatic thoughts, emotions, and judgments (Kornfield, 2012; Epstein, 1996). These practices also encourage the questioning of thoughts and beliefs, enabling individuals to move towards inner freedom from feeling stuck and/or rigid (Katie, 2018; Smernoff, Mitnik, Kolodner, Lev-Ari, 2015). Research supports the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in managing stress, anxiety, and chronic pain (Kabatt-Zinn, 2017). By cultivating awareness of thoughts and emotions and responding to stressors in a calm and centred manner, one may develop their capacity for compassion towards themselves and others. Mindfulness meditation can also help regulate emotions by observing and accepting thoughts and feelings without judgments or immediate reactions. Additionally, by observing thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations without judgment, individuals may gain greater insight into their behaviours and thought patterns, fostering personal growth and development (Kornfield, 2012; Epstein, 1996). Furthermore, mindfulness meditation has shown to produce physical health benefits such as reducing blood pressure and improving sleep quality (Kabatt-Zinn, 2017). The Wisdom of the Body Our bodies are not mere vessels, and they hold invaluable information and wisdom that is deeply intertwined with our emotions, thinking, and intuition (Selvam, 2022; Levine, 2015). Our nervous systems and bodies store the history of our experiences, including emotions, memories, and traumas. The autonomic nervous system, which oversees our survival responses of fight, flight, or freeze, plays a crucial role in our sense of well-being. Somatic psychotherapy and mindfulness meditation can guide individuals in learning about their triggers, discharging or transforming stuck survival energy, and regulating their nervous systems and emotions with more skill and tact. Paying attention to sensations, feelings, emotions, images, thoughts, memories, and physical reactions allows for insights into emotional and psychological well-being (Kabatt-Zinn, 2017; Kornfield, 2012; Epstein, 1996). For instance, overwhelming anger may be traced back to an unresolved fight response, that in everyday language could be thought of as bottled-up anger, that keeps interfering with our lives. If we have learned to suppress our fight/anger it may over time lead to symptoms such as chronic irritability, frustration or overwhelming and inappropriate (to the situation) levels of anger. As few examples, road rage, sarcasm/passive aggressiveness, chronic irritation of how someone else does not know how to wash the dishes the right way, or chronic frustration about how the neighbour's cat does not know how to keep away from my lawn. By skilfully cultivating a relationship with our bodies and emotions, we can enhance resilience, regulation, and pleasure, leading to a more positive and fulfilling life (Van der Kolk, 2014). Slowing down and feeling safe are essential factors in this process. By learning to find and hang out with our pleasurable, strong, calm, steady, or neutral sensations in our bodies, we are on our way to mastery over our sometimes-chaotic feeling inner environments (Levine, 2015). Taking Control of Our Well-being Realizing that more of our health and well-being is within our control than we might be customed to believe may empower us to make positive changes in our lives. This applies to our physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being (Kabatt-Zinn, 2017; Levine, Kornfield, 2012; Epstein, 1996). It might be good to keep in mind that the state of our wellness and health directly affects our families and communities and through personal growth and work on self, we automatically contribute to the well-being of everything in our environment (Mat\u00e9, 2022). Conclusion Understanding the interconnectedness of the body, brain and mind is crucial for promoting overall well-being. Somatic psychotherapy and mindfulness meditation offer valuable approaches in this regard. Somatic psychotherapy addresses the impact of biology on emotional and physiological regulation, by focusing on restoration of balance and building resources. Mindfulness meditation cultivates present-moment awareness, regulates emotions, and promotes personal growth. By deepening our relationship with our bodies and emotions, we experience increased resilience, regulation, and pleasure, ultimately contributing to a more positive and fulfilling life.
