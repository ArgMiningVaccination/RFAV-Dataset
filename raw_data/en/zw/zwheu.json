I'm Susan, and I welcome you wherever you are at in your life. I work holistically, and can help you to accept yourself with less judgment, learn new methods to find safety and calm within, work through unresolved feelings, and make the changes necessary to be at peace with yourself. Sometimes there is a restlessness inside or symptoms in the mind and body surface because you are needing to get clear about who you are and what your purpose is in this life. I will help you to trust your deepest self. Reach out to me if you're wanting lasting resolution of stress or trauma or seeking spiritual healing. I teach awareness of mind, body, heart & spirit in the healing process. By inviting all parts of the self in our work together, we can get to the root of issues and resolve them to completion. You will have a highly sensitive guide experienced in Mindful Somatic Therapy, Internal Family Systems (parts work), Brainspotting and more. I understand anxiety and trauma from the inside out. Working intuitively through guidance from Holy Spirit allows for spontaneous healing and information to make the process easier and more efficient. When we identify barriers to you moving forward, what could take years in psychotherapy or talk therapy can be reached in much less time.
