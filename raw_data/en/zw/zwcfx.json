Scientifically Proven Research has shown that emerging methods such as mindfulness, stress reduction, EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), and the Relaxation Response are \"evidence-based\" practices for addressing both emotional trauma and physical symptoms. NIIH is dedicated to conducting empirical research in these methods, as well as expanding patient access by fostering their adoption in primary care settings.

Epigenetics is the branch of science describing influences that alter the expression of genes (epi=above; epigenetic=control of DNA from above or outside the gene). NIIH is a leader in applying these methods for better health, happiness and longevity.
