Design/methodology/approach This study conducted content analysis of interviews, online reviews and relevant articles and used the concept of experiencescape to interpret spa hotels' experiential environment. The stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model was used as the basis for introducing authenticity, memorability, organizational identification and revisit intention to investigate how wellness tourism experiencescape affects tourists' behavior. In total, 488 valid questionnaires were collected at Taiwanese spa hotel clusters. Findings Four factors of spa hotel experiencescape were identified: health promotion treats, mental learning, unique travel experience and healthy diet. Existential authenticity-memorability and existential authenticity-organizational identification exerted full positive mediation effects in the relationship between wellness tourism experiencescape and revisit intention. Practical implications This study provides guidance on experience design for spa hotels. It promotes the consideration of existential authenticity in wellness tourism design. Originality/value The COVID-19 pandemic has raised awareness of wellness, drastically increasing the potential of the wellness tourism market. This study investigated the construction of wellness tourism experiencescape and its influence, and the findings can facilitate post-pandemic restoration of the wellness tourism industry. On the basis of SOR model, a chain mediation model was proposed to reveal the influence of wellness tourism experiencescape on revisit intention. Existential authenticity was discovered to play a crucial role in the relationship between wellness tourism experiencescape and revisit intention, which suggests that existential authenticity should be considered during service design and in marketing strategies for wellness tourism.
