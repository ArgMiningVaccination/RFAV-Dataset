The blue book, which reviews the nation's space activities in 2021and in- troduces missionsfor 2022,saidChina's aerospace has entered a new develop - mentphase. Last year saw many highlights on space exploration. China has completed five space station missions, successfully launched the first journey to explore Mars, developed space commerce, and basicallyformedaspaceindustrychain. A total of55launches were carried out, the most in the world throughout the past year. The aggregate weight of spacecraft sent into orbit hit a new re - cord high of 191.19tons, with an in - creaseof85.5percentyear-on-year. China's space industry has also committedtostrengtheninginternation - al exchanges and cooperation, and im - plemented various projects in 2021, in- cluding cooperative research and devel - opment, facility and data sharing, and applicationservice. In2022, China plans to carry out more than50space launches, sending over140spacecrafts, according to the China Aerospace Science Technolo -gyCorporation(CASC).

Relating to its success, many journalists and athletes have already voiced their commentsduringtheGames.Ingeneral, what impressed them most was the use of many cutting-edge technologies, in particular robots. In order to minimize contact among people during the COV - ID-19pandemic, robots were widely used in places like cafeterias and dining areasinsidetheOlympicvillage.

What surprised her most is the machine could even clean up the table after - ward. \"I need one of these at home,\" she wrote. WhyuseRobotsatBeijing 2022? The Olympics should be a global event to allow athletes to perform at their peak, without the pandemic being a disrupting factor. As a key method to contain the pandemic, robots can effec - tively reduce the human workforce and protect people from COVID- 19through lack of contact. In other words, the fewer volunteers working inside the Olympic closed loop, the lower the risk of infection will increase after theGames. \"The [robot] installation comes amidorganizers'effortstominimizethe risk of the Games,\"wroteUSAToday.

Ski jumping is an extreme sport popular among ice and snow lovers all over the world, noted for its long jump distancesandgracefulposture.Andpre -paring for those, the wind in the air is theskijumper'sclosestpartnerintrain - ingandcompetition. Various environmental changes to the wind, and speed of movement for each athlete, especially when the ath - letes are in different flight stages will produce the corresponding law of air moving, which is professionally known asaerodynamiccharacteristics.The use of wind tunnels in aero - space technology can effectively assist ski jumping training. A wind tunnel is anartificialwaytogenerateandcontrol air flow, which is used to simulate the flowofairaroundaircraftorobjects.
