Eating foods that are rich in fiber can help make your stools easier to pass. Fiber is the part of plant material that you cannot digest. Instead, fiber adds bulk to your stool and softens it. In addition to eating fiber-rich foods, drinking more water, herbal teas, and clear soups can help the fiber work better and get your digestive system moving again. This article lists the 10 best foods for constipation and explains how each food can help your digestive system stay regular. Illustration by Laura Porter for Verywell Health Berries Inessa Shustikova / EyeEm / Getty Images Berries are one of the best foods for constipation due to their high fiber and water content. Berries are rich sources of soluble fiber, which forms a gel in your digestive track that adds bulk to your stool and softens it. Berries also contain insoluble fiber in their seeds and skin, which helps food move through the intestines more quickly to prevent constipation. Raspberries are especially good for relieving constipation. Most adults need 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day, and there are eight grams of fiber in one cup of raw raspberries alone. Other berries to eat to prevent and relieve constipation include: BlackberriesBlueberriesStrawberriesCranberries Foods With Soluble vs. Insoluble Fiber Prunes Sanny11 / Getty Images Prunes, a type of plum, are famous for being one of the best foods for constipation. One cup of raw prunes contains more than 12 grams of dietary fiber. On top of that, they also contain a substance called sorbitol, which acts as a natural laxative to prevent and ease constipation. Drinking prune juice is also effective for relieving constipation and is a great alternative to raw prunes if you are unable to find them. Since prune juice can be very high in sugar, make sure to look for juices that have no sugar added. One study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that people with chronic constipation experienced significant relief within three weeks of drinking prune juice each day. Why Prunes Should Be Your Go-to Holiday Snack Veggies Alexander Spatari / Getty Images Eating plenty of colorful vegetables is undoubtedly one of the best ways to relieve constipation. Vegetables are excellent sources of dietary fiber and have other laxative properties that prevent your stools from becoming too hard or difficult to pass. Although it may not seem like it, they also contain lots of water. While eating vegetables raw is ideal, you can still get plenty of fiber and other essential nutrients from vegetables after blanching, steaming, grilling, roasting, and even stir-frying them.

This is one of the best foods for constipation due to its high fiber content. Unlike white rice, which is stripped of its bran and germ during the refining process, unrefined brown rice retains its entire fiber content. One cup of cooked brown rice contains about three grams of fiber. Pair brown rice with some cooked vegetables for a savory, fiber-rich meal. Oats Arx0nt / Getty Images Oats are truly underestimated. In addition to being one of the best foods for constipation, they are a powerhouse of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support gut health. Oats are surprisingly versatile, too. The simplest way to eat them is to make oatmeal, but you can also include oats in casseroles, homemade bread, and even meatballs. One cup of cooked oats contains about four grams of fiber. While shopping for oats, look for whole grain oats, oat groats, and oat bran to get the most fiber content. The Health Benefits of Oats (Avena Sativa) Walnuts Westend61 / Getty Images Walnuts are one of the best snacks to reach for when you are dealing with constipation. One cup of walnuts contains about eight grams of fiber, making them one of the most fiber-rich nuts, along with almonds and pecans. Furthermore, walnuts are rich with omega-3 fatty acids, which ease constipation by lubricating the intestinal walls so that stool can more easily pass through. Chia Seeds Westend61 / Getty Images Chia seeds are another versatile food that can help relieve constipation. You can use chia seeds in pudding, jams, overnight oats, smoothies, salads, and more. What makes chia seeds one of the best foods for constipation is their high fiber content; one ounce of dried chia seeds contains almost 10 grams of fiber. Chia seeds are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants to support digestion. Some research also shows they can help promote a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Soybeans Lucas Ninno / Getty Images Soybeans are a type of legume that are most widely eaten in the form of tofu. They are also used as a meat substitute in a variety of vegetable-based foods. One cup of soybeans contains 17 grams of fiber, making them one of the best foods for constipation. Cooking or boiling soybeans will not harm their fiber content, either. Unfortunately, drinking soy milk won't be helpful, as most of the soybeans' fiber is removed during the manufacturing process. Best Herbal Teas for Constipation GMVozd / Getty Images One way to help ease constipation is to drink a soothing cup of hot tea. Hot liquids are thought to promote bowel movements by encouraging peristalsis (intestinal contractions). Two herbal teas in particular, both of which have a licorice-like flavor, are said to have significant laxative effects: Anise teaFennel tea Water Yoshiyoshi Hirokawa / Getty Images As important as fiber-rich foods are in treating constipation, you also need to ensure that you drink plenty of water to maintain ample hydration. If you are dehydrated, less water can be pulled into the digestive tract to help keep stools soft. Most adults do not drink close to enough water per day. By upping your fluid intake, you'll not only be better able to treat acute bouts of constipation but remain regular over the long term. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies recommends drinking 11 cups of water per day for adult females and 15 cups per day for adult males. Summary If you have constipation, make an effort to increase your intake of foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, and herbal teas. Increase your intake gradually, especially with beans and legumes, to avoid gas and bloating.
