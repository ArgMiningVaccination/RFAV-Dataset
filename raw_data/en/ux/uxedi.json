SUMMARY vii SUMMARY Buruli ulcer (BU) hits thousands of individuals eve ry year in over 30 countries worldwide, primarily children in remote areas of su b-Saharan Africa. This devastating necrotizing skin infection is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , a cytotoxic macrolide producing environmental pathogen. The disease disto rts and cripples those affected and has great socio-economic impact on people livin g in endemic regions. Currently recommended treatment options are surgical excision of the lesion, systemic administration of as rifampicin and streptomycin (R -S) or a combination of both. Clinical diagnosis of BU lesions requires the exper tise of a skilled physician or health worker, and proper medical care is expensive, time- consuming or not available at all in many BU endemic regions of Africa. Thus, rapid d iagnostic tools as well as improved established or new alternative therapies w hich are safe, inexpensive and easy to handle in a rural setting are urgently need ed and the present work focused on these important issues. Histopathological hallmark of progressing BU diseas e is a poor inflammatory response despite clusters of extracellular bacilli inside necrotic subcutaneous areas. We conducted detailed histopathological studies on the efficacy of chemotherapy with R-S to restore the local immune responses in e arly (nodule and plaque) and late (ulcerative) BU lesions, respectively. In early les ions AFB internalized by macrophages and neutrophils were already found afte r two to four weeks of treatment and started to display irregular ZN stain ing after eight weeks. Final clearance of the bacterial load depended on the ini tial size of clusters and the surrounding necrosis. After eight weeks of R-S ther apy ulcerative lesions comprised only mycobacterial debris inside focally distribute d mononuclear phagocytes. Local cellular immune responses were re-activated very qu ickly (after two weeks acute infiltration was already prominent) and developed f urther during the course of antibiotic therapy, resulting in the formation of e ctopic tertiary lymphoid tissue. Granulomas and other lymphoid structures developed b oth in early and late stage lesions in the course of antibiotic treatment, but only nodules and plaques showed abscessus formation, severe haemorrhages and extens ive necrosis after completion of eight to twelve weeks chemotherapy. Administrati on of R-S is efficacious to cure BU, but immunopathological adverse events due to a chronic overreaction of the SUMMARY viii immune system may cause healing retardation. Thus, treatment strategies have to be further improved. Our results demonstrate that h istopathology can serve as a valuable tool for efficacy evaluation. M. ulcerans grows best at temperatures around 30\u00b0 C and not abo ve 37 \u00b0 C and this property makes the application of heat a treatment option. We employed the phase change material sodiumacetatetrihydrate which is wi dely used in commercial pocket heat pads as a heat application system for thermoth erapy. Laboratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative BU lesions were included i n a proof of principle study and treated for four to six weeks. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment while smaller ulcers heal ed completely without further intervention. Punch biopsies were analysed for hist opathological changes and local immunological reactions during heat therapy. While massive cellular infiltration was observed during antibiotic therapy, the extent of t otal leukocyte infiltration in the lesion did not increase during thermotherapy. This may favour a rapid transition from inflammation to healing, as indicated by the clinic al response to heat treatment, which was characterized by an extraordinarily rapid epithelization and healing process.

Introduction 1 CHAPTER 1 Introduction CHAPTER 1. Introduction 2 1.1 Epidemiology of M. ulcerans infection Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin disease due to i nfection with Mycobacterium ulcerans , a slow growing environmental pathogen producing a potent toxin with cytotoxic properties causing devastating ulcerative lesions. The main burden lies on individuals living in rural areas of sub-Saharan Af rica, primarily young children under the age of 15. M. ulcerans has been isolated for the first time in 1948 by Mc Callum and colleagues from six Australian patients presenting with unusua l skin lesions 1. Retrospectively, large ulcers described by Sir Robert Cook already i n 1897 in the population of northeast Congo were almost certainly caused by M. ulcerans 2. Before the 1980s several countries reported focal areas endemic for Buruli ulcer 3. The Uganda Buruli Group introduced the name \"Buruli\" ulcer referring t o the first reported cases coming from the Buruli region of Uganda near lake Kyoga 4. Since then, alarming increases in case numbers have been reported and over 30 coun tries worldwide are affected 5. Figure 1. BU situation in Africa 2006 (Source: WHO 2006) To date, Buruli ulcer is one of the most important human mycobacterioses, outnumbering tuberculosis and leprosy in some count ries such as Benin 6. Efficient surveillance of endemic areas and detection of new cases is difficult in many developing countries and prevalence rates are suspe cted to be even higher. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 3 1.2 Causative agent M. ulcerans belongs to a group of mycobacteria called \"occasio nal pathogens\" which have the potential to cause disease in humans and a nimals. Most of those bacteria have an environmental reservoir and infect their ho sts only under special circumstances 7. M. marinum , the ancestor of M. ulcerans , has a closely related DNA with 99.6% identity. Acquisition of the virulence p lasmid and two insertion sequences (IS2404 and IS2606) are the hallmarks of the diverg ence and species diversification was further driven by acquisition and concomitant l oss of DNA 8. The genome of M. ulcerans counts 5.8Mb, carrying over 5000 genes. Two phylog enetic lineages have been identified, the \"classical\" lineage - includin g the most pathogenic strains from Africa and Australia - and the \"ancestral\" lineage - genetically closer to M. marinum comprising strains from Asia and South America 9. African isolates are genetically less heterogeneous than all other known mycobacteri a, making epidemiological analyses extremely demanding 10. M. ulcerans is a slow growing bacillus with generation times b etween hours and days. Primary cultures are difficult to obtain and may take between several weeks to months to turn positive 11. The best growing rates are achieved at temperatur es around 30\u00b0 C on L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen medium or with the BacTec system 12. Unlike other members of the tuberculosis -complex, M. ulcerans does not have a dominating intracellular existence. However, recent studies pr edominantly in the mouse model, but also in humans showed that bacilli are internal ized by phagocytic cells during the initial phase of infection 13,14. Release of M. ulcerans into the tissue occurs due to the action of its exotoxin mycolactone, a polyketide-de rived 12-membered ring macrolide 15. Enzymes required for the synthesis of mycolactone are encoded by a giant 174kb virulence plasmid 16. Mycolactone has been shown to have both cytotoxic a nd immunosuppressive activity on leukocytes in vitro , leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis/necro sis 17. This explains the limited cellular immune responses obse rved in the core of BU lesions, despite extensive tissue damage and huge clusters o f extracellular bacteria. Injection of purified mycolactone into the skin of guinea pig s induces ulceration, whereas mycolactone deficient mutants fail to produce disea se in these animals 18. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 4 1.3 Reservoir and transmission It is assumed that M. ulcerans is an environmental organism but the reservoir(s) remain(s) yet unacquainted. BU often strikes indivi duals living and working in wetlands close to rivers, lakes or other water bodi es and increasing incidence rates have been reported in areas where major environment al rearrangements took place 19,20. Especially in Western Africa the disease is signi ficantly spreading which might be partially due to populations moving into endemic areas as well as increased deforestation, flooding, dam construction or other topographical alterations. To date the transmission of M. ulcerans cannot be fully explained but some sort of skin trauma seems to provide the entry site for inf ection. Occupational exposure to contaminated soil, for example on plantations or ri ver banks, seems to be associated with development of the disease 21. 1.1.1 Figure 2. The Common its faeces hypothesis links the disease to aquatic predator y insects. It has been shown that M. ulcerans replicate inside the salivary glands of Naucoris spp. and can be transmitted by these biting insects to laboratory m ice 22. Additionally, DNA assigned to M. ulcerans has been detected by PCR analysis in other aquatic animals and biofilm formations on aquatic plants 23-25. In 2008, Portaels et al published the first cultivation of M. ulcerans from the environment out of a water strider from B enin 26. More recently, in an unpublished study in Australia the faeces of possums, small marsupials living in trees (Figure 2), turned out h ighly positive when tested by real- time PCR. However, no acid-fast bacilli could be de tected and culture remained negative. The discovery of main reservoir(s) and exact mode o f transmission of M. ulcerans are two important research priorities of the global BU research community. CHAPTER 1. Introduction 5 1.4 The pathology of Buruli ulcer disease 1.4.1 Clinical presentation The early and less severe forms of BU lesions are m obile subcutaneous nodules (or papules) which are usually painless (Figure 3). Pri marily cooler body parts such as the limbs are affected. When left untreated, lesion s often become indurated plaques associated with varying degrees of oedema. At this stage bacterial burden is especially high and subcutaneous necrosis spreads r elatively fast occasionally involving the underlying fascia and bones 27. Eventually, plaques turn into an ulcerative lesion, with characteristic cotton wool- like discharge inside the necrotic slough and undermined skin margins where the better part of bacterial burden is located once the central necrosis has been removed 28. Figure 3. Various stages of M. ulcerans infection (Buruli ulcer) Patients usually present to hospital late, when lar ge plaques or ulcers are established or secondary infections cause additional symptoms s uch as fever and pain. Therefore, disabling contractures and scarring or e ven amputation of a limb are common sequelae with great socio-economic consequen ces for those affected 29. 1.4.2 Histopathological changes On microscopic level BU presents with a distinct his topathology serving as one of the pillows to confirm clinical diagnosis. All stages h ave in common a coagulative subcutaneous necrosis, mainly of the adipose and de ep dermal connective tissue, which is advancing almost unlimited driving progres sion of the disease. Huge clusters of extracellular M. ulcerans are usually located within the necrotic tissue and CHAPTER 1. Introduction 6 inflammatory responses are mild to absent especiall y in early lesions 30. Eventually, all compartments of the affected skin undergo apopt osis/necrosis including vessels, nerves and the epidermal layer, turning structural details into an amorphous eosinophilic coagulum (Figure 4a). As disease progr esses into its chronic form, elevated leukocyte infiltration associated with gra nuloma formation can be observed towards the macroscopically healthy lesion margins 28. Figure 4. Characteristic BU coagulative necrosis of the subc utaneous tissue (a) with masses of acid- fast bacilli in the adipose layer (b) Histopathological specimens typically show clumps o r microcolonies of acid-fast organisms (Figure 4b), but more recent studies indi cate a transient intracellular stage of M. ulcerans during the early phase of infection. Phagocytes, o ccasionally carrying internalized mycobacteria, may be observed at the n ecrotic rim where some leukocytes managed to infiltrate the tissue despite the immunosuppressive activity of mycolactone 13. In the mouse foot pad model this phenomenon can b e seen more clearly during the very early i.e. pre-nodular stag e of the infection. Leukocytes carrying intact bacilli are finally destroyed and r elease their contents into their environment. a b CHAPTER 1. Introduction 7 Antibiotic therapy abolishes the characteristic imm unosuppression and leads to the development of local strong, organized chronic infl ammatory responses and subsequently the destruction of the bacteria (see C hapter 4). 1.4.3 Immune response BU disease predominantly follows an indolent course , with little inflammatory response and mostly negative M. ulcerans or M. bovis PPD skin tests 31. The latter may switch to a positive reaction over time suggest ing the development of a systemic response 32,33. Similar to most mycobacteria, M. ulcerans proceeds through an initial intracellular phase, where bacilli are internalized by phagocytes , before transition to the extracellular phase due to cell death caused by myc olactone. This first step may lead to the induction of a Th-1 host response which is i neffective against extracellular pathogens. Suppression of TNF- in the presence of inflammatory chemokines produced by macrophages may prevent granuloma forma tion 14. Several studies on T-helper subset responses have been carried out, be cause cellular TH-1 responses with high levels of IFN- are regarded as crucial for the host defence again st mycobacteria 34. Study protocols implemented were very heterogeneo us leading to controversial results. Although one case study repo rts a shift from Th-1 to Th-2 phenotype during ulceration 35 it is still unclear whether the disease can be associated with a shift in T-helper responses (see C hapter 11). Mycolactone is not only cytotoxic but at lower conc entrations has also immuno- modulatory attributes 36. Recent evidence suggests that the toxin acts supp ressive on antigen presenting leukocytes such as dendritic cel ls hence disrupting the signal transduction to draining lymph nodes necessary for the activation and homing of lymphocytes 37. However, people who recovered from BU after surgica l excision are not at all protected against recurrences or novel infections. The fact that antibiotic therapy leads to pronounced local leukocyte activation 38 could hint towards a possible \"semi- vaccination\" based on rifampicin/streptomycin treat ment, but long-term follow-ups of patients who recovered solely by administration of antibiotics have not yet been accomplished. During active disease the majority of M. ulcerans are extracellularly located which suggests that antibodies could play a role in immun oprophylaxis and spontaneous healing. Sera from infected individuals have someti mes high antibody titres against CHAPTER 1. Introduction 8 M. ulcerans antigens, not correlated with disease stages 33,39. Unfortunately, normal BCG vaccination does not provide satisfactory prote ction 40,41. Current strategies for better vaccines include repeated or improved BCG vac cination, rational attenuation of a M. ulcerans subunit vaccines aimed at immunodominan t antigens 42- 44. Vaccination with a compound eliciting the develop ment of neutralizing antibodies against mycolactone is considered an alternative to protein based approaches. 1.5 Diagnostic tools and treatment strategies 1.5.1 Diagnosis The heterogeneous presentation of BU with its diffe rent stages requires an experienced physician for a proper differential dia gnosis on clinical grounds. Developed ulcers are more easily recognized by mean s of their typical undermined edges and painless nature, although cutaneous leish maniasis, squamous cell carcinoma or tropical phagedenic ulcer show certain similarities 29. Examination of swabs or small biopsies taken from the undermined l esion margins is commonly used for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. Sm ears can be stained with ZN and assessed for the presence of AFB even in remote are as of resource poor countries 45, but this method has low sensitivity and specifici ty. Figure 5. Schematic display of sampling a punch biopsy (sourc e: www.answers.com ) and two possible diagnostic a DNA extr act (a) and ZN staining of a smear (b) a b CHAPTER 1. Introduction 9 PCR based on the amplification of IS2404 and IS2606 is another standard diagnostic tool widely used in better equipped reference labor atories 8. It is a rapid, sensitive and specific method but requires technical expertis e and is not everywhere available. When it comes to the early nodular stage, clinical diagnosis of BU may even be more often confused with other diseases forming localize d swellings such as onchocercoma, lymphadenitis, mycosis or lipoma. The diffuse clinical picture of the oedematous and plaque forms might be mistaken for l eprosy, osteomyelitis or psoriasis 29. In all these cases the skin surface is still intac t making invasive sampling for laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnos is unavoidable. Since recently, punch biopsies are more often used to obtain materi al which can be used not only for PCR and ZN staining but also for culturing and hist opathological assessment (Figure 5). Culture of M. ulcerans is a very time-consuming, non-sensitive procedure 11. Detection of histopathological changes is a reliabl e diagnostic method but technically demanding and due to the heterogeneous nature of BU lesions often difficult to interpret especially when no AFB can be detected in side the biopsy. One of the main research priorities of the WHO Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative is the development of a simple and rapid diagnostic test w ith high sensitivity and specificity that could be used for early identification of case s and would help to improve the implementation of therapeutic interventions and pre vention campaigns. 1.5.2 Treatment During a long period surgical excision of lesions t ogether with subsequent skin grafting was the only available therapeutic interve ntion. Early non-ulcerative lesions can often be removed without requiring skin graftin g preventing the development of disfiguring large ulcers and accompanying deformiti es. Recurrences after primary surgical excision may occur in up to half the cases due to incomplete removal of the pathogen 46,47. This invasive therapy and the required long-term care have great economic impact on those affected. Furthermore, in developing countries such as West Africa skilled health care workers and experie nced physicians are not commonly in reach and neither are appropriately equ ipped surgical wards. Anecdotal reports on antibiotic treatment of BU, es pecially of complicated cases, have generally been discouraging although M. ulcerans is susceptible to rifampicin, some aminoglycosides, macrolides and quinolones in vitro 48,49. In humans, both CHAPTER 1. Introduction 10 clofazamine 50 and cotrimoxacole 51 yielded no effect, and the combination rifampicin/dapsone had limited success on ulcerativ e lesions 52. In 2002, Dega et al could show that combined rifampicin and amikacin ad ministration over 12 weeks was sufficient to cure M. ulcerans infection in mice 53 and unpublished data from several health centres in Africa reported promising efficac y in patients. Based on these events, WHO launched provisional guidelines on anti biotic therapy of BU patients with rifampicin and streptomycin alone or in combin ation with surgery in 2004 54. One year later Etuaful et al could show that already af ter four weeks of therapy with this combination culture was rendered negative 55. A study among patients treated with antibiotics for eight weeks in Benin could categori ze 96% of patients as successfully treated. Nevertheless, in about half the cases addi tional surgery and subsequent skin grafting had to be performed 56. Recent studies in mice indicate that streptomyci n, which has to be injected daily and may cause severe side-effects, could possibly be replaced by the orally administered clarithromycin 57. Nevertheless, new anti- mycobacterial compounds which are safe, cheap and e asy-to-administer are urgently needed as rifampicin is also one out of four frontl ine drugs in the combat against TB infection. In the mid-seventies of the last century a small cl inical trial was conducted on the local application of heat onto lesions to cure the disease 58. Although results were quite encouraging, the electricity dependent and co mplicated device based on water circulation to maintain a constant 40\u00b0 C made this a pproach inoperative for rural African regions. Recently, a proof-of-principal tri al was accomplished reviving the idea of curing with heat by using bags filled with a cheap, non-hazardous phase- change material (see Chapter 7). First results are very promising as lesions healed rapidly and patients remained free of relapse for o ver 12 months already, which indicates this strategy to be a possible alternativ e or supplementary treatment modality in the near future.

Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 20 Abstract Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is a chronic necrotizing disease of the skin and the underlying soft tissue. Fat tis sue necrosis accompanied by minimal inflammation is considered the most reliabl e histopathologic feature of BU. There may be a constant influx of inflammatory cell s to the sites of active infection but these are thought to be killed by mycolactone, a polyketide toxin produced by M. ulcerans , through apoptosis and necrosis. Here we describe the spatial correlations between mycobacterial load and the expression of de ndritic cell (DC) surface markers (cluster of differentiation (CD) 83, CD11c, and CD123), the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 and and TNF- messenger RNA (mRNA) was detectable by real-time P CR in all lesions, the expression of the other cytokines was only found as small foci in some lesions. Correlations of the distribution of mRNA e ncoding the activation marker CD83 and the DC subset markers CD123 and and myeloid dendritic cells were prese nt in the lesions. Results suggest that M. ulcerans specific immune responses may develop once therape utic interventions have limited the production of mycola ctone. Abbreviations BU, Buruli immune response in Buruli ulcer 21 Introduction Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is a chronic necrotizing disease of skin and soft tissue. Generally it manifests ini tially as firm, non-tender, subcutaneous nodules, probably at the sites of pene trating skin trauma (pre- ulcerative stage). Subsequently, these areas become fluctuant, followed by the formation of an ulceration with undermined edges (u lcerative stage). Ulcers can be extensive, involving more than 10% of the patient's skin surface (Johnson et al. , 2005). Subcutaneous fat is particularly affected, b ut underlying bone may also become involved in advanced cases. In BU lesions cl umps of extracellular acid-fast bacilli surrounded by areas of necrosis are found. Fat tissue necrosis accompanied by minimal inflammation is considered the most reli able histopathologic feature of BU 1993; Guarner et al. , 2003). In late stages of the disease, intralesional influx of leukocytes and granulomatous responses in the dermis and panniculus has been described. If left u ntreated, spontaneous healing of BU lesions can occur after extended periods of prog ressive ulceration (Asiedu et al. , 2000). Traditionally, BU is treated by wide surgica l excision, drug therapy has been considered ineffective, but recent data suggest tha t combinations of anti- mycobacterial antibiotics can support or replace su rgical treatment (Etuaful et al. , 2005). Provisional World Health Organization (WHO) gu idelines now recommend the use of rifampicin and streptomycin for the treatmen t of BU (http://www.who.int/buruli/information/antibiotics/e n/index1.html). M. ulcerans is unique among mycobacterial pathogens in that it is mainly extracellular and produces a plasmid-encoded toxin with a polyketide-derived macrolide structure, named mycolactone (Stinear et al. , 2004). Mycolactone is believed to play a central role in determining the extracellular localization of the bacteria and modulation of immunological responses to M. ulcerans (Adusumilli et al., 2005). Observations in rodents experimentally inf ected with mycolactone producing and mycolactone-negative M. ulcerans strains suggested that inflammatory cells are rapidly killed by necrosis w hen encountering high toxin concentrations. Inflammatory cells more distant fro m the necrotic center are thought to be killed via apoptosis resulting in extracellul ar bacteria surrounded by an area of coagulation necrosis. In contrast, granulomatous le sions with strong self-healing tendencies were observed with mycolactone-negative mutants (Oliveira et al. , 2005). CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 22 Intrigued by the described lack of inflammatory res ponses in BU lesions, we have analyzed the impact of M. ulcerans infection on the activation of the skin innate immune system, including dendritic cells (DC). Here we describe the spatial correlations between bacterial load and the express ion of DC-surface markers (cluster of differentiation (CD)83, CD11c, and CD12 3), the intracellular receptor Results Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the spatial distribution of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding cytokines and cell-su rface markers of the innate immune system within surgically excised early ulcer ative BU lesions of three selected patients. Histopathological changes and M. ulcerans DNA levels in the same tissue samples have been described previously (Rondini et al. , 2006). A summary of these data is provided in Figures 1 and 2 for direct comp arison with the distribution of cytokine and DC marker mRNA. CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 23 Figure 1.

Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 25 Distribution of DC marker mRNA Figure 1 shows the spatial pattern of mRNA encoding the cell-surface marker CD83, CD11c, CD123, and the receptor TLR9. Percent values normalized to - actin mRNA are provided. In all three patients CD83 (Figure 1d-f) and CD123 mRNA (Figure 1j-l) was detectable along the entire lesio ns. Relative levels ranged from 0 to 4.2% (as compared to 0.2 0.1% in normal skin) and from 0 to 7.4% (0.2 0.2% in normal skin), respectively. CD11c (Figure 1g-i) and TLR9 mRNA (Figure 1m-o) showed a more focal distribution with relative leve ls ranging from 0 to 92% (0.4 0.2% in normal skin) and 0-1.2% (<0.01% in normal skin), respectively. For all four markers peak values were thus much higher than in n ormal skin. In many cases peaks were located close to foci of M. ulcerans DNA (sample G in patient A, samples D and F in patient B, and samples D and E in patien t C). Distribution of cytokine mRNA Expression of cytokines with pro-inflammatory or an ti-inflammatory was analyzed (Figure 2). IL-8, IL-6, and TNF- mRNA was detectable in all three BU lesions, albeit in different amounts and in markedl y different spatial patterns. Peaks of the relative levels of IL-8 mRNA were associated with the ulcerations and the histological detection of neutrophils (Figure 2a-c) . In contrast, location of the relative peaks of IL-6 mRNA with respect to the location of ulcerations and peaks of M. ulcerans DNA varied markedly between lesions. In patient A, the relative IL-6 mRNA levels were highest at the less affected borders of the excised tissue, in patient B it was peaking at the nodular pre-ulcerative lesion an d in patient C at and around the ulceration (Figure 2d-f). TNF- mRNA was broadly distributed over the levels of IL-8, IL-6, and TNF- mRNA (130.395, 10, and 2.3%, respectively) were dramatically higher than the lev els found in normal skin (4.7 5.1, 0.10.1, and 0.1 0.1%, respectively). Like in normal skin, IL-12p40 mRNA levels were belo w the detection limit in all three BU lesions analzsed (<0.03%) (data not shown). and IL-10 mRNA, also undetectable in normal skin, was found a t least in one of the three analyzed lesions in spatially highly restricted foc i. IL-10 and IFN- mRNA was detected only in patient B (Figure 2n). Although a peak of IL-10 mRNA was associated with the secondary non-ulcerated nodule (peak value 1.2%), IFN- CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 26 mRNA was found in one sample close to the small ulc eration and the associated granulomas (peak value 0.2%) (Figure 2n). Significa nt levels of IFN- mRNA were primarily found in patient C (Figure 2j-l), peaking towards the right margin of the excised tissue (Figure 2l, peak value in sample I, 246%). Correlations of the spatial distribution of mRNA sp ecies The spatial mRNA distributions of the two DC subset markers CD11c and CD123 were positively correlated with that of the Also strong positive correlations of the distribution of CD83 with IL-6 IL-6 with CD123 was tight er ( 3f). The correlation of both DC subse t markers with TNF- expression was moderate (CD11c vs TNF- : r=0.48, P=0.004; data not shown). There was no indication of a correlation between IFN- and CD123, CD83, or CD11c (data not shown). CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 27 Figure 3.

Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 29 Discussion Under homeostatic cells (Kupper and Fuhlbrigge, 2004). Our real-time PCR and immunostaining data indicate t hat in addition to the CD11c- positive CD123-negative of lymphoid origin (Colonna et al. , 2004), CD11c-negative and known to be recruited t o diseased skin in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, atopic dermatitis, et al. , 2003; Nestle et al. , 2005). One of the surface molecules upregulated upon DC act ivation and maturation is CD83 (Lechmann et al. , 2002). Although CD83 is also expressed on activat ed human B and T cells and a subpopulation of activated mono cytes (Lechmann et al. , expression betwee n CD83 and CD123, or both P-DC and myeloid DC were activ ated in the BU lesions. The distribution of mRNA encoding the highly expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- was also strongly correlated with the activation m arker CD83. Expression of IL-6 was additionally strongly correlated with t hat of CD123, indicating that activated P-DC may represent the major source of IL -6 expression in the BU lesions. In contrast to myeloid DC, P-DC express TLR7 TLR3, TLR4, and TLR5. In the majority of patient samples analyzed, expression of TLR9 and CD123 mRNA was consistent, supporting the prese nce of P-DC in BU lesions (Figure 1). Signalling through TLR7 and TLR9 result s in P-DC activation to secrete large amounts of type I IFN and moderate amounts of TNF- and IL-6 (Colonna et al. , 2004). In contrast to IL-6, no correlation between CD123 and IFN- mRNA was observed. IFN- expression by P-DC seems to be variable; whereas P -DC activation by TLR9 in response to viruses results in secretion of large amounts of IFN- (Colonna et al. , 2004), during the development of psoriatic phenot ype IFN- expression by P-DC seems to be only an early and tr ansient event (Nestle et al. , 2005). Consistent with published data (Prevot et al. , 2004; Kiszewski et al. 2006), TNF- and IL-8 levels were, like those of IL-6 and IFN- mRNA, much higher in the BU lesions than in normal skin. As moderate correlation between DC markers and TNF- mRNA was observed, TNF- mRNA expression may CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 30 be in part associated with other cell types, like m onocytes, activated T cells, or natural killer cells. The mechanism of immune protection in M. ulcerans remains unclear. Evidence from genetic defects in the IFN- signalling pathway supports the role of IFN- in protection against a range of non-tuberculous mycob acterial disease, including M. ulcerans (Ottenhoff et al. , 2005). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BU patients with active disease showed significantly r educed lympho-proliferation and IFN- production in response to stimulation with live or dead M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, M. ulcerans , purified protein derivative and non-mycobacterial an tigens like et Prevot et al. (2004) showed with semiquantitative PCR analyses that the systemic Th1 downmodulation was mirrored b y local, intralesional cytokine profiles. High IFN- with low IL-10 mRNA levels were present in early, nodular lesions, and low IFN- mRNA levels were detected in late ulcerative lesion s (Prevot et al. , 2004). Hence, in active M. ulcerans disease, the Th1 response seemed to be downregulated both locally and systemically. The pr esence of IL-6 T-cell inhibit (Diehl assoc iation of CD123 (P-DC) with IL-6 in conjunction with the lack of IFN- production may favor Th2 development and result in the observed Th1 downmodulation in BU. IL -6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the growth and differentiation of numer ous cell types, including those of dermal and epidermal origin (Paquet and Pierard, 19 96). In the skin, it is induced in a broad range of dermatotoxic reactions and may be in volved in wound healing (Hernandez-Quintero et al. , 2006). The presence of high numbers of P-DC in th e lesions in the absence of IFN- gene expression raises also the issue of a tolerog enic role of these cells, as suggested in primary cutane ous melanomas (Vermi et al. , 2003). IL-10 and IFN- mRNA was detected in one of the three analyzed BU lesions, where it was present only in highly focal areas. Phillips et al. (2006) showed wide variations in IL-10 and IFN- mRNA expression among individual skin punch biopsi es. Generally, our results demonstrate that expression o f cytokines and cell-surface markers can vary considerably within a BU lesion. T herefore, results obtained with CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 31 biopsies of BU lesions do not necessarily reflect t he overall profile of a lesion. Our comparison of the spatial relationship between bact erial load, DC marker, and pro- inflammatory cytokine mRNA suggests that the presen ce of clusters of M. ulcerans does not exclude innate immune system recruitment t o the site of infection. This conclusion is consistent with the hypothesis of Oliv eira et al. (2005) suggesting a constant influx of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophag es, and lymphocytes to active M. ulcerans lesions. Potentially, M. ulcerans specific immune responses may therefore develop, once a therapeutic intervention, such as a successful antibiotic treatment, is limiting the production of mycolacton e. Materials and Methods Clinical specimens Three BU patients with ulcerative lesions, who rece ived standard treatment at the Amasaman Health Centre in the Ga district in Ghana, were enrolled in this study. The standard treatment comprised wide surgical excision including margins of macroscopically healthy tissue followed by skin gra fting. BU clinical diagnosis was reconfirmed by IS2404 PCR, microscopic detection of acid-fast bacilli, and observation of characteristic histopathological cha nges. The distribution of M. ulcerans DNA and histopathological examination within the e xcised tissue samples analyzed here, have been described elsewhere (Rondi ni et al. , 2006). Patient A presented with an ulcerated plaque (ulcer size 4 5 cm) on the dorsal aspect of the left upper arm. The central necrotic slough was ass ociated with typical inflammatory cells whereas no granulomas were seen in any zone o f the excision. The highest mycobacterial DNA burden was present at the base of the ulcer and decreased towards the margins of the excision (Figure 1a). Pa tient B presented with a small- ulcerated lesion ( 1 cm) and a larger non-ulcerated nodule located ab out 3 cm apart on the dorsal aspect of the right elbow. The M. ulcerans DNA was present with high load within the non-ulcerated nodule and, with lower load, in the ulcerated region. Between these two lesions no bacterial DNA was detected. Granulomas were present across the tissue from nodule to ulcer till the right margin of the excision (Figure 1b). Patient C presented with a small ulcer 5 cm away from a larger ulcer, which was surrounded by scar tissue and showed evid ence of previous treatment. M. CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 32 ulcerans DNA was only present at the base of the small ulce r and no granulomas were detected in the whole excision (Figure 1c). Et hical approval for analyzing patient specimens was obtained from the local ethic al review board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and partici pants gave their written informed consent. The study was conducted according to the D eclaration of Helsinki Principles. RNA extraction, removal of genomic DNA, and reverse transcription RNA was extracted from several samples of equal siz e, each comprising skin and fat tissue, which were obtained from BU patients' excis ed lesions: patient A, 14 samples (A-N); patient B, 11 samples (A-K); patient C, nine samples (A-I). Samples were disrupted by sonication for 2 minutes (Sonifer\u00ae Branson 250, Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT) and centrifuged for 3 min utes at 10,000 g. RNA was extracted from the tissue lysate using the RNeasy M ini Kit (Qiagen AG, Basel, CH) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) to remove genomic DNA. To synthesize complementary DNA, total RNA was incu bated with oligo d(T) for 10 minutes at 65\u00b0 C, and put on ice. A reaction mixt ure containing dNTP mix (125 nM), dithiothreitol (10 mM) and reverse transc riptase Moloney murine leukemia virus (200 U) with corresponding first strand buffe r was added (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The reaction mix was incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C before enzyme inactivation for 5 minutes at 94\u00b0 C. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction Gene transcription was evaluated using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Prime rs and probes for TLR9) were used to amplify specific complementary DNA in duplicate, according to the manufacturers in structions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The -actin gene was used as an internal house keeping g ene reference. Primers and from Applied Biosyste ms. Primer and probes for IL- 6 (Hartwig et al. , 2002), IL-10 (Giulietti et al. 2001), and IFN- 1999) were synthesized by Mycrosynth (Balgach, CH ). CHAPTER 3. Innate immune response in Buruli ulcer 33 Having verified that the amplification dynamic rema ins proportional at all tested dilutions, RNA expression of each surface marker an d cytokine was presented as percentage relative to -actin gene expression. The assays were run in dupl icates and the results with a standard deviation >2% were excluded. Correlation analyses were performed in Prism using the Spearman rank cor relation coefficient. Mean values of surface markers and regulatory cytokines in six samples of healthy skin tissue are as follow: CD11c undetectable. Immunohistochemistry Tissue samples were fixed overnight in neutral buff ered 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin according to standard protocol and cut into 5 m sections using a microtome. After de-paraffinization, sectio ns were re-hydrated through graded alcohols and washed in distilled water. Anti gen retrieval was performed by microwave unmasking technique in 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0. Subsequently, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H 2O2 for 30 minutes and unspecific binding prevented by incubating with blocking serum for 20 minutes at room temperature. TLR9 (clone and slides incubated in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were incubated for 30 mi nutes at room temperature with the secondary antibody biotin labelled (Vector Labo ratories; 1:200 in phosphate- buffered reptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector Laboratories, Vectastain Elite AB C kit) for 30 minutes at room temperature and staining was performed by using Vec tor NovaRed and hematoxylin (counter stain).

Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli Abstract Background: Buruli ulcer Mycobacterium ulcerans is an infection of the subcutaneous tissue leading to chronic necrotising skin ulcers. The pathogenesis is associated with the cytocidal and immunosuppressive activities of a macrolide toxin. Histopathological hallmark of progressing disease i s a poor inflammatory response despite of clusters of extracellular bacilli. While traditionally wide excision of the infected tissue was the standard treatment, provisi onal WHO guidelines now recommend an eight week pre-treatment with streptom ycin and rifampicin. Methodology/ Principal Findings: We conducted a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples from Buruli patients who received antibiotic treatment. Cellular immune response along with bacterial load and distribution were monitored. We demonstrate that this treatment leads to the dev elopment of highly organized cellular infiltration surrounding areas of coagulat ive necrosis. Diffuse infiltrates, granulomas and dense lymphocyte aggregation close t o vessels were observed. Mycobacterial material was primarily located inside mononuclear phagocytes and microcolonies consisting of extracellular rod-shape d mycobacteria were no longer found. In observational studies some patients showe d no clinical response to antibiotic treatment. Corresponding to that, one of five lesions analysed presented with huge clusters of rod-shaped bacilli but no sig ns of infiltration. Conclusions/ Significance: Results signify that eight weeks of antibiotic tre atment reverses local immunosuppression and leads to an ac tive inflammatory process in different compartments of the skin. Structured leuk ocyte infiltrates with unique signatures indicative for healing processes develop ed at the margins of the lesions. It remains to be analysed whether antibiotic resistanc e of certain strains of M. ulcerans, lacking patient compliance or poor drug quality are responsible for the absent clinical responses in some patients. In future, analysis of local immune responses could serve as a suitable surrogate marker for the effica cy of alternative treatment strategies. CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 41 Synopsis Buruli ulcer (BU) is a debilitating disease of the skin presenting with extensive tissue destruction and suppression of local host defence m echanisms. Surgical removal of the affected area has been the standard therapy unt il in 2004 WHO recommended eight weeks treatment with the anti-mycobacterial d rugs rifampicin and streptomycin. We performed a detailed histological analysis of th e local immune response in biopsies from five children medicated according to WHO provisional guidelines. One patient still revealed all histopathological signat ures of an active BU lesion with huge bacterial clusters in areas of fatty tissue necrosi s. Different factors can contribute to treatment failure like poor patient compliance and resistant bacterial strains. In four patients, different compartments of the skin presen ted active immune processes with only limited residues of bacterial material persist ing. We demonstrated that antibiotic treatment not only directly controls the infectious agent but is also associated with fulminant host immune responses. Characterization o f the healing process in BU due to therapy is highly relevant to increase our knowl edge on the impact of treatment strategies to fight the disease. CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 42 Introduction Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is a chronic necrotizing skin disease mainly affecting subcutaneous and adipose t issue [1,2]. The unique pathology of BU is primarily attributed to a plasmi d-encoded macrolide toxin, mycolactone [3,4]. Mycolactone has cytopathic and a poptotic activity and is thought to be responsible for local immunosuppression by de stroying infiltrating cells [3,5,6] . In animal models, injection of purified mycolactone causes lesions similar to those produced by wild type M. ulcerans bacteria [3,7]. BU is considered to be the third most common mycoba cterial infection after tuberculosis and leprosy. Clinical lesions usually start as painless subcutaneous nodules that may develop into plaques or oedema. If left untreated, extensive ulcerations with typical undermined edges of the de rmis develop. Spontaneous healing can occur, often leaving the patient behind with extensive scarring, retractions and deformities [8-10]. BU has been rep orted in more than 30 countries worldwide, but rural communities in Western and Cen tral Africa are the worst affected [2]. Areas endemic for BU are associated w ith stagnant or slow-flowing water bodies. The mode of transmission is not clear ; both contamination of wounds from environmental reservoirs, such as bio films on aquatic vegetation [11] and infection through the bite of insect vectors [12-14 ] have been discussed. Until recently, surgery has been the only WHO recomm ended treatment for BU [15- 17]. Wide excision margins reaching into the health y tissue are necessary to prevent recurrences [18] and often subsequent skin grafting is required. In most endemic areas access to surgery is very limited for the maj ority of BU patients. Moreover, the costs for treatment and prolonged hospital stays ar e often prohibitive. In 2004, WHO published provisional guidelines recommending treat ment with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin [19] based on results o f a small randomised controlled clinical trial [20] and observational studies. Whil e no antibiotic therapy has been formally proven effective in BU [17], there is evid ence that treatment with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin reduces recurrence rates and may help to avoid surgery or at least limit its extent [21]. Mo re than 50% of BU cases are children below 15 years. Potential long-term side effects of streptomycin in this population CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 43 restrict the duration of the antibiotic treatment t o eight weeks. If surgery is combined with antibiotic therapy, the aim is to use minimal surgery to excise necrotic tissue when antibiotics have arrested progress of the dise ase. For yet unknown reasons, a proportion of BU patients seem to be refractory for antibiotic treatment. Histopathological hallmarks of progressing BU are a poor inflammatory response and growing regions of necrosis of the dermal and adipo se tissue eventually leading to the collapse of the overlying epidermis (Figure 1; A to D). Clusters of extracellular, mycolactone-producing acid-fast bacilli are usually located within these necrotic areas (Figure 1; E and F) [18,22-24]. Granulomatous responses in the dermis and panniculus have been described in late stages of BU [18,22,25]. Observations both in cell culture and rodents experimentally infected wi th mycolactone producing and mycolactone-negative M. ulcerans strains indicate that infiltrating cells are killed due to the cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing activity of mycolactone [5,26,27]. While M. ulcerans may be captured by phagocytes during different stag es of infection, it appears to persist only transiently inside these ho st cells [6,28]. After killing of the phagocytes, extracellular growth leads to the devel opment of extracellular bacterial foci in areas of coagulating necrosis [18,27]. The aim of the present study was to analyse whether the local immunosuppression in Buru li ulcer lesions can be reversed by the combination treatment with rifampicin and st reptomycin and if intralesional cellular immune responses complement antibiotic the rapy. CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 44 Materials and Methods Clinical specimens Surgical specimens from five patients aged between six and 11 years with ulcerative lesions were obtained from the Amasaman Health Cent re in Ghana and the Ayos district hospital in Cameroon (Table S1; supplement ary material). Lesions were not older than three months and located at the lower le g (four patients) or arm (one patient). Patients had received the currently recom mended standard treatment comprising surgical excision of lesions after pre-t reatment with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin (WHO, 2004). Although no further ulcer enlargement and reduction of oedema were observed, the responsible clinicians had decided to treat all five patients surgically to remove necrotic tis sue and facilitate wound healing. After receiving informed consent from the guardians of th e patients, surgical specimens were used for laboratory reconfirmation of clinical diagnosis and for detailed immunohistochemical analysis. All five specimens we re positive for at least two of three diagnostic tests applied (Buruli ulcer - Diag nosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans PCR, microscopic detect ion of acid-fast bacilli and observation of characteristic histopathological cha nges. After receiving informed consent the immunologically non responding patient was tested for HIV positivity. Ethical approval for analysing patient specimens wa s obtained from the ethical review board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and the National Ethics Committee of Cameroon. Immunohistochemistry Immediately after surgery, specimens with a volume of about 0.5 cm3 were collected from different areas of the excised lesions to char acterize the gradient of histopathological changes from necrotic areas to he althy appearing tissue at the excision margins (Figure S1; supplementary material ). Tissue samples were fixed overnight in neutral buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, transferred to 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin according to standard protocol s and cut into 5 \u00b5m sections using a microtome. After deparaffinization sections were rehydrated through graded alcohols, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0. 3% H 2O2 for 20 min and unspecific binding prevented by incubating with blo cking serum matching the CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 45 secondary antibody host (Table1). Antigen retrieval treatment was performed according to standard protocol (Dako\u00ae). After antig en retrieval antibodies (Table 1) were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and sl ides incubated for 1 h at room temperature under rocking conditions. Afterwards se ctions were incubated for 30 min with a correspondent biotin-conjugated secondary an tibody (Table 1) and for another 30 min with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase con jugate (VECTASTAIN\u00ae ABC Kit, Vector performed using Vector\u00ae NovaREDTM and haematoxylin (counterstain). Slides were subsequent ly Staining with Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) and Haematoxylin/ Eosin (HE) was performed on all collected tissue specimen. Staining for acid-fast b acteria was performed according to WHO standard protocol (WHO Diagnostic booklet). In b rief, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated followed by incubatio n with ZN carbolfuchsin for 30 min at RT. Subsequently slides were washed in cool tap water for 5-10 min and individually differentiated with acid-alcohol.

Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 46 Results Lack of a marked inflammatory response and abundant clusters of extracellular bacilli in one of five antibiotic treated patients The excised lesion of one of the five antibiotic tr eated patients was almost devoid of cellular infiltrates. Only minor superficial vasculi tis-associated infiltrates of the dermis consisting of lymphocytes monocyte s were found (Figure 2A). Extensive connective tissue necrosis and epidermal hyperplasia was observed (Figure 2A). The adipose regions displayed fat cell ghosts, extensive calcification and massive necrosis, associated with nearly complete a bsence of intact cell structures (Figure 2B; calcified areas stained purple). While the ulcerative centre of the lesion harboured numerous large clusters of rod-shaped ext ra-cellular acid fast bacilli (Figure 2C), margins contained only very few small bacterial microcolonies (not shown). A polyclonal antiserum, raised against M. leprae and highly cross-reactive with other mycobacteria, was used to stain M. ulcerans for confirmation of ZN staining results. Staining ion of mycobacteria (Figure 2D; red-brown) close to fat cell ghosts and necroti c calcified tissue (purple). In- between fat cell ghosts leukocytes exhibiting signs of defragmentation of nuclei and loss of cytoplasm were found only sporadically (Fig ure 2E). Taken together, features of this lesion resembled that of specimens from unt reated patients (Figure 1) [18]. The patient was tested negative for HIV. Highly organized inflammatory responses and intrace llular bacterial material in four of five antibiotic-treated patients In the other four patients massive cellular infiltr ation was observed. Three major types of mixed infiltrates, differing in cellular c omposition, architecture and localisation were found in all four specimens: (i) highly organized epithelioid granulomas of different size and state of different iation, primarily located in deeper dermal tissue (Figure 3A); (ii) less organized diff use infiltrates representing the most abundant type, present in all areas of the dermal c onnective and adipose tissue (Figure 3B); (iii) dense lymphocyte clusters in pro ximity to vessels, occasionally found in superficial connective tissue (Figure 3C). Cellular composition and CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 47 localisation of these structures along with the dis tribution of mycobacterial material are also schematically represented in Figure 3. Histopathological characteristics of BU were still found in all four patients. These included psoriasiform and pseudoepitheliomatous epi keratinocytes (Figure 4B). Additionally, extensive necrosis of adipose tissue resulted in the appearance of fat cell ghosts (Figure 4C). Cellular infiltration was generally more profuse in vicinity to the necrotic centre of a lesion and declined toward s the excision margins. Granulomas were composed of foamy histiocytes and La nghans' giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes and some plasma cells (Fi gure 4A). No central caseous necrosis was observed. In deeper adipose tissue den se infiltration with high proportions of macrophages and new blood vessel for mation were observed (Figure 4C). Occasionally signs for calcification of deep d ermal tissue were present (not shown). Areas of necrotic connective tissue were en circled by large accumulations of leukocytes (Figure 4D). Some leukocytes exhibiting apoptotic features resided inside necrotic regions (Figure 4D). The periphery of lesi ons revealed focal superficial eosinophilia (Figure 4E). The distribution of mycobacterial material (Figur e 5E - 5G). Both staining methods were found to be equally sensitive when com pared in serial sections (Figure 5A and 5B vs. 5E and 5F). In all four patients myco bacterial material was predominantly found inside macrophages, although so me was still located extra- cellularly; both extra- and intracellular bacilli h ad lost their characteristic rod-shape appearance (Figure 5B and 5F). While the cytoplasm of macrophages frequently harboured numerous phagosomes containing mycobacter ial material (Figure 5C), only few with vacuoles cont ( Figure 5D and 5G, respectively). The highest burden of mycobacterial material was fo und in deep dermal regions (Figure 5A and 5E) with a declining gradient from u lcerative areas towards the excision margins. Accumulations of mycobacterial ma terial were primarily observed in areas of mixed cellular infiltration, but only v ery rarely in granulomas. Additionally, few residues of microcolonies were present in the u pper dermal connective tissue or close to the epidermal basal layer (not shown). CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 48 Architecture of granulomas A panel of antibodies specific for leukocyte marker s (Table 1) were used for immunohistochemical characterisation of infiltrates . Serial sections revealed that the outer layer of granulomas was mainly composed of CD 3+ T lymphocytes (Figure 6A) with CD4+ T cells (Figure always outnumbering CD8+ T cells (Figure 6C). S100+ dermal dendrocytes (dDCs) (Figure 6D). Occasionally dDCs were present in the centre of granulomas (not shown). Focal clusters of CD20+ B cells appeared at the outer margins of the T lym phocyte layer (Figure 6E). Cytoplasmic CD68+ (Figure 6F insert) and epithelioid macrophages formed the centre of granulomas (Figure 6F). Staining of the membrane protein CD14 confirmed the macrophage/monocyte origin of giant cells (Figure 6 G, arrow). Furthermore, large amounts of soluble CD14 were observed within the be lt of T lymphocytes (Figure 6G, arrowhead). A great proportion of lymphocytes turne d out to be activated as evidenced by their CD45RO+ phenotype (Figure 6H). Variable numbers of Ki67+ (proliferating) cells (Figure 6I) presented a lymph or cells could be detected in gran uloma formations. Cellular composition of diffuse mixed infiltrates In contrast to granulomas, regions of diffuse cellu lar infiltration contained sparsely distributed elastase+ PMNL (Figure 7A) with sporadic focal clusters near ulcerative and necrotic areas (not shown). CD56+ NK cells showed a similar distribution with even lower cell counts (not shown). Foci of PMNL an d NK cells with signs of apoptosis were located within necrotic tissue (Figu re 7A insert and 7B, respectively). CD3+ T lymphocyte (Figure 7C) and foamy histiocytes (no t shown) were the most prominent cell types of mixed infiltrates in the de rmal connective tissue. The CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio varied widely between different regions of a lesion, but usually CD8+ cells were more abundant than CD4+ cells (not shown). Small clusters of CD20+ B lymphocytes were scattered within infiltrates (F igure 7D). Counts of CD14+ macrophages/monocytes were particularly high in adi pose tissue and around necrotic areas (Figure 7E). Additionally, vast amounts of sC D14 shed from those cells were revealed (Figure 7E insert). Dendritic cells could be detected in both epider mis and dermis. The frequency of epidermal CD1a+ Langerhans cells was strongly elevated CHAPTER 4. Reversal immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 49 (Figure 7F). S100+ dDC were distributed throughout diffuse mixed infi ltrates with increasing density towards the margins of necrotic areas (Figure 7G). Remarkably, dendritic cell appendices reached into the damaged tissue (Figure 7H). Similar to the findings in granulomas, a large proportion of lymph ocytes stained positive for the activation marker CD45RO (Figure 7I) and proliferati ng Ki67+ cells were scattered throughout the (Figure 7J). Aggregates of lymphocytes resembling follicular str uctures Adjacent to lymphatics or blood-vessels a third typ e of infiltration was found, i.e. follicle-like structures with dense aggregations of lymphocytes (Figure 8A). CD20+ B lymphocytes were the dominating cell type (Figure 8 B) followed by CD3+ T lymphocytes (Figure 8C). Here CD4+ T cells (Figure 8D) were more frequent than CD8+ T cells (Figure 8E). Additionally, few CD68+ APCs (Figure 8F) and S100+ dDCs (Figure 8H) were scattered throughout the aggregate . Similar to the other two infiltration types, a large proportion of lymphocyt es stained positive for the activation marker CD45RO (Figure 8G). Single proliferating Ki67+ cells were evenly distributed (Figure 8I) and sporadically hyper-proliferative cl usters were encountered (Figure 8I insert). CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 50 Discussion It has been demonstrated recently that treatment wi th a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin inhibits the growth of M. ulcerans in pre-ulcerative BU lesions [19]. Furthermore, observational studies [21] indicate th at at least in some of the BU patients antibiotic therapy may reduce the extent o f or even circumvent the indication for surgery. Here we present results of a detailed immunohistological analysis of ulcerative BU lesions from patients treated with ri fampicin/streptomycin prior to surgery. Findings were compared to those obtained f rom lesions of patients that have been treated merely with wide-ranging surgical exci sion (Figure 1) according to former WHO treatment guidelines [1,18]. To our knowl edge this is the first detailed immunohistological description of the effect of ant ibiotic treatment on BU lesions. Presentation of the affected tissue of four of the five antibiotic treated patients was strikingly different from that of untreated patient s, in that immense leukocyte infiltrates and the formation of new vessels were o bserved. These findings reconfirm results of Etuaful et al., who observed an inductio n of chronic inflammation and granulomas in pre-ulcerative lesions by antibiotic treatment [19]. Our detailed analysis regarding composition and architecture of cellular infiltrates is indicative for the development of highly organized tertiary lympho id tissue. Islands of infiltration and scattered granulomas may also develop in untrea ted late stage lesions [18,22,25]. However, infiltration in the patients a t hand was much more substantial, resembling histopathological patterns observed in c onditions such as dermatoborreliosis, where lymphoid neogenesis is re ported [29]. We found three different types of infiltration in all four respond ing patients (Figure 3): granulomas, diffuse mixed infiltrates and dense lymphocyte aggr egations in the vicinity to vessels. We assume that this clear structural differentiatio n reflects a range of different functional activities required for complete clearan ce of infection and resorption of necrotic tissue. In regions of diffuse infiltration, in particular c lose to areas of necrosis, outstandingly large amounts of both membrane-bound and soluble CD 14 were found. Consistent with this, it has been reported that the developmen t of highly organized structures, such as granulomas, is not required for the resorpt ion of destroyed tissue [30]. CD14 mediated clearance of necrotic tissue is usually no t associated with an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines [30], which is in line with the observed lack of CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 51 major inflammatory symptoms in the enrolled patient s. Necrotic regions were surrounded by a substantial quantity of dDCs and th eir appendices reached into the damaged tissue, indicating enhanced antigen uptake and presentation. Moreover, elevated numbers of Langerhans cells were distribut ed throughout the epidermis, like it has been described for tuberculoid and borderlin e leprosy [31]. A large proportion of lymphocytes were expressing activation and proli feration markers. Taken together, these observations reveal that adaptive immune resp onses are taking place autonomously. While in human tuberculosis granulomas develop a ce ntral necrotic core [32], this was not observed in the lesions of the antibiotic t reated BU patients. Here, the centre was mainly formed of foamy histiocytes and Langhans ' giant cells, like reported for leprosy [33], and mycobacterial material was only i nfrequently detected. In leprosy, cells of the lymphocyte belt are less tightly packe d [34] than in tuberculosis [35], a feature we also observed in BU lesions. Thus, BU gr anulomas may function primarily as a place for antigen presentation and adaptive im mune response rather than for sequestration of the mycobacteria. In diffuse infiltrates the CD8/CD4 T lymphocyte rat io was higher than in granulomas. Otherwise, the cellular composition of both types of infiltration was largely the same. Small islets of Langhans' giant cells inside the di ffuse infiltrates support the hypothesis that granulomas represent a more advance d state of the initially unorganized infiltrations. In contrast, the dense l ymphocyte aggregations we observed in vicinity to vessels were of a markedly different cellular composition. Here B lymphocytes represented the most dominant cell ty pe in contrast to granulomas or unorganized infiltrates, where small B cell cluster s were distributed more sparsely. B and T lymphocytes were packed in a notably dense ma nner, with interspersed dDCs and APCs and no central core, a composition charact eristic also for secondary lymphoid organs. Similar structures have also been reported by Ulrichs et al in lung tissue from tuberculosis patients [35]. Many lympho cytes were in the activated state as demonstrated by CD45RO staining and a substantial proportion displayed the proliferation marker Ki67. It has been suggested th at these cell aggregations represent active centres, which orchestrate the loc al host defence [35]. It is not clear, which factors play a crucial role in the developmen t of ectopic lymphoid tissue induced via antibiotic treatment. Plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells present in BU lesions prior to antibiotic treatment [36] may p lay an important role in this CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 52 process. Lymphangiogenesis and participation of lym phoid tissue-inducer cells may in lymphoid neog enesis [29]. Although tertiary lymphoid organs seem to develop in infectious disea ses to sequester pathogens, this process is often accompanied by tissue damage [29]. Anecdotal reports on the emergence of new ulcerations in the course of antib iotic treatment of BU, probably at sites containing unrecognized infection foci, may b e a hint into this direction. It remains to be analysed whether in some cases antibi otic treatment may even accelerate the progression of early plaques and oed emas to ulcerative lesions. In animal infection models neither wild type nor my colactone negative M. ulcerans strains were strong neutrophilic attractants [6], a lthough other studies reported substantial neutrophilic infiltrates in early stage infections [28]. Infiltrates in patients treated with antibiotics contained only very low le vels of neutrophilic leukocytes. In contrast, large numbers of apoptotic cells positive for the neutrophilic leukocyte marker elastase and the NK cell marker CD56 were pr esent within necrotic regions. Findings with an experimental M. ulcerans mouse infection model [27] indicate that these apoptotic cells represent the residues of an early acute defence line. Our data show for the first time that cells of this early de fence are destroyed together with the surrounding tissue, if a substantial infection focu s develops. It is most likely that the generalized cytotoxic activity of mycolactone is th e all-dominant factor. Lesions of all four responders still harboured myco bacterial material as revealed by ZN cells were no longer found. Stainable mycobacterial material had lost th e characteristic shape and was primarily located inside mononuclear phagocytes, bu t was also present in small extracellular foci. These data indicate a killing o r debilitation of the bacteria in the course of antibiotic treatment. Moreover, antigen u ptake and presentation via macrophages and dendritic cells may be enhanced due to lower levels of mycolactone. While bacterial residues were abundant in regions of diffuse infiltration of the deeper dermis and in adipose tissue, granulo mas were largely devoid of it. Only single Langhans' giant cells contained vacuoles filled with stainable residues of the mycobacterial cells. A similar pattern may be f ound in active pulmonary tuberculosis [35,38]. Again, these findings support the theory that granulomas serve as a place for antigen encounter. CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 53 The density of stainable mycobacterial material inc reased from the outer margins of lesions towards the ulcerative centre, which is con sistent with the distribution of mycobacterial DNA in untreated lesions [18,39]. Mor eover, our results demonstrate that after antibiotic treatment the mycobacteria ar e directly taken up by phagocytes at the original focus of infection without granuloma f ormation. M. ulcerans is able to destroy phagocytes after transient intracellular gr owth via the release of mycolactone [6,28]. We think that the stainable intracellular m ycobacterial material represents the remains of phagocytosed dead bacilli or of cells se verely impaired in mycolactone production due to the antibiotic treatment. In gene ral it is most likely, that a pronounced reduction of the concentration of mycola ctone in the lesion is a prerequisite for the observed reversal of the local immunosuppression. Due to the lack of quantitative detection methods for mycolact one, for the time being this aspect cannot be studied. The BU lesion of one antibiotic-treated patient dis played histopathological features similar to active lesions of patients not receiving antibiotic treatment. Only minor leukocyte infiltration was found and huge clusters of extracellular mycobacteria were located beneath the ulcerative centre. Observationa l studies indicate that in a certain proportion of patients, rifampicin/streptomycin tre atment has no clinical curative effect. Acquired or inherited host factors, like de ficiencies in the IFN- /uni04AF and IL-12 pathways for macrophage activation [40,41], may pla y a role. Alternatively, antibiotic resistance of certain lineages of M. ulcerans could be responsible for this lack of response. Therefore major efforts should be made to generate M. ulcerans isolates from these patients for susceptibility testing. Ano ther factor to be considered is poor patient compliance. Rifampicin is administered once per day orally and the intake of tablets may not be monitored. Furthermore, outdated drugs and poorly prepared solutions can be possible reasons for treatment fai lure and clearly need to be taken into consideration. In summary, we conclude that treatment of BU with r ifampicin/streptomycin is accompanied by a reversion of the local immunosuppr ession. The synergistic anti- mycobacterial action of antibiotics and immune defe nce mechanisms may be required to clear the infection efficiently. In vie w of these results, it may be suitable to replace streptomycin already after a few weeks by a bacteriostatic antibiotic. Recently published data of our group indicate that not everyone exposed to M. ulcerans develops clinical disease [42]. After exposure a r ace between front line CHAPTER 4. Reversal of immunosuppression in Buruli ulcer 54 immune responses and mycobacterial multiplication s eems to decide whether a chronic infection focus is established or not. Once a bacterial cluster is large enough to develop a cytocidal cloud of mycolactone around itself, necrotic areas with only minor infiltration develop [18,22-25,43], which is in stark contrast to the vigorous immune responses we describe in the present study. We infer that a complex and highly organized cellular immune response is crucia l for elimination of a chronic M. ulcerans infection. Efficient triggering of local immune res ponses may thus represent a suitable auxiliary marker for the efficacy of alt ernative treatment strategies.

Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 70 Abstract Background: Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans involves devastating skin disease called Buruli ulcer (BU). Currently, dual t herapy with rifampicin and streptomycin (R/S) for eight weeks as well as surge ry are the standard treatments. Objectives: To elucidate the processes taking place in Buruli ulcer lesions in the course of chemotherapy we performed an in-depth his tological analysis of lesions after four weeks of rifampicin and streptomycin (R/ S) treatment. Results are compared to findings in untreated and eight weeks tr eated lesions, respectively. Patients/Methods: Tissue specimens were collected from patients with out, after four and eight weeks of R/S treatment, respectively. Mai n features evaluated were local immune responses, histopathological alterations and bacterial distribution. Results: After four weeks of R/S treatment we observed a la rge proportion of mycobacteria inside macrophages, occasionally formi ng globus-like aggregations. While distinct bands of inflammatory leukocytes sur rounded the necrotic core in an ulcer and early granuloma formation was apparent in the healthy appearing margins, acute cellular infiltration covering the whole lesi on had developed in a nodular lesion. In contrast, ulcerative lesions after eight weeks o f chemotherapy show intra- and extracellular bacterial debris as well as the exten sive presence of chronic infiltrates forming huge granulomas. Conclusions: R/S treatment of BU results in a rapid onset of lo cal cellular immune responses associated with phagocytosis of the extra cellular M. ulcerans . This might be related to declining levels of the macrolide tox in mycolactone in the tissue thus leading to an enhanced chemotherapy-induced clearan ce of the infection. CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 71 Introduction Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic infectious skin dise ase caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans which may produce pronounced deformities and disab ilities when left untreated. M. ulcerans causes necrotizing lesions due to the release of a diffusible macrolide toxin with cytotoxic properties named myc olactone 1-3. Although it can affect humans of any age group, a large proportion of patients are children below the age of 15 4. There are increasing case-numbers mainly in rural areas of Western Africa associated with swamps and slow flowing or s tagnant water bodies 5-7, yet the mode(s) of transmission along with the reservoir(s) of this disease remain unknown. Initially BU appears as a mobile subcutaneous nodul e, a papule or a raised plaque. These develop either into slowly enlarging necrotic ulcers, or rapidly progressing oedema sometimes affecting a whole limb. The initia l prolonged stages of BU lesions can be almost painless and patients do not show sig ns of systemic infection such as fever or malaise 8. At later stages, lesions may heal on their own ac cord yet are often accompanied by contracting scars and ankylosis 9. Surgical treatment without extended excision into h ealthy appearing surrounding tissue is associated with relapse rates of up to 47 % 10-12. In addition, access to health care facilities is limited due to the remote nature of most BU endemic areas, and treatment is often both lengthy and expensive 9. Since 2004, chemotherapy for eight weeks with a combination of rifampicin and streptom ycin is recommended by WHO 13. Small and/or nodular lesions seem to be curable w ith low relapse rates, but additional surgery and/or skin graft are often need ed for larger ulcerative lesions 14,15. Inhibition of cellular immune responses in the infe cted skin 16-18 seems to be a result of mycolactone production 1,3,19,20. However, especially in late stage Buruli ulcer, l ocal cellular infiltration and cytokine production may o ccur 21-24. We recently described the development of ectopic ly mphatic tissue in BU lesions after eight weeks of R/S treatment 25. Microcolonies of extracellular rod-shaped bacilli were no longer observed and only focal, most often intracellular, mycobacterial residues were revealed. Furthermore, in 2005 Etuafu l et al could demonstrate that four weeks of chemotherapy render both in vivo and in vitro cultures negative 26. CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 72 Here we present results of a histological analysis of skin specimens obtained from two patients (one nodule and one ulcer) who had bee n treated with R/S during four weeks. Histopathological pattern, cellular immune r esponses and localisation of acid fast bacilli (AFB) are compared to commonly observe d features in untreated as well as eight weeks antibiotically treated lesions. CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 73 Materials and Methods Study population and sampling In total, four patients with clinical diagnosis of BU were recruited in Ayos, Cameroon. Two controls were included as representative cases for histopathological alterations in (i) untreated lesions and (ii) eight weeks antib iotically treated ulcers, respectively. The first control was a 45 year old woman with a no dule and a small ulcer on the left calf, both which were excised before the start of a ntibiotic therapy based on the decision made by the local surgeon. The second cont rol was a seven year old boy with an ulcer on his left foot who underwent surger y in order to prepare the area for skin grafting after the full course of eight weeks R /S. The third patient, a 13 year old boy, presented a n odule of about 3,5 cm in diameter near his right eye with oedematous swelling of the surrounding area. The fourth patient was a 14 year old boy with an early ulcer o n his left arm right above the elbow. His lesion changed from nodule to ulcer thre e weeks before treatment was commenced and the ulceration was <2cm in diameter. Antibiotic treatment with daily administration of streptomycin (15 mg/kg i.m.) and rifampicin (10 mg/kg orally) was started immediately and, due to the critical locati on, surgery performed after (iii) four weeks. Afterwards, both patients completed the full eight weeks course of chemotherapy. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by Ziehl Neelsen ( ZN) real-time PCR . Ethical clearance was obtained from the National Ethics Committee in Yaou nd\u00e9, Cameroon. Tissue samples were obtained as previously describe d 25, fixed in neutral buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and secti oned 335 E rotary microtome (MICROM International GmbH). Staining procedures and section analysis Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as describ ed in a previous study 25. In brief, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with H2O2 and unspecific binding prevented by incubating with blocking sera. Subsequently slides were pre-treated with the adequate antigen retrieval method and incubated at room temperature with (i) m onoclonal antibodies against (Beckman Coulter), CD56 Ki67 (both Dako) and my antigens (Colorado University, CO, USA; pAbLep). Afterwards secti ons were incubated with the secondary antibody and labelled with s treptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (both Vector Laboratories). St aining was performed by applying Vector NovaRed (Vector Laboratories) and h aematoxylin (Sigma). Immunofluorescent labelling was achieved using seco ndary antibodies and 568 (Invitrogen), respectively, and 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindo (DAPI) counterstaining. Slides were mounted with Eu kitt\u00ae mounting medium. HE and ZN staining were performed according to stan dard protocols. Pictures were taken with a Leica\u00ae DM5000B microscope equipped with a Leica\u00ae DFC300FX\u00ae camera. Images were saved using Leica\u00ae Application Suite and processed with Adobe Photoshop\u00ae CS. Whole section analysis was performed at differ ent magnifications of all samples taken and representat ive areas were chosen for figure preparation. All data about infiltrating cells rela te to the necrotic lesions core and its immediate surroundings (max. 1 cm). The healthy app earing margins of most untreated ulcerative lesions contain cellular infil trates. The same holds true for late pre-ulcerative lesions though at lower rates 17,22. CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 75 Results Histopathological features of (i) untreated and (ii ) eight weeks antibiotically treated Buruli ulcer lesions from representative ar eas of typical lesions (i) The nodular lesion excised without R/S treatmen t showed typical histopathological features of an untreated nodule, i.e. a necrotic fo cus with fat cell ghosts (Fig. 1-A) and minor focal acute infiltration of the connectiv e and adipose tissue (Fig. 1-B). Foamy Touton giant were found surrounding deg rading adipose cells (Fig. 1-B; arrows). Furthermore, abundant bacterial clusters w ere located in the necrotic connective and adipose tissue (Fig. 1-C) and the cy totoxic activity of mycolactone reached beyond the mycobacterial load (Fig. 1-D). B acterial clusters and even single scattered bacteria had no contact to intact leukocy tes (Fig. 1-E). In the same patient a further early ulcerative lesi on, the more advanced stage of BU, was detected showing extensive necrosis with decomp osing leukocytes and erythrocytes (Fig. 1-F). At the borders of the cent ral necrotic area a more substantial acute infiltration as well as large haemorrhages we re noted (Fig. 1-G). Compared to the nodule, the untreated ulcerative lesion reveale d a very high bacterial load inside a huge necrotic compartment (Fig. 1-H). Some acute leukocyte infiltration, located at the circumference of the bacterial distribution (Fi g. 1-I) was noticed being in close contact with extracellular mycobacteria and exhibit ed apoptotic signs such as nucleus defragmentation (Fig. 1-J). (ii) In contrast, a patient who underwent eight wee ks of R/S therapy showed diffuse mixed chronic leukocyte infiltrates in an early ulc er, which appeared to cover the necrotic area (Fig. 1-K) and fully developed granul omas were present towards the lesion margins (Fig. 1-L). Only ZN stainable bacteri al debris was identified (Fig. 1-M), most of it located encased in macrophages (Fig. 1-N ) which was confirmed by immunohistochemical ens (Fig. 1-O). CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 76 Histopathology seen in two lesions after (iii) four weeks of R/S treatment Emergence of intracellular bacilli both in a nodula r and an ulcerative lesion After four weeks of R/S treatment a strong generali zed infiltration and prominent angiogenesis was observed in lesion (Fig. main ce llular population of the acute infiltrate throughout the entire lesion (Fig. 2-B). In the upper dermis prominent clusters of eosinophils were revealed (Fig. 2-C). A high power image displayed enlarged macrophages with phagocytosed material (Fi g. 2-D). M. ulcerans were distributed over the whole lesion sometimes as smal l extracellular clusters, but mostly internalized by phagocytes (Fig. 2-E; arrows ). Moreover, some macrophages engulfed exceptionally large numbers of bacilli unt il the whole cytoplasm was densely packed, appearing as globi-like structures (Fig. 2- E; arrowhead). Macrophages could be observed while establishing close contact betwee n their cell membrane and single bacteria (Fig. 2-F) and phagocytosing them (Fig. 2- G), respectively. At higher magnification, phagosomes containing densely packed rods could easily be spotted inside these macrophages (Fig. 2-H). In an early ulcerative lesion, four weeks antibioti c therapy led to the development of immense cellular infiltration surrounding the core necrosis (Fig. 2-I). Adjacent to the necrosis, the infiltrate consisted mainly of PMNs a nd macrophages (Fig. 2-J) whereas infiltration further away displayed a chron ic pattern with lymphocytes and some Langhans' giant cells (Fig. 2-K). Formation of granulomatous structures was identified towards the excision margins (Fig. 2-L) sometimes containing foci of eosinophils (Fig. 2-M). Numerous huge bacterial clu sters remained inside the completely destroyed tissue (Fig. 2-N). PMNs were f ound invading this area in vast numbers and encountering some of the bacterial foci (Fig. 2-O). Bacilli appeared still rod-shaped and the great majority were found to be extracellular (Fig. 2-P), nevertheless phagocytes comprising internalized bac teria could also be detected in distance to the main bacterial burden (Fig. 2-Q). In the four weeks treated nodule, numerous CD68+ an tigen presenting cells, mostly revealing macrophage morphology, carried phagosomes with mycobacterial material (Fig. 3-A). On the other hand mycobacteria were nev er observed being internalized by Elastase+ PMNs 3-B). Comparatively few CD6 8+ macrophages with phagocytosed mycobacteria were found in the four we eks treated ulcerative lesion CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 77 and these cells had already developed karyopyknosis , a sign of apoptosis (Fig. 3-C). As in the nodular lesion, there was evidence Elastase+ PMNs containing bacilli, moreover, PMNs and macrophag es were not co-localized in the infiltrate (Fig. 3-D). Mixed acute cellular infiltration in the nodule For a detailed characterisation of the cellular imm une response inside the nodule treated during four weeks with R/S, IHC was perform ed on serial sections. Elastase+ PMNs (Fig. 4-A), CD56+ natural 4-B) CD68+ macrophages (Fig. 4-C) almost abundant . Only few CD4+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 4-D) and some more CD8+ T ytes 4-E) were observed. Single CD20+ B lymphocytes were distribut ed within the mixed infiltration (Fig. 4-F). Large amounts of membrane bound and sol uble CD14, a pattern recognition receptor expressed by different cell ty pes such as macrophages, were displayed throughout the lesion (Fig. 4-G). CD1a+ La ngerhans dendritic cells the papillary . 4-H) as as numerous dendrocytes distributed within the infiltrat ion (Fig. 4-I) could be detected. Moreover, the infiltrated deeper dermis was intersp ersed with considerable amounts of Ki67+ and hyperprolifer ative foci (arrows), respectively (Fig. 4-J). In contrast, in the untreated lesion on ly destroyed remnants of acute response leukocytes such as PMNs (Fig. 4-K), macrop hages (data not shown) and NK cells (data not shown) were observed inside the necrosis. The surrounding tissue stained negative for those cells (data not shown). Mild infiltrates of CD3+ T lymphocytes were found around glands and vessels in vicinity to the necrotic core (Fig. 4-L) mainly appearing to be CD4+ whereas CD8+ staining was entirely negative (data not shown). No CD20+ B lymphocytes were prese nt (data not shown) and only single dermal dendrocytes could be spotted (Fig. 4- M). Distinct bands of inflammatory leukocytes and early granuloma formation in the ulcer The early ulcerative lesion showed distinct infiltr ation zones in vicinity to the necrotic rim of the excised specimens after four weeks R/S t reatment, with each zone having its characteristic cellular subsets (Fig. 5a). CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 78 The first (that is the inner) belt surrounding the necrotic lesion core displayed acute cellular infiltrates mainly consisting of Elastase+ PMNs (Fig. 5b-A) and was marked off from the second (that is the outer) belt by a l ine of CD56+ NK cells (Fig. 5b-B) with the majority expressing Ki67, indicating stron g proliferative activity (Fig. 5b-C). In the second belt strong positive signals for membran e bound and soluble CD14 were obtained (Fig. 5b-D) and towards the outer margins of this zone increasing numbers of both CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5b-E) and CD4+ T cells ( Fig. 5b-F) emerged. CD20+ B lymphocytes were much less frequent in this region, but some small foci were observed in the upper dermis (not shown). Similar t o the untreated nodule, high levels of CD1a+ Langerhans dendritic cells were abu ndant both inside the epidermis and the upper dermis close to vessels (not shown). Additionally, S100+ dermal dendrocytes resided in the outer leukocyte belt aro und the necrosis (Fig. 5b-G). For direct comparison, IHC was performed on an untr eated ulcerative lesion. In the lesions core and its surroundings staining for PMNs (Fig. 5b-H), NK cells (data not shown) and macrophages (Fig. 5b-I) showed, similar as in the nodule, only cellular debris. Staining for dermal dendrocytes and B lymph ocytes was entirely negative (data not shown). Mild infiltrates of CD3+ lymphocy tes with apoptotic phenotype, revealing a CD8+ phenotype (Fig. 5b-J) , were found around the necrosis. In the periphery, tissue was focally heav ily infiltrated with CD8+ T lymphocytes and also some small CD20+ B lymphocyte foci were observed (data not shown). The dermis of the macroscopically healthy appearing margins of the antibiotic treated lesion contained granulomatous structures primarily built by CD8+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 6-A). CD4+ T lymphocytes were spread inside i n smaller numbers (Fig. 6-B) and CD20+ B cell foci could be identified at the ri m (Fig. 6-C) of these aggregates. A huge proportion of lymphocytes stained positive for the activation marker CD45RO (Fig. 6-D) and many leukocytes were identified expr essing the proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 6-G). CD68+ antigen presenting cells wer e scattered throughout the cellular aggregates (Fig. 6-E), not yet developing into foamy, multinucleated Langhans giant cells (Fig. 6-E insert) as observed after eight weeks R/S treatment 25. A similar pattern was detected for the distribution o f S100+ dermal dendrocytes (Fig. 6- F). Interestingly, dense CD20+ B cell accumulations , often in vicinity to sweat glands, could be identified (Fig. 6-H) and a subset appeare d to be Ki67+ due to proliferation (Fig. 6-I). CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 79 Discussion Although provisional WHO guidelines recommend chemo therapy with a combination of R/S for the treatment of all stages of M. ulcerans infection, little is yet known about the local and systemic responses to this therapy. I n a previous study we observed enormous organized local cellular immune responses as well as destruction of mycobacteria in ulcerative lesions after the recomm ended eight weeks of antibiotic treatment 25. This raised more questions regarding the immune p rocesses taking place in the course of R/S therapy and whether ther e are differences between response patterns in early and late stage disease. On this account, we conducted an in-depth pathological study with samples from a nod ular and an early ulcerative lesion excised from patients who had received only four weeks of antibiotic treatment prior to surgery. It is well established that M. ulcerans unlike other mycobacteria appear as extracellular clumps in necrotic connective and adi pose tissue 18,27. Some data also suggest intracellular stages at the periphery of le sions 28. After four weeks of antibiotic therapy, phagocytosis of large numbers o f yet rod-shaped bacilli was observed, possibly still leading to a positive cult ure 26. Whilst high counts of mycobacteria were detected inside phagosomes of mac rophages in the nodule, most bacilli were still located deep inside the necrosis as extracellular clumps in the ulcer. It appears that the extended necrosis in the ulcera tive lesion delays leukocyte entry into the bacterial focus. In lepromatous leprosy, intracellular bacilli are k nown to form structures named globi inside histiocytes which are - together with neurot ropism - a diagnostic feature of this mycobacteriosis 29. We could show for the first time that macrophages internalize M. ulcerans in large numbers during R/S therapy developing a s imilar intracellular globus-like packing as seen in leprosy biopsies. Fu rthermore, after eight weeks antibiotic therapy only bacterial debris instead of rod-shaped bacilli was observed 25. Macrophages thus seem to be capable of degrading in gested mycobacteria during the course of antibiotic treatment. It can be assumed that mycolactone production is re duced or abolished early after the onset of R/S treatment due to bacterial growth arrest or death, respectively. Additionally, chemical instability associated with the unsaturated side chain is anticipated, and the core mycolactone itself has no cytopathic activity 30. We CHAPTER 5. Intracellular M. ulcerans during chemotherapy 80 speculate that mycolactone degrades inside the lesi on, leading to declining toxin levels, allowing the establishment of a local immun e response and survival of macrophages containing intracellular bacteria. While there is evidence for the formation of local leukocyte infiltration in untreated chronic lesions, lack of pronounced inflammatory re sponses is still a histopathological diagnostic criterion in BU 17,18,22,24. In contrast, after four weeks of antibiotic therapy, pronounced leukocyte infiltrati on was apparent mostly consisting of cells related to acute inflammatory responses like PMNs and macrophages. In the case of the ulcerative lesion, chronic infiltrates were already present. Here the belt- like organization of acute and chronic infiltrates surrounding the necrotic core is indicative for sequential waves of leukocyte influx . Granuloma formation and proliferating B lymphocyte c lusters are indicators for an adaptive immune response, like it has been reported for chronic pulmonary tuberculosis 31. After four weeks of R/S we found early granuloma formation and small but highly proliferative B lymphocyte cluster s in the ulcerative lesion. In comparison, after eight weeks of antibiotic treatme nt mature granulomas with Langhans' giant cells and large focal B cell aggreg ations have typically developed 25. This is the first work reporting huge amounts of in tracellular M. ulcerans accompanied by a marked local cellular immune respo nse in patients submitted to R/S treatment. The two cases after four weeks of an tibiotic therapy presented here are outstanding in terms of leukocyte infiltration as well as host-pathogen interaction and provide a first insight into the immune respons e heterogeneity of different antibiotically treated BU stages. Nevertheless pati ent numbers are too small to draw conclusions universally valid for the various forms of Buruli ulcer. Further analysis of stage-specific differences in local immune response s induced by R/S treatment will help to improve treatment strategies.

Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 98 Abstract Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin disease caused b y Mycobacterium ulcerans. Major necrosis with abundant clusters of extracellularly replicating mycobacteria and only minor infiltration are characteristic histopatholog ical features of the disease. Mycolactone, a macrolide exotoxin of M. ulcerans has cytotoxic activities and plays a key role in the development of this pathology. Curr ent treatment strategies include rifampicin-streptomycin chemotherapy with or withou t additional surgery and/or skin- graft. Here we have performed a histopathological analysis of Buruli ulcer lesions excised after 0, 2, 4, 8 or 12 weeks of rifampicin-streptom ycin treatment. Both localisation and morphology of organization of leukocyte infiltrates were monitored. Mycobacteria started to be internalized by phagocytes already after two weeks of treatment and displayed irregular Ziehl Neelsen staining after eight weeks. Acid-fast debris was still found after 12 weeks of chemotherapy in otherwise Ziehl Neelsen negative areas of sections. Cellular infiltrates were already observed after two weeks of chemotherapy and total leukocyte numbers increased during the further course of the treatment. Initial ly unstructured infiltrates converted with time into lymphocyte aggregates, associated wi th granuloma and abscessus formation. CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 99 Introduction Mycobacterium ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer (BU), a necrotizing disease of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue often leading to extens ive ulceration [1,2]. The bacterium produces an ry and cytotoxic properties named mycolactone [3,4,5,6], which is thought to be responsible for most clinical symptoms related to M. ulcerans infection [7,8,9]. Many sub-tropical countries all over the world are affected, but the largest number s of cases are reported from sub- Saharan Africa [2,10,11,12]. Children develop the d isease more often than adults. Whether this is due to more intense exposure or dif ferences in immune status is unclear, since the mode of transmission of BU and p ossible environmental reservoir(s) of the pathogen are still under investi gation [13]. When left untreated, pre-ulcerative forms of BU - n odules, plaques and oedema - break in and form necrotic skin ulcers. Usually the ulcers have deeply undermined edges and enlarge over an extended period of time [ 12,14]. Until an antibiotic combination therapy with rifamp icin and streptomycin (R-S) was recommended by WHO in 2004, surgery was the only ava ilable treatment [15,16]. A clinical trial and observational studies have yield ed promising results with the combination chemotherapy [17,18]. In a previous stu dy we showed that the treatment of patients with ulcerative BU lesions with R-S lea ds to the development of highly structured, ectopic lymphoid tissue [19]. Furthermo re, our histopathological analyses have provided evidence for a different response pat tern in pre-ulcerative lesions (Sch\u00fctte et al, in press). Therefore we investigate d in the present study histopathological changes in early BU lesions - pla que and nodules - after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of R-S treatment and compared results with data from ulcerative lesions. Samples analysed were collected during a c linical trial assessing clinical efficacy of R-S treatment [17] CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 100 Material and Methods Study population Skin tissue samples used in the present study were collected during a clinical trial performed in 2004 assessing clinical efficacy of ri fampicin-streptomycin treatment of early BU lesions [17]. In brief, patients with clin ically diagnosed early BU infection (nodules or plaques) were recruited from two endemi c districts in Ghana. Only patients older than 15 years with a single lesion o f maximum 10 cm in diameter were included after having given written consent. Clinic al diagnosis was confirmed retrospectively by culture, histopathology, visible acid fast bacilli (AFB) and/or positive IS2404 based PCR. Lesions were excised after 0, 2, 4, 8 a nd 12 weeks of daily administration of R-S, respectively, and tiss ue specimens equally split for microbiological and histopathological analysis. Histology and immunohistochemistry Tissue samples were stored in formalin after surgic al excision for various durations until committed to paraffin embedding. Histological and immunohistochemical staining procedures were performed as previously de scribed [19]. In brief, serial sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (HE) or monoclonal antibodies specific for the antibodies (cross-reactive with mycobacterial antigen) was per formed to monitor distribution, localization and morphology of M. ulcerans . Pictures were taken with a microscope equipped with a camera (Leica Microsystems GmbH) or with MIRAX scan (Carl Zeiss AG). Images were saved using Application Suite (Leic a Microsystems GmbH) or MIRAX Viewer and processed with Adobe Photoshop\u00ae CS . CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 101 Results Leukocyte infiltration and aggregation during antib iotic treatment An overview over a representative sample taken afte r eight weeks of chemotherapy displays histopathological features characteristic for antibiotic treated early BU lesions (Figure 1). Three main areas can be disting uished: sub-epidermal infiltrate, necrosis and deep (F ig.1-A1). In all samples varying degrees of necrosis were observed (Fig.1-A2). In th e subcutaneous region very often cellular infiltration and angiogenesis at exceeding ly high levels were present (Fig.1- A3), revealing histological patterns characteristic for healing processes within the severely affected tissue. Secondary tissue damage s uch as neuritis (Fig.1-B1) or extensive haemorrhages due to destruction of vessel epithelia (Fig.1-B2 and -B3) were observed. On the other hand slight eosinophilia and presence of Langhans' giant cells were markers for transition into a heal ing process (Fig.1-B4 and -B5). Strong leukocyte infiltrations cumulated in abscess (Fig.1-C1), A bscesses were of elastase+ PMN origin (Fig.1-C3). As an element characteristic for chronic cellular immune responses, Granuloma formation with Langhans' giant cells was f ound in several lesions of different treatment stages (Fig.1-D1). More commonl y dense lymphocyte clusters, sometimes covering large areas of the sub-epidermal tissue, were observed (no 2, 9, 15; Table 2) (Fig.1-D2). These were present in all but three samples and consisted primarily of CD20+ B lymphocytes (Fig.1-D3), but al so scattered CD3+ T lymphocytes (not shown). The three lesions excised from untreated patients c ontained only low numbers of leukocytes, which were largely (>90%) apoptotic or destroyed. In contrast, the majority of lesions excised after 2 to 12 weeks of R-S treatment showed acute (14/15) and chronic (13/15) infiltrates (Table 1). A high proportion of lesions contained and abscessus-like PMN accumul ations. Moreover, dense lymphocyte congregations were found in every treatm ent group. CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 102 Mycobacterial viability, localisation and morpholog y during chemotherapy Bacterial numbers determined by microscopy and cult ure of tissue homogenate were compared to study loss of viability of M. ulcerans during the course of antibiotic therapy (Table 2). While after two weeks of treatme nt colony forming units (cfu) were still found in all samples analysed, all specimens taken after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of R- S treatment were culture negative. In contrast, bac terial counts in tissue homogenates determined by microscopy were relativel y stable over the entire period of R-S treatment (Table 2). In one culture negative sample, AFB were not found in the tissue homogenate, but in the tissue sections. Another sample was positive for AFB in the homogenate, but negative in histology. T hese discrepancies may be explained by the focal distribution of M. ulcerans within the lesions. Overall numbers of AFB found in the tissue sections were not signif icantly decreasing over time (Table 3). Clumps and/or single extracellular AFB were obs erved. In addition, in most samples variable numbers of bacteria were located i ntracellulary within phagocytes. The ratio between extracellular and intracellular b acteria declined with increasing treatment duration (Table 3). Bacterial localisatio n and morphology at different time- points of antibiotic treatment are shown for repres entative samples in Figure 2. Already after two weeks, strong leukocyte infiltrat ions into regions of bacterial burden were detected at the hypoxic rim of the central nec rosis (Fig.2-A). PMNs were very abundant in areas of high bacterial burden and had phagocytosed rod-shaped bacteria (Fig.2-A1), whereas AFB-containing macroph ages were less frequent at this stage (Fig.2-A2). Some phagocytes carried globi-lik e mycobacterial aggregations commonly observed in leprosy (Fig.2-A3). At four we eks of R-S therapy solid-stained clumps of AFB were observed both inside the necrosi s (Fig.2-B) and the neighbouring PMNs (Fig.2-B2) and macrophages (Fig.2-B3) with internalized bacteria w ere equally abundant. Results from ZN stainings were confirmed by immunohistochem ical staining of mycobacterial antigen (Fig.2-C and -C1). In the group of patients treated for eight weeks sections frequently revealed abscessus formation around bact erial clusters and their phagocytosis (Fig.2-D). At this stage extracellular mycobacterial clusters revealed irregular ZN staining Decomposed intracellular bacteria were found and only occasionally within PMNs (Fig.2-D3). Immunostaining same localisation ZN positive bacterial stru ctures (Fig.2-E), but antigen CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 103 staining remained in contrast to ZN staining solid (Fig.2-E2). After twelve weeks of antibiotic treatment, one sample contained no bacte rial clumps but only few extracellular bacilli (Fig.2-F and -F1). ZN positiv e of macrophages (Fig.2-F2) and PMNs (Fig.2 -F3) in the form of mycobacterial debris. Interestingly, immunostaining sometimes uncovered in serial sections antigen clusters that were ZN negative (Fi g.2-G). Single bacteria could be stained both in necrotic areas (Fig.2-G1) and insid e cellular infiltrations (Fig.2-G2). CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 104 Discussion There may be a constant influx of neutrophils, mono cytes/macrophages and lymphocytes to active BU lesions (Oliveira et al., 2005), but high concentrations of mycolactone around the extracellular foci of M. ulcerans are driving these cells into apoptosis. In this study we show that antibiotic th erapy of BU nodules and plaques leads to local cellular immune responses and phagoc ytosis of the bacteria. Intracellular bacteria were found already after two weeks of treatment, when culture was still positive. Antibiotic treatment may act ra pidly on the bacterial metabolism and interfere with mycolactone production, while comple te killing of bacteria takes more time. Similar findings have been reported for multi drug therapy in leprosy [20]. Declining mycolactone concentrations allow infiltra ting leucocytes to reach the bacterial foci, where they can enhance the anti-myc obacterial activity of the antibiotics. The fact that cultures turned negativ e after four weeks of chemotherapy evidences, that the antibiotics are able to suffici ently penetrate necrotic regions to kill the mycobacteria residing there. This observation i s emphasized by fading ZN staining at coeval solid immunostaining of bacteria l clusters after eight and twelve weeks of therapy. In M. leprae infections the so-called morphological index calculated by counting the numbers of solid-stainin g acid-fast rods, is used as a viability estimation [20]. Development of a similar viability index for M. ulcerans based on the bacteria's morphological changes during ther apy are currently under investigation. Extended necrotic areas, typically containing huge extracellular mycobacterial clusters, were still found in the BU lesions even 1 2 weeks after start of the R-S treatment. While these areas are at least partially washed out after ulceration, tissue debris and huge amounts of mycobacterial antigens a nd immunostimulators remain in the affected tissue after antibiotic therapy of pre-ulcerative lesions. In this respect chemotherapy differs profoundly from surgical treat ment, where necrotic tissue containing the vast burden of mycobacteria is excis ed. This is a feature most likely triggering the strong leukocyte infiltration and ab scessus formation observed in the BU lesions in the course of chemotherapy. Slow reso lution of necrotic areas and massive encounter of immune cells with remaining ba cterial material may explain why re-activation of plaques and/or oedematous form s of BU is observed in some CHAPTER 6. Chemotherapy in early stages of Buruli ulcer 105 patients several weeks after completion of antibiot ic therapy. This reaction is often associated with the sensation of heat and pain and a secondary ulceration, but not with the development of new mycobacterial foci (unp ublished results) [18]. in all lesi ons analysed here may cause a retardation of the healing process. In knock-out mi ce which lack macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells, more rapid repair proce sses and reduced scarring can be observed [22]. On the other hand, macrophages and t heir cytokines are needed to govern granulation tissue formation which relies on angio- and vasculogenesis [23]. Granulation tissue was observed in most of the sampl es as were macrophages. Moreover, eosinophils were found in varying numbers in all lesions. These act as regulators of tissue immune microenvironment and mo dulate the responses from recruited and resident leukocytes [24] .Comparison of our findings with pre-ulcerative early stages of BU presented here with results obta ined with ulcerative lesions during R-S treatment revealed commonalities, but also clea r differences. After eight weeks of R-S treatment, bacterial debris was barely found in ulcerative lesions and necrotic areas were smaller. In contrast to pre-ulcerative l esions infiltrates contained no neutrophils [19], indicating that the lower burden of mycobacterial antigen and necrotic material permits a faster transition from acute to chronic immune response. Taken together our data indicate that persisting my cobacterial antigens and immunostimulators may cause excessive immuno-stimul ation and some healing retardation after successful chemotherapy. Apparent reactivation of the disease in a small proportion of patients after chemotherapy sho uld be carefully analysed, but appears to be related to immunological factors rath er than incomplete killing of the pathogen.

Phase change material for thermotherapy 116 Abstract Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infection of the subcutane ous tissue leading to chronic necrotizing skin ulcers. The causative path ogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans , grows best at 30 \u00b0 C - 33 \u00b0 C and not above 37 \u00b0 C. We explored the safety, tolerability and efficacy of phase change material (PCM), a nove l heat application system for thermotherapy of BU. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a prospective observational single centre proof-of-principle trial in Ayos / Cameroon, six la boratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative Buruli lesions received 28-31 (ulcers 2 cm) or 50-55 (ulcers > 2 cm) days of thermotherapy with the PCM sodium acetate t rihydrate as heat application system. This PCM is widely used in commercial pocke t heat pads, it is easy to apply, rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazard ous to the environment. All patients enrolled in the trial completed treatment. Being completely mobile during the well-tolerated heat application, acceptability of t he PCM bandages was very high. In patients with smaller ulcers, wounds healed complet ely without further intervention. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment. Heat treatment was not associated with marked increases in local inflammation or the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue. One and a h alf years after completion of treatment, all patients are relapse-free. Conclusions/Significance: Our reusable PCM-based heat application device appears perfectly suited to treat BU in endemic cou ntries with limited resources and infrastructure. Trial Registration.

Phase change material for thermotherapy 117 Author Summary Buruli ulcer is an infection of the subcutaneous ti ssue leading to chronic necrotizing skin ulcers. The causative pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans , grows best at 30 \u00b0 C - 33 \u00b0 C and not above 37 \u00b0 C, and this property makes the application of heat a treatment option. We achieved a breakthrough in hea t treatment of Buruli ulcer by employing the phase change material sodium acetate trihydrate as a heat application system for thermotherapy, which is widely used in c ommercial pocket heat pads. It is easy to apply, rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazardous to the environment. Six laboratory reconfirmed patients wi th ulcerative Buruli lesions were included in the proof-of-principle study and treate d for four to six weeks. In patients with small ulcers, wounds healed completely without further intervention. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successf ul heat treatment. Heat treatment was not associated with marked increases in local i nflammation or the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue. One and a half years aft er completion of treatment, all patients are relapse-free. The reusable phase chang e material-based heat application device appears perfectly suited for use in remote Buruli ulcer-endemic areas of countries with limited resources and infra structure. CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 118 Introduction Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic necrotizing disease of skin and soft tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans [1]. The disease starts as a subcutaneous nodule, papule or plaque that eventually ulcerates and progresses ove r months to years. In BU lesions, clumps of extra-cellular acid-fast organisms surrou nded by areas of necrosis are found primarily in subcutaneous fat tissue [2]. M. ulcerans produces a macrolide toxin, mycolactone, which is associated with tissue destruction and local immunosuppression [3]. BU has been reported in >30 countries, but the major burden lies on children living in remote areas of W est Africa associated with swamps and stagnant water bodies. Traditionally wide excis ion of the infected tissue alone was the standard treatment for BU. This is hampered by traumatic interventions, high cost and very high recurrence rates [4]. Chemothera py with streptomycin and rifampicin is currently re-evaluated as an adjunct treatment to surgery and as a therapy in its own right [5,6,7,8]. M. ulcerans differs from most other pathogenic mycobacteria in that it grows best at 30 - 33 \u00b0 C and not above 37 \u00b0 C [9]. This characteri stic feature of the pathogen was first used for therapeutic purposes in the early 19 70s. Meyers et al. treated 8 patients from Zaire maintaining a temperature of approximate ly 40 \u00baC in the ulcerated area for a mean duration of 68 days [10]. There was no evide nce of local recurrence during follow-up periods of up to 22 months. Based on this impressive success rate, WHO guidelines listed the application of heat as a trea tment option for BU [11]. However, the heat application devices employed so far were i mpractical in most endemic countries. Here we describe the use of a cheap and easy to apply phase change material (PCM) device suitable for thermotherapy of BU in countries with limited resources. CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 119 Methods Study participants Eligibility criteria for participants and case defi nition. All patients between 6 and 30 years of age with an ulcer at the lower or upper ar m or leg with a diameter of up to 12 cm suggestive for BU on clinical grounds in the cat chment area of the Buruli treatment center Ayos / Cameroon were candidates fo r inclusion in the study. They were not admitted to the study if any of the follow ing criteria were present: (1) clinical signs and symptoms of communicable diseases other t han BU (fever, weight loss, night sweats, persistent cough, jaundice, pulmonary or myocardial dysfunction, CNS involvement, ascites, pleural effusion), (2) clinic al signs and of non- communicable diseases (myocardial, pulmonary, renal , CNS) and (3) inability to confirm BU using laboratory methods. A BU case was defined as a patient with an ulcer di agnosed as BU on clinical grounds and positive results in at least two of the three laboratory tests (PCR, detection of AFB on microscopy and histopathology) performed. Laboratory confirmation of clinical diagnosis. On day 0 four swabs from the undermined edges and one diagnostic biopsy were tak en from all patients enrolled into the trial on clinical grounds. A second set of biopsies was taken in week 4 of thermotherapy to assess histopathological changes i n response to heat treatment. All samples were investigated by microscopy for acid-fa st changes typical for BU [12] were recorded in the initial bi opsies and the follow-up biopsies in week 4 of thermotherapy. Immediately after performing the punch biopsies, ti ssue samples were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered PFA (paraformaldehyde) for 24h and subsequently transferred to 70% ethanol for short term storage and transport. B iopsies were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5\u00b5m thin sections an d retrieved on glass slides. After dewaxing and rehydration, sections were stained wit h haematoxylin/eosin (HE) and ZN. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed using Vector NovaRED and hae matoxylin. CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 120 The setting and location where the data were collec ted. Volunteers were recruited in the catchment area of the Buruli treatment center a t the hospital Ayos / Cameroon, identified by active and passive case detection. Th e treatment center has a longstanding collaboration with and is supported by Leprosy Relief Emmaus- Switzerland (ALES). It maintains a very well equipp ed and functioning operation theatre, wards for pre- and postsurgical care, phys iotherapy and a school which is of importance because the majority of patients with th is disease are children and convalescence after excision of ulcers and skin gra fting takes many months in the majority of patients. Dr. A. Um Boock, the director of the ALES Bureau R\u00e9gional pour l'Afrique, and his team are very experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with Buruli ulcer, including surgery and s kin grafting. Ethical approval and informed consent. The protocol was approved by the National Ethics Committee of Cameroon and the Ethics Committ ee of the University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Patients were enrolled in the s tudy only after informed written consent was obtained from them or their care provid ers. Interventions Heat application. Commercially available plastic bags filled with th e PCM sodium acetate trihydrate were used. Starters were placed in the bags to initiate the crystallisation process (Fig. 1). Size of filled ba gs is 21 cm x 15 cm x 2 cm with an average weight of 800 g. The melting temperature of the PCM sodium acetate trihydrate is 58\u00b0 C. The unique feature of PCM is it s thermal energy storing capacity combined with an almost constant temperature during the liquid-solid phase transition. This property is widely used in commerc ial pocket heat pads. After cleaning and sterile dressing of the ulcers a heat sensor connected to a data logger (testo 177-T3, testo AG, Lenzkirch, Germany) was placed on healthy skin at the edge of the ulcer. The area of contact between skin and PCM packs was protected by tube gauze and a layer of elastic band age to lower the PCM working temperature from 58\u00b0 C to the therapeutic target tem perature of 40\u00b0 C at skin surface (Fig. 1). Temperatures of 58\u00b0 C do not cause burns when not applied for prolon ged periods of time. Skin temperatures of up to 43\u00b0 C we re accepted and well tolerated for short intervals of time immediately after mounting the PCM bandage. The affected CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 121 skin (ulcer /oedema / induration) plus a safety mar gin of several centimeters was covered by one to four PCM packs per session depend ing on the size of the total area to be treated (Fig. 2). The PCM packs were fix ed with several layers of elastic bandage. A thermal insulation layer, commercially a vailable to insulate hot water pipes, was used to reduce heat loss to the environm ent and to reinforce positioning of the PCM packs (Fig. 1). This allowed patients to move around freely. The 24 hours protocol was as follows: 8.00: Clinical progress as sessment, cleaning and dressing of ulcers and renewal of PCM-packs, photo documentatio n at, on average, 3 day intervals. 12.00: Removal of PCM-packs, dressing of the wound to protect from contamination during a 5 hour pause of heat treatme nt, skin care with fatty cream. 17.00: Additional wound cleaning and dressing, if n eeded, renewal of PCM-packs. 22.00: Renewal of PCM-packs. Clinical observations (appearance of the ulcer and the surrounding heat exposed skin, overall clinical assessment of the patient) w ere recorded daily at the above mentioned time points on case record forms (CRF). T emperature at the skin surface was automatically recorded at 10 minute intervals a nd stored in a small data logger carried by the patients. Temperature data were tran sferred daily to a notebook and checked for therapeutic and safety margins (testo s oftware ComSoft 3.4, testo AG, Lenzkirch, Germany). Patients with small ulcers and without significant oedema (patients 1, 2, 3) received heat treatment for 28-31 days, patients with large ulcers and / or significant oedema (patients 4, 5, 6) for 50-55 days. Study objectives In the current study we tested the hypotheses that (1) PCM-based heat application is safe and comforta ble for patients (2) with PCM based heat application the results of the thermotherapy study of Meyers et al [10] can be reproduced, i.e. primary h ealing of Buruli ulcer without relapse can be achieved Primary outcomes CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 122 (1) Proportion of patients completing 28-31 days of heat treatment in patients with small ulcers ( 2 cm) or 50-55 days in patients with large ulcers (> 2 cm) and ulcers with prominent surrounding oedema (2) Proportion of patients cured 6 months after com pleting heat treatment (including skin grafting where necessary). Cure is defined as complete closure of the wound by epithelialisation or scarification or by skin gr aft. (3) Proportion of patients who are recurrence free 18 months after completing heat treatment Secondary endpoint Histopathological responses in week 4 of thermother apy compared to reference samples at day 0. CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 123 Results Participant flow Seven patients with ulcers suggestive for BU on cli nical grounds were recruited by active and passive case detection. In six of the se ven patients enrolled the diagnosis was laboratory confirmed. Protocol deviations We extended the total duration of heat application of large ulcers (> 2 cm) and ulcers with prominent surrounding oedema from 4 week to 50 -55 days and did not, as originally planned, treat small and large ulcers eq ually for 4 weeks only. This was done even though all ulcers appeared clinically hea led after 4 weeks of heat treatment, independent of size and surrounding oede ma. This decision was taken on the basis of the results of the punch biopsies in w eek 4 of thermotherapy showing residual AFB with intact rod-shaped appearance. Recruitment and follow-up Eligible patients were recruited between February 2 8, 2007 and March 3, 2007. Patients stayed in the hospital during the course o f heat treatment and thereafter until the wound was closed (patients with small ulcers; p atients 1, 2, 3, 4,) or skin grafted (patients with large ulcers; patient 5 and 6). All patients were followed up until 18 months after completion of heat treatment. Baseline data The age range of the seven patients enrolled was si x to 21 years. Three patients had single ulcers on the upper and four had single ulce rs on the lower extremities. Medical history and physical examination revealed n o significant health problem other than BU. In six out of seven patients enrolle d in the study on clinical grounds, diagnosis was laboratory confirmed. The unconfirmed patient was excluded from the analysis (Fig. 2). Outcomes All patients enrolled into the trial completed trea tment. In all patients temperatures at the lesion and over a wide margin of healthy lookin g skin were maintained above CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 124 39\u00b0 C for between 8.4 and 13.2 hours and 40\u00b0 C for between 4.4 and 9.3 hours per day (Fig. 2). Undermined margins collapsed between day 1 and day 3. Epithelialization started in all patients between 4 and 11 days after the start and was almost completed in patients 1, 2, and 3 at the end of heat treatment (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). In particular in patients with oedematous lesio ns (patients 4, 5) white discharge from ulcers was observed during initial treatment f or various lengths of time. The two patients with large defects (patients 5 and 6) had skin grafting after completion of heat treatment (Fig. 3B). All six reconfirmed patients were healed and relaps e-free 18 months after completion of treatment. In the punch biopsies taken prior to start of treat ment, histopathological changes characteristic for BU, such as fat cell ghosts, dee p dermal necrosis and/or psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, were found in s ix patients (Fig. 2). All patients yielded positive semi-quantitative IS2404 real-time PCR results. AFBs were detected in swabs or punch biopsies of 4 out of 6 patients i ncluded in the study. Analysis of serial sections of punch biopsies taken at day 0 and in week 4 of thermotherapy showed, that heat treatment was not a ssociated with marked increases in local inflammation, the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue or haemorrhages. At both time points small numbers of both polymorphonuclear cells as members of the innate and T cells as members of the adaptive immune system were present, with polymorphonuclear cells mainly l ocated around necrotic areas and T cells more confined to areas close to vessels in the upper dermis. Only the lesion of patient 3 contained both on day 0 and in week 4 of thermotherapy mixed cellular infiltrates, which were much more pronounced than i n typical untreated BU lesions. Safety and tolerability of PCM-based heat treatment , adverse events The heat treatment procedure was very well tolerate d by all patients. Patients with one (patients 1, 2, 3, 4) and with two PCM packs (p atient 5) could move around freely and did not feel unacceptably disturbed duri ng their daily activities nor during sleep at night. Patient 6 with four PCM packs also walked with acceptable restrictions and slept largely undisturbed. None of the patients and their guardians requested termination of treatment at any time. Temperatures between 40 - 43\u00b0 C were CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 125 observed only for short intervals of time immediate ly after mounting of the PCM packs without causing unacceptable discomfort. Only initially a few small blisters were occasionally observed. With a simple patient-c ontrolled method the therapeutic target temperature of 40\u00b0 C at skin surface was quic kly reached and maintained without further side effects. CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 126 Discussion Successful treatment of BU with heat has been repor ted in individual patients and small case series since 1950 [10,13,14,15]. This ha s not been carried further into clinical research and practice due to the fact that available heat application systems were cumbersome and not suited for use in developin g countries. We achieved a break through by employing PCM packs as a cheap hea t application system which is rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazard ous to the environment. In this proof-of-principle study we demonstrated that our h eat application system is easy to use and allows the patient to move freely. Family members and the hospital community accepted the treatment very well and favoured it over other treatments currently offered (surgery, antibiotics). Nurses quickly adopted the techniques of mounting the PCM packs and of recharging the packs in boiling water. The only side effects obser ved were sensation of excessive heat for a short period after applying the PCM pack s. Lowering of the temperature at the skin surface by an elastic bandage interposed b etween tube gauze and PCM packs reliably prevented skin irritation and develo pment of blisters, which may occur if the initial temperature at skin surface is less rigorously controlled. With our PCM-based heat application system we repro duced the excellent results of the thermotherapy study of Meyers' group in 1974 [1 0] with significantly shorter heat application times both with respect to length of he at treatment per day (close to 24 hours [39\u00b0 C - 40.5\u00b0 C] vs a mean of 10 hours, range 8.4 - 13.2 hours [ 39\u00b0 C]) and to total heat application time (28 to 115 days vs 28 t o 55 days). Since both systems worked at the same temperature range measured at sk in surface, the minimum length of heat application to achieve healing of BU appears to be in the range of our heat treatment schedule or even shorter. The initial clinical improvement of ulcerative lesi ons in our series was as fast as in the patient series of Meyers et al. As early as three d ays after initiation of heat treatment undermined ulcer margins collapsed and the skin att ached to the underlying subcutaneous tissue with re-epithelialization start ing at the edges. Discharge of the wound decreased over various lengths of time. Firm attachment of the affected skin CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 127 was complete only after discharge stopped. By using heat treatment alone no viable tissue is lost and even the overarching margins at undercutting edges are often rescued. Lesions were clinically inactive in all of our patients with very good granulation and re-epitheliazation responses after 28 days of heat treatment. In one of our patients (patient 6) non-viable tissue exten ded far beyond the ulcerated area, which had to be excised before skin grafting. In th is patient and one other patient with a large defect (patient 5) skin grafting was perfor med after a good granulation response had been achieved. Currently, all our pati ents are relapse-free 18 months after completion of heat therapy. Rifampicin/streptomycin chemotherapy of BU is assoc iated with the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue in the lesions [16]. In som e patients, effects reminiscent of the immune reconstitution syndromes observed in tub erculosis and leprosy patients after highly active antiretroviral therapy [17] are observed. In contrast, heat treatment did not lead to massive increases in local inflamma tion and this less vigorous response may favour rapid re-epithelialization. Als o haemorrhages, which are regarded as negative indicators for uncomplicated w ound healing [18] were not observed. Results of two pilot studies, the study of Meyers e t al. in the 1970s [10] and our study, demonstrate that heat is a highly efficaciou s therapy for M. ulcerans disease. Use of PCM packs represents a break through for the rmotherapy with respect to its practicality in endemic areas with poor infrastruct ure. Further optimization of the heat treatment schedule should make it suitable for comm unity application. CHAPTER 7. Phase change material for thermotherapy 128 Acknowledgments We thank engineer Dr. M.

Immune response after heat treatment of BU 136 Abstract Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin disease caused b y Mycobacterium ulcerans . These bacteria grow best at temperatures of 30 - 33 \u00b0 C an d produce the cytotoxic macrolide toxin mycolactone, to which most of the c linicopathological symptoms are related. To date, daily intake of rifampicin and st reptomycin and/or surgical excision of the affected tissue are the standard treatments. Therapy with local application of temperatures arou nd 40\u00b0 C using a phase change material-based heat application system is currently under evaluation. Here we have analysed punch biopsies taken at treatment days 0 a nd 28 to monitor histopathological changes and local immunological r eactions during heat therapy. While massive infiltration and development of ectop ic lymphoid tissue is observed during antibiotic therapy, the extent of total leuk ocyte infiltration did not increase during thermotherapy. While the number of PMNs decr eased, T cells became more abundant. This may favour a rapid transition from i nflammation to healing, as indicated by the clinical response to heat treatmen t, which was characterised by an extraordinarily rapid re-epithelization and healing process. CHAPTER 8. Immune response after heat treatment of BU 137 Introduction Buruli ulcer (BU) is a dermatological infection wit h Mycobacterium ulcerans leading to chronic necrotizing skin ulcers. The highest incide nce rates are reported from countries of Central and Western Africa with the ma jority of cases being children 1. When left untreated the infection spreads locally a nd can destroy huge parts of the patient's body surface. Treatment with antibiotics and surgery is time-consuming and difficult, because most affected communities are lo cated in remote areas of the developing countries 2. Spontaneous healing has been reported though is n ot commonly observed and those individuals usually exh ibit tremendous scarring leading to joint contractures and disabilities 3. M. ulcerans grows best at relatively low temperatures around 3 0\u00b0 C and already in the 1970s Meyers et al conducted a small trial on local heat application as treatment option. Results were very promising as patients cou ld be cured without any further surgical therapy required, but the heat application device used was electricity dependent with a complicated thermostat constructio n 4. Recently, Junghanss et al performed proof-of-principle trial with six patient s with laboratory reconfirmed ulcerative BU lesions in Cameroon with a new low-te ch approach of heat application. Plastic bags filled with sodiumacetatetrihydrate, a cheap and non-toxic phase-change material (PCM), were used to maintain a stable temp erature of around 40\u00b0 C at skin level to prevent M. ulcerans from proliferation and toxin production (Junghanss et al. 2008, submitted). The temperature sensitivity of M. ulcerans favours development of lesions in the skin and underlying tissue where mycolactone causes prog ressing dermal necrosis, destruction of infiltrating immune cells and a supp ression of local immune responses 5-7. In active BU lesions, intra-lesional cellular imm une responses are usually mild to absent and the vast majority of bacteria are extrac ellularly clustered in the necrotic subcutaneous tissue 8,9. Very early lesions or the macroscopically healthy margins of chronic BU lesions may contain a more pronounced le ukocyte infiltration and here intracellular bacteria can occasionally be observed 10-12. In previous studies we could show that antibiotic therapy with rifampicin and st reptomycin does not only kills the bacilli but also reverses local immunosuppression. During therapy a massive increase of leukocyte infiltration in the lesions a s well as the development of ectopic organised lymphoid aggregates is observed 9. CHAPTER 8. Immune response after heat treatment of BU 138 Here we report on the local cellular immune respons e in BU lesions during thermotherapy. In patients treated with the PCM-bas ed heat application device the clinical picture was ameliorating extraordinarily r apid. Wound closure was achieved by self-healing in small ulcers or skin grafting in larger lesions (Junghanss et al. 2008, submitted). Our histopathological evaluation i ndicates that lack of massive local immune responses favour rapid transition from inflammation to tissue healing. Materials and Methods Six laboratory-confirmed BU cases were included in this study and admitted to local heat treatment of the affected body parts as has be en described (Junghanss et al 2008). Briefly, plastic bags filled with the PCM so diumacetatetrihydrate were applied to the wounds and a therapeutic temperature of abou t 40\u00b0 C was kept at skin surface level for 15-20 hours per day for at least four wee ks. Temperature was recorded automatically every 10 min for safety reasons and w ounds cleaned and dressed three times a day to avoid additional super-infecti on. While 4/6 lesions healed completely without any other medical intervention a part from dressing and heat application, 2/6 required additional skin graft to close the large ulcerative areas without further delay to circumvent exaggerated sca rring. All individuals remained relapse free within 12 months of follow-up. Biopsie s and swabs were taken and assessed for presence of AFB by ZN staining, histop athology, as well DNA by IS2404 real-time PCR. 4mm punch biopsies were taken at days 0 and 28 from the lesion margins and fixed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde for 24h. Ti ssue samples were stored in 70% ethanol and transferred to Switzerland, where s amples were further processed as previously described 9. Paraffin embedded tissue was cut into 5\u00b5m thin se ctions. After dewaxing and rehydration, sections were stain ed with Ziehl Vector\u00ae NovaRED. CHAPTER 8. Immune response after heat treatment of BU 139 Results Serial sections from punch biopsies taken at days 0 and 28 from the margins of the six ulcerative lesions were stained with HE and ZN. At day 0, the samples taken from the three small ulcers showed only slight signs of necrosis and no AFB were detected. In these lesions the infection and tissue destruction thus had not yet progressed deeply into the tissue adjacent to the b order of the ulcers. However, PCR performed on swab material was positive for IS2404 and one out of these three small ulcers was also AFB positive. The biopsies from two of three patients with larger ulcers exhibited histopathological changes, i.e. extensive necrosis of the adipose tis sue in the absence of inflammation, characteristic for undermined edges of BU lesions. In the third patient with a larger lesion necrosis was associated with a much stronger leukocyte infiltration than is commonly found in BU lesions. Compared to the corresponding sample taken at day 0 , the biopsy taken on day 28 showed rather a reduction than an increase in cellu lar infiltration (Fig.1-c & -d). On day 0 infiltrates consisted primarily of histiocyte s with only few lymphocytes or PMNs and most of the cells were apoptotic/necrotic (Fig. 1-c). In contrast, on day 28 the infiltration contained in addition to histiocytes a high proportion of T lymphocytes (Fig.1-d). Already without treatment on day 0 giant cells but no granulomas were found in the deeper dermis (Fig.1-e) and the sub-ep idermal layer revealed vasculitis and strong infiltration of the papillary dermis (Fi g.1-f). After 28 days of heat treatment both the deeper dermis (Fig.1-g) and the sub-epider mal region (Fig.1-h) contained scarring tissue and elevated levels of fibroblasts building new connective tissue. When stained with ZN for acid-fast bacilli only the biopsy from day 0 comprised small clusters of extracellular AFB inside the necrotic t issue whereas no AFB were found in the biopsy from day 28 (Fig.1-i). The largest ulcer treated within the framework of t his study showed signs of super- infection, such as bad odour and greenish necrosis at the time of admission (Fig.2-a). Swabs taken from the undermined edges of the lesion were strongly positive for AFB and revealed heavy superinfection (Fig.2-b). After 28 days, undermined margins had reattached to the underlying tissue (Fig.2-c), the superinfection was eliminated and only a few AFB were left (Fig.2-d). CHAPTER 8. Immune response after heat treatment of BU 140 To monitor changes in the composition of the cellul ar infiltrates associated with heat treatment we characterised the infiltrating cells i n biopsies from two lesions, one small ulcer and one large ulcer. On day 0 the deep dermal necrosis in the biopsy from the small ulcer showed mild mixed infiltration (Fig.3-a) primarily consisting of Elastase+ (Fig.3-b) and very few CD3+ T lympho cytes (Fig.3-c). On day 28 the deep dermal infiltration was very low (Fig.3-d) but the sub-epidermal area exhibited increased cellular infiltration mainly ar ound vessels (Fig.3-e). Compared to day 0 the density of Elastase+ PMNs was strongly re duced (Fig.3-f), but the infiltrates in the sub-epidermal area comprised CD3+ T lymphocy te clusters (Fig.3-g). On day 0 the biopsy from the large ulcer showed a mi nor infiltration in its extended necrotic core (Fig.3-h). Elastase+ PMNs located aro und the and connective tissue in the deeper dermis (Fig.3-i) owed often had apoptotic/necrotic appearance (Fig.3-j). CD3+ T lymphocytes were only found around some vessels of the sub-epidermal tissue (Fig.3-k). The biopsy take n on day 28 still contained necrotic areas in the deeper dermal layer and cellu lar infiltration remained low (Fig.3- l) as were the numbers of Elastase+ PMNs (Fig.3-m). In the upper dermis some CD3+ T lymphocyte foci could be found near glands a nd vessels (Fig.3-n). In both lesions, numbers of CD14+ macrophages/monoc ytes were very low on day 0 and showed only marginal increase on day 28 (not sh own). While CD20+ B cells were absent on day 0, some scattered CD20+ cells co uld be found on day 28 (not shown). CHAPTER 8. Immune response after heat treatment of BU 141 Discussion/Conclusion Local inflammation of the skin was not evidently al tered during thermotherapy, which is in accordance with the clinical observation that lesions did not cause increased pain. Both PMNs, as members of the innate, and T ce lls, representing adaptive immune response, were present with PMNs mainly loca ted around bacteria containing dermal necrosis and T cells confined to vessels in the upper dermis. Total amounts of infiltrating cells were rather stable or decreasing after four weeks of treatment, leading to the assumption that infection can be cleared without major cellular immune modulations necessary. The relative ratio of PMNs vs. T lymphocytes shifted from almost equal amounts towar ds a clear T cell dominance over time. In skin samples from antibiotically treated patient s, vast haemorrhages were observed 9 as a negative indicator for uncomplicated wound he aling 13 which was not the case during heat application. Furthermore, stud ies on knock-out mice showed that the depletion of PMNs enhances the re-epitheli zation of wounds 14. These data are in concordance with the observed enduring disch arge from the ulcers together with a highly efficient healing process of the lesi ons during heat therapy. Mycolactone is likely to be the main causative for the typical clinical and histological symptoms observed in Buruli ulcer patients. Althoug h it has been discovered almost a decade ago 5 data about its behaviour inside the wounds includi ng released amount, diffusion kinetics and chemical stability i s difficult to gain and still fragmentary. Observational data indicate instability of the unsaturated fatty acid side chain of the toxin and cytotoxic properties are los t within few weeks when stored at 4\u00b0 C. The question arises whether heat application n ot only breaks mycolactone production by influencing the bacterial metabolism but even enhances degradation of already released toxin molecules. This could be a p ossible explanation for the astonishingly quick oedema reduction and re-epithel ization of the lesions. Histopathological results in the present thermo the rapy study were in stark contrast to findings from antibiotic treated patients were a co unterproductive immunopathology should be considered possible 9. The fact that punch biopsies are not enough to mirror the total infiltration should be regarded wh ich is a clear interpretation limitation CHAPTER 8. Immune response after heat treatment of BU 142 taking in account the great heterogeneity usually o bserved between different areas within a lesion 9,15,16. Since all patients showed similarities in both hi stopathological changes and clinical presentation this might be an indication for heat application being a potent tool to cure BU lesions without majo r tissue damage. In combination with antibiotic therapy it could prevent disproport ionate local leukocyte reactions and redundantise additional surgical interventions. CHAPTER 8.

Growth inhibition of M. ulcerans 150 Mycobacterium ulcerans , a due to its exotoxin mycolactone [1], causes one of the most pr evalent mycobacteriosis worldwide (Buruli ulcer). Infected individuals suff er from progressing dermal lesions which frequently lead to disabilities as a result o f extensive scarring and joint contractures. Currently recommended therapy include s circumstantial surgical excision of the affected tissue and/or eight weeks daily administration of rifampicin and streptomycin [2]. Surgical treatment is very expensive and time-consu ming and needs a well equipped and maintained infrastructure. Streptomycin has to be injected daily into the muscles, which is not very well tolerated by superstitious A frican populations and causes additional suffering and risks, especially for smal l children who are most often affected [3]. Furthermore, both antibiotics are fro nt-line drugs for TB treatment and major concerns arise regarding resistant M. tuberculosis strains developing in co- infected patients due to the relatively short thera py duration. Novel therapeutic approaches or drugs are therefore urgently needed and are currently under investigation [4,5]. We tested the in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity of compound DS-1 in liquid M. ulcerans cultures. Details of the compound such as synthesis or structure can not be disclosed to date due to patent issues. The compound was active against M. tuberculosis in previous studies. 20 BacTAlert MB Blood Culture flasks supplemented w ith 1ml MB/BacT Enrichment Fluid and 1.5ml MB/BacT Antibiotic Supplement each were inoculated with M. ulcerans strain ifik-1066089 and incubated at 32\u00b0 C for 2-3 weeks. When exponential growth phase was reached cultures were harvested an d bacterial pellets retrieved by centrifugation for 15 min. After washing with PBS p ellets were pooled and resuspended in Middlebrook 7H9-T freezing medium by vortexing aliquots containing sterile glass beads. Suspensions were calibrated to OD600 1, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0 C until further use. Growth inhibition was measured using Microplate Alam ar blue assay (MABA) in a 96 well plate format [6]. An appropriate amount of sto ck solution was diluted 1:4 in Middlebrook 7H9 complete medium (containing glycero l, Tween and OADC/ADS). 200\u00b5l of sterile deionised water was added to the o uter-perimeter wells of the 96 well plates and the remaining wells were filled with 100 \u00b5l 7H9GC broth. 100\u00b5l of 4x drug solutions were serially diluted in duplicates using a multi-channel pipette starting from CHAPTER 9. Growth inhibition of M. ulcerans 151 column 2 and 100\u00b5l excess medium was discarded from the wells in column 10. Column 11 was used for negative and positive growth controls. 100\u00b5l prediluted bacterial culture was added to all wells except the negative growth controls. Plates were incubated at 28-30\u00b0 C for 6 days without CO2 su pply under non-rocking conditions. 50 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 1:1 mixture o f 10XAlamar Blue and 10% Tween 80 was provided to all wells and plates incubated f or another 4-6 days depending on intensity of colour change. A digital camera was us ed to document results and plates evaluated based on the observed colour change. Thre e independent experiments were performed for each starting dilution. Several batches of rifampicin and streptomycin were tried as positive control in this assay, but the M. ulcerans strain used here was not susceptible to these drug s for unknown reason. The strain was very well adapted to BacTec, indeed keeping its ability to produce mycolactone but passing into log phase within 2 weeks after inoculation. Compound DS-1 had a MIC 90 of 0.016 - 0.025 \u00b5g/ml or 4.6 - 7.4 \u00b5mol/ml for M. ulcerans strain ifik9066089 in 7H9-GT medium. Coloric change s of the indicator dye Alamar blue were not as clear-cut as observed with faster growing mycobacteria [7]. This is mainly due to the fact that replication of M. ulcerans takes much longer from few days up to several weeks and therefore metaboli c activity is lower. Although proliferation of ifik9066089 could be accelerated t hrough adaptation to BacTec medium over a long period, the change to 7H9-GT medi um obviously slowed it down again. Cytotoxicity assays both in cell culture and animal model as well as bioavailability studies have to be performed to evaluate whether co mpound DS-1 or its derivatives are suitable candidates for antimycobacterial drug development. Furthermore, the MIC 90 of a range of other mycobacteria will be tested. The here presented data disclose that compound DS-1 is stable in liquid mycobacterial culture over weeks without loss of it s antibacterial activity, very efficiently inhibiting growth of M. ulcerans . The main goal is to obtain a save drug which is orally administered, acting rapidly and ca n be produced at low costs. Compound DS-1 may represent a suitable lead structu re for the development of a novel antimycobacterial drug to treat Buruli ulcer patients. CHAPTER 9. Growth inhibition of M. ulcerans 152 Figure1.

Diagnos is via mAbs against 18kD shsp 1 56 Introduction Buruli ulcer is a chronic necrotizing disease of sk in and soft tissue caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans . The disease starts as a subcutaneous nodule, papule, or plaque that eventually ulcerates and progresses over months to years 1. After tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli ulcer is the third most common mycobacterial infection in immunocompetent humans. People of all ages, races, and socioeconomic class are susceptible, but the main burden of disea se falls on children living in sub- Saharan Africa 2. Buruli ulcer has mainly been reported in countrie s with tropical and subtropical climates, but it may also occur in some regions where it has not yet been recognized. The full extent of the Buruli disease burden is unk nown because this disease occurs primarily in remote and rural areas. The numbers of cases reported in some countries of West Africa are substantial. Although not generally a fatal condition, BU lesion s can become extensive. When diagnosis and treatment are delayed, sufferers are frequently left with lon g-term physical and cosmetic disabilities. In a known area of endem icity, an experienced person can diagnose BU on clinical grounds. Any two of the following findings are required to confirm clinical diagnosis: (i) acid-fa st bacilli (AFB) in a smear M. ulcerans , (iii) pathognomonic histopathology (contiguous coagulation necrosis and the presence of AFB), or (iv) the presence of M. ulcerans DNA as detected by PCR 3. Culture confirmation may take 8 to 12 weeks and treatment needs to be initiated much sooner than this to ensure an optimal outcome for the patient. The use of PCR for diagnosis of BU has been a major step forward, most commonly targeting IS 2404 , a multicopy transposase 4. However, this technique has to be performed in a laboratory with high standards to avoid false positives. Histopathology is a reliable diagnostic tool, but certainly a technically demanding method. Among the tests recommended for t he confirmation of a suspected case of Buruli ulcer (BU), only microscop y is simple, less costly and within the competence of peripheral treatment centres 5. Broad antigenic cross-reactivity between mycobacter ial species represents a major problem for the development of new tests to identif y M. ulcerans with high specificity and sensitivity. In a previous work we identified t he highly immunogenic 18kD small heat shock protein (shsp) of M. ulcerans , which has no homologues in M. bovis and CHAPTER 10. Diagnos is via mAbs against 18kD shsp 1 57 M. tuberculosis , and described humoral responses of individuals exposed to M. ulcerans on the basis of this antigen 6. We produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against this particular protein which recognize M. ulcerans antigen preparation in Western Blot and may become useful in the diagnosis of BU. Here we present analysis of mAbs against M. ulcerans 18kD shsp regarding their suitability to monitor M. ulcerans infection or exposure. We could show that these mAbs detect M. ulcerans in culture and tissue with high sensitivity and sp ecificity and may be used in future for the development of an ant igen capture assay to rapidly diagnose M. ulcerans infection. CHAPTER 10. Diagnos is via mAbs against 18kD shsp 1 58 Results Expression of 18kD shsp under different growth cond itions We have evaluated the potential of a monoclonal ant i-18kD antibody with very limited cross-reactivity with other mycobacterial species, namely M. chelonae 6 to detect M. ulcerans inside BU lesions. First, we assessed the expression of 18kD shsp in vitro under different growth conditions mimicking the change between environment and host. M. ulcerans were grown on LJ-medium at 28\u00b0 C or 32\u00b0 C under aerobe and at 32\u00b0 C under anaerobe conditions, and protein lysates loaded onto a SDS-G el. Mycobacterial proteins were retrieved by beat-beating with 1% SDS solution and another beat-beating of the solid phase with 5% SDS solution. Ponceau staining showed similar protein levels for all lanes (Fig.1a). In the 1% SDS fraction 18kD protein could only be detected under 32\u00b0 C anaerobic conditions, but the 5% SDS fraction revealed also a certain expression in the 28\u00b0 C and 32\u00b0 C culture (Fig.1b). T aken together 18kD seems to be constitutively expressed, but expression levels may vary with growth conditions. Evaluation of different staining techniques to dete ct in vitro grown M. ulcerans with a monoclonal anti-18kD antibody (DD3.6) We performed immunohistochemistry with the monoclon al anti-18kD antibody DD3.6 on two different African M. ulcerans strains, namely ifik and afr2, from culture grown at 32\u00b0 C on LJ-medium and several negative controls. Both M. ulcerans cultures showed positive staining (Fig.2a) whereas other myc obacterial species, namely M. marinum , M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, remained negative (Fig.2b). The ifik strain was used to compare different staining methods for sensitivity and specificity. Peroxidase-based staining with Vector NovaRed using a horse anti-mouse secondary antibody revealed bacterial cluster with blebbing of 18kD containing matrix (Fig.2c; left panel). Single bacteria sprouting fro m huge culture clumps were easily identified (Fig.2c; right panel). Fluorescence stai ning with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody labelled with fluorofore Alexa48 8 gave a bright signal at lower magnifications (Fig.2d; left panel) and clearly lab elled shsp (Fig.2d; right panel). Staining with FastRed u a horse anti-mouse secondary antibody labelled with alkaline phosphatase gave a brighter signal compared to (c) and (d) both in bright field and fluorescence micro scopy (Fig.2e; left panel). At higher CHAPTER 10. Diagnos is via mAbs against 18kD shsp 1 59 magnification a high background noise was observed and no clear staining of bacilli could be obtained (Fig.2e; right panel). Secondary antibodies were all manufactured by Vector Laboratories. To assess the antibody's potential as diagnostic to ol we used different immunohistochemistry techniques to detect M. ulcerans in skin tissue from BU patients. Staining with Vector NovaRed gave a brigh t, background-free signal (Fig.3a-i). Higher magnification revealed a very di stinct staining of the surface-bound 18kD shsp identifying single organisms within clust ers (Fig.3a-ii). Polar accumulation of the protein was found in a proportion of bacteri a which showed signs of decomposition (Fig.3a-iii). With Alexa488 fluoresce nce staining bacteria were efficiently labelled but auto-fluorescent erythrocy tes (arrow) inside the tissue interfered with the bacterial staining and reduced sensitivity (Fig.3b-i). The close-up displayed equally sensitive surface staining of 18k D shsp as with Vector NovaRed (Fig.3b-ii). The brightest staining both in bright field and was obtained with the phosphatase-based FastRed staining (Fig.3c -i). A spotted staining pattern was observed not allowing identification of single bacteria (Fig.3c-ii). Furthermore, false positive background staining of tissue compar tments was produced (not shown). CHAPTER 10. Diagnos is via mAbs against 18kD shsp 1 60 Discussion As diagnosis of BU is usually based on clinical exa mination and unspecific staining of acid-fast bacilli, developing a rapid diagnostic te st to identify M. ulcerans infections with high specificity and sensitivity is a prioriti zed topic in BU research. In the present work we evaluated the immunodominant 18kD shsp of M. ulcerans and a monoclonal antibody against this antigen for their potential to be used as diagnostic tools. The environment harbours unknown mycobacterial spec ies that might facilitate serum antibody production in humans and therefore c ontribute as well to false positive results based on cross-reactive serum anti bodies. Diagnosis of BU based on specific monoclonal antibodies against the native M. ulcerans 18kD shsp would circumvent those issues. In a former publication of our group monoclonal antibodies against this protein was raised in mice and showed no cross-reactivity to other mycobacterial species except M. chelonae in Western Blot analysis 6. We could reconfirm these results with IHC of different mycob acterial cultures. It has been shown that M. ulcerans grows more efficient and rapid under low oxygen concentration 7. Moreover, expression of heat shock proteins is co mmonly up- regulated under hypoxic conditions or due to elevat ed temperature 8. Accordingly, 18kD shsp expression seems to be up-regulated when culture conditions were changed from 28\u00b0 C aerobic towards 32\u00b0 C anaerobic. W e speculate that these findings might reflect the natural situation, where the bacteria have to adjust their metabolism both to an environmental reservoir (low temperature, high oxygen) as well as to a human or animal host (elevated tempera ture, reduced oxygen). Increased resolution and staining intensity inside BU tissue samples compared to bacteria cultured on LJ-plates further supports thi s hypothesis. Fluorescence staining gives a very good contrast fo r identification of single bacteria but the complex organization of the skin, which car ries auto-fluorescent structures such as erythrocytes, confuses the readout and may lead to false positivity. The brightest staining assessable in both bright field and fluorescence microscopy can be achieved with phosphatase-based FastRed staining, b ut specificity is very low as also nuclei and other structures become lightly sta ined. The best working procedure is peroxidase-avidin/streptavidin-based immunohisto chemistry with the substrate Vector NovaRed, which can be assessed in bright fie ld microscopy and provides high specificity and sensitivity without background nois e. Morphology of single M. ulcerans CHAPTER 10. Diagnos is via mAbs against 18kD shsp 1 61 inside and around bacterial clusters can be visuali zed with this technique. Furthermore, decomposing bacilli developing polar a ccumulation of 18kD can be observed. This is probably due to loss of cytoplasm and subsequent collapse of the cell wall which results in the \"beaded\" appearance of bacteria. The anti-18kD antibody DD3.6 specifically identifie s M. ulcerans in culture as well as in tissue and we will assess the possibility to det ermine viability of M. ulcerans via this method. Furthermore, a rapid diagnostic test s uitable for sample analysis in the field may be developed using monoclonal antibodies a gainst this protein. CHAPTER 10.

Rev iew 168 Abstract Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin disease caused b y Mycobacterium ulcerans . Major necrosis with abundant clusters of extracellularly replicating mycobacteria and only minor leukocyte infiltration are characteristic his topathological features of the disease. Mycolactone, a cytotoxic macrolide exotoxi n of M. ulcerans plays a key role in the development of this pathology. Antimicrobial therapy, such as rifampicin/streptomycin that was recently introduce d, appears to lead to phagocytosis of mycobacteria and massive leukocyte infiltration which culminates in the development of ectopic lymphoid structures in the l esions. While the curative effect of the antibiotic treatment may be supported by immune defense mechanisms, persisting mycobacterial antigens and immunostimula tors occasionally also seem to cause apparent reactivation of the disease. This ap pears to be related to excessive immunostimulation rather than incomplete killing of the pathogen. Introduction Epidemiology of BU First reports about extending cutaneous ulcers in t he Ugandan population came from Sir Albert Cook in 1897 indicating that BU was alre ady present at that time in Africa [1]. In 1937 the disease was first recognized in Ba irnsdale in Victoria, Australia [2] and in 1948 McCallum et al were able to culture and identify Mycobacterium ulcerans as the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (named after the Buruli County of Ugan da, where a BU epidemic occurred in the 1960s) is the third most common myc obacterial infection in immunocompetent people [4]. BU has been found by no w in more than 30 tropical and subtropical countries worldwide [5]. Endemic fo ci are usually linked to wetlands and riverine areas, and especially in many regions of West-Africa including Benin, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Ghana the numbers of rep orted BU cases have dramatically increased in recent years [6,7,8]. Outb reaks appear to be related to environmental changes and an increased exposure of affected populations [9,10]. Although the disease is known to develop in all age groups with a nearly equal gender distribution, children aged between 5 and 15 make up the majority of patients CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 169 [11,12]. Occasional clustering of cases within one family may reflect a common source of infection or increased genetic susceptibi lity to infection rather than human- to-human transmission [13]. It is commonly believed that M. ulcerans is an environmental mycobacterium and that micro-traumata of the skin during fishing, farming or washing activities represent entry-sites for infection [14]. However, it is not clear, whether the natural reservoir relevant for M. ulcerans infection in humans has already been identified. A quatic plants are known to carry bio-film formations of M. ulcerans [15] and several groups of aquatic animals, such as aquatic insects, mollu sks, frogs and fish have been found associated with M. ulcerans . Recently, the first successful isolation of M. ulcerans from an environmental source, a water strider coll ected in West-Africa, has been published [16]. Insects such as mosquitoes and biting aquatic hemiptera have been implicated as vectors [17,18], but positivity for M. ulcerans may only be an indicator for the presence of the pathogen in the e nvironment and not for a role of the insects in transmission [19,20]. Ulcerative lesions caused by M. ulcerans have been described not only in humans, but also in wild and domestic animals [21,22,23]. Clinical presentation of BU BU is primarily an infection of the subcutaneous ad ipose tissue. Most commonly it starts as a painless, movable subcutaneous nodule o r papule adherent to the skin (Figure1). The painless nature of progressive BU se ems to be due to nerve damage at the site of the lesions [24]. All parts of the b ody can be affected, but most lesions are located at the extremities. Thermosensitivity o f M. ulcerans [25] seems to favor development of skin lesions of the limbs. Early les ions may either heal spontaneously or break down centrally and form a necrotic skin ul cer. Other manifestations of early disease are large plaques or edema, which often ext end rapidly, eventually leading to large ulcerations [26,27]. Usually the ulcers have deeply undermined edges and enlarge over an extended period of time (Figure 1). They are often painless, systemic symptoms are largely absent and involvement of visc eral organs has not been described [26]. After destruction of skin and soft tissue, reactive osteitis or osteomyelitis may develop [28]. A subset of patient s develops multiple skin lesions, and lymphohematogenous spread of the mycobacteria m ay also lead to metastatic osteomyelitis [27]. After extended periods of progr essive ulceration, the necrotic CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 170 stage of the disease may cease and lesions may heal spontaneously. Scarring close to joints often result in contractures and severe f unctional limitations [29]. Since M. ulcerans isolates from the same geographical origin are gen etically largely monomorphic [30,31], variations in disease progress ion and severity observed within a particular endemic area are most likely related t o host factors. Treatment of BU Until recently, surgical excision of lesions with a wide margin including healthy appearing tissue was the only recommended treatment for all stages of BU [11,12,21]. While for pre-ulcerative lesions primar y closure after wide excision is possible, split skin autografting after development of granulation tissue is required for larger lesions. Recurrence rates between 6% to 47% have been reported after surgical treatment [32,33,34] and adjunct antibioti c therapy has therefore sometimes been implemented [35]. Recurrences may be caused by small numbers of M. ulcerans that have spread to non-excised macroscopically he althy tissue surrounding the primary lesion [36]. Since 2004 WHO recommends a dual antibiotic therapy with oral rifampicin (10 mg/kg) and i. m. streptomycin (15 mg/kg) administer ed daily for at least eight weeks [37]. For nodular lesions it has been shown that cu lture turns negative after four weeks of this chemotherapy [38]. Results of a first published observational study are encouraging [39]. Of 215 treated patients, 102 were treated exclusively with antibiotics. 113 had to be treated with antibiotics plus surgical excision and skin grafting. One year after antibiotic treatment was c ompleted, only 3 of the 208 retrieved patients had a recurrence [39]. Since bot h streptomycin and rifampicin treatment can be associated with side effects [40], search for alternatives, in particular for a fully oral drug treatment is ongoi ng. Even if showing reasonable antimicrobial activity in vitro , some potential alternative drugs such as macrolid es and fluoroquinolones, had no satisfactory curative effe ct in experimental animal models for BU [41,42,43]. In contrast, moxifloxacin and cl arithromycin, have shown bactericidal activity in mice [44]. Other topical tr eatments including application of heat [45], clay [46], nitrite [47], hyp erbaric oxygen [48], and even honey [49] have been suggested. CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 171 Virulence of M. ulcerans Evolutionary origin of M. ulcerans Comparative genomic analyses have shown that M. ulcerans has developed from a progenitor of the aquatic environmental mycobacteri um M. marinum [30,31,50] . In contrast , M. marinum only causes self-limiting granulomatous infections in Acquisition of the virulence plasmid mycolactone [30,31,51], massive gene decay (loss of 1.1 Mb of genomic DNA) and pseudogene formation [50] are hallmarks of the development of M. ulcerans into a pathogen that causes chronic infections. Reductive evolution indicates t hat M. ulcerans is adapting to a new niche environment. Gain of the immunosuppressiv e toxin mycolactone is accompanied by loss of highly immunogenic proteins [52], suggesting an adaptation to survival in host environments that are screened by immunological defense mechanisms. Comparative genomic analyses indicate t hat M. ulcerans has developed two distinct lineages: (i) the \"classical \" lineage representing the most pathogenic genotypes - those that are found in Afri ca, Australia and South East Asia; and (ii) an \"ancestral\" lineage comprising strains from China/Japan, South America and Mexico [30,31]. Mycolactone structure and activity One key to the understanding of the pathology of M. ulcerans infection is the family of macrolide exotoxins designated mycolactones. To dat e, the structure of six different forms of mycolactone has been elucidated. These con sist of a common lactone core to which an unsaturated fatty acyl side chain is ap pended (Figure 2) [53,54]. Variations in length and oxidation state of this si de chain defines the different forms, i.e. mycolactone A to D produced by M. ulcerans lineages isolated from different regions [55,56,57], mycolactone E coming from M. liflandii [58] and mycolactone F recently discovered in M. pseudoshottsii [59]. Mycolactones lead to an arrest in the G0/G1 of the cell cycle followed by apoptosis [53]. T he type(s) of mycolactone produced by a certain M. ulcerans lineage may have major implications for its virulence. In-vitro, mycolactone C for instance is 10,000-fold less active than A and B [57]. CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 172 In vitro activities of mycolactone The molecular mechanism of mycolactone action on eu karyotic cells is not entirely clear, but current evidence indicates that it diffu ses through the plasma membrane, accumulates in the cytoplasm and interacts with a c ytosolic target [60]. Within a short time, mycolactone can cause dramatic cell skeletal rearrangements, which may the cause for reduced phagocytic activity of mycolacton e-treated macrophages [61,62,63]. The cytotoxic action of mycolactone is not specifically directed towards a certain cell type, but rather affects a broad range of cell types although in differing intensity, which is also dependent on the state of maturation of the target cells [54,64]. Adipose cells are for instance extremely s ensitive to mycolactone and undergo apoptosis at low toxin concentrations, wher eas other cell types cope better [65]. This is in accordance with the histopathologi cal observation of extensive adipose coagulative necrosis below a relatively int act sub-epidermal and epidermal layer in early BU lesions. In vitro studies have identified multiple mechanism s by which mycolactone may suppress local and systemic immune reactivity. In h uman monocytes expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF- ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10 and TNF- induced NF-B activation is suppressed by mycolactone in vitro in a dose dependent manner. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages produce low levels of TNF- when infected with highly virulent but not with intermed iately virulent or nonvirulent strains of M. ulcerans [64,66]. This finding is supported by another stud y where reduced TNF- mRNA levels were found in activated macrophages 24 h post infection [62]. At non-toxic concentrations, mycolactone inhibits func tional and phenotypic maturation of human dendritic cells [63]. Their ability to act ivate allogeneic T cell priming and to produce inflammatory molecules is highly reduced. I nterestingly, in these cells TNF- production is only marginally affected [63]. Suppre ssion of the production of chemokines by dendritic cells (DCs) may contribute to the observed lack of local inflammatory responses in BU lesions. Furthermore, it is likely that massive production of mycolactone in established lesions wi th large clusters of mycobacteria destroys infiltrating leukocytes, explaining why in tact inflammatory cells are usually only found at the periphery of the necrotic areas [6 7]. Activities of mycolactone in animal models CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 173 When injected into guinea pigs, purified mycolacton e produces the typical clinico- histopathological picture of BU with strong apoptot ic and immunosuppressive actions [68]. Infection with mycolactone-negative M. ulcerans fails to induce ulceration in this animal model, but chemical complementation with pur ified mycolactone restores wild type pathology [61]. Histopathological analysis of guinea pig skin infected with wild type M. ulcerans revealed coagulative necrosis to appear already 24 h post infection. Normal host cells were absent apart from small numb ers of shrunken, pyknotic cells indicative for apoptosis. Infiltration of mononucle ar leukocytes was present at the edges of the necrotic area 10 days post infection, some containing intracellular bacilli although advanced apoptotic changes were observed i n these cells. Inflammatory infiltrates increased throughout a six week infecti on period but were always located at some distance from the bacterial foci [61]. In a mo use footpad infection model, significant differences in the mean footpad swellin g - a macroscopic parameter for monitoring pathology - has been observed between a highly virulent strain from Benin, a moderately virulent strain from China and a mycolactone-negative mutant. Leukocyte infiltration two days post infection cons isted predominantly of neutrophils. While the two virulent strains solely triggered an acute inflammation in the periphery of the necrotic area, mice infected with the mycola ctone-negative mutant switched to chronic inflammation one week post infection with g ranuloma-like structures forming two weeks post infection and neutrophilic infiltrat es vanishing concurrently [67]. A recently published work from Demangel et al shows that mycolactone diffuses into the tissue not only locally but also systemically t hrough migrating monocytes [69]. In the mouse model structurally preserved mycolactone was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), mononuclear cells of the lymph nodes (both draining and distant) and the spleen but not in the sera six weeks post infection. These findings support the hypothesis that the toxi n exerts immunosuppressive effects at the systemic level. Histopathological features of untreated BU lesions Histopathological hallmarks of BU include the prese nce of extracellular clusters of AFB, massive contiguous coagulative necrosis, adipo se cell ghosts and a remarkably low cellular infiltration [70,71]. In very early st ages extensive involvement of subcutaneous fat in the form of a septate panniculi tis and otherwise little inflammatory response apart from a slight histiocyt ic infiltration in the intermediate CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 174 area, between necrosis and healthy tissue has been described [72]. Bacteria are located focally and total numbers may vary greatly between individual lesions [73]. Currently BU lesions are not, like leprosy lesions, routinely classified into paucibacillary and multibacillary forms, but a deep er understanding of the influence of host factors on M. ulcerans disease progression may lead in future to such a classification system. In contrast to M. tuberculosis and M. leprae , M. ulcerans has traditionally been classified as an extracellular p athogen [74]. However, in 2002, Drancourt et al were able to grow M. ulcerans inside amphibian cells in vitro , and three years later Coutanceau et al described intrac ellular bacteria in a mouse model of BU [62]. Recently, Torrado et al provided eviden ce for a transient intra- macrophage growth phase in the mouse model and subs equent release into the surrounding. In specimens from BU patients this phe nomenon is usually not explicitly appreciated, as bacilli and inflammatory exudates a re not always concomitantly represented. An additional reason may be that first clinical symptoms leading to the collection of a diagnostic biopsy or surgical excis ion of the lesion may occur substantially later than an early phase of the infe ction, in which intracellular replication may potentially play a major role. Local and systemic immune responses in BU patients Humoral immune responses Currently only limited data on the development of M. ulcerans specific immune responses are available and it is not entirely clea r to what extent mycolactone secretion may lead to a suppression of systemic imm une responses. The control of M. ulcerans infection may be primarily dependent on cell-media ted immunity involving activated macrophages, T cells, and Th type 1 cytokines, as is thought to be the case for M. tuberculosis and M. leprae infection. However, also antibodies could provide protective mechanisms against the largely extracell ular M. ulcerans . Opsonisation might improve phagocytosis by neutrophi ls, increase intracellular killing by macrophages or improve antigen presentation and ind uction of protective T cell responses. In tuberculosis (Tb) endemic areas, where BCG vaccin ation is common, broad antigenic cross-reactivities of M. ulcerans antigens with M. tuberculosis and M. bovis CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 175 antigens complicate the analysis of M. ulcerans specific immune responses substantially. In studies with M. ulcerans culture filtrates IgG antibody responses against the secreted M. ulcerans proteins were frequently found in BU patients, but also in Tb patients from BU non-endemic regions [75 ] [76]. IgM responses of BU patients against the filtrate proteins were more di stinct than those of healthy family members living in the same village [76], indicative for B cell stimulation. Diaz et al. used the highly immunogenic M. ulcerans 18 kD small heat shock protein, which has no homologues in M. bovis and M. tuberculosis to monitor M. ulcerans specific IgG responses in BU patients and household contacts fro m Ghana. Under stringent assay conditions 75% of patients, independent of di sease stage, but also 38% of household contacts showed reactivity, whereas sampl es from Europeans and non- exposed Africans remained negative [77]. This is in dicative for the development of specific humoral responses against M. ulcerans in exposed, but otherwise healthy individuals. Infection with M. ulcerans may thus lead only in a minority of exposed individuals to clinical manifestations. Most of the others may develop transient infection foci and even nodular lesions may resolve spontaneously [78]. Immune responses in healthy household contacts have also b een described in an Australian study [79], where a lower background staining than with African sera facilitated analysis with M. ulcerans cell extracts. Systemic cellular immune responses While patients with early BU lesions rarely show de layed-type hypersensitivity responses to intradermally injected M. ulcerans lysate, reactivity is common in patients with healing lesions [75,80]. However, it is currently not clear to what extent BU patients can mount a M. ulcerans specific Th1 response. Triggering of pattern recognition receptors by structural components of M. ulcerans could lead to phagocyte activation and production of proinflammat ory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta. IL-12 could in tur n drive T cells and NK cells to produce Th1 proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN- and In IFN- could activate M. ulcerans infected macrophages, leading to elimination rather than intracellular multiplicatio n. On the other hand, IL-10, an anti- inflammatory cytokine produced by differently activated macrophages, Th2 and subsets of regulatory T cells and DCs could down-regulate I L-12 production leading CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 176 to a decrease in IFN- production. Several research groups, using differe nt experimental approaches, have analyzed expression p rofiles of these key cytokines and proliferative responses of peripheral blood mon onuclear cells (PBMCs) of BU patients stimulated ex vivo with mycobacterial antigens and immunostimulatory compounds (Table 1). Wide individual variations in IFN- and IL-10 responses have been found in these studies, which may be one reaso n accounting for discrepancies with respect to the influence of the disease stage on the polarization of the Th response [81,82,83,84]. In a case report acquired T h cell anergy following infection with M. ulcerans has been described in a BU patient from Australia [ 85]. Before infection, the patient's PBMCs responded to ex vivo stimulation with M. ulcerans by producing Th1 cytokines, but, after development of BU, a shift toward production of Th2 cytokines was found. Taken together the various studies are indicative for a generalized impairment in IFN- production during active BU. The capacity to produce IFN- is also depressed in Tb [86,87,88,89], where cellu lar components of M. tuberculosis have been shown to down-regulate IFN- receptor signaling [90,91]. Similarly, in BU mycolactone may also not be the on ly component with immunosuppressive activity. Data from Yeboah-Manu e t al have shown that PBMCs recover from the systemic downregulation of IFN- production in BU after surgical removal of the lesion [92] containing the vast majo rity of mycobacterial material. It should be noted that many conditions frequently fou nd in rural Africa, including infections such as malaria [93], helminthiasis [94,95,96] and Tb [88], but also malnutrition [97] can lead to a partial suppression of cellular immune responses as well. Local immune response in untreated lesions In BU lesions inflammation is usually minor with re spect to the extent of necrosis of subcutaneous tissues and dermal collagen [72,74]. T here may be a constant influx of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes to the active lesions, but mycolactone produced by clusters of mycobacteria is likely to induce apoptosis and necrosis of the inflammatory infiltrate [67]. In pa rticular remainders of early neutrophilic infiltrates may be immunohistoch emically detectable inside the necrotic areas [98]. CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 177 After long periods of persistent infection, granulo matous reactions with epithelioid macrophages, variable numbers of giant cells of the Langhans type, peripherally situated lymphocytes, and relatively few AFB develo p [72]. Granuloma formation is more often found in ulcerative lesions than in pre- ulcerative lesions [74]. In particular ulcer edges may show signs of chronic inflammation accompanied by a mixed pro- inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance [99 ,100]. Vast apoptotic/necrotic regions with minimal inflammation may thus be surro unded by a rim of mixed leukocyte infiltration. Healing is associated with the development of granulation tissue, fibrosis, and granulomatous inflammation [7 0]. New M. ulcerans satellite colonies may still develop in the lesion after the onset of granulomatous inflammation [73]. Analyses of intralesional cytokine production patterns have yielded conflicting results (Table 1) with respect to the polarization of the local response [81] [101] [83,100]. Within a lesion the distribution of diff erent types of leucocytes is extremely heterogeneous [73]. Therefore results based on the analysis of single biopsies may not be representative for the entire lesion [102]. In addition, it appears that there is a great variation in individual response patterns to M. ulcerans infection. A gradation system used for the classification of inflammatory responses in leprosy, ranging from foamy macrophages (lepromatous) to well-formed gran ulomas (tuberculoid), may also be useful for the classification of BU lesions . Local immune responses during chemotherapy In active BU disease, a protective cloud of mycolac tone around the mycobacterial clusters is thought to both destroy infiltrating le ukocytes and hinder them from passing pro-inflammatory signals to other cells [63 ]. It is most likely, but still remains to be proven experimentally, that mycolactone produ ction is reduced or abolished early after the onset of rifampicin/streptomycin ch emotherapy due to bacterial growth arrest and/or cell death. Declining toxin levels al low leukocytes to reach the extracellular mycobacteria, leading to their phagoc ytosis and destruction [98]. infiltration dev elopment of ectopic lymphoid structures [98]. CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 178 After eight weeks of chemotherapy antigen presentin g cells as well as B and T lymphocyte foci are found in large numbers inside t he BU lesions [98]. Gathering of DCs around the necrotic core as well as development of defined granuloma structures indicates that antigen recognition and p rocessing is leading to active M. ulcerans specific immune responses [98]. Three major types o f mixed infiltrates, differing in cellular composition, architecture and localization have been identified in the treated lesions: (1) highly organized epithelio id granulomas primarily located in deeper dermal tissue; (2) less organized diffuse in filtrates in all areas of the dermal connective and adipose tissue; (3) dense lymphocyte clusters in proximity to vessels. The outer layer of granulomas is mainly composed of T lymphocytes with CD4+ T cells outnumbering CD8+ T cells. These lymphocyte belts are interspersed w ith dermal DCs. Focal clusters of B cells appear at the outer margins of the T lymphocyte layer. Antigen-presenting cells, in part icular Langhans' giant cells and epithelioid macrophages form the centre of granulom as. Many lymphocytes are positive for activation and proliferation markers. Neither PMNs nor NK cells contribute significantly to granuloma formations. W hile in human Tb granulomas develop a central necrotic core, this is not observ ed in the lesions of the antibiotic treated BU patients. Here, the centre is mainly for med of foamy histiocytes and Langhans' giant cells, like reported for leprosy. M ycobacterial material is only infrequently detected inside these structures. BU g ranulomas thus may function primarily as a place for antigen presentation and a daptive immune response rather than for sequestration of the mycobacteria. In contrast to granulomas, regions of diffuse cellu lar infiltration in the dermal connective tissue contain sparsely distributed PMNs with sporadic focal clusters near necrotic areas. Small clusters of B lymphocytes are found, but T lymphocytes and foamy histiocytes are the most prominent cell types . Also here a large proportion of lymphocytes stain positive for activation prolifera tion markers. Macrophages/monocytes are particularly abundant in adipose tissue and around necrotic areas. The frequency of epidermal Langerha ns cells is strongly elevated and dDC are distributed throughout diffuse mixed infilt rates with increasing density towards the margins of necrotic areas. Appendices o f dDC reach into the damaged tissue. Vast amounts of shed CD14 is observed, whic h is implicated in the clearance of necrotic tissue [103]. Adjacent to lymphatics o r blood-vessels follicle-like CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 179 structures with dense aggregations of lymphocytes a re found. Here B lymphocytes are the dominating cell type followed by T lymphocy tes with CD4+ T cells being more frequent than CD8+ T cells. After eight weeks of chemotherapy, AFBs with beaded appearance may still be found inside large necrotic areas. In other areas rod-sha ped AFB have largely disappeared. However, acid-fast mycobacterial debris that can st ill be stained with antibodies specific for mycobacterial antigens, is still abund ant and primarily located inside mononuclear phagocytes. AFB start to be internalize d by phagocytes already after two weeks of treatment, when M. ulcerans can still be cultured from tissue homogenates (unpublished results). Also cellular in filtrates and small B cell clusters are already observed at this time point. Antibiotic treatment may thus act rapidly on the bacterial metabolism and interfere with mycolac tone production, while complete killing of bacteria takes at least four weeks of ch emotherapy. After four weeks of antibiotic therapy granulomas have not yet been ful ly developed and Langhans' giant cells are still rare (Sch\u00fctte et al, in press), but a shift of infiltrating cells from acute to chronic subsets may already have taken place. Abund ant clusters of AFB inside necrotic tissue may still be found (Figure 3), surr ounded by dense bands of acute and chronic infiltrates (Sch\u00fctte et al, in press). Abscess formation by PMNs is occasionally found, which may lead to secondary tis sue damage and \"reactivation\" phenomena such as ulceration or painful papules wee ks to months after completion of treatment (Sch\u00fctte et al, manuscript in preparat ion). Marked heterogeneity in response patterns of indivi dual BU patients may be observed with respect to both clinical outcome and histopathological findings. This may be related to factors such as: (1) lesion stage and size and extent of necrosis (2) total burden of M. ulcerans inside a lesion and (3) composition and organizati onal status of cellular infiltrates. It is not clear, wh ich factors play a crucial role in the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue during chemo therapy of BU. Plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs present in BU lesions prior to anti biotic treatment [102] and lymphoid tissue-inducer cells may play an important role. Although tertiary lymphoid tissue is thought to develop in infectious diseases primarily to sequester pathogens, this process is often accompanied by tissue damage. Occasionally antibiotic treatment thus may even accelerate the progression of early plaques and oedemas CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 180 to ulcerative lesions. In some patients new ulcerat ions develop in the course of or after completion of antibiotic treatment. These are usually not associated with the development of new infection foci (Sch\u00fctte et al., unpublished results), but are most likely located at sites containing preexisting unre cognized infection foci in which mycobacterial antigens and immunostimulators lead t o massive local immune responses . Conclusion The pathogenesis of BU is strongly associated with the cytocidal and immunosuppressive activities of the macrolide toxin mycolactone. Histopathological hallmark of progressing disease is a poor inflammat ory response despite of clusters of extracellular bacilli. While traditionally wide excision of the infected tissue was the standard treatment, provisional WHO guidelines now r ecommend eight week chemotherapy with streptomycin and rifampicin. Soon after start of the antibiotic- therapy onset of vigorous local immune responses is observed, which speaks for a rapid decline of mycolactone levels in the lesion. Three different general types of infiltration, diffuse mixed infiltrates, granulomas and dense lymphocyte aggregation in the vicinity of vessels are found in the treated le sions. This structural differentiation may reflect a range of different functional activit ies required for resorption of necrotic tissue and complete clearance of residual mycobacte rial cells and antigens. After eight weeks of antibiotic treatment necrotic region s are surrounded by large numbers of dDCs and their appendices reach into the damaged tissue, indicating enhanced antigen uptake and presentation. A large proportion of lymphocytes in the infiltrates are expressing activation and proliferation markers . It is likely that the curative effect of the antibiotic treatment is supported by these i mmunological reactions. Future studies on re-infection rates will show, whether ch emotherapy of BU results in long- lasting immunity and protection against re-infectio n by M. ulcerans . Expert opinion CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 181 There is convincing evidence that the macrolide tox in mycolactone of M. ulcerans plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the chr onic necrotizing skin disease BU. Tissue destruction, killing of leukocytes that are attracted to the site of a M. ulcerans infection and possibly also some downregulation of systemic immune responses can be primarily attributed to the apoptotic and direct bactericidal activities of the toxin. However, the exact molecular mode of action of myco lactone is not known, nor has its distribution and stability in the host been stu died. The fact that tissue destruction reaches far beyond the tissue areas containing larg e clusters of extracellular M. ulcerans demonstrates that mycolactone diffuses into the ti ssue. Development of leukocyte infiltrates in BU lesions already after o ne to two weeks of chemotherapy indicates on the other hand that the stability of m ycolactone in the necrotic tissue is limited. However, this represents only indirect evi dence for the behavior of mycolactone in BU lesions. Due to lack of a sensiti ve and robust quantification method for mycolactone in biological samples it is currently also not clear, whether mycolactone related metabolites could potentially b e detected in the blood or urine of Buruli ulcer patients - a feature that could be use d for the development of a specific diagnostic test. Various attempts are therefore cur rently made to develop an immunological antigen capture assay or a mass spect rometry-based test system for mycolactone. The macrolide toxin could also represe nt a suitable target for the development of a toxoid-based vaccine. However all approaches to develop a protein conjugate that elicits high titers of mycolactone-s pecific and potentially neutralizing antibodies have failed so far and only one mycolact one specific monoclonal antibody has become available (unpublished results). There i s also no evidence for the development of natural immune responses against myc olactone in BU patients or M. ulcerans exposed, but healthy individuals. In established M. ulcerans disease the vast majority of AFB are located extracellularly in necrotic areas of the lesions. H owever results from experimental infections in mice speak for a transient intracellu lar stage early in the infection. The bacteria appear to kill the phagocytes that have in gested them after a few days and may then develop further into microcolonies, which develop a protective cloud of mycolactone around them. Since human biopsies or ex cised tissue is only becoming available at an advanced stage of the infection it is not entirely clear, whether the same holds true for the infection in humans. Howeve r, at the periphery of necrotic CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 182 areas in established human BU lesions, encounter of spreading M. ulcerans cells with human phagocytes can be observed. Here small n umbers of intracellular AFB are found. Signs of apoptosis at the side of the le ukocytes and 'beaded' appearance of the mycobacteria upon ZN staining indicates that this encounter can be lethal both for the invader and the host cells. New satellite c olonies and lesions may develop from spreading mycobacteria, but this seems to be a relatively rare event. Probably only a few spreading mycobacteria succeed in develo ping satellite cluster of mycobacteria that are large enough to form a protec tive cloud of mycolactone. Host factors may largely determine whether a patient dev elops a single or multiple skin lesions or even metastatic osteomyelitis. The most striking finding of immunological analyses in BU patients is the wide individual vari ation in cytokine responses both with respect to magnitude and response patterns. Th is may make it impossible to associate different disease stages with either a Th 1 or a Th2 dominated response. However, a more differentiated gradation system for inflammatory responses in BU may turn out to be as useful as the differentiation between lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy. Like in leprosy, also in BU pa ucibacillary and multibacillary forms seem to exist, but this aspect has also not been sy stematically investigated. Only a subgroup of individuals exposed to M. ulcerans appears to develop clinical disease. This indicates that the human immune syste m is in principal able to cope with a M. ulcerans infection. Spontaneous healing of lesions may occur after prolonged periods of progressive ulceration, but al so nodular stages may occasionally resolve spontaneously. Granuloma forma tion and conversion to positive burulin skin test has been associated with spontane ous healing, suggesting a role for cellular immune mechanisms. But also the humoral ar m of the adaptive immune system may contribute to host defense against the l argely extracellular M. ulcerans. BU granulomas do not have a necrotic core containin g intact mycobacteria, as is found in tuberculosis and there is also no other hi stopathological evidence for the development of latent stages of M. ulcerans . However, relapses observed after prolonged disease-free intervals in some patients m ay not only be caused by re- infection. Current treatment options for BU include surgical e xcision, chemotherapy and heat treatment. While chemotherapy has for a long time b een regarded as largely CHAPTER 11. Rev iew 183 ineffective for M. ulcerans infection, treatment with a combination of rifampi cin and streptomycin is currently being re-evaluated with e ncouraging results. While surgical excision aims to remove tissue containing bacterial clusters completely, tissue and bacterial cell debris remains after antibiotic ther apy, in particular in the case of pre- ulcerative lesions, in the body. Mycobacterial anti gens and immunostimulators can in turn attract strong leukocyte infiltration and the formation of abscesses. Development of ectopic lymphoid tissue in the lesions demonstra tes that BU patients are capable of raising local anti-mycobacterial immune response s once the mycolactone levels decline. These inflammatory reactions may slow down wound healing after successful chemotherapy. Interestingly, thermothera py is associated with much less vigorous local cellular immune responses (unpublish ed results). Massive immunostimulation seems to lead in some patients to apparent reactivations of the disease weeks after completion of antibiotic therap y. Secondary ulcerations may be observed, which are not associated with the develop ment of new mycobacterial foci (unpublished results). Differentiated treatment strategies for different c ategories of BU lesions, combining the available treatment options, need to be develop ed and refined. With an improved understanding of BU pathogenesis and protective imm une responses it may also be possible to develop both simple point of care diagn ostic tests and a vaccine for targeted protection of the populations living in BU endemic areas.

Discussion 198 12.1. General remarks In 1998 WHO established the Global Buruli Ulcer Initi ative to coordinate BU control and research efforts. Although research on BU has b een intensified since then there are still many open questions regarding reservoir, transmission, pathology, immunology and epidemiology. Furthermore, improveme nts are necessary with respect to health care, prevention, surveillance an d awareness of the population. To efficiently fight BU and bring this neglected tropi cal disease out of obscurity, endemic countries, NGOs and research institutions actively c ollaborate and mobilize expertise and resources worldwide. Improved case detection and awareness for the disea se of populations in endemic areas has led to a better estimation of overall inc idence rates. Over 30 countries worldwide are affected 1 and more BU foci are likely to be discovered in fu ture, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The most endemic countries such as Benin, Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire report already 1,000 to 2,000 new cases per year 2. Assessing the burden of BU and establishing a control programme i n endemic countries with limited resources is very demanding as health care and rese arch infrastructures in those countries are usually poorly developed. Well trained clinicians and health workers who are capable of diagnosing and treating the disease are rare, and although community partic ipation in the recognition of disease symptoms is advancing, patients often prese nt late with severe ulcerative lesions. In many BU endemic regions of Africa suffi cient resources to treat and rehabilitate these patients are not available. Howe ver, more support is gradually becoming available to promote research on better di agnostic, treatment and preventive tools and to foster cooperation among co untries in order to strengthen surveillance, control and rehabilitation. The discussion section of this work is reviewing th e current diagnosis and treatment strategies for BU as well as the prospects for vacc ine design. CHAPTER 12. Discussion 199 12.2. Diagnosis of BU In an area known to be endemic an experienced perso n can diagnose BU on clinical grounds 3, although other ulcerating or boil forming disease s can be confused with M. ulcerans infection. Current goal of WHO is to reconfirm at l east 50% of the clinically diagnosed BU patients by laboratory analyses. With the introduction of antibiotic therapy of BU in 2004 4, the necessity of laboratory confirmation became e ven more crucial. Four laboratory-confirmatory methods are u sed retrospectively on samples taken during treatment, namely AFB examination of s mears and biopsies, culture, PCR 5. 12.2.1. AFB, culture and PCR Exudate smears can only be obtained by taking swabs from ulcerative lesions and microscopic examination for AFB is associated with low sensitivity. However, it is the only yet available field test which can be carried out rapidly at local facilities. Culture of M. ulcerans is an extremely time-consuming technique 6, that requires skilled personnel. It yields false-negative results too oft en to be implemented for routine diagnostic purposes, but has recently been used to monitor the kinetics of bacterial killing under antibiotic therapy 7. PCR is a test with a sensitivity of up to 100%, w hich often allows confirmation of clinical diagnosis eve n when samples are culture and smear negative. Although the target sequence IS2404 has also been found in some other environmental bacteria 8, positivity of clinical specimens is a strong indi cation for a M. ulcerans infection. Swabs or biopsies can both be assessed within two days, but in West Africa the expensive equipment and dema nding technical skills, inevitable to perform this method, are only availab le in a few reference laboratories. Furthermore, the high risk for false positive resul ts caused by contamination requires strict quality control, which is not yet implemente d. Therefore, the introduction of inter-laboratory comparable protocols has been sugg ested and will be established in the near future. We have used real-time PCR, which is less prone to yield false positive results than conventional PCR, for diagnos is in our thermotherapy study. In combination with histopathology and AFB staining it allowed to unambiguously reconfirm clinical diagnosis (see Chapters 7 and 8) . CHAPTER 12. Discussion 200 12.2.2. Histopathology BU lesions develop a distinctive pathology at the s ite of infection which allows an experienced pathologist to diagnose the disease on t hese grounds 9. Sampling has to be performed with great care to obtain tissue from the presumed lesion core or from ulcer edges. Biopsies must include all levels of th e integument as focal bacterial clusters and the associated pathological changes ar e primarily located inside the adipose region of the deeper dermal layer 10. Though histopathology is a reliable diagnostic tool, it requires special equipment and versed scientists to be performed and takes at least four days for sample processing and evaluation. Recently, punch biopsies have been introduced as standard procedure in the diagnosis of BU allowing histological analysis of tissue from both ulcerated and early closed lesions 11. Due to the heterogeneity of lesions and the superficial na ture of biopsies, sensitivity is much lower than for major excision samples. Given proper processing and storage, tissue embedded in paraffin can be preserved over years and used not only for diagnosis, but als o additional research, as it is shown in the present work (see Chapter 6). Histolog ical analyses can provide insight into processes taking place during progressing dise ase 12, treatment 13 or healing 14 and are extremely valuable to better understand the natural history of the disease (see Chapters 3, 4 and 5). The complete \"lack of lo cal immune responses\" was thought to be a hallmark of progressing BU disease and it was generally assumed, that the onset of a granulomatous response marks th e beginning of containment and eventual healing of a M. ulcerans infection 15. More detailed histological analysis is now modifying this point of view. Ulcer edges show signs of chronic inflammation accompanied by a mixed pro-inflammatory/anti-inflam matory cytokine balance as consistent histopathological features 16. It was demonstrated that new satellite lesions can still develop after the onset of these cellular immune response followed by granuloma formation 17. It appears that infection with M. ulcerans does trigger a local immune reaction, but that infiltrating leukoc ytes are subsequently destroyed in areas with high mycolactone concentration. This may explain the observation of vast apoptotic/necrotic regions surrounded by a rim of m ixed leukocyte infiltration. In our immunohistological studies remainders of early neut rophilic infiltrates were still detectable inside the necrotic areas. In chronic pr ogressing ulcerative lesions CHAPTER 12. Discussion 201 granulomas are commonly observed at the lesion edge s 16,17. This may represent an attempt of the immune system to fend off and isolat e the invading mycobacteria. A second conclusion, that M. ulcerans is an extracellular pathogen unlike other mycobacteria, was first challenged in 2005, when a transient intraphagocytic stage was observed in the animal model 18,19. Examination of the peripheries of necrotic acellular areas in BU patients revealed that inflam matory infiltrates containing bacilli are consistently present during infection 16,20. This phenomenon is not often appreciated because inflammatory exudates and bacil li are not always represented in the tissue fragments available for analysis. Monito ring the early development of experimental M. ulcerans infection of mice indicates a great proportion of bacilli replicating inside phagocytes before their final re lease into the tissue due to mycolactone cytotoxicity (Ruf et al, unpublished da ta). In future, histological analysis of very early BU lesions should be conducted to bet ter understand the factors contributing to the establishment of M. ulcerans infection such as intra- and extracellular bacterial stages and kinetics of loca l immune responses. There is mounting evidence that a proportion of M. ulcerans infections resolve spontaneously before giving rise to clinical disease. 12.2.3. Future improvements Novel strategies to develop highly predictive but s imple \"point-of-care\" diagnostic tests allowing fast confirmation of BU at periphera l treatment centres are considered a high research priority. Serological studies have indicated that exposure to M. ulcerans leads only in a minority of individuals to clinica l symptoms 21. One focus on the way to a field-compatible diagnostic test could be the development of an antigen capture assay based on antibodies against unique im munodominant proteins of M. ulcerans such as its 18kD small heat shock protein (shsp) 21. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) a gainst this surface-bound protein allows specific and sensitive detection of the pathogen in tissue and culture (see Chapter 10). The final goal is a cheap and eas y to handle test format such as a dip-stick, requiring only small amounts of urine or blood. CHAPTER 12. Discussion 202 Another focus is on mycolactone, the macrolide exot oxin, which is supposedly more widely distributed inside the lesion than the bacil li. Antibodies against this small molecule are not easily elicited and only one mycol actone-specific mAb has been generated so far (Dangy et al, unpublished data). A phage-display based approach is currently conducted as alternative strategy for the generation of mAbs with alternative specificity. The available mAb against the macrolide is currently under investigation for potential use in histopathologica l analysis of frozen sections (unpublished data). Since mycolactone is ethanol-so luble, paraffin-embedded thin sections are not suitable for such analyses. Excise d tissue could be assessed for mycolactone distribution not only for diagnostic pu rpose, but also to obtain more detailed information about extent and severity of i nfection. In addition, decline of mycolactone levels could represent a good surrogate marker for the efficacy of antibiotic or heat treatment. 12.3. Treatment of BU 12.3.1. Antibiotics Historically, surgery is the front-line therapy for all stages of BU 22,23. However, only a minority of BU patients in West Africa had access t o surgical treatment centres. The introduction of an efficacious antibiotic combinati on is currently shifting the balance from mere surgery to antibiotic therapy with or wit hout surgical intervention 4. In African countries daily administration of both rifa mpicin and streptomycin is now used at a number of treatment centres after a clinical t rial and observational studies showed its efficacy in humans 7,24. Large observational studies indicate that 30-50% of patients can be cured with antibiotics alone, pr imarily those with early pre- ulcerative or small ulcerative lesions. Patients wh o recover without additional surgery most often suffer from a minor lesion less than 5cm in diameter. Between experts, the rifampicin-streptomycin regimen remains a subje ct of debate and, although promising, has to be improved in several ways 25. Streptomycin is contraindicated during pregnancy and although it has been reported to be well-tolerated, there is a risk of renal and ototoxicity in particular in chil dren 26. Several studies to simplify antibiotic treatment are ongoing. In the mouse foot pad model, five days per week R- S administration are sufficient to cure M. ulcerans infection 27 and the same concept CHAPTER 12. Discussion 203 is currently under evaluation in a pilot dose-findi ng study in Ghanaian BU patients 28. Trials to evaluate the potential of the orally admi nistered antibiotic clarithromycin, which has excellent bio-availability and penetratio n into tissue and good anti- mycobacterial activity in vitro 29, are under way (van der Werf, drug trial NCT00321178). This macrolide penetrates phagocytes and accumulates in organelles delivering the drug directly to the site of infection 30. Even a treatment course of six months can be followed with this comb ination and curing severe disseminated cases becomes imaginable 31. 12.3.2. Thermotherapy The currently most promising alternative approach i s BU therapy through local heat application. A small proof-of-principle trial used non-hazardous commercially available bags containing phase-change material to locally apply temperatures around 40\u00b0 C over several weeks (see Chapters 7 and 8). Amazingly rapid re- attachment of undermined skin and subsequent healin g processes were achieved. Results from this \"proof of principle\" trial strong ly suggest that heat kills or suppresses M. ulcerans in the affected tissues and, at the same time, ind uces a local immune response which is carrying the healing proce ss further. These promising results encouraged implementation of a larger dose- finding trial and the recruitment of complicated cases. Exploration of the turning po int is important to determine the heat application schedule sufficient for the host's own defence and healing to take over. Furthermore, an \"over-night\" treatment schedu le would be very convenient for both patients and health workers. After completion of the dose finding study field workers have to be trained to independently adminis ter heat-therapy according to the appropriate schedule. This would allow the realizat ion of a community effectiveness trial, where thermotherapy is transferred to the co mmunity to accomplish \"on-the- spot\" treatment of BU patients. The non-invasive he at application was already greatly appreciated by all participants during the pilot st udy. Broad acceptance of a treatment modality by both health workers and the l ocal population is thus likely to be a major advantage. In regions with limited resource s, where the disease is the most prevalent, thermotherapy may open up a new era in t he treatment of M. ulcerans infections and could become a supplementary if not alternative treatment option in the fight against BU. CHAPTER 12. Discussion 204 12.3.3. Mycobacterial viability studies As noted already, histopathology is a good tool to evaluate local immune responses and bacterial distribution during therapeutical int erventions. Nevertheless, efficacy evaluation of a particular treatment should also in clude determination of mycobacterial viability which is, apart from perfor ming time-consuming and insensitive culture, not possible to date. A possible marker of viability loss is the so-calle d \"beading\" of mycobacteria. Microscopy can be used to evaluate the effects of t herapy on M. leprae as it is well known that even slight physical damage to the bacte rial cell wall is sufficient to change the acid fast properties visualized by \"bead ed\" ZN staining 32,33. At close examination, the same phenomenon was observed in mo use footpad M. ulcerans lesions (Ruf et al, unpublished data) and human BU (see Chapter 6) treated with antibiotics for several weeks. Unfortunately, if th ere is sufficient residual cytoplasm to outline the bacillus, thereby appearing solid in ZN staining, the degenerated form can only be identified by electron microscopy 33. Therefore, this method is too insensitive to monitor viability, but may be used to give a rou gh estimate of treatment success or probability of relapse. Another surrogate marker to measure viability may b e mycolactone content of clinical specimens. The observed recovery of local immune re sponses associated with declining necrosis speaks for a reduced mycolactone release during R-S treatment (see Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Lipid extracts of punch biopsies from BU patients with and without antibiotic treatment could be assessed for mycolactone levels via mass spectroscopy (Wansbrough-Jones, unpublished data). Moreover, monoclonal antibodies against the toxin may be used in frozen section to monitor mycolactone level and distribution to indirectly measure viabil ity of M. ulcerans in the course of therapy. Both methods could potentially also be sui table as diagnostic tools performed in reference laboratories. In leprosy, a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay targeting 16S rRNA of M. leprae has been used to detect specific RNA in biopsy spec imens 34. Positive results were obtained in biopsies from fresh or short term treat ed cases. In contrast, from specimens of long term treated cases showing clinic al features of relapse were CHAPTER 12. Discussion 205 negative. DNA targeting PCR showed positivity in bo th groups. These results suggest that RT-PCR positivity possibly reflects th e presence of viable organisms and that a proportion of supposed relapses may rath er appear as secondary immune \"reactivation\" due to remaining dead M. ulcerans . Thus RT-PCR assays may be useful for viability determinations of M. ulcerans in response to chemotherapy as well as in supposed relapse cases. 12.3.4. Vaccine development Prevention of clinical disease, as provided by vacc ination, is the most desired solution to finally control M. ulcerans infection. Studies whether BCG vaccination may render herd immunity as it is found for leprosy 35 were not overly successful 36-38, although severe disseminated infections may be prev ented 39. Other approaches based on DNA engineering and virulence factors of M. ulcerans are under evaluation. For the rational design of a vaccine it is importan t to identify the immune effector functions relevant for a particular infection. In t he case of the best studied mycobacterial disease TB cellular immune responses are thought to be most crucial. Effective immune response against the primarily int racellular pathogen M. tuberculosis requires several subsets of immunity. The inductio n of CD4+ Th-1 cells is protective in mice 40 and is mirrored in humans with HIV co-infection wh o have a 500-fold increased risk of TB due to their reduced CD4+ leukocyte counts 41. Furthermore, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells can recognise a nd destroy target cells infected with intracellular M. tuberculosis 42,43. Mouse models of latent TB indicate that CD8+ T lymphocytes are particularly important in the pre vention of reactivation 44. Another, though not very popular, hypothesis argues that myc obacteria-specific antibodies induced by BCG vaccination could target extracellula r M. tuberculosis implicated in transmission and actively replicating within cavita ry pulmonary lesions 45. In M. ulcerans infection leukocyte subsets required for immunity are supposed to be different as replication happens predominantly extr acellular. Intracellular M. ulcerans are released from phagocytes due to the action of m ycolactone and eliciting specific CD4+ Th-1 and CD8+ T cells may play a minor role in the containment of infection. Therefore, the humoral immune response potentially represents the most important CHAPTER 12. Discussion 206 effector arm of the immune system against M. ulcerans . In addition, eosinophils and mast cells may play an important role in immunity a gainst the pathogen. This hypothesis is supported by results from antibiotic treated lesions where eosinophils gather around infected areas (see Chapter 3 and 5). M. marinum is thought to be the common ancestor of all M. ulcerans strains 46. BCG derived from M. bovis may lack proteins crucial for protection against B U 36,38. A recombinant BCG strain over-expressing key M. ulcerans antigens might be a promising approach to enhance the vaccine's potency . However, standard BCG vaccination can induce prolonged ulcerative lesions at the site of intradermal inoculation which might even be enhanced through ex pression of M. ulcerans proteins. Especially immuno-compromised individuals may suffer from severe infectious complications 47. An attenuated M. ulcerans strain deprived of mycolactone production which can persist only for limited perio ds in vivo but carries all relevant antigens may represent an alternative. In guinea pi gs, mycolactone negative M. ulcerans strains have been shown to trigger a brisk inflamm atory response which is limiting the experimental infection 18. Under-attenuation could result in vaccine- associated BU disease whereas over-attenuation woul d greatly reduce immunogenicity. A strategy that avoids risks associated with a life vaccine is the utilization of whole killed M. ulcerans to introduce antibody responses against its immuno dominant antigens. However, this approach might provide rath er low protection, because antibody responses against molecules with low immun ogenicity may be primarily relevant. Subunit vaccines, based on recombinant proteins or plasmid DNA, represent a much safer strategy. A major drawback for protein subuni t vaccines is the insufficient availability of adjuvants to trigger antigen-presen ting cells. To date, only alum and QS-21 are approved for use in humans. DNA vaccines o ffer the advantage of endogenous antigen production inside antigen-presen ting cells and contain CpG motifs triggering appropriate responses via TLR9 si gnalling after vaccination 48. However, attempts to use a Mycobacterium leprae Hsp65-based DNA vaccine against M. ulcerans infection in mice failed 49. Recently, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Ag85A from M. tuberculosis and M. ulcerans , administered as a CHAPTER 12. Discussion 207 plasmid DNA vaccine, as a recombinant protein vacci ne in adjuvant or as a combined DNA prime-protein boost vaccine, was repor ted 50. Combination with a vaccine targeting mycolactone may be a way to stren gthen the effectiveness of this potential subunit vaccine. Another market-approved adjuvant and carrier system are influenza virosomes 51,52. Antigenic pathogen-specific peptides could be lin ked to virosomes to present M. ulcerans antigens to the immune system. Alternatively, synthesized mycolactone could be hooked to the viro somal surface to generate immunity against the cytotoxin. Even if future research will yield promising result s with vaccine candidates in the animal model it will be hard to raise enough money to implement clinical trials for BU vaccine development despite all efforts in rising a wareness of the disease. An additional opportunity is to wait for the developme nt of an improved TB vaccination which may evoke cross-reactive immune responses pro viding protection against M. ulcerans infection. 12.4. Future aspects of disease control One focus to intensify BU control activities lies on the education of the population in endemic countries which would improve case manageme nt through early case detection at community and school level. Patients n eed to be aware of the early symptoms and their confidence in the available trea tment options has to be strengthened. Many people believe in witchcraft as the main factor to develop such diseases and prefer traditional healers over classi cal medicine 53, so the true cause of BU has to be made clear to those affected. In a study in Benin presentation delay decreased from four months in 1989 to one month in 2001 due to continuing efforts to raise the population's education and awareness f or the disease 54. A decentralization of health care could help to rea ch people in the very remote rural areas who will not present to a hospital because of the great distance 53. Village health workers need to be trained to recognize and treat the disease, especially when a fully orally administered antibiotic regimen or thermotherapy is available. Diagnostic centres are needed in the periphery, as rural areas suffer from the inability CHAPTER 12. Discussion 208 to diagnose M. ulcerans infection in a timely manner, especially to unambi guously diagnose closed BU lesions which lack the pathognom onic features of ulcerative lesions. Synergies with other disease-control activ ities using already existing networks and infrastructures could help to accelera te implementation of these issues. It is important not only to create facilities but a lso to assure sustainability and a continuum of care by strengthening national health systems with the contribution of NGOs and thereby guaranteeing provision of equipment and resources. Correct treatment of BU includes a third essential element apart from surgery and drugs, namely prevention of disability (POD). Reduct ion in the range of motion or other more severe functional limitations of joints are commonly observed to accompany chronic M. ulcerans infections 55 and have significant impact on employment or schooling and farming activities 56. Joint contractures often have to be removed surgically, but also aftercare physiotherap y has been shown to improve disabilities 57. Some health centres are already equipped with a p hysiotherapy unit including trained personnel and special equipment, but all caregivers should receive basic training in POD. WHO is currently working on a POD manual within its series of training modules on BU which will be targeted at ge neral health staff 28. West Africa and other developing countries endemic for BU will never be able to cover all communities with high-standard resources, but every small improvement is one step further to diminish suffering among affect ed individuals. General practitioners could be educated, for instance, to p erform nodulectomies or simple split skin grafts, because workload is already too high in most regions to exclusively rely on fully-trained surgeons. Only ten years ago BU was an obscure disease to many living in endemic regions and even totally una cquainted on international level, and research was an extremely tedious business. Now adays we are witnessing growing interest in this particular of defined 13 n eglected tropical diseases worldwide 58, possibly leading towards an accelerated progress within the ten years to come.

For each coun try 13 patient sera were tested on recombinant 18kD protein for specific antibody r esponses. All 13 sera from Ghana (100%) were strong positive whereas only 5 out of 1 3 samples (38%) from Cameroonian patients showed an intermediate and 8 ( 62%) an extremely weak response which was (Fig.1). In the Australian set o f patient sera merely 2 out of 13 sera (23%) yielded a faint positive and 5 (38%) a n early invisible result (Fig.1) Sera from individuals living in non-endemic countri es showed no response to the 18kD protein at all [1]. We collected sera from non -endemic regions of BU endemic countries and tested those for their anti-18kD anti body response in comparison to patient sera. 12 out of 30 patients sera (40%) from an endemic BU area in Cameroon showed a positive response to the recombinant 18kD protein (Fig.2a). 13 out of 36 sera (36%) from a BU non-endemic neighbouring regio n in Cameroon were positive for anti-18kD antibodies (Fig.2b). A similar result was obtained for sera retrieved from a BU non-endemic area located in the dry northern G hana, where 13 out of 42 samples (31%) were Western Blot positive (Fig.2c). Finally, 13 out of 20 samples (65%) collected in a BU non-endemic village located inside the Savannah of northern Cameroon with a high leprosy incidence rate gave a positive anti-18kD response (Fig.2d). In a previous work we could show that the recombina nt 18kD is recognized by Ghanaian sera of BU patients and household contacts, therefore identifying exposure to the pathogen [1]. Surprisingly, this was not the case for sera collected in Cameroon or Australia where percentage of patient s amples recognizing the 18kD protein was less than in Ghana and positive signals lower in intensity. The reason for this phenomenon is unclear, but host factors might play a role as well as severity and location of the lesion. When around a third of sera from non-endemic regions within Cameroon and Ghana turned out positive, cross-reacti vity with another protein became conceivable. On this account, sera from a reg ion of Cameroon non-endemic for BU but with increasing prevalence of leprosy we re tested and 65% showed reaction against the recombinant 18kD shsp of M. . of 18kD shsp with 78.8% protein sequence identity and it is likely that APPENDIX 217 individuals infected or exposed to this pathogen el icit a similar immune response as against M. ulcerans exposure [1,2]. This would also explain the very l ow reactivity in sera collected in Australia, where leprosy is not e ndemic. Figure1.
