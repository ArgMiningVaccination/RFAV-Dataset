The answers below provide some general information. Your doctor or complementary therapist can give you more details about [particular therapies](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/) you are considering using.

The term complementary therapies covers a broad range of practices and medicines. They can be [grouped into different categories](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/key-questions/complementary-therapy-categories/) and most are part of whole medical systems. What are whole medical systems? [Whole medical systems](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/whole-medical-systems/) aim to treat the whole person - mind, body and spirit - not just the disease and its symptoms. In Australia, the main whole medical systems used are [Ayurvedic medicine? This is the combined use of conventional treatments and evidence-based complementary therapies. This approach has been adopted by some cancer centres. Why do people use these therapies? Complementary therapies are widely used by people with cancer in Australia. There are many reasons why people with cancer use complementary therapies, including to: - improve quality of life - take a more active role in their health and recovery - manage the symptoms and side effects of conventional cancer treatment, such as fatigue, nausea or pain - strengthen the mind and body to cope with treatment - look for more holistic ways of treating the whole person - incorporate [traditional or cultural practices](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/key-questions/#traditional-healing-practices). Should I tell my doctor? Yes. Discuss any therapy you are using or thinking about using with your doctors, as some may not be safe or evidence-based. This includes over-the-counter medicines, herbal supplements and vitamins that you buy from a pharmacy or health food store. It's important to tell your doctors before you start using any complementary therapy, especially if you are having chemotherapy or radiation therapy or taking any medicines. Depending on the treatment you are having, some complementary therapies may cause reactions, make side effects worse or interfere with the success of your conventional cancer treatment. Your doctors may advise you to avoid some complementary therapies while you are having cancer treatment. Your doctor may also be able to refer you to a qualified therapist who understands the role of complementary therapies in cancer care. For more on this, see [Safety concerns](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/safety-concerns/). How do we know treatments work? A clinical trial can help show whether a treatment works and is safe. In a randomised control trial, one group of people is given the new treatment and the other group is given the existing standard treatment. The results in the two groups are compared to work out which treatment is better, safer and/or more cost-effective. If a trial proves that a treatment is better than existing options, it may become the new standard of care for patients in the future. Some clinical trials compare existing approaches to see which one is more effective. Clinical trials for complementary therapies often test treatments on small groups of people with specific cancer types, such as breast and prostate. It can be challenging to establish whether the trial results apply to people with other types of cancer. Personal (anecdotal) evidence is based on individual people's experiences and observations, rather than on facts. It is not proven and is less reliable than scientific evidence from clinical trials. For more on this, see [Taking part in a clinical trial](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/making-informed-decisions/taking-part-in-a-clinical-trial/) and our general information on [Clinical trials and research](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/cancer-treatment/clinical-trials/). Which complementary therapies work? Cancer Council supports the use of complementary therapies that have been proven to be generally safe and effective in clinical trials (see above) or other scientific studies. Therapies such as [meditation](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/relaxation-and-meditation/), [massage ](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/massage/)and [acupuncture ](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/acupuncture/)can increase your sense of control, decrease stress and anxiety, and improve your mood. Only some complementary therapies have been scientifically proven to be safe or effective to use for people with cancer. Where the evidence is not available, the possible benefits and any harm they might cause should be considered by you and your health care team. See [Individual therapies](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/) for a brief overview of the evidence supporting the use of some complementary therapies. Many health claims for complementary therapies have not been proven. However, anecdotal evidence from people with cancer - and, in some cases, a long history of use in traditional medicine - suggest that particular therapies may be useful for some people. Using complementary therapies in palliative care Many palliative care services offer complementary therapies to patients to help improve their quality of life. Therapies such as [aromatherapy](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/aromatherapy/), [massage](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/massage/), [meditation ](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/relaxation-and-meditation/)and [reflexology ](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/reflexology/)can increase a person's sense of control, decrease stress and anxiety, and improve mood. Health professionals involved in [palliative care](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/advanced-cancer/palliative-care/) often support patients using complementary therapies that are safe and evidence-based. How is allied health different? Allied health professionals, such as physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, dietitians and psychologists, offer a range of evidence-based therapies to diagnose and treat health conditions. These therapies can offer people with cancer physical, emotional, spiritual and practical support, help reduce side effects from medical treatment, and improve quality of life. Many allied health practices are part of standard supportive care for cancer and allied health professionals are often members of multidisciplinary cancer teams. They have a university qualification in a recognised allied health field. They are also a member of a national professional organisation that: - certifies qualifications - sets and maintains competency standards - oversees continuing professional development - has a procedure for dealing with complaints about its members. Your general practitioner (GP) or specialist can refer you to a range of allied health professionals who have experience working with people affected by cancer. Some allied health therapies can be claimed under Medicare if you have a referral from your GP as part of a Chronic Disease Management Plan.

For example, some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people use traditional bush medicines to help them get through cancer. If you want to use bush medicine, discuss this with an Aboriginal health worker or elder. Talk to your doctor if you would like to use traditional remedies from your culture alongside conventional treatments.
