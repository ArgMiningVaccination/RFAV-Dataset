Are you a health-conscious and intuitive person who is struggling to heal your current health issues? For many years, you've worked with medical doctors and seen holistic practitioners. You are knowledgeable and live a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps, you've even tried to work on yourself using the modalities that you've learned, yet you are not getting a breakthrough. No matter what you try, you feel like your prayers have not been answered. If that sounds familiar, I'm inviting you to schedule a free 1 to 1 strategy session to get clarity on how what is missing in your journey. As a licensed Naturopathic Doctor and certified healer, I've helped many people treat the root cause of their health problems so they can finally heal and find answers as to why they have been struggling for so long. It's not the lack of information out there, but too many modalities available and no specific steps geared towards a clear goal. I'll make sure you leave the call with the missing pieces of the puzzle so you can get a fresh perspective on your path. The current healthcare system does not acknowledge that the root cause of your illness may be due to karma. If you have been diagnosed with a medical problem and you are asking yourself \"why me\"? Know that you are not to be blamed for these health issues. You can request healing through the divine realm for your health concerns no matter how severe they are. The Lightworker Healing Protocol is a unique high-level prayer that takes into account other sources of negativity not addressed by either conventional or alternative medicine. If you are open to receiving divine assistance, contact me to learn more. Here are the benefits that you may experience: - Improved mental clarity, mood, and energy. - Inner peace and enhanced well-being in your daily lives. - Assistance from the divine realm and Creator to heal your health issues. - Better intuitive reach and increased lifespan. - Improvement of your symptoms. - Healing of traumatic events you have experienced in this life (accident, loss, abuse, divorce, etc). - Attenuation of side effects done by invasive medical procedures such as surgery and anesthesia. - Manifesting abundance in all aspects of your life. What's unique about this Protocol: - Healing is performed by the divine realm, not the practitioner. - We remove dark energies that may affect your well-being. - Healing is not limited to this life but applied to all your previous lifetimes. - Healing is applied on all levels of your being: mental, emotional, energetic, and physical. I'm interested, what's next? Step 1: Watch my videos to learn more about this Protocol. Step 2: Book a discovery call to discuss your health concerns.

I've been processing a lot of karma, resistance, and negative feelings recently with the journey and the work required to show up with consistency, true integrity, and order after unhealthy choices in the past. Though I still have intrusion and addictive issues, I'm being guided to accept and slow down, not make everything too serious about me, and not forcing in my desired outcomes. I recognize that my own behaviors perpetuate these issues and it is not a problem with the LHP. My experience with the LHP through Anh Linh has been helpful in helping me open and expand my understanding of the layers of Spiritual workings of the Universe, to help in clearing up issues in my being, and to come closer to oneness in my relations, inner and outer worlds. I came to her for help with negative energies and interferences, and I received some guidance and relief for moving forwards afterwards. She is a helpful and compassionate facilitator and naturopath who has continued to inspire my journey with her attentiveness, diligence, and loving kindness. Thank you Dr. Anh, May God-Source continue to bless and support you and your loved ones x - Toronto, Canada May 28th, 2021 \"I had recently rescued a little dog from a bad situation. She was terrified of everything, people, dogs, children, birds and noises. It was very sad and as I lived in a condo it was also quite difficult to avoid running into her many fears whenever we went outside. I wanted her quality of life to improve so I tried Lightwork Healing Protocol Session, hoping for any change. It took a few months but she can now go outside to do her business and we even go for walks in the nearby park, which she loves. She is now smelling the grass which she never used to do, and looking around at the area. She even checks out other dogs from a distance. I think her quality of life has increased considerably, and she is living her best life which is all i wanted for her. I am very pleased with the result\". -April o3, 2021. Toronto, CA \"My granddaughter has Autism and it is difficult for her to remain calm or concentrate on anything very long. It is quite disruptive for everyone including her as it will escalate if it goes unchecked. I had signed her up for a Lightwork Healing Protocol Session, hopeful that it would help her. Within a few days of the procedure the family saw a difference in her behaviour, she seemed much calmer, she would sit and look at pictures in a book or watch something on her Ipad for long periods, which was difficult for her before that. It has been a couple of months now and she hasn't reverted back to her old ways. We are very pleased with the results, as any little change for her makes a big difference\". - April 03, 2021.Toronto, CA. \"I made a few requests for my dog, not really knowing what to expect, and got great results. It's fascinating to see how things pan out in the weeks following my requests. I also asked for help with his reactive temperament towards other dogs. Coincidentally, a new free course on dog training made its way to me and I decided to listen to it. I haven't consciously applied any of the techniques yet, but I noticed a big difference in my dog's reaction to other dogs. They are not as intense and frequent as they used to be. "}
