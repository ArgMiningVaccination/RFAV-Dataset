If the patient does not have a primary health care provider, the pharmacist shall provide the patient with a written record of the vaccine administered to the patient and shall advise the patient to consult a physician. Adverse Event Reporting - The pharmacist shall report any clinically significant event following vaccine administration to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) and the recipient's primary health care provider within 24 hours, even if it is not certain that the event was caused by the vaccine.

To prevent inadvertent needle -stick injury or reuse, needles and syringes shall be discarded immediately after use in labeled, puncture -proof containers located in the same room where the vaccine is administered. Needles must not be recapped before being placed in the container. Safety needles or needle -free injection devices should be used to reduce the risk for injury. XI. Management of Adverse Events All vaccines have the potential to cause an adverse reaction. In order to minimize adverse reactions, recipients must be carefully screened for precautions and contraindications before the vaccine is administered. Even with careful screening, reactions may occur. These reactions can vary f rom inconvenient (e.g. soreness, itching) to severe and life threatening (e.g. anaphylaxis). If reactions occur, the pharmacist shall be prepared for their management. The procedures for managing adverse reactions are set forth in Appendix E. XII.

Vaccine specific screening questions must also be asked based on the vaccine's contraindications and precautions according to current ACIP guidelines and manufacturer's package inserts. The pharmacist shall document relevant responses and explanations provided in response to the screening questions. PRECAUTION Precaution must be taken before vaccine administration to a p otential recipient with moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever.

Do not immunize a combative patient. Following vaccine administration, the pharmacist shall observe the patient for immediate adverse reaction(s) to the vaccine(s). If no reaction is immediately evident, request that the patient remain for observation for a period of 10 -15 minutes. If the patient displays any signs of any of the following reactions, the pharmacist shal l execute the following procedures. If the patient experiences symptoms of a local reaction (e.g., minor pain, redness, warmth, pruritus, swelling at injection site ): Apply ice to the injection site Consider administration of an analgesic Observe the pati ent closely for 30 minutes, watching for generalized symptoms Make sure the patient has the telephone number of a provider to contact in case condition deteriorates. If the patient does not progress to any other symptoms, send patient home and contact pati ent 4 -6 hours later to assess recovery. If the patient becomes pale and/or feels faint , have the patient lie flat or sit in head down position for several minutes. If the patient loses consciousness, but has a steady pulse, normal blood pressure and respirations: Have the patient lie flat on their back with their feet elevated Have the patient rest in a quiet area for 30 minutes after regaining consciousness Notify the patient's primary care provider about the incident Continue to monitor vital signs. If the patient remains unconscious for more than 3 minutes, CALL 911. If the patient's vital signs are abnormal (decreased blood pressure, increased or irregular pulse, etc.): Place the patient flat on their back with their feet elevated CALL 911. If the patient experiences symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., the sudden or gradual onset of generalized itching , erythema (redness) , or urticaria (hives) ; angioedema (swelling of lips, face, throat; bronchospasm (wheezing ); shortness of breath ; shock ; abdominal cramping ; or cardiovascular collapse : If symptoms are generalized, activate the emergency medical system ( CALL 911) immediately (this should be done by a second person while the pharmacist assesses the level of cons ciousness, circulation, airway, and breathing of the patient) Place patient in a recumbent position and elevate the legs The first line therapy in anaphylaxis is epinephrine. There are no contraindications to epinephrine to 0.5ml, with maximum single dose of 0.5ml) If EMS has not arrived and symptoms are still present, the dose of epinephrine may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes until emergency assistance arrives, depending on the patient's response Immunization Statewide Protocol - Iowa Board of Pharmacy 11 July 1, 202 2 OPTIONAL TREATMENT: administer diphenhydramine (either orally or intramuscularly; the standard dose is 1 -2mg/kg every 4 -6 hours, up to 50mg maximum single dose). Do not attempt to give oral medications to a recipient who is not fully alert and able to swallow safely. Monitor the patient closely and check vital signs (BP, pulse, respirations) every 2 to 5 minutes. Stay with patient until emergency assistance arrives. If ne cessary, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and maintain airway. Keep patient in supine position unless he or she is having breathing difficulty. If breathing is difficult, patient's head may be elevated, provided blood pressure is adequate to pre vent loss of consciousness. If blood pressure is low, elevate legs. Record all vital signs, medications administered to the patient (including the time, dosage, response, and the name of the person who administered the vaccine), and other relevant clinical information concurrently in an adverse reaction medication log to be maintained by the pharmacy, a copy of which may be provided to EMS and/or the patient's primary care provider. An Adverse Reaction Log form is attached as Appendix E. Notify the patient 's primary health care provider as soon as reasonably possible. Each patient experiencing an anaphylactic reaction must be referred for evaluation, even if symptoms resolve completely.
