Blincyto\u00ae is approved for treatment of a certain type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute ALL. What is the mechanism of action? Blincyto is a type of drug known as a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies target and attach to cancer cells, which tells the immune system to destroy the cancer. Specifically, Blincyto targets a protein called CD19 that's found on the surface of B-cell leukemia cells. Another protein, CD3, that's found on the surface of T-cell lymphocytes (part of the immune system), then connects with CD19 to destroy the cancer cells. How is Blincyto typically given (administered)? Blincyto is given by intravenous (IV) infusion into your vein using an infusion pump. One treatment cycle includes a continuous IV infusion for four weeks, followed by a two-week break during which you will not be given Blincyto. After the two-week break, your healthcare provider will decide if you will be given Blincyto for additional treatment cycles. How are patients typically monitored? While you're receiving Blincyto, your doctor will monitor you for signs or symptoms of infection.
