Carter PhD 2019, Chemical Engineering; Advisor, Ronald Willey Incorporating Chemical Process Safety Education Into a Chemical Engineering Curriculum Using the Four Categories of Change Strategies Model Process safety education and training at US colleges and universities is currently insufficient to meet industry needs. Failure to prepare students with essential process safety training can and does lead to catastrophic and financially devastating events. Academia needs to recognize the importance of chemical process safety education, and to emphasize this need, the college accreditation board, ABET, requires evidence that students understand the hazards associated with these processes as part of chemical engineering program accreditation. The goal of this dissertation is to integrate process safety across the Northeastern University (NEU) Chemical Engineering (ChmE) curriculum to address these needs and minimize these risks. Failing to include mandated process safety in the curriculum can influence an ABET accreditation for a university program. At a minimum, a program will have to prepare a report addressing a weakness within 3 years and submit an Interim Report (IR), or at the extreme, Not to Accredit (NA).2 This would cause a loss of competitiveness and will result in fewer enrollees in the university. For Northeastern University, this is equivalent to an income stream of $27 million per year. It can cascade over to closer assessments by potential students in other engineering programs as well.

Robust correlations between deposition parameters and film metrics are also necessary to engineer scalable manufacturing processes that produce consistent material quality results. The work of this dissertation builds the case for dynamic, real time characterization of film formation and explores next generation X-ray light source materials needed to achieve this probing of bond formation.

In-vivo studies concluded that VNS inhibits GI inflammation by releasing neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from efferent vagus nerve fibers which binds macrophage nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), inhibiting pro- inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) production. The next decade of research demonstrated that ACh activated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) to ameliorate epithelial barrier integrity. However, several contradictory studies were published. One plausible explanation for the discrepancies is differential mAChR expression and/or biological function between GI cell lines. Evidently, our cellular understanding of cholinergic regulation of the intestinal epithelium is in its infancy. Nevertheless, bioelectric medicine may potentially augment inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment, warranting further investigation of cholinergic regulation of the intestinal epithelium. This research leveraged primary human organoids and microfluidics to develop physiologically relevant models for studying cholinergic regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Primary human intestinal organoids were dissociated and seeded on Transwell inserts.

Gel electrophoresis is irreplaceably applied for separation and isolation of macromolecules, including DNA, RNA and protein, by providing diffusion resistance to molecules of different size and shape. The separation capability of gel electrophoresis is relatively low for long DNA segment limited by the modest voltage employed for the separation, even for high voltage capillary electrophoresis system. On the other hand, temperature that can affect all physicochemical properties of solution, gel and macromolecules, plays a significant role in gel electrophoresis. Although uncontrolled temperature variation in electrophoresis is considered pestiferous to separation, leading to low reproducibility of separation and thermal degradation of sensitive analytes, a controlled variation in temperature can be beneficial to separation. Temperature has a strong influence on the diffusion coefficient, which determines migration rate in gel electrophoresis. Temperature, at the meantime, affects the structural and mechanical properties of gel such as pore size, gelation rate and elastic modulus, among which the pore size has a significant impact on diffusion.

Conventional chemotherapy, such as Doxorubicin (DOX), is widely used for TNBC treatment. However, it often accompanies severe side effects that limit the effective therapeutic dose for cancer treatment. The plasticity of cancer epigenetics makes them plausible candidates for therapeutic intervention. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetyltransferases (HDACs) are two of most well studied enzymes that regulate transcription and chromatin compaction. Aberrant expressions of DNMTs and HDACs have been implicated in a variety of cancers. A few DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been treating Panobinostat (PAN) were shown to reverse abnormal methylation of DNA and altered chromatin structure, respectively, leading to increased expression of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and decreased expression of oncogenes (OGs). However, epigenetic agents as a monotherapy did not show a therapeutic benefit against solid tumors. A targeted drug delivery vehicle may improve efficacy of epigenetic drugs.

Of particular interest are materials that undergo coupled magnetic phase transitions sensitive to changes in crystal structure (magnetostructural phase transitions). Magnetostructural phase transformations may be induced by applying multiple stimuli (temperature, pressure, magnetic field) and are often easily tuned by chemical substitution. Composition induced structure changes provide a method for studying the sensitivity of a materials magnetic response to specific bond alterations and changes in the electronic environment. This research aims to quantify the impact of detailed chemistry on the magnetic phase transitions in layered systems where structure and magnetism are strongly coupled. The focus of this Dissertation is to understand structure-composition-property correlations in AlFe2B2 and Fe5SiB2 based technologically relevant new magnetic material systems. Both magnetic systems have layered crystal structures that contribute to their large magnetocrystalline anisotropy, or preference for a material to magnetize along a particular crystallographic direction.

Template-assisted electrodeposition of Fe-Ni-Co nanowires has been extensively investigated due to its low cost, easy implementation, and dimension control at the nanoscale. Additionally, the electrochemical codeposition behavior of iron-group elements (i.e. Fe, Ni, and Co) exhibits an anomalous codeposition, where less noble elements are preferentially deposited. It has been well known that the hydrogen evolution reaction plays an important role in determining the resulting alloy composition and morphology of deposits when electroplating iron-group metals from an aqueous solution. Although the effect of the hydrogen evolution reaction has been intensively investigated on planar electrodes, there is a lack of studies on nanoporous electrodes.

Current treatment plans focus on systemic delivery of drugs; however these drugs frequently fail or are inadequate to prevent or reverse the damage. The purpose of this study is to develop a new class of colonoscope-based treatment options that specifically target the diseased area and locally deliver drugs and stem cells through sprayable application of a regenerative hydrogel during diagnostic procedures. Thermoresponsive hydrogel solutions can facilitate on- demand delivery of drugs and viable cell populations through instant solidification on intestinal tissue. Ultimately, the regeneration of diseased or damaged sections of the intestinal tract could maintain deep remission, increase intestinal function, reduce symptoms, and provide a higher quality of life for patients.

A multitude of delivery systems, such as hydrogels, micelles, liposomes, or polymeric nanoparticles have been proposed as carriers for brain drug delivery and for GBM targeting. However, many of them exhibited limited tumor- specific inhibition effects. Herein, a drug-encapsulated dual-functionalized thermosensitive liposomal system was developed for delivery across the BBB. Specifically, a GBM-specific cell-penetrating peptide and an anti-GBM antibody were conjugated onto liposome surface. In addition, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and the functionalized liposomes (DOX@P1NS/TNC-FeLP) in order to achieve thermo-triggered drug release by converting electromagnetic energy to heat using an alternating magnetic field (AMF).
