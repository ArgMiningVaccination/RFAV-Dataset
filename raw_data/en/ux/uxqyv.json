If we wish to avoid all risks, then moving to an isolated and remote area, while growing your own food, may be the only viable option. Assessing risk requires one to measure the associated benefits. That is why each of us is willing to drive an automobile, even though data indicates the U.S. accrued over [40,000 automobile accident deaths in 2021](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/overview/preliminary-monthly-estimates/).
