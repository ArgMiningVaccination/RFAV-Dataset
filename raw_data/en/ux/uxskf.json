Key Facts In a speech Thursday, Biden said all federal employees and contractors who aren't vaccinated will be required to take weekly or biweekly coronavirus tests, wear masks on the job, socially distance and steer clear of traveling for work. Biden also directed the Pentagon to \"look into how and when\" it can require active-duty troops to get immunized, likely adding the Covid-19 shots to a list of [more than a dozen vaccines](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/07/06/pentagon-eyes-possible-mandatory-covid-19-vaccine-fda-weighs-approval.html) already required for members of the military. The Department of Veterans Affairs [made vaccines mandatory](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/07/26/va-becomes-first-federal-agency-to-require-vaccines-for-some-workers-as-white-house-weighs-legality-of-broader-mandate/?sh=1de0f559555b) for its frontline healthcare staff earlier this week, the first federal agency to take that step. Big Number 2.1 million. That's how many civilians are [employed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43590.pdf) by the federal government, not including nearly 600,000 U.S. Postal Service staffers and over 1.4 million uniformed military personnel. Key Background Coronavirus cases are spiking nationwide due to the virus' more contagious new Delta variant, but vaccination rates have plateaued in recent months, leaving some undervaccinated communities at risk of severe outbreaks. As a result, some employers are [pushing staff to get immunized](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberleespeakman/2021/07/28/these-companies-are-requiring-workers-to-get-vaccinated-amid-covid-surge/?sh=4d851a9447ba): Microsoft, Google and Morgan Stanley will require in-office employees to prove their vaccination status, and the states of New York and California are rolling out vaccine-or-test mandates similar to the federal government's new rules. Mandatory vaccinations are still somewhat contentious, but the Department of Justice issued a legal memo this week stating that it believes public and private employers are [permitted](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/doj-covid-19-vaccine-requirements-olc-opinion/index.html) to require their staff to take the vaccines. Tangent Biden is also pushing private employers and local officials to offer vaccine incentives. The president [encouraged state and local governments](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/100-dollars-covid-vaccine-biden.html) to dole out $100 payments to all newly vaccinated residents, [possibly using](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-wants-state-local-govts-give-100-newly-vaccinated-americans-treasury-2021-07-29/) some of the Covid-19 relief funds Congress allocated to cities and states earlier this year. He's also urging employers to give their staff paid time off to get vaccinated or take their family members to vaccine appointments, noting that the federal government [will reimburse](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/irs-expands-employer-tax-credit-for-covid-vaccine-paid-time-off-to-include-workers-families.html) some employers for vaccine-related paid leave.
