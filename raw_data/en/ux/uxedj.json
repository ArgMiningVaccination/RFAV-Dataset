On this page [Skip this page navigation](#toc-end) Overview Vaccination reduces the chance that you will get sick or infected if you are exposed to COVID19. Workplace control measures reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus; [COVID19 vaccines](/page/covid-19-vaccines) do not replace these measures. This guidance explains how COVID19 vaccines may help to protect you and others at work. The information provided is general in nature and may not be appropriate for all workplace circumstances. Each workplace will have different health and safety measures that are right for that workplace. To work safely, take steps to learn about and follow: - the latest public health guidance - your workplace's [COVID19 safety plan](/page/guide-developing-your-covid-19-workplace-safety-plan) - current laws, regulations and by-laws How vaccines protect people Vaccination (also known as immunization) increases a person's ability to fight infection if they are exposed to a specific virus. The vaccine activates the body's natural immune response and makes it more ready to fight the virus. The COVID19 vaccines approved for use in Canada have been shown to work well to protect those who receive them. After being vaccinated you are much less likely to get sick if you are exposed to COVID19. However, you could still: - get infected - spread the virus to others This is because no vaccine works 100% of the time, and we are still learning: - how well the COVID19 vaccines may work against new variants - how long protection will last after COVID19 vaccination or infection All Ontarians aged five years and older are encouraged to get their booster dose, as evidence shows that vaccine protection decreases over time. - Most people under the age of 65 are recommended to get their booster six months after their last dose or following a COVID-19 infection. - People at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness are strongly recommended to get their booster at a three-month interval. [Find out when you should get your next dose.](/vaccine-eligibility/) It is important to keep following public health and other workplace control measures even after you have been vaccinated. Vaccination and COVID-19 workplace control measures Workplace control measures are actions that employers take to help prevent workers from being exposed to a hazard. Vaccines are a good complement to workplace controls but cannot replace them. They have different purposes: - Workplace controls help prevent workers from being exposed. - Vaccines help protect you from getting sick or infected if you are exposed. The most effective way to limit exposure to COVID19 is to avoid interactions between people. Consider options such as: - remote work - virtual meetings - home delivery - curbside pickup These measures help protect workers who have to go into the workplace. Even as more people in Ontario are vaccinated and boosted, COVID19 is still a hazard that may come into the workplace through infected workers or customers. There are a variety of control measures to help reduce the chance that workers who must be in the workplace may be exposed to COVID19: - screening helps to keep people who may be infectious out of the workplace - good ventilation and wearing masks can help reduce the amount of virus in an indoor space - maintaining physical distance reduces the chance of being exposed to respiratory droplets of all sizes - personal protective equipment (PPE) can help protect the wearer from exposure to the virus and may be required when other control measures cannot be consistently maintained Employers should assess the risks of exposure to COVID19 in their workplace and identify appropriate control measures. No single action or control measure is perfect in terms of controlling COVID19 risks. Employers need to continue to take steps to protect workers from COVID19 no matter how many of their workers are vaccinated. Workplace vaccination supports and policies The goal of Ontario's COVID19 vaccination plan is for everyone in Ontario to be able to get a COVID19 vaccination if they want one. Workers who are considered employees under the [Employment Standards Act](/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/infectious-disease-emergency-leave) (ESA) have the right to take job-protected [infectious disease emergency leave](/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0/infectious-disease-emergency-leave) if they need to take time off work to get vaccinated or because of side effects after vaccination. An employer cannot penalize an employee in any way for taking or planning on taking an infectious disease emergency leave. The OHSA and the ESA do not directly address vaccination or the enforcement of employer vaccination policies for workers. There may be other statutes and considerations that apply to a workplace vaccination policy. Getting legal advice before developing or implementing a vaccination policy can help employers understand the implications. This might include advice on topics such as: - human rights and accessibility - labour and employment law - privacy - health care consent - occupational health and safety There are many ways employers can encourage and promote the vaccine to their workers. If you are an employer and are considering whether to develop a policy related to vaccination, be clear on the outcomes you intend to achieve. This resource does not replace or modify the OHSA, the ESA or their respective regulations, and should not be used as or considered legal advice. Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development inspectors and officers apply the law based on the facts in the workplace. "}
