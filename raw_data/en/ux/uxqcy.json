Transforming darkness to light. One step courage, one step love, step by step is the path of the heart. Sweet healing energy, nature washing over me. Transforming darkness to light. 2021-06-15T21:29:07Z Comment by Kyrian Please post the words Simon, I'd like to sing your poetry but I can't catch them all :) Thank you for your creations! 2021-06-15T19:03:26Z Comment "}
