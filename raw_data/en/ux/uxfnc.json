The Village 'Vaidyas' also used to provide herbal medicines in various conditions. People approach them for some types of illnesses. Many of such treatments are documented and have scientific rationale behind them. Thousands of years back, our own medical system Ayurveda, and wellness systems like Yoga were developed in the country. Methods of prevention of illnesses and healing through Ayurveda and yoga are simple, the common remedies are cheap and safe and the drugs are mainly obtained from the nature. 1. AYURVEDA Ayurveda is an ancient science of life since time immemorial. Ayurveda, apart from providing various therapeutic measures for diseases, emphasizes on maintenance, promotion of health and prevention of diseases through diet and lifestyle regimens. As per Ayurveda, life is sustained by a tripoid of mental, physical and spiritual factors constituted by body (Sharir), senses (Indriyas), mind (Satwa) and spirit (Atma). The physical world including the human body is derived from the specific combinations of five fundamental entities viz. Akash, Vayu, Teja, Jala and Prithvi which are known Tridoshas carry out the physiological activities and are responsible for the integrity of the human body. Due to the faulty diet and lifestyle normalcy of the Tridoshas is disturbed and they aggravate in the body. Vitiated Tridoshas disturb the normalcy of Dhatus and Malas causing their vitiation which manifests as various diseases in the body. Thus the health of an individual depends upon the normalcy of the Doshas , Dhatus and Malas . Health of an individual can be known by following aspects- 1. Proper nourishment. 2.Proper strength. 3.Desire and appetite for intake of food. 4.Proper digestion of food ingested at proper time. 5.Sleep at proper time. 6.Absence of pathological or dreadful dreams. 7. Feeling of freshness after waking up in the morning. 8.Proper evacuation of faeces, urine, and flatus at the proper time. 9.Proper functioning of mental faculties, intelligence and senses in all respect. 10.Absence of any kind of pain. Adopting healthy living ways advocated/ described in Ayurveda such as Dincharya (daily lifestyle), Ritucharya (seasonal lifestyle) and Sadvritta (code of conduct) etc. a person can remain healthy by maintaining the normalcy of the Doshas, Dhatus and Malas. Following these regimens will help an individual in achieving promotion of health, maintenance of health and prevention from various diseases. 3 2. YOGA Yoga is a science as well an art of healthy living physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. It's no way limited by race, age, sex, religion, cast or creed and can be practiced by those who seek an education on better living and those who want to have a more meaningful life. Yoga system advocates the eight fold path, popularly known as \"Ashtanga Yoga\" for all-round development of human Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana & Samadhi for increasing the power of concentration, mental purity and steadiness. The practice of Yama i.e., Ahimsa (not to harm others), Satya (to be truthful), Asteya (not to steal). Brahmacharya (celibacy), Aparigraha (not to possess beyond actual needs) along with the practice of Niyama i.e., Souch (external and internal purification), Santosh (contentment), Tapa (to make right efforts to achieve goals). Swadhyaya (to study authentic texts to acquire correct knowledge), and Ishwar Pranidhan (complete surrender to the divine will) paves way to increase the power of concentration, mental purity and steadiness. Asanas are special patterns of postures that stabilise the mind and the body through static stretching. Their aim is to establish proper mechanism in the nerve muscle co-ordination and improve the general muscle tone. Two basic principles governing the performance of Asanas are stability and comfort. Every Asana should be performed effortlessly and maintained for a comfortable time. There should be no jerks and the performance of Asana should not lead to undue fatigue. Pranayama is the science of regulating and gaining control over the prana or breath or life force. Normally, there are 3 components of breathing \u2014 Inhalation (Puraka), Exhalation (Rechaka) and Stoppage of breath (Kumbhaka). Maintaining Kumbhaka is the main aim of Pranayama but it should be Kevala Kumbhaka, a natural cessation of breath without any force. Pranayamas help in getting control over the thought processes in the mind as breath acts as a mediator between body and mind. The other benefits of Pranayama along with Kumbhaka are development of deep relaxation, lowered metabolic rate, sense of blissfulness, expansiveness and solitary thought. According to Yoga, most of the diseases Mental, Psychosomatic and Physical originate in mind through wrong way of thinking, living and eating which is caused by attachment. The basic approach of Yoga is to correct the life style by cultivating a rational positive and spiritual attitude towards all life situations. In recent times there is a growing awareness among the people about the efficacy and utility of Yoga and Nature Cure in keeping one fit at physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual planes. 4 Concept of Healthy living in Ayurveda and Yoga Following ways are described in Ayurveda for maintenance of health and treatment of diseases. A . Diet and Nutrition, B . Regimen of Personal and Social Hygiene :- Daily routine (Dinacharya), Seasonal regimens (Ritucharya), including basic sanitation and healthy living environment. Let us describe these one by one: A . Our Diet Diet plays very important role in our physical and mental health status. Many common health problems can be prevented or treated by consumption of a good diet. Following may be advised to the people in your community- Wash vegetables & fruits properly before cooking. Use boiling, steaming, grilling etc. as methods of cooking. Whole wheat flour (without sieving) may be prepared for making roti. Roti made out of jowar, bajra, ragi, maize (macca) are also having high fibre content. The use of white bread, nan, roomali roti and other maida preparations should be limited. It is desirable to take 50-100 gms/day fibre, when whole grain cereals, pulses and vegetables are consumed daily. It is for our advantage to maintain our traditional cooking and eating patterns. Increase locally available seasonal fruits and green leafy vegetables in the diet. As far as possible eat freshly prepared food. Reheating and refrigerating tends to lose the taste and nourishment. Do eat when you feel hungry i.e don't avoid mealtimes. Develop the habit of taking meals at regular intervals. Avoid overeating. Avoid eating too fast or too slow. Food eaten hurriedly does not get digested properly, it does not give a sense of fulfilment. On the contrary one tends to eat more. Don't drink too much or too little water since both hamper the digestion. Drinking of luke warm water helps easy passage of motion and urine, enhance digestive power, minimize the diseases related to digestive system and delayed ageing. Don't eat when the mind is unstable because you may eat less or in excess. Avoid heavy tasks immediately after meals since the blood circulation is diverted towards the site of action rather than towards digestion of food. It also creates pressure on the heart. After meals don't sleep immediately. But do take rest for a while before resuming your work. Dinner should be taken at least two hours before sleep. Avoid fried foods, restrict intake of ghee, oils. Cook the vegetables with minimum oil. Reduce salt and sugar intake. Avoid intake of aerated drinks (cola), fast/junk food (Chips, burger, samosa, pizza etc.). Increase intake of milk, butter milk, Lassi, coconut water etc. 5 Food should be taken after bathing, washing the hands, legs and face and without any disturbance. While taking the food, one should not divert his attention to other things. After the meals rinse the mouth and hands thoroughly with water. According to Ayurveda the diet is one of the most important factors which have direct impact on three Doshas/humors. To keep these Doshas balanced, our diet should contain all Tastes (Rasas) in a balanced way. For healthy person it is advised in Ayurveda to not to fill stomach full, while taking food. Stomach should be divided into three portions and one portion should be filled by food, second by water and third should be kept vacant for movement of Doshas (Humors). The right quantity of food is decided upon the nature of food substances such as heaviness or lightness and digestive power of the person. Food items like flour products, milk products, sugar cane products, pulses like Urad (Phascolus mungo ), meat etc. are heavy in nature whereas rice, wheat, pulses like moong dal (green gram) etc. are light in nature and easy to digest. Useful food items for daily use Edibles prepared with cereals like wheat (Gehun/Godhuma) and Barley (Yava) Condiments prepared from meat Rock for regular use. Fenugreek (methi) has high fibre content and useful in reducing blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Green vegetables like Bittergourd (karela), Lettuce leaves, Ladies finger (bhindi), Carrot (gajar), Soya Beans, Drumstik, and Jambu (Jamun) seeds are having beneficial effects for people suffering from Diabetes. However, Curd, Kshara like Kanji (Alkaline preparations), Vinegar, uncooked radish, dried meat, pork, meat of sheep, cow, black gram, bean, tuberous roots, the fibers of lotus (Kamalgutta), sweets prepared by grinding cereals, dried leaves, and molasses are all undesirable for regular use particularly in Diabetes patients. B. Personal and social hygiene Personal and social hygiene can be maintained by following Dinacharya (daily routine ), Ritucharya ( seasonal regimens) and Sadvritta conduct) which are described as following- 1.Daily routine (Dinacharya) can be summarized as following- 1 Wake up early at least 1 hour before sun rise. 2 Attending nature's call (Malotsarg) - bowels, urination etc. Never suppress nor forcefully void the natural urges - Vegavidharan (suppression) can lead to many diseases. For defecation one should always use toilets and it should not be done in open grounds. After defecation, the anal area should be cleaned properly with water and hands should be washed properly with soap. 3 Care of Teeth - Usage of fresh stick of Neem (Azadirachta indica), Khadir (Acacia catechu) etc. can clean teeth, and vanish foul smell. 4 Nasal drops (Nasya)- Put two drops of sesame oil/ mustard oil/ghee or Anu Talia (An Ayurvedic medicine if available)- It prevents premature greying of hair, baldness and ensures good sleep. 5 Mouth wash (Gandush)- Fill mouth with Triphala decoction or other medicated oils - It prevents excess thirst, improves taste and maintains oral hygiene. It is also useful in managing the mouth ulcers and dryness commonly seen in Diabetes patients. 6 6 Oleation (Abhyanga)- application of oil daily e.g. Tila Taila (Seasame oil) - Keeps skin soft, improves blood circulation and removes waste. This helps in prevention of numbness of extremities due to Diabetes. Apply Tila (Seasame) oil or any suitable oil on head in sufficient quantity which enhances the strength of head and forehead and makes hair black, long and deep-rooted. 7 Exercise (Vyayama)- Exercise should be done till sweat rolls down from neck, forehead etc. Exercising early in the morning can help remove stagnation in the body and can help recharge and rejuvenate your body and mind for a productive day.

In summer one can take a small nap during day time also. Too much sleep and too little sleep, both are not good for healthy living. Generally day sleeping is not advisable. 2. Seasonal regimens (Ritucharya) Role of seasons in health and diseases-Ayurveda stresses a lot at the role of seasons on the body and advises that we must change our daily routine depending on the seasons. This is known as Ritucharya. It helps in preserving the health as the season changes. Tips to combat summer heat There are certain measures that you can take to combat the summer heat and stay cool and comfortable. Follow these guidelines:- Drink plenty of liquids like coconut water, sugarcane juice, buttermilk or atleast 10 glass of water a day.
