When our energy is imbalanced it affects our health. The Chakra and Aura Healing Diploma Course explores the concepts of chakras and auras, giving full and clear explanations of how blockages in our chakra energy centres and uncleansed auras can lead to mental, physical, and spiritual discord. You'll discover how to recognise the symptoms of these and how to heal yourself and others of specific conditions, through energy healing. The theory of the major energy centres of our bodies known as chakras, is found in many healing practices. Chakras are responsible for our energetic, emotional, physical, psychological, mental and spiritual wellbeing. This online Chakra and Aura Healing Course provides a comprehensive understanding of how they work, where they are located, their meanings, and how each governs our mind, body, emotions and spirit. As your knowledge of the chakras expands, the course introduces the problems that can occur in the chakras and what the symptoms and remedies for these are, as well as how to cleanse and stimulate each of them. You'll gain an increased awareness of which of the chakras is out of balance by the symptoms present, whether they are over or under active, some simple ways to provide general healing to all chakras, what each will make you feel when they are in a balanced state, and how to stimulate and open chakras. There are several tools available to you that will aid in activating, balancing, or amplifying the energy of the chakras. The Chakra and Aura Healing Course talks you through how to choose and use healing stones, essential oils, pendulums and reiki symbols to heal specific chakras or to provide an overall balancing. An aura is an energy field that surrounds a person or object. Made up of coloured layers, this field can be sensed, and even seen, and can tell you a lot about the person it surrounds, as the layers contain information that relates to their physical, emotional, mental and spiritual body. This course teaches you what auras are and how to sense and see them. You'll learn the location, colour and meaning of the seven layers of auras. People usually have one or two colours that dominate or consistently flash in their aura, which can indicate particular physical or emotional traits; you'll discover how to translate these colours. People accumulate unwanted energies in daily life and regular aura cleansing supports health and wellbeing. The longer a person's aura goes without being cleansed, the more their energy system will attract lower, unhealthy, vibrations. The Chakra and Aura Healing Diploma Course shows you what can go wrong with a person's aura, how to recognise when an aura needs cleansing and both general and specifics ways to provide cleansing. Having learnt about chakras and auras, how each can become disordered and how to go about bringing back balance, the course finishes with guidance on how to conduct a healing session. This includes instruction on how to prepare yourself, how to conduct the sessions themselves (including some additional tips), post-healing advice for the client, and some information on your ethical responsibilities.
