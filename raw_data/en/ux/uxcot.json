These diet guidelines should be used before and after therapy. Please check with your doctor, nurse, or dietitian if you have questions about the diet or safe food preparation. They can also tell you when you no longer need to follow these guidelines. Most of the time, it is suggested that: - Autologous transplant patients: Stay on this plan for the first 3 months after transplant - Allogeneic transplant patients: Stay on this plan until off all immunosuppressive therapy General Tips Fresh fruits and vegetables are allowed on this diet. Be sure to check for and avoid those with bruises and/or broken skins. It is important that fresh produce is washed well (rinsed under clean, running water before use, including produce that is to be cooked or peeled,i.e., bananas, oranges, melon). Avoid raw or rare-cooked meat, fish, and eggs. Meat should be cooked to the \"well done\" stage. All eggs should be fully cooked (no runny yolks). Avoid foods that are visibly rotten and/or have mold. Do not use food that smells bad. Do not keep leftovers for more than 3 days. Do not share food or drinks with other people, even family members. All dairy products must be pasteurized. Wash hands with warm water and soap before handling food. Wash all sinks, counters, handles, cutting boards and cutting utensils very well. Keep hot food hot and cold food cold. Tips for Dining Out - Eat early to avoid crowds. - Ask that food be made fresh in fast-food restaurants. - Avoid raw fruits and vegetables when dining out; save these items for home, where you can wash and prepare them safely. - Do not eat salsa or other condiments that are not refrigerated and are used by many people at a restaurant. - Ask for single-serving condiment packages. Do not use public self-serve condiment containers. - Avoid salad bars, delicatessens, buffets, smorgasbords, potlucks, and sidewalk vendors. These are high-risk food sources due to the risk of improper food storage or holding temperature and poor hygiene by food handlers. - Check the general condition of the restaurant. Are the plates, glasses, and utensils clean? Are the restrooms clean and stocked with soap and paper towels? How clean the restaurant looks may suggest the level of care taken while making the food.
