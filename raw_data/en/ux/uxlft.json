We had many interesting turn of events: a new biobank director, dozens of new biobank projects, fruitful national and international collaborations, and the successful collection of samples from a new national health survey. Sirpa Soini is the new director of THL Biobank THL Biobank has a new director since 2017. LL.M. Sirpa Soini is a former THL employee, with vast knowledge of the biomedical field and expert in ethico-legal issues. Our former director Anu Jalanko has been selected as the coordinator of a new and exciting international biobank project led by the University of Helsinki, and she will continue to serve as the national coordinator of the Finnish Biobank Network BBMRI.fi. We warmly thank Anu for her excellent ground breaking work in the establishment of THL Biobank and its operations. A new national health survey and a new genome-based health study collected to the biobank [The FinHealth 2017 national health survey](https://www.thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/research-and-expertwork/population-studies/national-finhealth-study) was successfully completed this year. More than 97% of the participants gave consent to use their samples and data also in biobank research. These population-wide health surveys are immensely important for studying the health and wellbeing of the Finnish population. We are happy and grateful for this high participation rate. [GeneRISK](https://www.thl.fi/en/web/thl-biobank/for-researchers/sample-collections/generisk-study), a study in which genomic information is used for assessing the cardiovascular disease risk of participants has also been transferred to THL Biobank in 2017. Is this study, participants obtain information on their disease risk which is based also on their genomic information. Plenty new biobank projects and research collaborations Our collaborators include the world's leading genomic research institutes. This year THL Biobank approved 29 new research projects. The largest one, [FinnGen](https://www.finngen.fi/en), is a six year long effort to identify new therapeutic targets and diagnostics for treating numerous diseases. In this project, genome information from hundreds of thousands of biobank donors will be combined with digital health care information. The FinnGen study involves all Finnish biobanks and is an unprecedented global research project representing one of the largest studies of this type. Our biobank's sample handling laboratory has been very busy during this year, extracting DNA from 17.000 samples and providing 35.000 DNA sample aliquots to different research groups and projects. THL's renowned Research Professors Markus Perola and Veikko Salomaa are again on [the Highly Cited Researchers list of 2017](https://www.thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/-/markus-perola-and-veikko-salomaa-again-among-the-world-s-highly-cited-researchers) published by Clarivate Analytics. Both are using actively THL's national health surveys in their research projects. We thank them for this valuable collaboration. Participation in the European Biobank Network THL continues to coordinate the national biobank [network BBMRI.fi](http://www.bbmri.fi/en) to advance the Finnish Biobank field in Finland and elsewhere. Our active participation in [BBMRI-ERIC](http://www.bbmri-eric.eu/) activities and projects provides an important link to other European biobanks and biobank networks. We thank BBMRI-ERIC's former general director Jan-Eric Litton for excellent collaboration over the past years and welcome BBMRI-ERIC's new general director Erik Steinfelder to visit Finland in January 2018! What will 2018 bring? EU's new general data protection regulation (GDPR) becomes applied on May 2018. THL Biobank has started to prepare for the new regulation. One of our top activities in the beginning of 2018 will be to finalize all documents and processes to be compatible with the regulation. At the same time we want to create smoother research administration process. THL Biobank aims to develop ways for sample donors to be more actively involved in biobank activities. This includes telling them about biobanks and how their samples and data are used in biobank research. We will also pilot how to return sample donors health related information. Next year Sirpa Soini will start writing a blog to discuss current issues of the biobank field. You are welcome to follow Sirpa's "}
