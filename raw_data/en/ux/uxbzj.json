In this Q&A, Kristin Oliver, MD, MHS, a pediatrician and preventive medicine physician at the Mount Sinai Health System, explains the benefits of the booster shot and urges parents to talk with their child's health care provider if they have questions. \"We know information about COVID-19 and vaccination is constantly evolving,\" says Dr. Oliver, who is also an Associate Professor of Pediatrics, and Environmental Medicine and Public Health, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"Reach out to your child's pediatrician if you have any questions. We are happy to talk with you.\" What are the benefits of getting a COVID-19 booster shot? While two doses of COVID-19 vaccine continue to give good protection to children against severe disease and hospitalization from COVID-19, protection from infection decreases at around five months after completing the series. A booster dose may increase protection against infection, emergency department and urgent care visits, and severe disease. What side effects can we expect? Side effects after a booster dose are similar to side effects after the second dose, with pain at the injection site most common, followed by tiredness and headache. Is there any data on how effective the booster shot is? In the study of 5- to 11-year-olds, the booster dose increased levels of antibodies to COVID-19 to higher than they were after the first two doses. While there is not enough data from that study yet to see the effectiveness against infection in this age group, there is good data that a booster dose in older age groups provides increased protection against infection and severe disease. We expect to see this same increase in protection for children ages 5 to 11. If my child had COVID-19, do they still need to get a booster? A recent COVID-19 infection does provide some protection in the short term, but that protection also decreases over time. Depending on your child's risk factors and potential exposures, for children with a recent COVID-19 infection you may want to consider waiting three months before getting a booster dose. Waiting this amount of time may result in a better antibody response. You can speak with your child's doctor about this choice. Is there anything else parents should know about the booster shot and staying safe from COVID-19? The most important thing you can do is get the first two doses of the vaccine if you haven't yet. Hospitalization with COVID-19 is twice as high for children who are unvaccinated compared to children who received two doses of the vaccine, even during the recent Omicron surge. "}
