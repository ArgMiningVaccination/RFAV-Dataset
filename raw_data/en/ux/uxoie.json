Using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Across these sports, scoring tempo\u2014when scoring events occur\u2014closely follows a common Poisson process, with a sport-specic rate. Simi- larly, scoring balance\u2014how often a team wins an event\u2014follows a common Bernoulli process, with a parameter that eectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we nd they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical pat- terns underlying within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest specic mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics. Professional team sports like American football, soc- cer, hockey, basketball, etc. provide a rich and relatively well-controlled domain by which to study fundamental questions about the dynamics of competition. In these sports, most environmental irregularities are eliminated, players are highly trained, and rules are enforced consis- tently. These features produce a level playing eld on which competition outcomes are determined largely by a combination of skill and luck (ideally more the former than the latter). Modern sports in particular produce large quantities of detailed data describing not only competition out- comes and team characteristics, but also the individual events within a competition, e.g., scoring events, referee calls, timeouts, ball possessions, court positions, etc. The availability of such data has enabled many quantitative analyses of individual sports [1-6]. Relatively little work, however, has asked what patterns or principles, if any, cut across dierent sports, or whether there are fundamental processes governing some dynamical aspects of all such competitions. These questions are the focus of this study, and our results shed light on several other phenomena, including the roles of skill and luck in determining out- comes, and the extent to which events early in the game influence events later in the game. Game theory provides an attractive quantitative framework for understanding the principles and dynam- ics of competition [7]. Given a set of payos for dier- ent actions, formal game theory can identify the optimal strategy or probability distribution over actions against an intelligent adversary. In simple decision spaces, like penalty shots in soccer [8] or serve-and-return play in ten- nis [9], professional athletes appear to behave as game theory predicts (although some do not [10]). However, sears.merritt@colorado.edu aaron.clauset@colorado.edumost professional team sports exhibit large and complex decision spaces, with many possible actions of uncertain payos, and execution is carried out by an imperfectly coordinated team. Game theory provides less guidance within such complex games, and the resulting dynam- ics are often better described using tools from dynamical systems [11, 12]. Using such an approach, we investigate the within- game scoring dynamics of four team sports, college and professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball. Our primary goals are (i) to quantify and identify the common empirical patterns in scoring dynamics of these sports, and (ii) to understand the competitive processes that produce these patterns. We do not consider non-stationary eects across games, e.g., evolving team rosters or skill sets, playing eld vari- ables, etc. Instead, we focus explicitly on the sequence of scoring events within games. For each sport, we study three measurable quantities: scoring event tempo, bal- ance, and predictability. We take an inferential approach to investigating their cross-sport patterns and present a generative model of competition dynamics that can be tted directly to scoring event data within games. We apply this model to a comprehensive data set of 1,279,901 scoring events across 9 or 10 years of consecutive seasons in our four team sports. There are many claims in both the academic litera- ture and the popular press about scoring dynamics within sports, and sports are often used as exemplars of decision making and dynamics in complex competitive environ- ments [10, 13-15]. Our results on common patterns in scoring dynamics and the processes that generate them serve to clarify, and in several cases directly contradict, many of these claims, and provide a systematic perspec- tive on the general phenomenon. Summary of results . Here we provide a brief summary of our results, and Table IV presents them in the form of a series of specic questions and answers.arXiv:1310.4461v1 [stat.AP] 16 Oct 20132 Across all sports, scoring tempo\u2014when scoring events occur\u2014is remarkably well-described by a Poisson pro- cess, in which scoring events occur independently with a sport-specic rate at each second on the game clock. This rate is fairly stable across the course of gameplay, except in the rst and last few seconds of a scoring period, where it is much lower or much higher, respectively, than normal. This common pattern implies that scoring events are largely memoryless, i.e., the timing of events earlier in the game have little or no impact on the timing of future events. Memorylessness contrasts with the dynamics of strategic games like chess or Go, in which events early in a game constrain and drive later events. Instead, profes- sional sports appear to exhibit little strategic entailment, and events are driven instead by short-term optimization for scoring as quickly as possible. The scoring balance between teams\u2014how often a team wins a scoring event\u2014is well-described by a common Bernoulli process, with a bias parameter that varies ef- fectively over gameplay and across sports. Football and hockey exhibit a common pattern in which the probabil- ity of scoring again while in the lead eectively increases with lead size. In basketball, however, this probability decreases with lead size (a phenomenon rst identied by [5]). The former pattern is consistent with the out- come of each scoring event being determined by a memo- ryless coin flip whose bias depends on the dierence in the teams' inherent skill levels. The pattern in basketball is also consistent with such a process, but where on-court team skill varies inversely with lead size as a result of teams deploying their weaker players when they are in the lead and their stronger players when they are not. This player management strategy produces substantially more unpredictable games than in other sports, with win- ning teams losing their lead and losing teams regaining it much more often than we would normally expect. Overall, these results reinforce the conclusions from scoring tempo, indicating that event outcomes early in a game have little or no impact on event outcomes later in the game, which reinforces statistical claims that teams do not become \"hot,\" [5, 13, 16] with successes running in streaks. Instead, gameplay is largely a se- quence of roughly independent, short-term optimizations aimed at maximizing near-term scoring rates, with little multi-play strategic eorts and few downstream conse- quences for mistakes or miscalculations. This memory- lessness may be caused by a persistently level playing eld, which lacks strategically exploitable environmental features [17] and forbids actions that might produce sus- tained competitive advantages [18] as a result of within- game choices, e.g., eliminating an opposing team's best players. We combine these insights within a generative model of gameplay and demonstrate that it accurately repro- duces the observed evolution of lead-sizes over the course of games in all four sports, and also makes highly accu- rate predictions of game outcomes, when only the rst few scoring events have occurred. Cursory comparisonssuggest that this model achieves accuracy comparable to or better than several commercial odds-makers, de- spite this model knowing nothing about teams, players, or strategies, and instead relying exclusively on the ob- served tempo and balance patterns in scoring events. I. A NULL MODEL FOR COMPETITION DYNAMICS We rst introduce the limiting case of an ideal compe- tition , which provides a useful tool by which to identify and quantify interesting deviations within real data, and to generate hypotheses as to what underlying processes might produce them. Although we describe this model in terms of two teams accumulating points, it can in prin- ciple be generalized to other forms of competition. In an ideal competition, events unfold on a perfectly neutral or \"level\" playing eld, in which there are no environmental features that could give one side a com- petitive advantage over the other [17]. Furthermore, each side is perfectly skilled, i.e., they possess complete infor- mation both about the state of the game, e.g., the posi- tion of the ball, the location of the players, etc. and the set of possible strategies, their optimum responses, and their likelihood of being employed. This is an unrealistic assumption, as real competitors are imperfectly skilled, and possess both imperfect information and incomplete strategic knowledge of the game. However, increased skill generally implies improved performance on these char- acteristics, and the limiting case would be perfect skill. Finally, each side exhibits a slightly imperfect ability to execute any particular chosen strategy, which captures the fact that no side can control all variables on the eld. In other words, two perfectly skilled teams competing on a level playing eld will produce scoring events by chance alone, e.g., a slight miscalculation of velocity, a fumbled pass, shifting environmental variables like wind or heat, etc. An ideal competition thus eliminates all of the envi- ronmental, player, and strategic heterogeneities that nor- mally distinguish and limit a team. The result, particu- larly from the spectator's point of view, is a competition whose dynamics are fundamentally unpredictable. Such a competition would be equivalent to a simple stochastic process, in which scoring events arrive randomly, via a Poisson process with rate \u0000, points are awarded to each team with equal probability, as in a fair Bernoulli pro- cess with parameter c=1/2, and the number of those points is an iid random variable from some sport-specic distribution. Mathematically, let Sr(t) and Sb(t) denote the cumu- lative scores of teams randsat time t,w h e r e0 tT represents the game clock. (For simplicity, we do not treat overtime and instead let the game end at t=T.) The probability that Srincreases by kpoints at time tis equal to the joint probability of observing an event worth kpoints, scored by team rat time t.

Real competitions will deviate from this ideal because they possess various non-ideal features. The type and size of such deviations are evidence for competitive mech- anisms that drive the scoring dynamics away from the ideal. II. SCORING EVENT DATA Throughout our analyses, we utilize a comprehensive data set of all points scored in league games of consecu- tive seasons of college-level American football (NCAA Di- visions 1-3, 10 seasons; 2000-2009), professional Ameri- can football (NFL, 10 seasons; 2000-2009), professional hockey (NHL, 10 seasons; 2000-2009), and professional basketball (NBA, 9 seasons, 2002-2010).[19] Each scor- ing event includes the time at which the event occurred, the player and corresponding team that won the event, and the number of points it was worth. From these, we extract all scoring events that occurred during regulation time (i.e., we exclude all overtime events), which account for 99% or more of scoring events in each sport, and we combine events that occur at the same second of game time. Table I summarizes these data, which encompass more than 1.25 million scoring events across more than 40,000 games. A brief overview of each sport's primary game mechan- ics is provided in Appendix A. In general, games in these sports are competitions between two teams of xed size, and points are accumulated each time one team places the ball or puck in the opposing team's goal. Playing elds are flat, featureless surfaces. Gameplay is divided into three or four scoring periods within a maximum of 48 or 60 minutes (not including potential overtime). The team with the greatest score at the end of this time is declared the winner.III. GAME TEMPO A game's \"tempo\" is the speed at which scoring events occur over the course of play. Past work on the timing of scoring events has largely focused on hockey and basket- ball [3, 5], with little work examining football or in con- trasting patterns across sports. However, these studies show strong evidence that game tempo is well approxi- mated by a homogenous Poisson process, in which scoring events occur at each moment in time independently with some small and roughly constant probability. Analyzing the timing of scoring events across all four of our sports, we nd that the Poisson process is a remark- ably good model of game tempo, yielding predictions that are in good or excellent agreement with a variety of sta- tistical measures of game play. Furthermore, these re- sults conrm and extend previous work [5, 13] showing little or no evidence for the popular belief in \"momen- tum\" or \"hot hands,\" in which scoring once increases the probability of scoring again very soon. However, we do nd some evidence for modest non-Poissonian patterns in tempo, some of which are common to all four sports. A. The Poisson model of tempo A Poisson process is fully characterized by a single pa- rameter \u0000, representing the probability that an event oc- curs, or the expected number of events, per unit time. In each sport, game time is divided into seconds and there areTseconds per a game (see Table II). For each sport, we test this model in several ways: we compare the empir- ical and predicted distributions for the number of events per game and for the time between consecutive scoring sport \u0000T 91.99 31.3 TABLE II. Tempo summary statistics for each sport, along with simple derived values for the expected number of events per game and seconds between events. Parenthetical values indicate standard uncertainty in the nal digit.4 FIG. 1. Empirical distributions for the number of scoring events per game, along with the estimated Poisson model with rate\u0000T(dashed).events, and we examine the two-point correlation func-tion for these times.Under a Poisson model the number of scoringevents per game follows a Poisson distribution with pa-rameter\u0000T, and the maximum likelihood estimate of\u0000isthe average number of events observed in a game dividedby the number of intervals (which varies per sport). Fur-thermore, the time between consecutive events followsa simple geometric (discrete exponential) distribution,with mean 1/\u0000, and the two-point correlation betweenthese delays is zero at all time scales.For the number of events per game, we nd generallyexcellent agreement between the Poisson model and thedata for every sport (Figure 1). However, there are somesmall deviations, which suggests some second-order, non-Poissonian processes, which we investigate below. Devi-ations are greatest in NHL games, whose distribution isslightly broader than predicted, underproducing gameswith 3 events, and overproducing games with 0 or with8 or more events. Similarly, CFB games have a slightexcess of games with 9 events, and NBA games exhibitslightly more variation in NBA games with scores closeto the average (92.0 events) than expected. In contrast,NFL games exhibit slightly less variance than expected,with more games close to the average (7.3 events) thanexpected.For the time between consecutive scoring events withina game, or the inter-arrival time distribution, we againnd excellent agreement between the Poisson model andthe data in all sports (Figure 2). That being said, inCFB, NFL and NBA games, there are slightly fewer gapsof the minimum size than predicted by the model. Thisindicates a slight dispersive eect in the timing of events,perhaps caused by the time required to transport theball some distance before a new event may be generated.In contrast, NHL games produce as many short gaps,more intermediate gaps, and fewer very long gaps thanexpected were events purely Poissonian.Finally, we calculate the two-point correlation functionon the times events [21],C(n)= Xk(tk\u0000hti)(tk+n\u0000hti)!,Xk(tk\u0000hti)2,(2)wheretkis thekth inter-arrival time,nindicates the event, andhtiis the mean5 05 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 5 0 0 4 0 0 0Interarrival time, t (seconds)10\u0000410\u0000310\u0000210\u00001100Pr(T\u0000t)CFB DataExp.,\u0000=0.00202468 1 0Lag, n\u00000.50.00.51.0C(n) 05 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 5 0 0 4 0 0 0Interarrival time, t (seconds)10\u0000410\u0000310\u0000210\u00001100Pr(T\u0000t)NFL DataExp.,\u0000=0.00202468 1 0Lag, n\u00000.50.00.51.0C(n) 05 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 5 0 0 4 0 0 0Interarrival time, t (seconds)10\u0000210\u00001100Pr(T\u0000t)NHL DataExp.,\u0000=0.00102468 1 0Lag, n\u00000.50.00.51.0C(n) 05 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 3 0 0 3 5 0 4 0 0 4 5 0Interarrival time, t (seconds)10\u0000410\u0000310\u0000210\u00001100Pr(T\u0000t)NBA DataExp.,\u0000=0.04502468 1 0Lag, n\u00000.20.00.20.40.60.81.0C(n) FIG. 2.

IfC(n) is positive, short intervalstend to be followed by other short intervals (or, large in-tervals by large intervals), while a negative value impliesalternation, with short intervals followed by long, or viceversa. Across all four sports, the correlation function isclose or very close to zero for all values ofn(Figure 2insets), in excellent agreement with the Poisson process,which predictsC(n) = 0 for alln>0, representing nocorrelation in the timing of events (a result also foundby [5] in basketball). However, in CFB, NFL and NHLgames, we nd a slight negative correlation for very smallvalues ofn, suggesting a slight tendency for short inter-vals to be closely followed by longer ones, and vice versa.B. Common patterns in game tempoOur results above provide strong support for a com-mon Poisson process as an excellent explanatory model ofgame tempo across all four sports. We also nd some ev-idence for mild non-Poissonian processes, which we nowinvestigate by directly examining the scoring rate as afunction of clock time. Within each sport, we tabulatethe fraction of games in which a scoring event (associatedwith any number of points) occurred in thetth second ofgameplay.Across all sports, we nd that the tempo of events fol-lows a common three-phase pattern within each distinctperiod of play (Figure 3). This pattern, which resemblesan inverse sigmoid, is characterized by (i) an early phaseof non-linearly increasing tempo, (ii) a middle phase ofstable (Poissonian) or slightly increasing tempo, and (iii)an end phase of sharply increasing tempo. This patternis also observed in certain online games [17], which havesubstantially dierent rules and are played in highly het-erogeneous environments, suggesting a possibly funda-mental generating mechanism for team-competitive sys-tems.Early phase: non-linear increase in tempo.W h e n aperiod begins, players are in specic and xed locationson the eld, and the ball or puck is far from any team'sgoal. Thus, without regard to other aspects of the game,it must take some time for players to move out of theseinitial positions and to establish scoring opportunities.This would reduce the probability of scoring relative tothe game average by limiting access to certain player-ball6 FIG. 3. Empirical probability of scoring events as a function of game time, for each sport, along with the mean within-sportprobability (dashed line). Each distinct game period shows a common three-phase pattern in tempo.congurations that require time to set up. Furthermore,and potentially most strongly in the rst of these phases(beginning att= 0), players and teams may still be\"warming up,\" in the sense of learning [22] the capabil-ities and tendencies of the opposing team and players,and which tactics to deploy against the opposing team'schoices. These behaviors would also reduce the proba-bility of scoring by encouraging risk averse behavior inestablishing and taking scoring opportunities.We nd evidence for both mechanisms in our data.Both CFB and NFL games exhibit short and modest-sized dips in scoring rates in periods 2 and 4, reflectingthe fact that player and ball positions are not reset whenthe preceding quarters end, but rather gameplay in thenew quarter resumes from its previous conguration. Incontrast, CFB and NFL periods 1 and 3 show signicantdrops in scoring rates, and both of these quarters beginwith a kicko from xed positions on the eld. Sim-ilarly, NBA and NHL games exhibit strong but short-duration dips in scoring rate at the beginning of each oftheir periods, reflecting the fact that each quarter beginswith a tossup or face-o, in which players are located inxed positions on the court or rink. NBA and footballgames also exhibit some evidence of the \"warming up\"process, with the overall scoring rate being slightly lowerin period 1 than in other equivalent periods. In contrast,NHL games exhibit a prolonged warmup period, lastingwell past the end of the rst period. This pattern mayindicate more gradual within-game learning in hockey,perhaps are a result of the large diversity of on-ice playercombinations caused by teams rotating their four \"lines\"of players every few minutes.Middle phase: constant tempo.O n c e p l a y e r s h a v emoved away from their initial locations and/or warmedup, gameplay proceeds fluidly, with scoring events oc-curring without any systematic dependence on the gameclock. This produces a flat, stable or stationary patternin the probability of scoring events. A slight but steadyincrease in tempo over the course of this phase is con-sistent with learning, perhaps as continued play shedsmore light on the opposing team's capabilities and weak-nesses, causing a progressive increase in scoring rate asthat knowledge is accumulated and put into practice.A stable scoring rate pattern appears in every periodin NFL, CFB and NBA games, with slight increases ob-served in periods 1 and 2 in football, and in periods 2-4 in7 basketball. NHL games exhibit stable scoring rates in the second half of period 2 and throughout period 3. Within a given game, but across scoring periods, scoring rates are remarkably similar, suggesting little or no variation in overall strategies across the periods of gameplay. End phase: sharply increased tempo . The end of a scor- ing period often requires players to reset their positions, and any eort spent establishing an advantageous player conguration is lost unless that play produces a scoring event. This impending loss-of-position will tend to en- courage more risky actions, which serve to dramatically increase the scoring rate just before the period ends. The increase in scoring rate should be largest in the nal pe- riod, when no additional scoring opportunities lay in the future. In some sports, teams may eectively slow the rate by which time progresses through game clock man- agement (e.g., using timeouts) or through continuing play (at the end of quarters in football). This eectively com- presses more actions than normal into a short period of time, which may also increase the rate, without necessar- ily adding more risk. We nd evidence mainly for the loss-of-position mech- anism, but the rules of these games suggest that clock management likely also plays a role. Relative to the mean tempo, we nd a sharply increased rate at the end of each sport's games, in agreement with a strong incentive to score before a period ends. (This increase indicates that a \"lolly-gag strategy,\" in which a leading team in possession intentionally runs down the clock to prevent the trailing team from gaining possession, is a relatively rare occurrence.) Intermediate periods in NFL, CFB and NBA games also exhibit increased scoring rates in their nal seconds. In football, this increase is greatest at the end of period 2, rather than period 4. The increased rate at the ends of periods 1 and 3 in football is also inter- esting, as here the period's end does not reset the player conguration on the eld, but rather teams switch goals. This likely creates a mild incentive to initiate some play before the period ends (which is allowed to nish, even if the game clock runs out). NHL games exhibit no dis- cernible end-phase pattern in their intermediate periods (1 and 2), but show an enormous end-game eect, with the scoring rate growing to more than three times its game mean. This strong pattern may be related to the strategy in hockey of the losing team \"pulling the goalie,\" in which the goalie leaves their defensive position in order to increase the chances of scoring. Regardless of the par- ticular mechanism, the end-phase pattern is ubiquitous. In general, we nd a common set of modest non- Poissonian deviations in game tempo across all four sports, although the vast majority of tempo dynamics continue to agree with a simple Poisson model. IV. GAME BALANCE A game's \"balance\" is the relative distribution of scor- ing events (not points) among the teams. Perfectly bal-anced games, however, do not always result in a tie. In our model of competition, each scoring event is awarded to one team or the other by a Bernoulli process, and in the case of perfect balance, the probability is equal, at c=1/2. The expected fraction of scoring events won by a team is also c=1/2, and its distribution depends on the number of scoring events in the game. We estimate this null distribution by simulating perfectly balanced games for each sport, given the empirical distribution of scoring events per game (see Fig. 1). Comparing the sim- ulated distribution against the empirical distribution of c provides a measure of the true imbalance among teams, while controlling for the stochastic eects of events within games. Across all four sports, we nd signicant deviations in this fraction relative to perfect balance. NFL and CFB games exhibited more variance than expected, while NHL and NBA games exhibited the least. Within a game, scoring balance exhibits unexpected patterns. In par- ticular NBA games exhibit an unusual \"restoring force\" pattern, in which the probability of winning the next scoring event decreases with the size of a team's lead (a pattern rst observed by [5]). In contrast, NFL, CFB and NHL games exhibit the opposite eect, in which the probability of winning the next scoring event appears to increase with the size of the lead\u2014a pattern consistent with a heterogeneous distribution of team skill. A. Quantifying balance The fraction of all events in the game that were won by a randomly selected team provides a simple measure of the overall balance of a particular game in a sport. Let randbindex the two teams and let Er(Eb) denote the total number of events won by team rin its game with b. The maximum likelihood estimator for a game's bias is simply the fraction c=Er/(Er+Eb) of all scoring events in the game won by r. Tabulating the empirical distributions of cwithin each sport, we nd that the most common outcome, in all sports, is c=1/2, in agreement with the Bernoulli model. However, the distributions around this value deviate sub- stantially from the form expected for perfect balance (Figure 4), but not always in the same direction. In CFB and NFL, the distributions of scoring balances are similar, but the shape for CFB is broader than for NFL, suggesting that CFB competitions are less balanced than NFL competitions. This is likely a result of the broader range of skill dierences among teams at the col- lege level, as compared to the professionals. Like CFB and NFL, NHL games also exhibit substantially more blowouts and fewer ties than expected, which is con- sistent with a heterogeneous distribution of team skills. Surprisingly, however, NBA games exhibit less variance in the nal relative lead size than we expect for perfectly balanced games, a pattern we will revisit in the following section.8 FIG. 4. Smoothed distributions for the empirical fraction cof events won by a team, for each sport, and the predicted fractionfor a perfectly balanced scoring, when given the empirical distribution of events per game (Fig. 1). Modes at 1 and 0 indicatea non-trivial probability of one team winning or losing every event, which is more common when only a few events occur.B. Scoring while in the leadAlthough many non-Bernoulli processes may occurwithin professional team sports, here we examine onlyone: whether the size of a leadL, the dierence in teamscores or point totals, provides information about theprobability of a team winning the next event. [5] previ-ously considered this question for scoring events and leadsizes within NBA games, but not other sports. Across allfour of our sports, we tabulated the fraction of times theleading team won the next scoring event, given it held alead of sizeL. This function is symmetric aboutL= 0,where it passes through probabilityp=1/2w h e r et h eidentity of the leading team may change.Examining the empirical scoring functions (Figure 5),we nd that the probability of scoring next varies system-atically with lead sizeL. In particular, for CFB, NFL andNHL games, the probability appears to increase with leadsize, while it decreases in NBA games. The eect of thenegative relationship in NBA games is a kind of \"restor-ing force,\" such that leads of any size tend to shrinkback toward a tied score. This produces a narrower dis-tribution of nal lead sizes than we would expect underBernoulli-style competition, precisely as shown in Fig-ure 4 for NBA games.Although the positive function for CFB, NFL and NHLgames may supercially support a kind of \"hot hands\"or cumulative advantage-type mechanism, in which leadsize tends to grow superlinearly over time, we do notbelieve this explains the observed pattern. A more plau-sible mechanism is a simple heterogeneous skill model, inwhich each team has a latent skill valuer, and the prob-ability that teamrwins a scoring event againstbis de-termined by a Bernoulli process withc=r/(r+b).(This model is identical to the popular Bradley-Terrymodel of win-loss records of teams [23], except here weapply it to each scoring event within a game.)For a broad class of team-skill distributions, this modelproduces a scoring function with the same sigmoidalshape seen here, and the linear pattern atL=0i st h eresult of averaging over the distribution of biasescin-duced by the team skill distribution. The function flat-tens out at large|L|assuming the value representing thelargest skill dierence possible among the league teams.9 FIG. 5. The probability of scoring as a function of a team's lead size for each sport, football, hockey, and basketball and a linearleast-squares t (p0.1), indicating positive or negative correlations between scoring and a competition's score dierence.This explanation is supported by the stronger correla-tion in CFB games (+0.005 probability per point in thelead) versus NFL games (+0.002 probability per point),as CFB teams are known to exhibit much broader skilldierences than NFL teams, in agreement with our re-sults above in Figure 4.NBA games, however, present a puzzle, because nodistribution of skill dierences can produce a negativecorrelation under this latent-skill model. [5] suggestedthis negative pattern could be produced by possessionof the ball changing after each scoring event, or by theleading team \"coasting\" and thereby playing below theirtrue skill level. However, the change-of-possession rulealso exists in CFB and NFL games (play resumes with afaceo in NHL games), but only NBA games exhibit thenegative correlation. Coasting could occur for psycho-logical reasons, in which losing teams play harder, andleading teams less hard, as suggested by [15]. Again, how-ever, the absence of this pattern in other sports suggestthat the mechanism is not psychological.A plausible alternative explanation is that NBA teamsemploy various strategies that serve to change the ra-tioc=r/(r+b) as a function of lead size. Forinstance, when a team is in the lead, they often substi-tute out their stronger and more oensive players, e.g.,to allow them to rest or avoid injury, or to manage floorspacing or skill combinations. When a team is down byan amount that likely varies across teams, these playersare put back on the court. If both teams pursue suchstrategies, then eective ratiocwill vary inversely withlead size such that the leading team becomes eectivelyweaker compared to the non-leading team. In contrast toNBA teams, teams in CFB, NFL and NHL seem less ableto pursue such a strategy. In football, substitutions arerelatively uncommon, implying thatrshould not varymuch over the course of a game. In hockey, each teamrotates through most of its players every few minutes,which limits the ability for high- or low-skilled players toeectively changerover the course of a game.V. MODELING LEAD-SIZE DYNAMICSThe previous insights identify several basic patternsin scoring tempo and balance across sports. However, westill lack a clear understanding of the degree to which any10 FIG. 6. Comparison of empirical lead-size variation as a function of clock time with those produced by Bernoulli (B) or Markov(M) tempo or balance models, for each sport.of these patterns is necessary to produce realistic scoringdynamics. Here, we investigate this question by combin-ing the identied patterns within a generative model ofscoring over time, and test which combinations producerealistic dynamics in lead sizes. In particular, we con-sider two models of tempo and two models of balance.For each of the four pairs of tempo and balance mod-els for each sport, we generate via Monte Carlo a largenumber of games and measure the resulting variation inlead size as a function of the game clock, which we thencompare to the empirical pattern.[24]Our two scoring tempo models are as follows. In therst (Bernoulli) model, each second of time produces anevent with the empirical probability observed for thatsecond across all games (shown in Figure 3). In the sec-ond (Markov), we draw an inter-arrival time from theempirical distribution of such gaps (shown in Figure 2),advance the game clock that that amount, and generatea scoring event at that clock time.Our two balance models are as follows. In the rst(Bernoulli) model, for each match we draw a uniformlyrandom valuecfrom the empirical distribution of scoringbalances (shown in Figure 4) and for each scoring event,the points are won by teamrwith that probability andby teambotherwise. In the second (Markov), a scoringevent is awarded to the leading team with the empiricallyestimated probability for the current lead sizeL(shownin Figure 5). Once a scoring event is generated and as-signed, that team's score is incremented by a point valuedrawn iid from the empirical distribution of point valuesper scoring event for the sport (see Appendix B).The four combinations of tempo and balance modelsthus cover our empirical ndings for patterns in the scor-ing dynamics of these sports. The simpler models (calledBernoulli) represent dynamics with little or no memory,in which each event is an iid random variable, albeitdrawn from a data-driven distribution. The more com-plicated models (called Markov) represent dynamics withsome degree of memory, allowing past events to influencethe ongoing gameplay dynamics.Generating 100,000 competitions under each combina-tion of models for each sport, we nd a consistent pat-tern across sports (Figure 6): the Markov model of gametempo provides little improvement over the Bernoullimodel in capturing the empirical pattern of lead-size vari-ation, while the Markov model for balance provides a sig-11 nicant improvement over the Bernoulli model. In par- ticular, the Markov model generates gameplay dynamics in very good agreement with the empirical patterns. That being said, some small deviations remain. For instance, the Markov model slightly overestimates the lead-size variation in the rst half, and slightly under- estimates it in the second half of CFB games. In NFL games, it provides a slight overestimate in rst half, but then converges on the empirical pattern in the second half. NHL games exhibit the largest and most systematic deviation, with the Markov model producing more vari- ation than observed, particularly in the game's second half. However, it should be noted that the low-scoring nature of NHL means that what appears to be a visually large overestimate here (Fig. 6) is small when compared to the deviations seen in the other sports. NBA games exhibit a similar pattern to CFB games, but the crossover point occurs at the end of period 3, rather than at period 2. These modest deviations suggest the presence of still other non-ideal processes governing the scoring dynam- ics, particularly in NHL games. We emphasize that the Markov model's accuracy for CFB, NFL and NHL games does not imply that individ- ual matches follow this pattern of favoring the leader. Instead, the pattern provides a compact and e\u0000cient summary of scoring dynamics conditioned on unobserved characteristics like team skill. Our model generates com- petition between two featureless teams, and the Markov model provides a data-driven mechanism by which some pairs of teams may behave as if they have small or large dierences in latent skill. It remains an interesting direc- tion for future work to investigate precisely how player and team characteristics determine team skill, and how team skill impacts scoring dynamics. VI. PREDICTING OUTCOMES FROM GAMEPLAY The accuracy of our generative model in the previous section suggest that it may also produce accurate predic- tions of the game's overall outcome, after observing only the events in the rst tseconds of the game. In this sec- tion, we study the predictability of game outcome using the Markov model for scoring balance, and compare its accuracy to the simple heuristic of guessing the winner to be the team currently in the lead at time t.T h u s , we convert our Markov model into an explicit Markov chain on the lead size L, which allows us to simulate the remaining T\u0000tseconds conditioned on the lead size at time t. For concreteness, we dene the lead size Lrela- tive to team r, such that L< 0 implies that bis in the lead. The Markov chain's state space is the set of all pos- sible lead sizes (score dierences between teams rand b), and its transition matrix Pgives the probability that a scoring event changes a lead of size Lto one of size L0.I f rwins the event, then L0=L+k,w h e r e kisthe event's point value, while if bwins the event, then L0=L\u0000k. Assuming the value and winner of the event are independent, the transition probabilities are given by PL,L+k=P r ( rscores \u0000Pr(rscores |L)) Pr(point value = k), where, for the particular sport, we use the empirical prob- ability function for scoring as a function of lead size (Fig- ure 5), from r's perspective, and the empirical distribu- tion (Appendix B) for the point value. The probability that team ris the predicted winner depends on the probability distribution over lead sizes at time T. Because scoring events are conditionally inde- pendent, this distribution is given by Pn,w h e r e nis the expected number of scoring events in the remaining clock time T\u0000t, multiplied by a vector S0representing the ini- tial state L= 0. Given a choice of time t, we estimate n=PT w=tPr(event |w), which is the expected number of events given the empirical tempo function (Fig. 3, also the Bernoulli tempo model in Section V) and the remain- ing clock time. We then convert this distribution, which we calculate numerically, into a prediction by summing probabilities for each of three outcomes: rwins (states L>0),rtiesb, (state L= 0), and bwins (states L>0). In this way, we capture the information contained in mag- nitude of the current lead, which is lost when we simply predict that the current leader will win, regardless of lead size. We test the accuracy of the Markov chain using an out-of-sample prediction scheme, in which we divide each sports' game data into a training set of a randomly se- lected 3/4 of all games and a test set of the remaining 1/4. From each training set, we estimate the empirical func- tions used in the model and compute the Markov chain's transition matrix. Then, across the games in each test set, we measure the fraction of times the Markov chain's prediction is correct. This fraction is equivalent to the popular AUC statistic [25], where AUC = 0 .5 denotes an accuracy no better than guessing. Instead of evaluating the model at some arbitrarily se- lected time, we investigate how outcome predictability evolves over time. Specically, we compute the AUC as a function of the cumulative number of scoring events in the game, using the empirically observed times and lead sizes in each test-set game to parameterize the model's predictions. When the number of cumulative events is small, game outcomes should be relatively unpredictable, and as the clock runs down, predictability should in- crease. To provide a reference point for the quality of these results, we also measure the AUC over time for a simple heuristic of predicting the winner as the team in the lead after the event. Across all sports, we nd that game outcome is highly predictable, even after only a small number of scoring events (Figure 7). For instance, the winner of CFB and NFL games can be accurately chosen more than 60% of the time after only a single scoring event, and this rate increases to more than 80% by three events. NHL games12 FIG. 7. AUC's of the Markov chain and leader wins predictions of game winner for each sport, football, hockey, and basketball.are even more predictable, in part because they are verylow-scoring games, and the winner may be accuratelychosen roughly 80% of the time after the rst event. Thefast rise of the AUC curve as a function of continuedscoring in these sports likely reflects the role played bydierences in latent team skill in producing large leads,which make outcomes more predictable (Figure 5). Incontrast, NBA games are the least predictable, requir-ing more than 40 events before the AUC exceeds 80%.This likely reflects the role of the \"restoring force\" (Fig-ure 5), which tends to make NBA games more unpre-dictable than we would expect from a simple model ofscoring, and signicantly more unpredictable than CFB,NFL or NHL games.In all cases, the Markov chain substantially outper-forms the \"leader wins\" heuristic, even in the low-scoringNHL games. This occurs in part because small leads areless informative than large leads for guessing the winner,and the heuristic does not distinguish between these.VII. DISCUSSIONAlthough there is increasing interest in quantitativeanalysis and modeling in sports [26-30], many ques-tions remain about what patterns or principles, if any,cut across dierent sports, what basic dynamical pro-cesses provide good models of within-game events, andthe degree to which the outcomes of games may be pre-dicted from within-game events alone. The comprehen-sive database of scoring events we use here to investi-gate such questions is unusual for both its scope (everyleague game over 9-10 seasons), its breadth (coveringfour sports), and its depth (timing and attribution infor-mation on every point in every game). As such, it oersa number of new opportunities to study competition ingeneral, and sports in particular.Across college (American) football (CFB), professional(American) football (NFL), professional hockey (NHL)and professional basketball (NBA) games, we nd a num-ber of common patterns in both the tempo and balanceof scoring events. First, the timing of events in all foursports is remarkably well-modeled by a simple Poissonprocess (Figures 1 and 2), in which each second of game-play produces a scoring event independently, with a prob-13 ability that varies only modestly over the course of a game (Figure 3). These variations, however, follow a common three-phase pattern, in which a relatively con- stant rate is depressed at the beginning of a scoring pe- riod, and increases dramatically in the nal few seconds of the period. The excellent agreement with a Poisson process implies that teams employ very few strategically- chosen chains of events or time-sensitive strategies in these games, except in a period's end-phase, when the incentive to score in elevated. These results provide fur- ther support to past analyses [5, 13] showing no evidence for the popular notion of \"hot hands,\" in which scoring once increases the chance of scoring again soon. Second, we nd a common pattern of imbalanced scor- ing between teams in CFB, NFL and NHL games, relative to an ideal model in which teams are equally likely to win each scoring event (Figure 4). CFB games are much less balanced than NFL games, suggesting that the transition from college to professional tends to reduce the team skill dierences that generate lopsided scoring. Furthermore, we nd that all three of these sports exhibit a pattern in which lead sizes tend to increase over time. That is, the probability of scoring while in the lead tends to be larger the greater the lead size (Figure 5), in contrast to the ideal model in which lead sizes increase or decrease with equal probability. As with overall scoring balance, the size of this eect in CFB games is much larger (about 2.5 times larger) than in NFL games, and is consistent with a reduction in the variance of the distribution of skill across teams. That is, NFL teams are generally closer in team skill than CFB teams, and this produces gameplay that is much less predictable. Both of these patterns are consistent with a kind of Bradley-Terry-type model in which each scoring event is a contest between the teams. NBA games, however, present the opposite pattern: team scores are much closer than we would expect from the ideal model, and the probability of scoring while in the lead eectively decreases as the lead size grows (Fig- ure 5; a pattern originally identied by [5]). This pattern produces a kind of \"restoring force\" such that leads tend to shrink until they turn into ties, producing games that are substantially more unpredictable. Unlike the pattern in CFB, NFL and NHL, no distribution of latent team skills, under a Bradley-Terry-type model, can produce this kind of negative correlation between the probability of scoring and lead size. Recently, [15] analyzed similar NBA game data and argued that increased psychological motivation drives teams that are slightly behind (e.g., by one point at half- time) to win the game more often than not. That is, losing slightly is good for winning. Our analysis places this claim in a broader, more nuanced context. The ef- fective restoring force is supercially consistent with the belief that losing in NBA games is \"good\" for the team, as losing does indeed empirically increase the probability of scoring. However, we nd no such eect in CFB, NFL or NHL games (Figure 5), suggesting either that NBA players are more poorly motivated than players in otherteam sports or that some other mechanism explains the pattern. One such mechanism is for NBA teams to employ strategies associated with substituting weaker players for stronger ones when they hold various leads, e.g., to allow their best players to rest or avoid injury, manage floor spacing and oensive/defensive combinations, etc., and then reverse the process when the other team leads. In this way, a team will play more weakly when it leads, and more strongly when it is losing, because of personnel changes alone rather than changes in morale or eort. If teams have dierent thresholds for making such substitu- tions, and dierently skilled best players, the averaging across these dierences would produce the smooth pat- tern observed in the data. Such substitutions are indeed common in basketball games, while football and hockey teams are inherently less able to alter their eective team skill through such player management, which may ex- plain the restoring force's presence in NBA games and its absence in CFB, NFL or NHL games. It would be in- teresting to determine whether college basketball games exhibit the same restoring force, and the personnel man- agement hypothesis could be tested by estimating the on-court team's skill as a function of lead size. The observed patterns we nd in the probability of scoring while in the lead are surprisingly accurate at re- producing the observed variation in lead-size dynamics in these sports (Figure 6), and suggest that this one pat- tern provides a compact and mostly accurate summary of the within-game scoring dynamics of a sport. How- ever, we do not believe these patterns indicate the pres- ence of any feedbacks, e.g., \"momentum\" or cumulative advantage [31]. Instead, for CFB, NFL and NHL games, this pattern represents the the distribution of latent team skills, while for NBA games, it represents strategic deci- sions about which players are on the court as a function of lead size. This pattern also makes remarkably good predictions about the overall outcome of games, even when given information about only the rst `scoring events. Under a controlled out-of-sample test, we found that CFB, NFL and NHL games are highly predictable, even after only a few events. In contrast, NBA games were signicantly less predictable, although reasonable predictions here can still be made, despite the impact of the restoring force. Given the popularity of betting on sports, it is an in- teresting question as to whether our model produces bet- ter or worse predictions than those of established odds- makers. To explore this question, we compared our model against two such systems, the online live-betting web- site Bovada[32] and the odds-maker website Sports Book Review (SBR).[33] Neither site provided comprehensive coverage or systematic access, and so our comparison was necessarily limited to a small sample of games. Among these, however, our predictions were very close to those of Bovada, and, after 20% of each game's events had occurred, were roughly 10% more accurate than SBR's money lines across all sports. Although the precise de-14 tails are unknown for how these commercial odds were set, it seems likely that they rely on many details omit- ted by our model, such as player statistics, team histo- ries, team strategies and strengths, etc. In contrast, our model uses only information relating to the basic scor- ing dynamics within a sport, and knows nothing about individual teams or game strategies. In that light, its accuracy is impressive. These results suggest several interesting directions for future work. For instance, further elucidating the connec- tion between team skill and the observed scoring patterns would provide an important connection between within- game dynamics and team-specic characteristics. These, in turn, could be estimated from player-level characteris- tics to provide a coherent understanding of how individ- uals cooperate to produce a team and how teams com- pete to produce dynamics. Another missing piece of the dynamics puzzle is the role played by the environment and the control of space for creating scoring opportu- nities. Recent work on online games with heterogeneous environments suggests that these spatial factors can have large impact on scoring tempo and balance [17], but time series data on player positions on the eld would fur- ther improve our understanding. Finally, our data omit many aspects of gameplay, including referee calls, time- outs, fouls, etc., which may provide for interesting strate- gic choices by teams, e.g., near the end of the game, as with clock management in football games. Progress on these and other questions would shed more light on thefundamental question of how much of gameplay may be attributed to skill versus luck. Finally, our results demonstrate that common patterns and processes do indeed cut across seemingly distinct sports, and these patterns provide remarkably accurate descriptions of the events within these games and predic- tions of their outcomes. However, many questions remain unanswered, particularly as to what specic mechanisms generate the modest deviations from the basic patterns that we observe in each sport, and how exactly teams ex- erting such great eorts against each other can conspire to produce gameplay so reminiscent of simple stochastic processes. We look forward to future work that further investigates these questions, which we hope will continue to leverage the powerful tools and models of dynamical systems, statistical physics, and machine learning with increasingly detailed data on competition.

Appendix A: Game mechanics Here we provide brief summaries of the game mechan- ics for each of the sports represented in our data set. Professional and college football Both professional and college football games last 60 min- utes, divided into four equal length \"quarters.\" Each of the two teams eld 11 players, the identities of which are usually changed depending on whether a team has pos- session of the ball (oense) or not (defense). The eld is a flat grass or turf surface 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. On either end of the eld are two \"end zones,\" measuring 30 feet in length, one for each team. The oense is given a series of four attempts (\"downs\") to move the football 10 yards downeld from the last valid ball position, each of which must occur within 40 seconds of the last attempt's end. Failure to move the ball the required distance results in the other team gaining possession. Points are scored by the team in possession when it moves the ball into the defensive team's \"end zone,\" (a touchdown, 6 points) or passes the ball through the defensive team's eld goal (a eld goal, 3 points). Scoring a touchdown provides the scoring team the opportunity for additional points, either through what would normally be a touchdown (2 points) or a eld goal (1 point). Each team has three timeouts to use during gameplay, which are often used strategically near the end of the game. When time runs out, the team with the most points is declared the winner. For a complete description of professional and college level rules, see [34] and [35] respectively. Professional hockey A professional hockey game lasts 60 minutes, divided into three equal length \"periods.\" A game is played between two teams, each composed of six players (ve skaters and one goalkeeper), whose identities change periodically throughout the game. Teams compete on an ice rink, 200 feet long and 85 feet wide. On either end of the rink are two nets, 6 feet wide and 4 feet high, one for each team.Players on the team controlling the puck work to- gether to move it into the opposing team's net through a combination of strategic passes and shots. If the team is successful, a goal is scored and the team is awarded 1 point. The game plays continuously except after stoppages, which occur at minutes 6, 10, and 14, penalties, or goals. Each team has a single 30 second timeout that can be used at any point in the game. Teams use their timeouts to substitute players, adjust strategy and to provide the team with brief moments of rest during crucial periods of play. When time runs out, the team with the most points is deemed the winner. For a complete description of rules, see [36]. Professional basketball A professional basketball game lasts 48 minutes, divided into four equal length \"quarters.\" Each of the two teams eld ve players, whose identities change throughout the game. The court is a flat wooden surface, 94 feet long and 50 feet wide. On either side of the court are two circular rims, known as baskets, measuring 18 inches in diameter, positioned 10 feet above the court surface, one for each team. A team in possession of the basketball has a total of 24 seconds to make a shot that it either hits the opposing team's rim or goes through it. If time expires before the team attempts a shot, the opposing team gains posses- sion of the basketball. Depending on game state and a player's court location, a successful shot (one that goes through the opposing team's rim) can be worth 1, 2, or 3 points. After scoring, the scoring team relinquishes pos- session of the basketball to the opposing team. Game play continues according to this procedure, except when the ball goes out of bounds or a foul is committed. Each team is awarded a single 20 second timeout per game half. Each team is also entitled to 6 more timeouts that may be used at anytime throughout the game, with the following restrictions: no more than 3 timeouts may be used dur- ing the nal quarter and no more than 2 timeouts may be used within the nal 2 minutes of play. These timeouts are used strategically to substitute players, control the speed of play, and facilitate the coordination and plan- ning of complex plays. When time expires, the team that has accumulated the most points is deemed the winner. For a full description of game rules, see [37]. Appendix B: Points per scoring event Table III shows the distribution of points per scoring event, for each sport. Events in the NHL only generate a single point. Although events in the NBA generate 1, 2 or 3 points, the large majority of events (74%) are worth 2 points, with the remaining events divided between 1- and 3-point shots. Similarly, scoring events in both CFB and NFL games generally produce 7 points (touchdown with extra point). Games in CFB games from those in NFL in producing16 many more eld goals (3 points) and many fewer touch- downs with no extra point (6 points), which are the next most common events in both. The remaining point val- ues are relatively uncommon: 8 points for touchdowns plus a 2 point conversion play, and 2 points for a safety, which occurs in three scenarios: (i) when a ball carrier is tackled in his team's own end zone; (ii) when the ball is deemed dead by referees in the end zone, or (iii) when the oensive team commits a foul play in its own end zone. Two point conversions occur when the scoring team elects to successfully pass or run the ball into the end zone in- stead of kicking the ball through the eld goal after a touchdown. Figure 8 shows the fraction of total points in each game that are won by a team, which agrees very closely with the fraction of total scoring events, from Figure 4. This agreement indicates that only very rarely does the value of the points associated with events ultimately determine the outcome of a game. Instead, the chief determinant is simply number of events. In NHL games, this must be true as every event is worth the same number of points.A slightly deviation around 1 /2 for NFL games, but not CFB games, indicates that very occasionally point values do matter. point value NFL CFB NHL NBA 1 -- 1.0000 0.0941 0.1647 4 --- 0 . 0 0 2 9 5 --- 0 . 0 0 0 9 6 0.0308 0.0708 - 0.0001 7 0.6222 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 TABLE III.

Smoothed distributions for the empirical fraction of total points won by a team (solid line), for each sport, plus theempirical fraction of total scoring events (dashed line; from Figure 4). The very close agreement indicates that only very rarelydoes the point-value of scoring events\u2014instead of simply their number\u2014determine the outcome of a game.18 Question Answer Does scoring in games of dierent team sports follow common patterns?Yes. The pattern of when points are scored and who gets them are remarkably similar across sports. What is the common pattern? Events occur randomly (a Poisson process). Which team wins the points is coin flip (a Bernoulli process) that depends on the relative skill dierence of the teams on the eld. What might cause this pattern? A strong focus on short-term maximization of scoring opportunities, while blocking the other team from the same. There is no evidence of strategic planning across plays, as in games like chess or Go. Teams largely react to events as they occur. What determines how often scoring occurs? Each sport has a characteristic rate (see Ta- ble II), which increases dramatically at the end of scoring periods. What determines who wins an event? Skill and luck, in that order. Do events early in a game influence events later in a game?No. Each scoring event or \"play\" is eectively independent, once we control for relative team skill (and lead size in basketball). Gameplay is eectively \"memoryless.\" Can a team be \"hot,\" where they score in streaks?No. Just like players [13], teams do not get \"hot.\" Scoring streaks are caused by getting lucky. When is it easier or harder to score? Every moment is equally easy or di\u0000cult. But, teams try harder at the end of a period. Which sport is the most unpredictable? Pro basketball, where lead sizes (spreads) tend to shrink back to zero. This tendency generates many \"ties\" as a game unfolds. Do other sports exhibit this pattern? No. Pro basketball is the only sport where the spread tends to shrink. In football and hockey, the spread tends to grow over time. Does being behind help you win, as argued by [15]?No. Being behind helps you lose. Being ahead and being lucky helps you win. TABLE IV. A summary of our results, in question-and-answer format. "}
