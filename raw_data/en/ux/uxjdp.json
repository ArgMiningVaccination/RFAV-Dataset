They contain only natural sources of caffeine and natural ingredients, and usually no artificial preservatives or fillers. Today's fast pace of life and busy schedules often lead to a lack of energy. That's why we often turn to energy drinks. Although energy drinks have a bad reputation, we can turn to natural alternatives which, in addition to all the other benefits, are also better for our health. Table of content: [More energy with natural ingredients](#naturalingredients) [Natural energy drink with collagen - more than just an ''energy'' drink](#naturalenergydrink) Lack of energy Lack of energy and prolonged physical exhaustion can be consequences of spring fatigue, but often the causes are hidden elsewhere. There are many and varied reasons for low energy levels: - Not enough sleep, - a lot of stress, - dehydration, - poor nutrition and various nutrient deficiencies, - lack of physical activity, - too much caffeine, etc. It is important to find the cause and try to eliminate it. The most important thing is to ensure that we get enough sleep and have a constant routine. Scientists recommend getting at least 8 hours of sleep every night. If we don't get enough sleep, it can manifest itself as constant fatigue, with no end in sight. Even if we sleep more during the weekend, our energy levels do not improve. It is important to get about the same amount of sleep each day, preferably an hour or two more. It is also very important to try to avoid stressful situations in our daily lives. If we do have to face them, we should try to deal with them as calmly as possible and without panicking. A proper diet and sufficient fluid intake are also important. Try to eat as varied and nutritious a diet as possible, and drink enough fluids If there is a lack of water in the body, dehydration can lead to fatigue and a feeling of malaise, which can impair concentration. Physical activity and exercise are also important factors in energy deficiency. It is recommended to exercise at least three times a week, preferably outside in the fresh air. Even though we follow all the above tips, sometimes we just need a little extra energy. This is often when we reach for energy drinks. Although energy drinks have a bad reputation, we can look for natural alternatives which, besides all the other benefits, are also better for our health. What are energy drinks? Energy drinks are refreshing soft drinks that are most commonly laced with caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and other substances that affect our central system. They also contain high amounts of sugar and often have artificial ingredients such as flavor enhancers and colors added. Natural energy drinks are a great alternative to artificial energy drinks. Energy drinks are supposed to increase mental alertness and clarity as well as physical energy. Some are sold to help you stay up all night, although skipping sleep is never a good idea and can have some harmful side effects. But it's not just these claims that make people question the safety of energy drinks... Commonly described side effects of artificial energy drinks include headaches, heart palpitations, insomnia, irritability, stomach upset, and more - mainly due to excessive amounts of synthetic caffeine. A natural alternative? Natural energy drinks are increasingly popular and for good reason. They contain only natural sources of caffeine and natural ingredients, and usually no artificial preservatives or fillers. Natural energy drinks have many benefits: - Rich in vitamins and minerals - Contain fewer calories and sugar - Contains no artificial preservatives or fillers - Contains naturally occurring caffeine - Provide a more sustained source of energy, clarity of thought, and longer focus throughout the day More energy with natural ingredients Natural energy drinks contain natural plant-based ingredients such as: - Mate tea or Yerba mate Mate tea is a traditional South American drink that is increasingly popular all over the world. It is an herbal tea made from the leaves and twigs of the llex paraguariensis plant. - Studies show that it is said to contain several beneficial plant substances, such as: - Phytochemicals (polyphenols) - Xanthines (caffeine) - Flavonoids - Vitamins and minerals (iron, manganese, zinc, potassium, etc.) Some studies say that mate tea is said to contain even more antioxidants than green tea. In addition, it can contain seven to nine essential amino acids and almost all the vitamins and minerals the body needs. Due to its natural caffeine content, mate tea can help boost energy levels and mental alertness. Compared to coffee, mate tea has a longer lasting and milder action, so it will not cause a rapid rise and then drop in energy as a coffee can. - Kombucha Kombucha is a fermented tea drink rich in probiotics, vitamins C and B, and live enzymes. Kombucha was first brewed in China 2000 years ago, where it is still considered one of the most important remedies for stomach upset. It acts as a probiotic and actively restores the natural microflora in the stomach. Natural energy drink with collagen - more than just an ''energy'' drink [Collagen drink Energy ](/en/food-supplements/collagen-drink-energy.html)is a natural energy drink made with mate tea infused with kombucha, collagen, and vitamin B12. Kombucha acts as a probiotic and actively restores the natural microflora in the stomach. Mate tea is full of antioxidants and gives the drink a natural source of caffeine. Kombucha is also supplemented with vitamin B12, which is one of the most essential vitamins in our bodies. It is present in every cell of our body, where it has many functions as a constituent factor in DNA synthesis and as a vital element in the generation of energy. Why did we decide to add collagen to kombucha? Collagen is the most abundant protein in our body, accounting for between 25 and 30% of all proteins in the body. That's as much as a third of the body's composition. It is found in cartilage, skin, teeth, nails, muscle tendons, the walls of the body's organs, and hair. Collagen plays a very important role in the body, helping organs to develop, wounds and tissues to heal, and corneas, gums, and scalp to repair. [Collagen ](/en/food-supplements/collagen-shot-tropical.html)can be said to act as the \"glue\" that holds our bodies together, as it is responsible for the stability and strength of the body's tissues. However, after about the age of 20, the body's production of collagen starts to decline. According to data, the body is expected to produce 1.5% less collagen each year after the age of 20. The body loses certain nutrients in the natural aging process, but regular intake of collagen and other active ingredients helps to ensure more elastic skin, shiny, strong hair and faster hair growth, stronger nails, stronger joints, balanced digestion, and "}
