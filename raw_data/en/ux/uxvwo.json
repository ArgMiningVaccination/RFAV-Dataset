The Noosa Pest Management Difference We combine our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) service methods with our common-sense approach to the application of botanical solutions, which separates us from the green pretenders! Our botanical pest control services are truly customized pest management solutions to meet your specific needs and expectations. During our initial service and inspection, we will exhaust all available non-chemical avenues to reduce the pest pressure in your home. For instance, we may recommend the addition of a door sweep, caulking cracks and crevices, utilizing expanding foam around conduit that enters the foundation of your home, cleaning gutters, and trimming branches that are in contact with your roof. Measures such as these help exclude pests, an important part of the IPM approach. After identifying the pests and offering recommendations, we apply an effective, naturally occurring insecticide to the areas of concern. Noosa's botanical pest control and botanical pest control services use a number of oil extracts and treatment techniques to assure you that eco-friendly pest control is not just a buzzword, but a safe solution to your pest challenges. Why we provide natural pest control. The reason Noosa Pest Management focuses on low-impact pest control is that it's the best pest control method for our natural environment. Low-impact doesn't mean ineffectiveness, however! Because we take a multi-faceted approach, we don't rely only on the products we use. We first take time to inspect your property to find out how pests got into your home and suggest changes you can make to keep them out in the future. Then we apply botanical insecticides to address the existing pest problems you have. In addition to having less impact on the environment, our green pest control treatments are better for all of the beneficial insects on your property. There are many types of insects that shouldn't be considered as \"pests\" and that actually make a contribution to your garden or landscape by controlling the pests you don't want. For example, there are insects that prey on flies, gnats, slugs, aphids, and more. By providing habitat for the good bugs, you're supporting truly natural, organic pest control that works hand in hand with our botanical pest control. Thinking about green pest control but want to know more? We'd love to tell you all about our proactive approach to decreasing the impact of our pest management services on the environment and why we're an environmentally conscious pest management firm.

Natural Pest Control FAQs The majority of pest control products on the market come from synthetic chemicals that can be highly toxic. Although they're certainly effective, they're often too effective by making no distinctions between what's good and bad. This means these chemicals can be harmful to wildlife, pets, and even people. Our green pest control differs from synthetic chemical pest control in several important ways, including: - The botanical pest control products we use are derived from the naturally occurring chemicals in plants that the plants themselves use to defend themselves from insects and pathogens. - Botanical products are quickly degraded by air, sunlight, and moisture, which means they're generally less harmful to the environment since they don't allow residues to accumulate in the soil and the water supply. Because botanicals don't have long-term residual effects, we provide our botanical pest control service every two months to maintain effective protection for your home. - Most botanical products aren't toxic to plants. Botanical pest control may be earth-friendly, but it's not friendly to pests such as cockroaches, bed bugs, and many other common household pests. If you're plagued by these pests, remember\u2014we reach for the safest products and methods first to solve your problem. Want to know more? Read our post, \" [What is Botanical Pest Control?](https://noosapest.com/blog/what-is-botanical-pest-control/)\" Natural pest control and conventional [pest control solutions](/) are both viable options you can choose to keep pests at bay. However, there are a few differences between the two methods that are worth noting. Here are some essential ways natural pest control may differ from conventional solutions: - Its approach. While conventional pest control products are generally effective on a variety of pests, many natural pest control methods are tailored to work on specific organisms at a time. - Its ingredients. Natural pest control prides itself on being a lower-impact solution with active ingredients made from neem oil, while conventional methods contain active ingredients made from synthetic compounds that were designed to eliminate pests and their colonies. - Its environmental impact. Pest control products that aren't labeled as environmentally friendly aren't necessarily more harmful to the environment. In fact, some botanical products can have the same impact on our ecosystem as conventional ones\u2014even though they are promoted to be more environmentally friendly. - Its price. Botanical pest control solutions typically cost more than conventional methods. Despite the price difference, natural pest control is not considered a more effective alternative to traditional pest control solutions. Natural pest control methods refer to a series of strategies that rely on the power of nature to eliminate pests. While the natural approach may be easier on the environment, these products are less persistent than conventional ones, making them more suitable for preventive maintenance than full-blown infestations. Rather than eliminating pests immediately, natural remedies, or botanical pest control products generally work to make pests feel unwanted by depriving them of the resources they need to survive, deterring them from entering, or repelling them with natural solutions they consider to be intolerable. One of the most common methods is natural pesticides, or pest control solutions made from elements found in nature. From botanical pesticides (made from chemicals extracted from plants or minerals) to microbial pesticides (made from microorganisms, such as fungi and other bacteria), a variety of natural products can be used to repel pests. Whether you call it green, organic, or natural pest control, it isn't perfect. There are advantages and disadvantages to green pest control, just like there are with more traditional pest control approaches. Here are some of the pluses and minuses of a natural pest management approach: Green pest control pros include: - Eco-friendliness: This is the most obvious advantage to using natural pest control products in and around your home or business. The botanical products we use have far less impact on the environment than synthetic pesticides, which can send harmful chemicals into waterways where they can disrupt or even destroy ecosystems and pollute the natural habitats of plants and animals. Green pest control helps protect the clean water and soil that we all depend on. - Safety: Like with every type of [pest control](/pest-control/), natural pest control products are not completely without some health risks (so it's important to have a qualified professional apply them), but compared to synthetic chemical treatments, botanicals are much less of a health threat to humans and pets. - Long-term effectiveness: Decades of use of synthetic pest control has resulted in many types of pests becoming tolerant to them, and the more frequently and widely they're used, the less effective they become. Natural alternatives deliver better results over the long term. Green pest control cons include: - Effectiveness: The effectiveness of green pest control products is in the \"cons\" column as well as the \"pros\" because there is no one-size-fits-all pest control solution to every pest problem. In some cases, a botanical product just won't get the job done. No matter what type of pest you're dealing with, Noosa will always review all of your options with you before recommending the one that we believe is best. - Application expertise: Traditional pesticides that contain synthetic chemicals are often so powerful against their targets that expert application doesn't make a difference. When using a green pest control approach, however, expertise in applying it is an essential part of its ultimate effectiveness in solving your pest problem. This is one reason why DIY green pest control may be unsuccessful. At Noosa, we're experienced in applying the right product in the right place while minimizing its impact on your family and pets and the environment. We're even [partners with the EPA](https://noosapest.com/about-us/epa-partnership/)! - Availability: There are only a few pest control providers who specialize or even offer green pest control. This isn't a downside, of course, when you [contact Noosa Pest Management](https://noosapest.com/contact/)!

At Noosa Pest Management, we pride ourselves in giving our customers the option to choose between our natural option or select a synthetic (conventional) option. Regardless of your choice, each of our services offers endless benefits and ultimate peace of mind to the households we serve. Below are some of the common advantages associated with using natural pest control methods: - Since natural products break down into the environment, they generally do not cause any major environmental harm. - Since natural pest control methods target specific pests, more precise pest identification and extermination can potentially be achieved with natural remedies. - There is a myth that natural pest control methods are safer than conventional ones, which can have an influence on what customers select. Just because it's a conventional pest control product, doesn't mean it's toxic. Before labeling a natural product a \"safe\" product, be sure to check the label. Natural methods may not be the best solution for all pest infestation problems. However, there are a few pests that natural methods are successful at repelling. Some infestations that occur in compact, outdoor environments may benefit from a more gentle approach, such as botanical solutions, to eliminate these common pests: - Ants. Essential oils can be used to repel ants from your garden, and they can interfere with an ant's normal life cycle. - Cockroaches. Boric acid can be a roach extermination method when applied to cracks and crevices they may hide in. Mixing together baking soda and sugar can also be used as a natural roach bait. - Spiders. Essential oils such as peppermint and eucalyptus can be used to deter spiders. Keeping your home free from clutter can reduce the number of spider hiding spots. - Rodents. Sealing any cracks or holes into your home is the best way to prevent entry. Using natural repellents such as placing cat litter in strategic locations can help deter rodents as well. When you hear the word natural, it's easy to naturally associate it with safe and assume it to be the best option. But when it comes to pest control, that may not necessarily be the case. While some botanical pest control products on the market may not be highly toxic for humans, they can be for animals, and other organisms. For example, most botanical products are made from neem oil, which can be harmful to fish. It is also known to be toxic to bees, and can eliminate them on contact. To confirm the safety of your pest control product, it is essential to first read the label before use. There are several natural pest control techniques that can be used to control infestations. Below are some examples of common natural pest control methods and how they work: - Biological control. Some of the most common enemies of pests that can be used to control infestations, include pathogens, parasitoids, and predators. - Barrier control. Close off entryways and set up natural pest traps that will keep them at bay, or trap pests, if necessary. - Organic deterrents. Some essential oils, such as neem oil, eucalyptus oil, and citronella, are natural insect repellents that can prevent pests from entering your space. At Noosa Pest Management, we believe that keeping your home and your family safe from unwanted pests starts with prevention. When it comes to keeping pests from invading your home, it is not beyond your control. One of the best courses of action you can take for preventive measures would be to hire pest control professionals who can help you start a routine pest control maintenance plan. Sometimes, DIY pest control seems like it may be the easiest and most affordable route. However, taking matters into your own hands could result in more costly issues occurring down the road. At Noosa, we provide quarterly pest control applications, meaning every few months, a professional will visit your home and monitor it for any pest activity. They will also treat the interior and exterior of your home, safeguarding it from future infestations. While natural pest control methods and chemical-based methods both share the goal of controlling pest infestations, the effectiveness of the two remedies may differ. Natural pest control can be successful in some instances, but overall it pales in comparison to many of the chemical-based products available on the market. Products made from chemicals contain active ingredients designed to eliminate pest infestations much faster than natural solutions can. In fact, higher quantities of botanical products are usually required to reach the same level of effectiveness we've become accustomed to with conventional solutions. The success rate associated with conventional products is one of the many reasons it is preferred over other methods. However, some customers may still select natural pest control solutions under the belief that conventional methods may be harmful to the environment or their loved ones. At Noosa Pest Management, we offer a variety of pest control products that are safe and effective. Both conventional and botanical, or natural pest control products, are available to our residential customers. Absolutely! Natural pest control solutions may be the most appropriate course of action in some instances, and conventional pest control methods may be preferred for others. However, there are times when taking an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach may require the use of both for maximum effectiveness. Integrated Pest Management takes an ecological approach to pest control and employs pest prevention, routine pest management, and the balance of nature to control pests in a commercial or residential area. IPM considers factors such as the area of the infested area to determine if one, or both may be the most appropriate action to take. "}
