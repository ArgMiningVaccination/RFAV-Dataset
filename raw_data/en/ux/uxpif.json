It pushed 100 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. It has widened inequality, posing a risk that recovery could leave poor countries behind. And it comes on top of long-term challenges that make many countries fragile: unsustainable debt, climate change, conflict, and weak governance. The World Bank Group has mounted the largest crisis response in its history to help over 100 low- and middle-income countries fight the health, economic, and social impacts of COVID-19. Our efforts focus in four critical areas: saving lives, protecting the poor and vulnerable, supporting business growth and job creation, and rebuilding in better ways. We are committed to helping our clients emerge from the global crisis and move toward green, resilient, and inclusive recovery. AN UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL EFFORT During the 15-month period from April 2020 through June 2021 , the World Bank Group deployed over $157 billion* to help governments and the private sector in developing countries. World Bank financing to governments includes: Commitments of $53.3 billion from IDA, our fund for the poorest countries Commitments of $45.6 billion from IBRD, to middle- and low-income countries IFC and MIGA private sector financing includes: $42.7 billion from IFC, to private companies and financial institutions $7.6 billion in gross issuance of MIGA guarantees * This total and figures that follow include short-term finance, mobilization, and recipient-executed trust funds.Our global support $10.9 billion EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA $35.2 billion SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA $15.6 billion SOUTH ASIA $6.2 billion MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA $13.5 billion EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC $ 1 7.5 billion LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEANWorld Bank Group commitments for the 12-month period in fiscal year 2021 totaled $98.8 billion Includes IBRD, IDA, IFC and Recipient-Executed Trust Fund commitments and MIGA gross issuance. IFC commitments include long-term commitments for IFC's own account and short-term finance commitments.The World Bank has financed projects to help more than 100 countries meet their health emergency needs. The focus includes testing, case tracking, and treatment; purchase of medical and laboratory supplies; and training of medical staff. We are also redeploying funds from existing projects to support countries' response. In East Asia and the Pacific and in Latin America and the Caribbean, we have activated Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options that are designed to address disasters. Our efforts include collaboration with a broad range of global partners , including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations , Gavi , the Global Fund , the IMF , the WHO , and the WTO . Vaccines. The Bank is supporting developing countries' access to vaccines, both through COVAX and directly from manufacturers. A $20 billion financing envelope over two years is helping countries purchase vaccines and set up systems for deployment. As of August 2021, we have committed $4.6 billion for 54 countries. Working with partners, we have also helped 140 developing countries assess their readiness for safe distribution. We are also partnering with the African Union to help countries across Africa purchase and deploy vaccines for more than 400 million people . IFC is making $4 billion available to increase the capacity of developing countries to manufacture vaccines and access vital medical equipment. With bilateral partners, IFC is investing \u20ac600 million to enable South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare to produce the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Health systems. World Bank investments and related policy support are helping countries strengthen health systems for the long term, including by building resilience to address future pandemics and to prevent disruptions to other essential health services. Learning from Ebola outbreaks, we have expanded IDA financing for disease surveillance in West and Central Africa. To enhance preparedness , the Bank is also supporting regional centers of excellence, such as the Africa Centers for Disease Control, the East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project, and the West African Health Organization.Saving lives SAVING LIVESProtecting the poor and vulnerable PROTECTING THE POOR The impacts of COVID-19 have pushed an estimated 100 million more people into extreme poverty, reversing hard-won gains in development. Twice as many people now face food insecurity, particularly in countries that were already fragile or affected by conflict. Up to 1.6 billion students have been out of school. Women have been more likely to lose their jobs, while also facing more demand for caregiving and a higher risk of gender-based violence. Social protection. Safety nets are critical when people lose incomes and livelihoods: yet before the pandemic, just 1 in 5 people in the poorest countries had access to this support. World Bank financing is helping countries scale up social protection to address the crisis and build resilience for the long term. In Ghana , the World Bank is supporting cash transfers for one-time payment to 350,000 households. In Pakistan, $25 million will provide emergency transfers for up to 4 million people under the national safety net. In Somalia , a $65 million IDA grant is helping the national cash transfer program provide assistance that lets families supplement their income and prioritize their children's health and education. Education. We are helping countries return students to school, recover from learning losses, and rebuild systems to be more effective, resilient, and equitable. In India , a $500 million project is investing in remote learning , reducing dropout rates, providing remedial instruction, and offering psychosocial support for teachers, students, and families. The effort will reach around 250 million school-age children and over 10 million teachers. Food security. IDA's dedicated funding for crises is supporting early responses on food insecurity, both by scaling up emergency safety nets and providing support for livelihoods. In Yemen , support is being designed in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization to reach 150,000 households in the most vulnerable areas . In Haiti , we mobilized emergency funding to help small farms purchase seeds, fertilizer, and other inputs to safeguard production for the next two growing seasons. The pandemic's impact on private enterprises has been severe. Across emerging markets, World Bank Group data shows nearly four in 10 smaller firms are in financial arrears or expect to be soon. Boosting the private sector is essential to contain the economic crisis and support recovery; in many countries, sustaining inclusive growth and job creation will be tied to reforms and economic transformation. Support to businesses. In low- and middle-income countries, companies are facing acute financial difficulties amid the pandemic; many of them need help to stay in business and preserve jobs . IFC's $8.4 billion Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility launched in March 2020 to provide liquidity to existing clients. By June 2021, $5.8 billion was committed , nearly half of it for the poorest countries and fragile and conflict-affected states. Much of IFC's funding is going to micro, small, and medium enterprises , a big source of employment in developing countries, as well as to women entrepreneurs. MIGA's $6.5 billion COVID-19 Response Program has helped investors and lenders mitigate the impact of the crisis in emerging markets and developing economies. The World Bank is also assisting viable firms, strengthening insolvency regimes, and building financial sector resilience in Indonesia, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The digital economy. The pandemic makes clearer than ever that connectivity infrastructure is critical for economic and social development. But in countries where few have internet access, achieving universal, affordable, and high-quality connectivity requires massive investment. The Bank's Digital Economy for Africa initiative supports the African Union's Digital Transformation Strategy; it aims to connect every individual, business, and government in Africa by 2030. In the Kyrgyz Republic, we are helping link farms with markets using digital technology to track deliveries and product quality. This helps farmers strengthen livelihoods and raise incomes, while building resilience in value chains . In Jordan , a $163 million project is connecting poor and vulnerable youth\u2014both Jordanians and Syrian refugees\u2014to digital opportunities by improving skills, creating jobs, and helping high-growth companies access finance.Supporting business growth and job creation SUPPORTING GROWTHAs they look toward recovery, developing countries will continue to need macro- economic support, but also reforms that bolster growth prospects. The World Bank's knowledge products offer insights that can help lay the foundation for long-term recovery, through approaches that help countries build more resilient infrastructure, prepare for natural disasters, and adapt to a rapidly changing climate. Sustainable infrastructure. Recovery from COVID-19 presents an opportunity for countries to build back better, meet their climate goals, and stimulate flagging economies with climate-smart infrastructure development. The Bank Group is helping governments take stock of projects, access funding, and tap private sector financing and expertise. In 11 African countries from Djibouti to Senegal, we will invest more than $5 billion over five years to help restore degraded landscapes, improve agricultural productivity, and develop climate-resilient infrastructure. Comprehensive support. By strengthening policies and institutions based on transparent and sustainable debt and investments, we believe countries can return to growth while also making sure that it is green, resilient, and inclusive. In Jamaica , a $150 million development policy loan is helping the government provide emergency financial assistance to vulnerable people, supporting businesses as they cope with the economic shock, and strengthening financial institutions for sustainable recovery and climate resilience. Rebuilding better REBUILDING BETTER The World Bank Group is mounting an unprecedented response to the pandemic, drawing on our country depth and global breadth, a range of flexible financing mechanisms, deep multisector knowledge and expertise, and wide-reaching convening power. We seek to help countries navigate their way out of the crisis toward a green, resilient, and inclusive recovery. There is no path to sustainable, long-term growth without continuous progress in reducing poverty and inequality.
