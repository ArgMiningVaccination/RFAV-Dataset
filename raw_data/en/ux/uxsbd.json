In the state of Illinois (due to shortage of supply) individuals eligibility for this vaccine are: sexually active gay, bisexual, or other same-gender-loving men, and transgender and non-binary communities. JYNNEOS vaccine administration The vaccine is given subcutaneously (under the skin) or intradermally (in between the layers of the skin). Both require getting a shot, usually in the arm. Intradermal administration is not for everyone (though most people will get the vaccine this way). A provider should give you a subcutaneous vaccine if you: - Are under the age of 18 - Have a history of developing keloid scars You must get 2 doses for full protection regardless of method of administration. The 2nd dose should be at least 28 days after your first dose. Potential side effects from the JYNNEOS vaccine Subcutaneous or Intradermal dose Common side effects include: - Tiredness - Redness - Soreness - Headache - Swelling - Itchiness - Muscle pain Intradermal dose only It is normal to have a small \"bleb\" or pocket of fluid in the skin, similar to a bug bite after the vaccine. Symptoms at the injection site are more likely. How to get the JYNNEOS Vaccine Talk with a trusted health care provider, your local health department, or use 1-800-889-3931 or [mpoxvaxmap.org](https://mpoxvaxmap.org/) for help and ease in finding the nearest vaccination location. Common Questions Is the JYNNEOS vaccine safe for those living with HIV or with compromised immune systems? Yes, the level of immune response is the same for those living with HIV or who have a compromised immune system. It is vital that those that are immunocompromised receive a second dose 28 days after the first dose due to potentially less immune response. What should I do if I have a serious reaction to the vaccine? Though unlikely, there are reported severe allergic reactions, such as: hives, swelling of the face & throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. Call 911 or go to the nearest hospital if exhibiting these symptoms. Can I get the vaccine at the same time as other vaccines? Yes, except for Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines due to an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), which is particularly high for young adult males. Waiting 4 weeks after JYNNEOS to get a COVID-19 vaccine is recommended. However, if you have had a mpox exposure, you should still get the JYNNEOS vaccine. How well does JYNNEOS work? Clinical data shows the vaccine should be effective in preventing mpox. However, we do not have real-world data due to this being a current outbreak. Due to this reason, it's important to continue other preventative measures. "}
