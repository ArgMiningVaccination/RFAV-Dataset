Scientifically speaking, energy is defined as the ability to do work. Here, the word 'work' has a broad meaning. Work doesn't mean your job. It doesn't mean mopping the floor or pulling weeds. Work is any type of activity or action. Work changes one form of energy to another. Think about this: if you have ever turned a thought into an action, you've changed thought energy into action energy. The term energy healing is used to describe a variety of holistic healing techniques that use the natural mind-body connection to promote emotional and physical wellbeing. By accessing, channeling, balancing, and manipulating the body's natural energy centers, energy healing processes may help support health. Energy healing is based on connecting the subconscious and conscious, engaging the whole person to promote health and wellbeing. Unlike the prescription medications and invasive surgeries of conventional medical practices, energy healing combines powerful physical, mental, and spiritual aspects to enable the body's natural healing ability. The Origins of Energy Healing Traditional Chinese Medicine introduced ancient energy practitioners to the body's energy meridian system and the 7 chakras. The [7 chakras](https://discoverhealing.com/interactive-chakra-chart/) are said to be the energy centers of the body, with each chakra influencing a different part of who you are and how you feel. Over the last century or so, modern scientists and physicists have discovered that these ancient people were onto something \u2014 in fact, everything is made of energy! Many medical practitioners are beginning to see and use the benefits of energy healing in their own practices. [Hundreds of hospitals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/reiki-goes-mainstream-spiritual-touch-practice-now-commonplace-in-hospitals/2014/05/16/9e92223a-dd37-11e3-a837-8835df6c12c4_story.html) in the United States are now making Reiki available (one of the basic forms of energy healing). The concept of energy healing can also be traced back several thousand years to an ancient Indian spiritual tradition of universal energy called prana. Prana, or the breath of life, is based on the idea that universal energy is the basic component and source of every life form. In the third millennium B.C., the ancient Chinese people founded the belief that all matter is pulsing with vital energy they called ch'i. This universal energy is composed of two opposing forces \u2014 yin and yang \u2014 that when balanced, promote optimal physical and mental health. The common holistic practice of acupuncture, for example, is designed to help balance the yin and yang energies in the body. Today, energy healing practitioners continue to use these and other similar ideologies to help people access conscious and subconscious energies that may promote prime physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Everything is Energy People who practice energy healing embrace the fact that everything is made of energy, including our bodies, emotions, and thoughts. As energy beings, our bodies are connected to the earth and the rest of the universe in unseen ways. The energy of your body connects to the energy of everything around you, and one can influence the other. Without this unseen force, we wouldn't have life. We need this constant flow of energy to keep our bodies, minds, and spirits alive and whole. Energy healers would probably tell you that this energy flow is what makes physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual recovery possible. While we see and think of our bodies as flesh and bone, our physical bodies are only a small part of what we're made of. While energy healing practices vary in methods and techniques, each is based on the idea that every aspect of the body is intimately connected to the others and to the universe. The Benefits of Energy Healing Because energy healing is so simple, and can be an amazing tool in anyone's hands. Using energy healing, anyone may be able to lead a happier and healthier life. For example, the mind-body connection forged by energy healing may help you stay positive, even under tough conditions. This positivity can help you relax, stay grateful, and maintain physical and emotional wellness even when you're stressed. Other benefits of energy healing include: - Completely non-invasive - Can be done in person or from miles away - Gentle and pain-free - Can be practiced on yourself and loved ones at home - No drug interactions - Can help you reduce anxiousness and sadness - May help you improve relationships - Can help identify energetic root cause of physical or emotional symptoms - Can help you easily remove imbalances that may be holding you back physically and emotionally Types of Energy Healing Acupuncture Developed in China more than 3,000 years, acupuncture is a big part of traditional Chinese medicine. It is based on the body's meridians \u2014 or energy highways \u2014 where qi (or energy) flows. It is thought that these energy highways or channels provide access to the different systems of the body. Acupuncture uses tiny needles, suction cups, and pressure points in specified points of the body to activate and strengthen these meridians for different purposes. Research is ongoing, but many users swear by acupuncture as an effective method for easing health issues and types of discomfort. Reiki The word Reiki is literally made from two Japanese words. Rei means \"God's wisdom\" or \"higher power.\" Ki refers to \"life force energy\". The word Reiki is usually defined as life force energy which is spiritually guided, by a higher power. As a Japanese modality used to promote relaxation and stress reduction, Reiki is thought to promote natural healing. It is used by the practitioner laying their hands on a person, and is based on the idea that the unseen life force energy which flows through each of us is what allows us to live. If this life force energy is compromised, we may be more prone to stress, illness or other ailments. But when this energy is higher, we are better able to achieve wellness and joy. Meditation [Mindful meditation](https://discoverhealing.com/the-benefits-of-mindfulness-and-meditation/) is one of the most widely used holistic health practices, but is really based in energy healing as it is meant to connect the mind and body. While you may seek guidance from a recording or personal guide, you can easily practice it on your own, in the comfort of your own home. There are many different kinds of meditation for spiritual growth, progressive relaxation, stress management, focus, etc. Many people embrace meditation as a mind-body approach to holistic health. Research shows [meditation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) may have a positive impact on things like high blood pressure, cardiovascular health, and inflammation. Chakra Healing Chakra, or \"wheel\" in Old Sanskrit, refers to the energy life force (or prana, as mentioned above) that moves inside the human body. When balanced, the body's 7 chakras are thought to send optimal energy levels to every connected aspect of the mind, body, and spirit. It's believed that unbalanced chakras \u2014 or energy that's spinning too quickly or slowly \u2014 may lead to negative effects on the body's health. Beginning with the Root chakra, below the genitals, and ending with the Crown chakra, above the crown of the head, the [chakra chart](https://discoverhealing.com/interactive-chakra-chart/) sheds light on the importance of maintaining balance within each of the 7 chakras. You can learn more about them [here](https://discoverhealing.com/interactive-chakra-chart/). The Emotion Code & The Body Code The Emotion Code\u00ae and The Body Code were both developed by [Dr. Bradley Nelson](https://discoverhealing.com/about/) to empower every person to enable their body's own natural healing abilities. The Emotion Code is focused on the idea that even our emotions are made of energy, and that by tapping into the information in the subconscious mind (made possible through a simple method called muscle testing), you can release the literal energy of negative emotions that may be trapped inside your body. Releasing those energies can help you feel lighter, happier, and even reduce physical symptoms like joint discomfort \u2014 sometimes immediately. The Body Code takes this idea to a deeper level, guiding the user through the process of identifying energies of physical issues like organ dysfunction, structural imbalance, even pathogens or nutritional deficiencies. These are identified through simple muscle testing, where answers about your health are sought from the brilliant subconscious mind. Using The Body Code may help you identify the root cause of outward symptoms, and give you the information you need to address them. This list is not an exhaustive one. There are many types of energy healing, but none of them should exclude seeking recommended medical treatments from licensed physicians and healthcare providers. Energy healing may help you feel better from any number of ailments, but is not intended to be a substitute for medical care. "}
