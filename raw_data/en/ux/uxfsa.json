It does not include all of the terms, coverage, exclusions, limitations and conditions of the actual contract language. The policies and contracts themselves must be read for those details. Policy forms for your reference will be made available upon request. The intent of this document is to provide you with general information regarding the status of, and/or potential concerns related to, your current employee benefits environment. It does not necessarily fully address all of your specific issues. It should not be construed as, nor is it intended to provide, legal advice. Questions regarding specific issues should be addressed by your general counsel or an attorney who specializes in this practice area.3 GROUP HEALTH AND WELFARE PLAN Plan Eligibility Colleagues are eligible to participate in benefits through Nebraska Medicine's Group Health and Welfare Plan as long as an active status is maintained, and you are regularly scheduled to work 20 hours (.5 FTE) or more per week in a regular job. Coverage under Nebraska Medicine's Plan is effective on the first day of the month following or coinciding with your date of hire. Dependent Coverage Under the medical, dental, vision and life insurance plans, only a colleague's legal spouse and dependent child(ren) up to the age of 26 are eligible for coverage. A \"child\" includes the colleague's natural born child, a stepchild, a legally adopted child or a child placed and approved for adoption in the colleague's home. Dependent Documentation Before adding a dependent to any benefit plan, supporting documentation must be received and approved by the Benefit Department. Allow up to two business days for the dependent to be approved. Please review MyHR for details regarding acceptable documentation. Enrollment Procedures A colleague must utilize Workday to add dependents and enroll in benefits. If you do not enroll within 30 days of your hire date or becoming benefits eligible, all optional elections will be considered waived. If both parents (or step-parents) are employees of Nebraska Medicine, children can not be dually covered on medical, dental, and vision plans. The parents should decide under whose plan the child will be covered. How the Plan Works Each payday, Nebraska Medicine provides colleagues with some basic benefits depending on a colleague's benefit eligibility. Depending on the type of benefit, deductions are reflected using either pre-tax or after-tax dollars. Colleague benefit deductions are reflected on each biweekly paycheck. By submitting your new hire benefits enrollment, you are authorizing Nebraska Medicine to deduct the applicable premium(s) from your biweekly paycheck. If an election is made with a retro-active effective date, the first paycheck that is processed after the election has been approved will include any additional contribution amounts that are required. If you are not wanting to contribute funds to your health savings account, enter an annual amount of 0. All benefit coverage will remain in effect through the end of the plan year. The only time benefit changes can be made to medical, dental, vision and flexible spending accounts is if a qualified event is experienced (see right) and proper documentation is submitted within 30 days of the event (includes day of event). Changes may be requested to Life, AD&D and Long-Term Disability at any time throughout the year. A colleague must utilize Workday to submit documentation of a qualified event (if applicable) and request an election change to benefit plans. It is your responsibility to contact the HR Service Center regarding any election change questions. A change from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time is not considered a qualifying event, as the colleague is already considered benefit-eligible.Nebraska Medicine provides many choices in benefits to enable colleagues to have the coverage that best suits their personal needs. Nebraska Medicine pays the cost of some benefits, while colleagues have the opportunity to purchase additional benefits.

Specifics Definition of Disability Disability means any physical or mental condition arising from a non-occupational illness, pregnancy, or injury which renders a participant incapable of performing the material duties of his or her regular job, or any reasonably related job. A colleague is also considered disabled when: he or she is ordered not to work by written order from a state or local health officer because he or she is infected with, or suspected of being infected with, a communicable disease; or he or she has been referred or recommended by competent medical authority to participate as a resident in either an alcohol abuse treatment program or drug abuse treatment program. Amount of Insurance 60% of basic weekly earningsElimination Period 7 calendar days of missed work due to a qualified Short-Term Disability* *A Participant is required to use available paid time off (PTO) during the elimination period for Short-Term Disability. Once a participant has satisfied the elimination period and has started to receive Short-Term Disability benefits, they will be required to supplement STD pay with any available Extended Illness Bank (EIB) hours. When EIB hours are exhausted or if the participant does not have any available EIB hours, they will be required to supplement the Short-Term Disability pay with PTO hours for the duration of the disability and/or during the FMLA and/or state leave of absence. Maximum Weekly Benefit N/A Minimum Weekly Benefit $25 BASIC LONG-TERM DISABILITY Nebraska Medicine will provide all full-time (.9 to 1.0 FTE) colleagues a basic amount of Long-Term Disability (LTD) insurance at no cost. Part-time colleagues are not eligible for this basic amount. Specifics Definition of Disability A colleague is considered disabled when: he or she is limited from performing the material and substantial duties of his/her regular occupation due to sickness or injuries; and he or she has a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury. Amount of Insurance 60% of basic monthly earnings*Elimination Period 90 calendar days of missed work due to a qualified Long- Term Disability Maximum Monthly Benefit Lesser of $15,000 or 60% of basic monthly earnings Minimum Monthly Benefit Greater of $100 or 10% of basic monthly earnings *Basic Monthly Earnings Excludes bonus, overtime pay or other special forms of compensation19 SUPPLEMENTAL LONG-TERM DISABILITY Full-time colleagues (.9 to 1.0 FTE) and part-time colleagues (.5 to .89 FTE) are eligible to participate in Supplemental Long- Term Disability (LTD) insurance. Supplemental LTD insurance pays an enhanced benefit of 66 2/3% of basic monthly earnings. Full-time colleagues may purchase 6 2/3% of disability coverage. Part-time colleagues may purchase the full 66 2/3% of disability coverage. Specifics Definition of Disability A colleague is considered disabled when: he or she is limited from performing the material and substantial duties of his/her regular occupation due to sickness or injuries; and he or she has a 20% or more loss in indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury. Amount of Insurance 66 2/3% of basic monthly earnings*Elimination Period 90 calendar days of missed work due to a qualified Long-Term Disability Maximum Monthly Benefit Lesser of $15,000 or 66 2/3% of basic monthly earnings Minimum Monthly Benefit Greater of $100 or 10% of basic monthly earnings *Basic Monthly Earnings Excludes bonus, overtime pay or other special forms of compensation If you choose to purchase Supplemental Long-Term Disability coverage, you will pay the premium through biweekly payroll deductions. Please note that the premium for this coverage will be paid with after-tax dollars. Enrollment in supplemental LTD insurance is permitted when the colleague is first benefit-eligible without evidence of insurability (EOI) approval. A colleague may apply for supplemental LTD insurance any time during the plan year, but EOI will be required. Coverage will begin the first of the month following approval.20 FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS (FSA) Administrator: UMR Customer Service: 866.868.0145 Website: www.umr.com Under current tax law, a colleague may make pre-tax contributions (before taxes are computed) to pay for qualified expenses. UMR is the administrator for processing claims and customer service for Nebraska Medicine's flexible spending accounts (FSA). Two flexible spending accounts are available under the program: one for health care expenses and another for dependent care expenses. Colleagues who are enrolled in the Advantage or Value Medical Plans are not eligible to enroll in the Health Care FSA. If you are enrolled in the Health Care Flexible Spending Account Plan you will receive a debit card. Annual Election The election the colleague makes will be in place from the effective date of the election through December 31 of the current calendar year. You may not make any changes to your election during the calendar year unless you have a qualified event. IRS regulations do not allow eligible colleagues to change elections simply because the colleague did not estimate reimbursable expenses accurately. In order to make a change in your elections due to a qualified event, a benefit change with appropriate documentation must be completed within 30 days (includes day of the event). The new election amount applies only to expenses incurred after the first of the month following the qualified event. IRS regulations require re-enrollment each year to participate in the FSA programs. How Flexible Spending Accounts Work During enrollment, you determine how much you wish to contribute to one or both FSAs each pay period. Each payday, the amount is deducted from your gross pay before taxes are computed. As health care expenses are incurred throughout the year, participants can either pay at the time services are received and submit a claim for reimbursement, or they can use their FSA debit card to have the expenses paid directly from their account. For daycare expenses, reimbursements cannot exceed the year-to-date amount withheld from the colleague's pay less any previous reimbursements. For health care expenses, reimbursement cannot exceed the colleague's projected annual contribution. Employment Termination or Loss of Benefit Eligibility If you terminate employment or cease to participate in the plan during the calendar year, your participation in the FSA accounts will terminate at the end of the month in which you are no longer eligible or stop making contributions. If there is a balance in the account, the colleague will be able to submit claims for reimbursement of eligible expenses incurred through the end of the month in which the colleague is no longer eligible. Claims must be submitted for reimbursement within 90 days after the colleague is no longer eligible to participate in the plan. \"Use It or Lose It\" Rule It is important to plan carefully. If the colleague does not incur eligible expenses equal to the amount of money elected for the FSAs during the year, any remaining balances will be forfeited. In addition, the colleague cannot use funds left in one account to reimburse expenses in the other account.21 FLEX DEBIT CARD All colleagues who elect the health care FSA will automatically receive an FSA card. Each card is valid for five years. The FSA card is a useful tool, similar to a debit card, which allows the cardholder to pay for eligible expenses with a simple swipe at a merchant payment terminal. By using the card, the cardholder avoids paying for a purchase with money out of pocket. However, because of the special tax status of the FSA contributions, IRS regulations will often require the colleague to submit the receipt of the purchase after the fact as proof of the eligibility of the expense. Save all itemized purchase receipts in the event that UMR conducts an audit and requests this information. FSA cards can only be used at non-health care related merchant locations that have implemented an Inventory Information Approval System (IIAS). An IIAS recognizes whether an expense is eligible or ineligible for medical care under IRS 213 (d). The cards will be accepted at health care related merchants and service providers such as doctors, dentists, vision care centers and pharmacies. You will not be able to use your card at grocery stores, discount stores or any other retailer unless the retailer has implemented an IIAS. Please take time to review the \"rules\" of the FSA card once the card is received. How to Request Reimbursement If the FSA card is not being used, your claims submission options are: web submission (via www.umr.com) mail fax Claim forms are available on MyHR. For the health care FSA , the colleague will need to attach itemized bills and explanation of benefits from the insurance company. For the dependent care FSA, the colleague should attach a receipt for the dependent care services. If the colleague does not have a receipt for daycare expenses, the care provider must sign the claim form. Payment of all claims is administered by a third-party claims administrator. Claim forms may be mailed, faxed, or filed online. Information on how to file claims is on MyHR.Direct Deposit of Reimbursement Payments You have the option to have reimbursements automatically deposited into your personal bank account. This can be arranged by logging into the UMR website and setting up personal account information. Annual Cutoff Claims incurred during the current calendar year must be received by the Claims Administrator no later than March 31 of the next calendar year in order to receive reimbursement. These claims cannot be reimbursed out of the following year's funds. 22 HEALTH CARE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT Under the plan, the colleague will only be reimbursed for eligible health care expenses. To find additional information, refer to the UMR website. A link can be found on MyHR. The expenses are incurred for services rendered after the effective date of this election and during the calendar year to which it applies. If you are enrolled in a Health Savings Account, you will receive a debit card. DEPENDENT CARE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT Under the plan, colleagues will only be reimbursed for eligible dependent care expenses meeting all of the following conditions. To find additional information refer to the UMR website. A link can be found on MyHR. The expenses must be incurred to enable the colleague to be gainfully employed. The expenses must be incurred for services rendered after the date of the election and during the calendar year to which it applies.Health Care FSA Maximum Annual Contribution \u2014 $2,750 Federal Tax Deduction vs. Health Care FSA Current tax law allows you to deduct certain non-covered medical and dental expenses on your income tax return. You may wish to consult your personal tax advisor to determine whether you wish to participate in the health care FSA or to claim a tax deduction for the medical expenses. Dependent Care FSA Maximum Annual Contribution \u2014 $5,000 Federal Tax Deduction vs. Dependent Care FSA Under current tax law, the colleague may be eligible to receive a tax credit for daycare costs. The credit may be used instead of the dependent care FSA. You may wish to consult with your personal tax advisor before choosing to participate in the dependent care FSA. 23 VOLUNTARY BENEFITS Providing coverage in key benefit areas, voluntary benefits offer additional financial security.

Since our needs for time off are as varied as our lifestyles, Nebraska Medicine has implemented a paid leave plan that allows each individual colleague flexibility in scheduling time off. Eligibility All full-time (.9 FTE or greater) and eligible part-time (.5 to less than a .9 FTE) colleagues may accrue paid time off benefits. Paid Time Off The paid time off (PTO) bank gives eligible colleagues paid work hours that may be used for vacation, personal sick, family care and personal time to do the things they enjoy. The colleague decides how to use his/her earned PTO. Accrual Colleagues begin to accrue PTO benefits upon employment in, or transfer to, an eligible employment category. Colleagues will accrue PTO benefits each pay period. FULL-TIME COLLEAGUES YEARS OF SERVICE ACCRUED PER PAY PERIOD ACCRUED PER YEAR 0 to 5 6.15 160 5+ to 10 7.08 184 10+ to 20 8.31 216 20+ 9.23 240 PART-TIME COLLEAGUES YEARS OF SERVICE ACCRUED PER PAY PERIOD ACCRUED PER YEAR 0 to 5 0.0654 136 5+ to 10 0.0769 160 10+ to 20 0.0885 184 20+ 0.1038 216 Maximum PTO hours Allowed in Bank: 320 Once the maximum limit of hours has been reached, no further accrual of PTO will occur until the balance falls below the maximum. Colleagues are responsible for monitoring their PTO accruals and initiating appropriate action to keep accruals below the maximum level. Recognized Holidays Nebraska Medicine recognizes six holidays each year. Colleagues will receive time off pay or holiday pay on these designated holidays. The holiday hours are a separate benefit and are not included in the colleague's PTO bank. Upon employment, all full- time (.9 FTE or greater) and part-time (.5 to less than .9 FTE) colleagues are eligible for holiday benefits. Full-time colleagues (.9 FTE to 1.0 FTE) receive eight hours and part-time colleagues (.5 FTE to less than .9 FTE) will receive four hours.

You and your eligible dependents may enroll during the annual enrollment period. NOTICE OF YOUR HIPAA SPECIAL ENROLLMENT RIGHTS Loss of Other Coverage: If you are declining enrollment for yourself and/or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage or group health plan coverage, you may be able to enroll yourself and/or your dependents in this plan if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage or if the employer stops contributing towards your or your dependent's coverage.

Termination of Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Coverage: If you decline enrollment for yourself or for an eligible dependent (including your spouse) while Medicaid coverage or coverage under a state children's health insurance program is in effect, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents in this plan if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage. However, you must request enrollment within 60 days after your or your dependents' coverage ends under Medicaid or a state children's health insurance program.

If your premiums are deducted from your pay on a pre-tax basis, IRS regulations only allow you to change your benefit elections effective January 1 unless you have a qualifying status change. Examples of changes in status include: changes in legal marital status, number of dependents, employment for you or your dependent, number of hours worked, eligibility of your dependent, entitlement to Medicare or Medicaid, or a spouse's annual enrollment. Any mid-year change in election must be consistent with and because of the qualifying status change. You must notify the HR Service Center within 30 days for most changes in status (within 60 days of loss of Medicaid or CHIP coverage or becoming eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP). If your employment ends and you are rehired within 30 days, the pre-tax elections in effect at the time of your termination will be reinstated. This means that any pre-tax premium payments and contributions will be automatically put back into effect. If you are rehired more than 30 days after terminating employment, you may reinstate your previous elections or you may make new elections. Consult the HR Service Center for more information concerning when you can change your pre-tax benefit elections. AUTOMATIC PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS ON A PRE-TAX BASIS When you elect Medical, Dental, Vision and Flexible Spending Account coverage, the premiums are automatically deducted from your wages on a pre-tax basis.

This law requires group health plans that provide coverage for mastectomy to provide coverage for certain reconstructive services. These services include: All states of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy was performed Surgery/reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance Prostheses Physical complications during all stages of mastectomy, including lymphedemas These benefits will be provided subject to the same deductibles and coinsurance applicable to other medical and surgical benefits provided under the plan. Therefore, the group health plan's deductibles and coinsurance apply. If you have questions about the current plan coverage, please contact MyHR at 402.552.6947 . NEWBORNS' ACT DISCLOSURE Group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal law generally does not prohibit the mother's or newborn's attending provider, after consulting with the mother, from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the insurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay not in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours). AVAILABILITY OF HIPAA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES Nebraska Medicine Group Health and Welfare and Dental Plan Protecting Your Health Information Privacy Rights Nebraska Medicine is committed to the privacy of your health information. The administrators of the Nebraska Medicine Group Health and Welfare and Dental Plan (the \"Plan\") use strict privacy standards to protect your health information from unauthorized use or disclosure.

You may receive a copy of the Notice of Privacy Practices by contacting MyHR at 402.552.6947. IMPORTANT NOTICE FROM NEBRASKA MEDICINE ABOUT YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE AND MEDICARE Please read this notice carefully and keep it where you can find it. This notice has information about your current prescription drug coverage with Nebraska Medicine (the Group) and about your options under Medicare's prescription drug coverage. This information can help you decide whether or not you want to join a Medicare drug plan. If you are considering joining, you should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered at what cost, with the coverage and costs of the plans offering Medicare prescription drug coverage in your area. Information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage is at the end of this notice. There are two important things you need to know about your current coverage and Medicare's prescription drug coverage: 1. Medicare prescription drug coverage became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium. 2. The Group has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered by the Nebraska Medicine Group Health and Welfare and Dental Plan is, on average for all plan participants, expected to pay out as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage pays and is therefore considered Creditable Coverage. Because your existing coverage is Creditable Coverage, you can keep this coverage and not pay a higher premium (a penalty) if you later decide to join a Medicare drug plan. When Can You Join A Medicare Drug Plan? You can join a Medicare drug plan when you first become eligible for Medicare and each year from October 15th to December 7th. However, if you lose your current creditable prescription drug coverage through no fault of your own, you will also be eligible for a two (2) month Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to join a Medicare drug plan. What Happens To Your Current Coverage If You Decide to Join A Medicare Drug Plan? If you decide to join a Medicare drug plan, your current coverage with the Group may be affected. 29 If you do decide to join a Medicare drug plan and drop your current Group coverage, be aware that you and your dependents may not be able to get this coverage back. When Will You Pay A Higher Premium (Penalty) To Join A Medicare Drug Plan? You should also know that if you drop or lose your current coverage with the Group and don't join a Medicare drug plan within 63 continuous days after your current coverage ends, you may pay a higher premium (a penalty) to join a Medicare drug plan later. If you go 63 continuous days or longer without creditable prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium may go up by at least 1% of the Medicare base beneficiary premium per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without creditable coverage, your premium may consistently be at least 19% higher than the Medicare base beneficiary premium. You may have to pay this higher premium (a penalty) as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the following October to join. For More Information About This Notice Or Your Current Prescription Drug Coverage... Contact the person listed below for further information. NOTE: You'll get this notice each year before the next period you can join a Medicare drug plan, and if this coverage through the Group changes. You also may request a copy of this notice at any time. For More Information About Your Options Under Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage... More detailed information about Medicare plans that offer prescription drug coverage is in the \"Medicare & You\" handbook. You'll get a copy of the handbook in the mail every year from Medicare. You may also be contacted directly by Medicare drug plans. For More Information About Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage: Visit www.medicare.gov . Call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (see the inside back cover of your copy of the \"Medicare & You\" handbook for their telephone number) for personalized help. Call 800.MEDICARE (800.633.4227) . TTY users should call 877.486.2048 . If you have limited income and resources, extra help paying for Medicare prescription drug coverage is available. For information about this extra help, visit Social Security on the web at www.socialsecurity.gov , or call them at 800.772.1213 (TTY 800.325.0778 ).Remember: Keep this Creditable Coverage notice. If you decide to join one of the Medicare drug plans, you may be required to provide a copy of this notice when you join to show whether or not you have maintained creditable coverage and, therefore, whether or not you are required to pay a higher premium (a penalty).
