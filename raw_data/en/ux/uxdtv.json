Their aim was to show the power of anthroposophic Christology. Thus, they focused on key turning points in Steiner's exposition--his major work, An Outline of Esoteric Science; the first Goetheanum; the reappearance of Christ in the etheric realm and its relationship to Rudolf Steiner's lectures on the Fifth Gospel; and the Christmas Conference of 1923/1924 and the founding of the New Mysteries. The lectures from these conferences, published as four booklets in German, are collected here in a single volume. The Creative Power of Anthroposophical Christology will prove to be an important work for anyone interested in the true meaning and depth of Rudolf Steiner's experience and understanding of Christ's act on Golgotha and his continuing presence among us "}
