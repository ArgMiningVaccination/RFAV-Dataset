Specifically we aim to compare outcomes of in-hospital JJA sting challenges and JJA venom specific IgE, and IgG4 responses to semi-rush JJA VIT at maintenance doses of 25 and 50 mcg of JJA venom, with and without delta-inulin adjuvant. Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||18 Years - 65 Years| |Gender||All| Inclusion Criteria: - - Previous immediate systemic allergic reaction to definite or possible JJA sting. - - Venom-specific lgE response to JJA venom (by intradermal skin testing or serological analysis). - - Age between 18 and 65 years at the time of starting treatment. - - Gives informed consent, including acknowledgement that any protection from JJA sting anaphylaxis may be short lived and that JJA VIT and in particular, JJA sting challenges have the potential to cause systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Exclusion Criteria: - - Pregnant (women of child-bearing age will have a urine pregnancy test on first day of treatment) or intended pregnancy during treatment. - - Beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor or mono-amine oxidase therapy for any reason. - - Unstable heart disease. - - Poorly controlled lung disease; defined as being severe enough to cause breathlessness on mild or moderate exertion, i.e. unable to walk up a modest incline. - - Any other chronic or severe medical condition which puts the patient at increased risk if they participated in this study in the investigators opinion. - - Previous JJA VIT, any ongoing immunotherapy or use of immunosuppressive drugs. Trial Details | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. Background JJA sting appears to be a dominant cause of insect sting anaphylaxis in the cooler areas of southern and eastern Australia where the native ant is prevalent. Immunotherapy for treatment of stinging insect anaphylaxis involves the administration of increasing doses of purified insect venom with the aim of inducing clinical tolerance, but also carrying the risk of allergic reactions to treatment. In a randomised double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of JJA VIT7 we have shown JJA VIT to be highly effective at preventing JJA sting anaphylaxis, with an objective systemic sting reaction rate in those who were on maintenance JJA VIT < 5% vs.#46;70% for those receiving placebo VIT. Real world experience in Tasmania has supported these findings with objective systemic reaction rates to sting challenges on 50 and 100 mcg maintenance doses respectively 14/130 and 12/126 subjects as against reaction rates to stings in similar subjects without JJA VIT of 70-76% in trial and epidemiological studies. Although JJA VIT is highly effective at preventing severe objective reactions to JJA stings, its applicability is limited by - (1) venom availability with venom collected by venom sac dissection of ants harvested from wild nests with inherent WH&S risks; (2) venom costs, at $2 per microgram of venom (3) as with honey bee VIT difficulties in a significant minority of subjects in achieving maintenance because of immediate generalised allergic reactions (4) prolonged therapy, generally 5 years or longer - for those in whom a previous sting reaction was immediately life-threatening, treatment continues indefinitely for as long as the risk of an accidental sting remains. - (4) study groups each of ten (10) subjects. - - will be performed after 12 months tolerating the 1-month maintenance interval, and one month after the last dose. Arms Experimental: 25mcg JJA venom Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT (without delta-inulin) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 25mcg (dose finding comparison). Experimental: 25mcg + Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT with delta-inulin (at a fixed dose of 5 mg with each dose of venom) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 25mcg (dose finding comparison, adjuvant comparison). Active Comparator: 50mcg JJA venom Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT (without delta-inulin) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 50mcg, ie. the current standard of care. Experimental: 50mcg JJA venom + 5mg delta-inulin Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT with delta-inulin (at a fixed dose of 5 mg with each dose of venom) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 50mcg (adjuvant comparison). Interventions Drug: - Delta-inulin Addition of adjuvant, delta-inulin to JJA VIT regime, to determine if this will allow lower doses and shorter regimes to promote protective responses, reducing costs and morbidity of JJA VIT. Biological: - Dose finding comparison Define minimum effective maintenance dose (50mcg vs 25mcg). In \"real world\" sting challenges after 12 months of JJA VIT objective systemic reaction rates after 50 and 100 mcg maintenance doses respectively 14/130 and 12/126 subjects vs reaction rates to stings in similar subjects without JJA VIT 70-76%. Venom delivery in sting likely <20mcg. Therefore minimum effective maintenance dose not yet defined.
