IMPORTANT DATES |September 15, 2023||Call for Abstract and Sessions Opens| |March 8, 2024||Hotel Reservation Deadline| | | Join Us Over the past two decades, our field of Integrative Medicine and Health has effectively established itself as a visionary, coherent, and compelling advocate for the transformation of our ailing healthcare system. The Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health has articulated a multi-disciplinary, team-based, and holistic approach to health care that recognizes the effects of biomedical, psychological, socioeconomic, and spiritual factors on patient health outcomes. We have conducted high-quality research that has shown integrative healthcare strategies to be safe and effective, particularly for common health problems for which conventional medical therapies have not met the needs of many patients. Because of these successes, respected medical guidelines now recommend using integrative therapies for chronic pain, cancer, and other conditions. The 2024 Congress will focus on the challenging next step in our journey: moving integrative healthcare strategies into mainstream healthcare. | | "}
