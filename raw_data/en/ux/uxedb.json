Spiritual healing and healing through prayer: a discussion paper] Abstract Spiritual healing and healing through prayer have been among the methods for healing diseases of mankind since time immemorial. Even today they are quite popular in many parts of the Western world, as epidemiological data testify. Also in Germany, although less systematic data are available, spiritual healing is being used quite a lot. This interest is driven mainly by word of mouth and media presentation of spectacular single case descriptions of healing. Scientifically speaking, such cases present a challenge to science to understand the mechanisms at work. Systematic scientific studies, however, are rather sporadic and sometimes amateur-like efforts. However, the data available show two general results: patients seeking out healing normally profit to a clinically significant degree. At the same time, there is little evidence that these effects are specific in nature. It could be the case that the mechanisms at work--if there are any specific mechanisms at all--do not follow the normal expected causal routes of activity, and hence the methodology applied might be misguided or incapable of capturing the effects. If there are generalised non-local effects at work, a hypothesis worth testing, then this has profound consequences both for research and for the interpretation of results.
