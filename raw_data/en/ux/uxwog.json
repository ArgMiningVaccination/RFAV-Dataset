CDC Office and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch (EPB) within the Influenza Division (ID) in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. This opportunity can be part-time or full-time, and is eligible for 100% telework from Atlanta. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the major operating components of the Department of Health and Human Services. CDC works to protect America from health, safety, and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same. The mission of the Infectious Division (ID) is to improve global prevention and control of seasonal and novel influenza and improve influenza pandemic preparedness and response. NCIRD - Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Home | CDC ID - About Influenza Division | CDC Research Project: The Applied Research and Modeling (ARM) Team in EPB seeks a qualified and motivated candidate to support a community-based, multi-site study of respiratory virus transmission in households. The project objectives are to describe risk factors for transmission, evaluate vaccine efficacy to prevent influenza, and provide insights into how influenza changes within and across seasons. Under the guidance of a mentor, the intern will serve as an analyst for a research project related to influenza transmission study objectives. This includes conducting literature reviews, collaborating with external partners, managing data, and conducting data analyses. The intern will also support scientific project management for ongoing projects. By the end of the internship, the student will have gained experience participating in teams, synthesizing scientific literature, study design, conducting research with data, scientific writing, and synthesizing research results relevant to public health. These projects evaluate the impact of vaccination to protect individuals from getting infected and from infecting others. These projects also assess the impact of age, mitigation measures, socioeconomic/sociodemographic characteristics, and other determinants of health on influenza outcomes in household settings. Learning Objectives: The activities listed below represent the minimum training opportunities that the fellow will complete: Conduct reviews of scientific literature to support the development of a specific research project, with supervision. Develop and lead an analysis of existing data, leading to a presentation to partners or a manuscript draft. Support ongoing study activities as needed. Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Alexandra Mellis (qzv6@cdc.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, don't hesitate to get in touch with the mentor(s). Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 21, 2023. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors. Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of CDC and is contingent on the availability of funds.
