Through the use of acupuncture points on the body, needles and in some cases darts are placed into the skin at specific locations which alter or influence the way the nervous system processes information and the way the energy/Qi flows through the body. Acupuncture combines psychological comfort with physical relief to provide an effective treatment option for many health care needs. We offer acupuncture treatment options to our patients at Alexandria Natural Health Center. Patients seeking acupuncture treatment are usually seeking relief from chronic pain, additional rehabilitation techniques from sports related or accidental injuries or as a natural treatment alternative.
