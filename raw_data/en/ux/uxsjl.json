Do you want to overcome your sugar cravings? Do you have a few pounds to lose that accumulated during the past few months? Do you want to experience more ENERGY throughout the day, without relying on coffee? Do you want to adopt better EATING HABITS, to stabilize your blood sugar and BALANCE YOUR HORMONES? Do you feel there are things that are dragging you down that you can't seem to get rid of? THEN THIS DETOX IS PERFECT FOR YOU! This detox is all about feeling lighter, letting go of bad habits and building new ones, in order to feel rejuvenated this season. In only 7 days, you will feel better both emotionally and physically. This detox will help to eliminate toxins, stabilize your blood sugar and hormones, boost your positive energy, improve your mood, and make you feel healthier and happier overall. You will be eating easy and simple BALANCED meals made with whole, unprocessed foods. You diet will be primarily rich in fiber to keep you full and support elimination. You will be eating LOTS of leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables that support your detoxification pathways, add a ton of nutrients, help reduce inflammation and even balance hormones. They will make up the majority of your plate, and with little calories, they also support your weight loss. You will have small portions of lean protein filled with Omega-3's (from flax seeds to fish) to keep you satiated and provide blood sugar support. Lastly, you will be eating healthy carbohydrates - to keep you energized, add insoluble fiber, and support both your thyroid and adrenal glands. While I do suggest only small portions of protein and carbs at each meal, they are just what your body needs, and the large serving of vegetables will ensure that you do not go hungry! Lastly, you will be detoxing other aspects of your life for a full mind-bod-spirit transformation!
