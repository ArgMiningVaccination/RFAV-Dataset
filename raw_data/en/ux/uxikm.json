We are delighted you enjoyed your detox with Homefield. regards Homefield x The 5 day Healthy Balance option was a great way to detox, and re-start a healthy eating regime in time for Spring. I managed to lose 5lbs of my winter/Christmas weight and now feel inspired to eat more healthily again. Food is as delicious as you would expect from Homefield Grange. I lost 9lb over 5 days and now feel great. The soups, juices and meals all taste delicious and the supplements and videos help you to keep on track. This was the first time I tried the Balance Box and found it easier to stick to than I was expecting. It will now be a regular part of my health regime going forwards. Many thanks to the team at Homefield Grange Retreat. I have loved every day of the five day balance box - I feel light and healthy and every few weeks I will order to re set me on my weight loss journey - so far Homefield Grange has played a big part in my weight loss success !
