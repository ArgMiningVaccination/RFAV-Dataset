Argued February 25, 1992\u00d0Decided June 18, 1992 In response to rapidly rising real property taxes, California voters ap- proved a statewide ballot initiative, Proposition 13, which added ArticleXIIIA to the State Constitution. Among other things, Article XIIIAembodies an \u00aaacquisition value\u00ba system of taxation, whereby propertyis reassessed up to current appraised value upon new construction or a change in ownership. Exemptions from this reassessment provisionexist for two types of transfers: exchanges of principal residences bypersons over the age of 55 and transfers between parents and children.Over time, the acquisition-value system has created dramatic disparitiesin the taxes paid by persons owning similar pieces of property. Longerterm owners pay lower taxes re\u00afecting historic property values, whilenewer owners pay higher taxes re\u00afecting more recent values. Facedwith such a disparity, petitioner, a former Los Angeles apartment renterwho had recently purchased a house in Los Angeles County, \u00aeled suitagainst respondents, the county and its tax assessor, claiming that Arti-cle XIIIA's reassessment scheme violates the Equal Protection Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment. The County Superior Court dismissedthe complaint without leave to amend, and the State Court of Appealaf\u00aermed. Held: Article XIIIA's acquisition-value assessment scheme does not Unless a state-imposed classi\u00aecation warrants some form of heightened review because it jeopardizes exercise of a fundamentalright or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic,the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the classi\u00aecation ration-ally further a legitimate state interest. P. 10. (b) Petitioner may not assert the constitutional right to travel as a basis for heightened review of Article XIIIA. Her complaint does notallege that she herself has been impeded from traveling or from settlingin California because, before purchasing her home, she already livedin Los Angeles. Prudential standing principles prohibiting a litigant'sraising another person's legal rights may not be overlooked in this case, since petitioner has not identi\u00aeed any obstacle preventing others whowish to travel or settle in California from asserting claims on their own,nor shown any special relationship with those whose rights she seeks toassert. Pp. 10\u00b111. (c) In permitting longer term owners to pay less in taxes than newer owners of comparable property, Article XIIIA's assessment scheme ra-tionally furthers at least two legitimate state interests. First, becausethe State has a legitimate interest in local neighborhood preservation,continuity, and stability, it legitimately can decide to structure its taxsystem to discourage rapid turnover in ownership of homes and busi-nesses. Second, the State legitimately can conclude that a new owner,at the point of purchasing his property, does not have the same relianceinterest warranting protection against higher taxes as does an existingowner, who is already saddled with his purchase and does not have theoption of deciding not to buy his home if taxes become prohibitivelyhigh. Pp. 11\u00b114. (d)Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.County Comm'n of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336, is not controlling here, since the facts of that case pre-cluded any plausible inference that the purpose of the tax assessmentpractice there invalidated was to achieve the bene\u00aets of an acquisition-value tax scheme. Pp. 14\u00b116. (e) Article XIIIA's two reassessment exemptions rationally further legitimate purposes. The people of California reasonably could haveconcluded that older persons in general should not be discouraged fromexchanging their residences for ones more suitable to their changingfamily sizes or incomes, and that the interests of family and neighbor-hood continuity and stability are furthered by and warrant an exemp-tion for transfers between parents and children. Pp. 16\u00b117. (f) Because Article XIIIA is not palpably arbitrary, this Court must decline petitioner's request to invalidate it, even if it may appear to be505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT 3 Cite as: 505 U.

The adoption of Proposi- tion 13 served to amend the California Constitution to im-pose strict limits on the rate at which real property is taxedand on the rate at which real property assessments are in-creased from year to year. In this litigation, we consider achallenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment to the manner in which real propertynow is assessed under the California Constitution. I A Proposition 13 followed many years of rapidly rising real property taxes in California. From \u00aescal years 1967\u00b11968to 1971\u00b11972, revenues from these taxes increased on an av-erage of 11.5% per year. See Report of the Senate Commis-sion on Property Tax Equity and Revenue to the CaliforniaState Senate 23 (1991) (Senate Commission Report). In re-sponse, the California Legislature enacted several propertytax relief measures, including a cap on tax rates in 1972.Id., at 23\u00b124. The boom in the State's real estate market persevered, however, and the median price of an existinghome doubled from $31,530 in 1973 to $62,430 in 1977. As aresult, tax levies continued to rise because of sharply in-creasing assessment values. Id.,at 23. Some homeowners saw their tax bills double or triple during this period, welloutpacing any growth in their income and ability to pay. Id., at 25. See also Oakland, Proposition 13\u00d0Genesis and Con-sequences, 32 Nat. Tax J. 387, 392 (Supp. June 1979). By 1978, property tax relief had emerged as a major politi- cal issue in California. In only one month's time, tax reliefadvocates collected over 1.2 m illion sig natures to qualify Proposition 13 for the June 1978 ballot. See Lefcoe & Alli-son, The Legal Aspects of Proposition 13: The Amador Val- leyCase, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 173, 174 (1978). On election day, Proposition 13 received a favorable vote of 64.8% and carried55 of the State's 58 counties. California Secretary of State,505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT 5 Cite as: 505 U.

California thus had a novel constitutionalamendment that led to a property tax cut of approximately$7 billion in the \u00aerst year. Senate Commission Report 28. A California homeowner with a $50,000 home enjoyed an im-mediate reduction of about $750 per year in property taxes.Id.,at 26. As enacted by Proposition 13, Article XIIIA of the Califor- nia Constitution caps real property taxes at 1% of proper-ty's assessed valuation as of the 1975\u00b11976 tax year or,\u00aathereafter, the appraised value of real property when pur-chased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has oc-curred after the 1975 assessment.\u00ba \u00a7 2(a). The assessment\u00aamay re\u00afect from year to year the in\u00afationary rate not to exceed 2 percent for any given year.\u00ba \u00a7 2(b). Article XIIIA also contains several exemptions from this reassessment provision. One exemption authorizes the leg-islature to allow homeowners over the age of 55 who selltheir principal residences to carry their previous base-yearassessments with them to replacement residences of equalor lesser value. \u00a7 2(a). A second exemption applies totransfers of a principal residence (and up to $1 m illion of other real property) between parents and children. \u00a7 2(h). In short, Article XIIIA combines a 1% ce on the prop- erty tax rate with a 2% cap on annual increases in assessedvaluations. The assessment limitation, however, is subjectto the exception that new construction or a change of owner-ship triggers a reassessment up to current appraised value.Thus, the assessment provisions of Article XIIIA essentiallyembody an \u00aaacquisition value\u00ba system of taxation rather thanthe more commonplace \u00aacurrent value\u00ba taxation. Real prop-erty is assessed at values related to the value of the propertyat the time it is acquired by the taxpayer rather than to thevalue it has in the current real estate market.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT 6 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Opinion of the Court Over time, this acquisition-value system has created dra- matic disparities in the taxes paid by persons owning similarpieces of property. Property values in California have in-\u00afated far in excess of the allowed 2% cap on increases inassessments for property that is not newly constructed orthat has not changed hands. See Senate Commission Re-port 31\u00b132. As a result, longer term property owners paylower property taxes re\u00afecting historic property values,while newer owners pay higher property taxes re\u00afectingmore recent values. For that reason, Proposition 13 hasbeen labeled by some as a \u00aawelcome stranger\u00ba system\u00d0thenewcomer to an established community is \u00aawelcome\u00ba inanticipation that he will contribute a larger percentage ofsupport for local government than his settled neighbor whoowns a comparable home. Indeed, in dollar terms, the dif-ferences in tax burdens are staggering. By 1989, the 44%of California homeowners who have owned their homes sinceenactment of Proposition 13 in 1978 shouldered only 25% ofthe more than $4 b illion in residential property taxes paid by homeowners statewide. Id., at 33. If property values continue to rise more than the annual 2% in\u00afationary cap,this disparity will continue to grow.

Petitioner later discovered she was paying about \u00aeve times more in taxes than some of her neighbors who ownedcomparable homes since 1975 within the same residential de-velopment. For example, one block away, a house of identi-cal size on a lot slightly larger than petitioner's was subjectto a general tax levy of only $358.20 (based on an assessedvaluation of $35,820, which re\u00afected the home's value in 1975plus the up-to-2% per year in\u00afation factor). Id., at 9\u00b110. 2 According to petitioner, her total property taxes over the \u00aerst 10 years in her home will approach $19,000, while anyneighbor who bought a comparable home in 1975 stands topay just $4,100.

After exhausting administrative remedies, petitioner brought suit against respondents in Los Angeles County Su-perior Court. She sought a tax refund and a declarationthat her tax was unconstitutional. 3In her amended com- 2Petitioner proffered to the trial court additional evidence suggesting that the disparities in residential tax burdens were greater in other LosAngeles County neighborhoods. For example, a small two-bedroom housein Santa Monica that was previously assessed at $27,000 and that was soldfor $465,000 in 1989 would be subject to a tax levy of $4,650, a bill 17 timesmore than the $270 paid the year before by the previous owner.

The California Court of Appeal af\u00aermed. Nordlinger v. Lynch, 225 Cal. App. 3d 1259, 275 Cal. Rptr. 684 (1990). It noted that the Supreme Court of California already had re-jected a constitutional challenge to the disparities in taxationresulting from Article XIIIA. See Amador Valley Joint Union High School Dist. v.State Bd. of Equalization, 22 Cal. 3d 208, 583 1281 (1978). Characterizing ArticleXIIIA as an \u00aaacquisition value\u00ba system, the Court of Appealfound it survived equal protection review, because it wassupported by at least two rational bases: First, it preventedproperty taxes from re\u00afecting unduly in\u00afated and unfore-seen current values, and, second, it allowed property ownersto estimate future liability with substantial certainty. 225Cal.

The Court of Appeal also concluded that this Court's more recent decision in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.County Comm'n of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989), did not war- rant a different result.

Id.,at 341. This Court determined that the unequal assessment practice violated the Equal Pro-tection Clause. The Court of Appeal distinguished Allegheny Pittsburgh on the grounds that \u00aaCalifornia has opted for an assessmentmethod based on each individual owner's acquisition cost,\u00ba while, \u00aa[i]n marked contrast, the West Virginia Constitution requires property to be taxed at a uniform rate statewideaccording to its estimated current market value\u00ba (emphasis in original). 225 Cal. App. 3d, at 1277\u00b11278, 275 Cal. Rptr.,at 695. Thus, the Court of Appeal found: \u00aa Allegheny does not prohibit the states from adopting an acquisition valueassessment method. That decision merely prohibits the ar-bitrary enforcement of a current value assessment method\u00ba(emphasis omitted). Id.,at 1265, 275 Cal. Rptr., at 686. The Court of Appeal also rejected petitioner's argument that the effect of Article XIIIA on the constitutional right totravel warranted heightened equal protection review. Thecourt determined that the right to travel was not infringed,because Article XIIIA \u00aabases each property owner's assess-ment on acquisition value, irrespective of the owner's statusas a California resident or the owner's length of inthe state.\u00ba Id.,at 1281, 275 Cal.

The Equal Protection Clause does notforbid classi\u00aecations. It simply keeps governmental deci-sionmakers from treating differently persons who are in allrelevant respects alike. F. S. Royster Guano Co. v.Vir- ginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920). As a general rule, \u00aalegislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that,in practice, their laws result in some inequality.\u00ba McGowan v.Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425\u00b1426 (1961). Accordingly, this Court's cases are clear that, unless a classi\u00aecation war-rants some form of heightened review because it jeopardizesexercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basisof an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal ProtectionClause requires only that the classi\u00aecation rationally furthera legitimate state interest. See, e. g., Cleburne v.Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 439\u00b1441 (1985); New Or- leans v.Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976). A At the outset, petitioner suggests that Article XIIIA qual- i\u00aees for heightened scrutiny because it infringes upon theconstitutional right to travel. See, e. g., Zobel v.Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 60, n. 6 (1982); Memorial Hospital v.Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250, 254\u00b1256 (1974). In particular, peti- tioner alleges that the exemptions to reassessment for trans-fers by owners over the age of 55 and for transfers betweenparents and children run afoul of the right to travel, becausethey classify directly on the basis of California residency.But the complaint does not allege that petitioner herself hasbeen impeded from traveling or from settling in Californiabecause, as has been noted, prior to purchasing her home,505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT 11 Cite as: 505 U.

See also Moose Lodge No. 107 v.Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 166 (1972). Petitioner has not identi\u00aeed any obstacle preventing others who wishto travel or settle in California from asserting claims on theirown behalf, nor has she shown any special relationship withthose whose rights she seeks to assert, such that we mightoverlook this prudential limitation. Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v.United States, 491 U. S. 617, 623, n. 3 (1989). Accordingly, petitioner may not assert the constitutionalright to travel as a basis for heightened review. B The appropriate standard of review is whether the differ- ence in treatment between newer and older owners ration-ally furthers a legitimate state interest. In general, theEqual Protection Clause is satis\u00aeed so long as there is a plau-sible policy reason for the classi\u00aecation, see United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v.Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 174, 179 (1980), the legislative facts on which the classi\u00aecation is ap-parently based rationally may have been considered to betrue by the governmental decisionmaker, see Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 464 (1981), and the relationship of the classi\u00aecation to its goal is not so attenu-ated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, seeCleburne v.Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S., at 446. This standard is especially deferential in the context of clas-si\u00aecations made by complex tax laws. \u00aa[I]n structuring in-ternal taxation schemes `the States have large leeway inmaking classi\u00aecations and drawing lines which in their judg-ment produce reasonable systems of taxation.' \u00ba Williams v.Vermont, 472 U. S. 14, 22 (1985), quoting Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973). See also Regan v.Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT 12 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Opinion of the Court U. S. 540, 547 (1983) (\u00aaLegislatures have especially broad latitude in creating classi\u00aecations and distinctions in taxstatutes\u00ba). As between newer and older owners, Article XIIIA does not discriminate with respect to either the tax rate or theannual rate of adjustment in assessments. Newer and olderowners alike bene\u00aet in both the short and long run from theprotections of a 1% tax rate ce iling and no more than a 2% increase in assessment value per year. New owners and oldowners are treated differently with respect to one factoronly\u00d0the basis on which their property is initially assessed. Petitioner's true complaint is that the State has denied her\u00d0a new owner\u00d0the bene\u00aet of the same assessment value thather neighbors\u00d0older owners\u00d0enjoy. We have no dif\u00aeculty in ascertaining at least two rational or reasonable considerations of difference or policy that jus-tify denying petitioner the bene\u00aets of her neighbors' lowerassessments. First, the State has a legitimate interest inlocal neighborhood preservation, continuity, and stability.Village of Euclid v.Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926). The State therefore legitimately can decide to structure itstax system to discourage rapid turnover in ownership ofhomes and businesses, for example, in order to inhibit dis-placement of lower income families by the forces of gentri\u00ae-cation or of established, \u00aamom-and-pop\u00ba businesses by newerchain operations. By permitting older owners to pay pro-gressively less in taxes than new owners of comparable prop-erty, the Article XIIIA assessment scheme rationally fur-thers this interest. Second, the State legitimately can conclude that a new owner at the time of acquiring his property does not have thesame reliance interest warranting protection against highertaxes as does an existing owner. The State may deny a newowner at the point of purchase the right to \u00aalock in\u00ba to thesame assessed value as is enjoyed by an existing owner ofcomparable property, because an existing owner rationally505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:55 PAGES OPINPGT 13 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992) Opinion of the Court may be thought to have vested expectations in his property or home that are more deserving of protection than the antic-ipatory expectations of a new owner at the point of purchase.A new owner has full information about the scope of futuretax liability before acquiring the property, and if he thinksthe future tax burden is too demanding, he can decide not tocomplete the purchase at all. By contrast, the existingowner, already saddled with his purchase, does not have theoption of deciding not to buy his home if taxes become pro-hibitively high. To meet his tax obligations, he might beforced to sell his home or to divert his income away from thepurchase of food, clothing, and other necessities. In short,the State may decide that it is worse to have owned and lost,than never to have owned at all. This Court previously has acknowledged that classi\u00aeca- tions serving to protect legitimate expectation and relianceinterests do not deny equal protection of the laws. 4\u00aaThe protection of reasonable reliance interests is not only a legiti-mate governmental objective: (internal quotation marks omitted). For ex-ample, in Kadrmas v.Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U. S. 450 (1988), the Court determined that a prohibition on userfees for bus service in \u00aareorganized\u00ba school districts, but not 4Outside the context of the Equal Protection Clause, the Court has not hesitated to recognize the legitimacy of protecting reliance and expecta-tional interests.

S. 128, 143 (1978) (\u00aa[P]rotection of the Fourth Amendment depend s... upon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate ex-pectation of privacy in the invaded place\u00ba); Penn Central Transportation Co.v.New York City, 438 U.

Similarly, in United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v.Fritz, the Court determined that a denial of dual \u00aawindfall\u00ba retirement ben-e\u00aets to some railroad workers, but not others, did not vio-late the Equal Protection Clause, because \u00aaCongress could properly conclude that persons who had actually acquiredstatutory entitlement to windfall bene\u00aets while still em-ployed in the railroad industry had a greater equitable claimto those bene\u00aets than the members of appellee's class whowere no longer in railroad employment when they becameeligible for dual bene\u00aets.\u00ba 449 U. S., at 178. Finally, inNew Orleans v.Dukes, 427 U. S. 297 (1976), the Court deter- mined that an ordinance banning certain street-vendor oper-ations, but grandfathering existing vendors who had been inoperation for more than eight years, did not violate theEqual Protection Clause because the \u00aacity could reasonablydecide that newer businesses were less likely to have builtup substantial reliance interests in continued operation.\u00baId.,at 305. 5 Petitioner argues that Article XIIIA cannot be distin- guished from the tax assessment practice found to violatethe Equal Protection Clause in Allegheny Pittsburgh. Like Article XIIIA, the practice at issue in Allegheny Pittsburgh resulted in dramatic disparities in taxation of properties ofcomparable value. But an obvious and critical factual differ- 5Because we conclude that Article XIIIA rationally furthers the State's interests in neighborhood stability and the protection of property owners'reliance interests, we need not consider whether it permissibly servesother interests discussed by the parties, including whether it taxes realproperty according to the taxpayers' ability to pay or whether it taxesreal property in such a way as to promote stability of local tax revenues.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 15 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992) Opinion of the Court ence between this case and Allegheny Pittsburgh is the ab- sence of any indication in Allegheny Pittsburgh that the poli- cies underlying an acquisition-value taxation scheme couldconceivably have been the purpose for the Webster Countytax assessor's unequal assessment scheme. In the \u00aerstplace, Webster County argued that \u00aaits assessment schemeis rationally related to its purpose of assessing propertiesat true current value \u00ba (emphasis added). 488 U. S., at 343. 6 Moreover, the West Virginia \u00aaConstitution and laws provide that all property of the kind held by petitioners shall betaxed at a rate uniform throughout the State according toits estimated market value,\u00ba and the Court found \u00aano sug-gestion\u00ba that \u00aathe State may have adopted a different sys-tem in practice from that speci\u00aeed by statute.\u00ba Id.,at 345. To be sure, the Equal Protection Clause does not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature orgoverning decisionmaker actually articulate at any time thepurpose or rationale supporting its classi\u00aecation. United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v.Fritz, 449 U. S., at 179. See also McDonald v.Board of Election Comm'rs of Chi- cago, 394 U. S. 802, 809 (1969) (legitimate state purpose may be ascertained even when the legislative or administrativehistory is silent). Nevertheless, this Court's review does re-quire that a purpose may conceivably or \u00aamay reasonablyhave been the purpose and policy\u00ba of the relevant govern-mental decisionmaker. Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v.Bow- 6Webster County argued that the outdated assessments it used were consistent with current-value taxation, because periodic upward adjust-ments were made for in\u00afation and it was not feasible to reassess individu-ally each piece of property every year. Although the county obliquelyreferred in a footnote to the advantages of historical cost accounting, Brieffor Respondent in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.County Comm'n of Webster Cty., O. T. 1988, No. 87\u00b11303, p. 30, n. 23, this was not an assertion of the general policies supporting acquisition-value taxation. Even ifacquisition-value policies had been asserted, the assertion would havebeen nonsensical given its inherent inconsistency with the county's princi-pal argument that it was in fact trying to current-value taxation.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 16 NORDLINGER v.HAHN the Court ers, 358 U.

Allegheny Pittsburgh was the rare case where the facts precluded any plausible inference that the reason for the unequal assessment practicewas to achieve the bene\u00aets of an acquisition-value taxscheme. 7By contrast, Article XIIIA was enacted precisely to achieve the bene\u00aets of an acquisition-value system. Alle- gheny Pittsburgh is not contro lling here.8 Finally, petitioner contends that the unfairness of Article XIIIA is made worse by its exemptions from reassessmentfor two special classes of new owners: persons aged 55 andolder, who exchange principal residences, and children whoacquire property from their parents. This Court previouslyhas declined to hold that narrow exemptions from a generalscheme of taxation necessarily render the overall scheme in- 7InAllied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v.Bowers, 358 U.

After the Court in Wheeling Steel deter- mined that the statutory scheme's stated purpose was not legitimate, theother purposes did not need to be considered because \u00aa[h]aving themselvesspeci\u00aecally declared their purpose, the Ohio statutes left no room to con-ceive of any other purpose for their existence.\u00ba 358 U.

See Sunday Lake Iron Co. v.Township of Wake\u00aeeld, 247 U. S. 350, 352 (1918). Nor do we suggest that the Equal Protection Clause constrains administrators, as inAllegheny Pittsburgh, from violating state law requiring uniformity of taxation of property.

Royster Guano Co. v.Virginia, 253 U. S., at 415. The two exemptions at issue here rationally further legiti- mate purposes. The people of California reasonably couldhave concluded that older persons in general should not bediscouraged from moving to a residence more suitable totheir changing family size or income. Similarly, the peopleof California reasonably could have concluded that the in-terests of family and neighborhood continuity and stabilityare furthered by and warrant an exemption for transfersbetween parents and children. Petitioner has not dem-onstrated that no rational bases lie for either of theseexemptions.

They argue thatArticle XIIIA dampens demand for and construction of newhousing and buildings. And they argue that Article XIIIAconstricts local tax revenues at the expense of public educa-tion and vital services.

I agree with the Court thatProposition 13 is constitutional. But I also agree with Jus- tice Stevens that Allegheny Pittsburgh cannot be distin- guished. See post, at 31\u00b132. To me Allegheny Pittsburgh represents a \u00aaneedlessly intrusive judicial infringement onthe State's legislative powers,\u00ba New Orleans v.Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 306 (1976) (per curiam), and I write separately because I see no bene\u00aet, and much risk, in refusing to con-front it directly. I Allegheny Pittsburgh involved a county assessment scheme indistinguishable in relevant respects from Proposi-tion 13. As the Court explains, California taxes real prop-erty at 1% of \u00aafull cash value,\u00ba which means the \u00aaassessedvalue\u00ba as of 1975 (under the previous method) and after1975\u00b11976 the \u00aaappraised value of real property when pur-505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 19 Cite as: 505 U.

See California Const., Art. XIIIA, \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2(a); ante, at 5. The property tax system worked much the same wayin Webster County, West Virginia. The tax assessor as-signed real property an \u00aaappraised value,\u00ba set the \u00aaassessedvalue\u00ba at half of the appraised value, then collected taxes bymultiplying the assessed value by the relevant tax rate.For property that had been sold recently, the assessor setthe appraised value at the most recent price of purchase. For property that had not been sold recently, she increasedthe appraised price by 10%, \u00aerst in 1976, then again in 1981and 1983. The assessor's methods resulted in \u00aadramatic differences in valuation between . . . recently transferred property andotherwise comparable surrounding land.\u00ba 488 U. S., at 341;cf.

Severalcoal companies that owned property in Webster County suedthe county assessor, alleging violations of both the West Vir-ginia and the United States Constitutions. The SupremeCourt of Appeals of West Virginia upheld the assessmentagainst the companies, but this Court reversed. The Allegheny Pittsburgh Court asserted that with re- spect to taxation, the Equal Protection Clause constrains theStates as follows. Although \u00aa[t]he use of a general adjust-ment as a transitional substitute for an individual reappraisalviolates no constitutional command,\u00ba the Clause requiresthat \u00aageneral adjustments [be] accurate enough over a shortperiod of time to equalize the differences in proportion be-505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 20 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Opinion of Thomas, J. tween the assessments of a class of property holders.\u00ba 488 U.

(citing Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v.Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 526\u00b1527 (1959)). Moreover, the Court stated, the Constitution and laws ofWest Virginia \u00aaprovide that all property of the kind held bypetitioners shall be taxed at a rate uniform throughout theState according to its estimated market value,\u00ba and \u00aa[t]here[was] no suggestio n... that the State may have adopted a different system in practice from that speci\u00aeed by statute.\u00ba 488 U.

(\u00aaWe are not advised of any West Virginia statute or practice which au-thorizes individual counties of the State to fashion their ownsubstantive assessment policies independently of state stat-ute\u00ba).

S. 1 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. II As the Court accurately states today, \u00aathis Court's cases\u00ba\u00d0 Allegheny Pittsburgh aside\u00d0\u00aaare clear that, unless a classi\u00aecation warrants some form of heightened reviewbecause it jeopardizes [the] exercise of a fundamental rightor categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect charac-teristic, the Equal Protection Clause requires only that theclassi\u00aecation rationally further a legitimate state interest.\u00baAnte, at 10; see also Burlington Northern R. Co. v.Ford, 504 U. S. 648, 651 (1992); Lehnhausen v.Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973). The California tax system, like most, does not involve either suspect classes or funda-mental rights, and the Court properly reviews California'sclassi\u00aecation for a rational basis. Today's review, however,differs from the review in Allegheny Pittsburgh. The Court's analysis in Allegheny Pittsburgh is suscepti- ble, I think, to at least three interpretations. The \u00aerst is theone offered by petitioner. Under her reading of the case,properties are \u00aasimilarly situated\u00ba or within the same \u00aaclass\u00bafor the purposes of the Equal Protection Clause when theyare located in roughly the same types of neighborhoods, forexample, are roughly the same size, and are roughly thesame in other, unspeci\u00aeed ways. According to petitioner,the Webster County assessor's plan violated the Equal Pro-tection Clause because she had failed to achieve a \u00aaseason-able attainment of a rough equality in tax treatment\u00ba of allthe objectively comparable properties in Webster County,presumably those with about the same acreage and aboutthe same amount of coal. Petitioner contends that Proposi-tion 13 suffers from similar \u00afaws. In 1989, she points out,\u00aathe long-time owner of a stately 7,800-square-foot, seven-bedroom mansion on a huge lot in Beverly Hills (among themost luxurious homes in one of the most expensive neighbor-hoods in Los Angeles County )... paid less property tax annually than the new homeowner of a tiny 980-square-foothome on a small lot in an extremely modest Venice neighbor-505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 22 NORDLINGER Petitioner 5; see also id.,at 7 (Petitioner's \u00aa1988 property tax assessment on her unpretentious BaldwinHills tract home is almost identical to that of a pre-1976owner of a fabulous beach-front Malibu residential propertyworth $2.1 m illion, even though her property is worth only 1/12th as much as his\u00ba). Because California not only has nottried to repair this systematic, intentional, and gross dispar-ity in taxation, but has enacted it into positive law, petitionerargues, Proposition 13 violates the Equal Protection Clause. This argument rests, in my view, on a basic misunder- standing of Allegheny Pittsburgh. The Court there pro- ceeded on the assumption of law (assumed because the par-ties did not contest it) that the initial classi\u00aecation, by theState, was constitutional, and the assumption of fact (as-sumed because the parties had so stipulated) that the proper- ties were comparable under the State's classi\u00aecation. Butcf. Glennon, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev., at 271\u00b1272 (noting thatsome of the properties contained coal and others did not).In referring to the tax treatment of a \u00aaclass of property hold-ers,\u00ba or \u00aasimilarly situated property owners,\u00ba 488 U. S., at343, the Court did not purport to review the constitutionalityof the initial classi\u00aecation, by market value, drawn by theState, as opposed to the further subclassi\u00aecation within theinitial class, by acquisition value, drawn by the assessor. In-stead, Allegheny Pittsburgh assumed that whether proper- ties or persons are similarly situated depended on state law,and not, as petitioner argues, on some neutral criteria suchas size or location that serve as proxies for market value.Under that theory, market value would be the only rational basis for classifying property. But the Equal ProtectionClause does not prescribe a single method of taxation. Wehave consistently rejected petitioner's theory, see, e. g., Ohio Oil Co. v.Conway, 281 U. S. 146 (1930); Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232 (1890), and the Court properly rejects it today.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 23 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. Allegheny Pittsburgh, then, does not prevent the State of California from classifying properties on the basis of theirvalue at acquisition, so long as the classi\u00aecation is supportedby a rational basis. I agree with the Court that it is, bothfor the reasons given by this Court, see ante, at 11\u00b114, and for the reasons given by the Supreme Court of California inAmador Valley Joint Union High School Dist. v.State Bd. of Equalization, 22 Cal. 3d 208, 583 P. 2d 1281 (1978). But the classi\u00aecation employed by the Webster County assessor,indistinguishable from California's, was rational for all thosereasons as well. In answering petitioner's argument that Allegheny Pittsburgh controls here, respondents offer a sec- ond explanation for that case. Justice Stevens gives much the same explanation, see post, at 31\u00b132, though he concludes in the end that Proposition 13, after Allegheny Pittsburgh, is unconstitutional. According to respondents, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State itself to determine which properties are sim-ilarly situated, as the State of California did here (classifyingproperties by acquisition value) and as the State of WestVirginia did in Allegheny Pittsburgh (classifying properties by market value). But once a State does so, respondentssuggest, the Equal Protection Clause requires after Alle- gheny Pittsburgh that properties in the same class be ac- corded seasonably equal treatment and not be intentionallyand systematically undervalued. Proposition 13 providesfor the assessment of properties in the same state-determined class regularly and at roughly full value; thiscontrasts with the tax scheme in Webster County, where bydividing property in the same class (by market value) into asubclass (by acquisition value), the assessor regularly under-valued the property similarly situated. This, according torespondents, made the Webster County scheme unconstitu-tional, and distinguishes Proposition 13. Respondents' reading of Allegheny Pittsburgh is, in my view, as misplaced as petitioner's; their test, for starters,505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 24 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Opinion of Thomas, J. comes with a dubious pedigree. In one of the cases cited in Allegheny Pittsburgh, Allied Stores, we upheld against an equal protection challenge a statute that exempted some cor-porations from ad valorem taxes imposed on others. Notonly does Allied Stores not even hint that the Constitution \u00aarequire[s ]...t h e seasonable attainment of a rough equality in tax treatment of similarly situated property owners,\u00ba 488U. S., at 343, we took pains there to stress a very differentproposition: \u00aaThe States have very wide discretion in the laying of their taxes. . . . Of course, the States, in the exercise oftheir taxing power, are subject to the requirements ofthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-ment. But that clause imposes no iron rule of equality,prohibiting the \u00afexibility and variety that are appro-priate to reasonable schemes of state taxation. TheState . . . is not required to resort to close distinctionsor to maintain a precise, scienti\u00aec uniformity with refer-ence to composition, use or value.\u00ba Allied Stores, 358 U. S., at 526\u00b1527. Two of the other cases cited in Allegheny Pittsburgh, Sun- day Lake Iron and Sioux City Bridge, also rejected equal protection challenges, see also Charleston Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v.Alderson, 324 U. S. 182 (1945), and the case in which the words intentional, systematic, and undervaluation \u00aerstappeared, Coulter v.Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 196 U. S. 599, 609 (1905), did not explain where the test came fromor why. It is true that we applied the rule of Coulter to strike down a tax system in Cumberland Coal, also cited in Alle- gheny Pittsburgh. Cumberland Coal, however, re\u00afects the most serious of the problems with respondents' reading ofAllegheny Pittsburgh. As respondents understand these two cases, their rule is categorical: A tax scheme violatesthe Equal Protection Clause unless it provides for \u00aathe sea-505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 25 Cite as: 505 U.

S., at 343,345. This would be so regardless of whether the inequalityor the undervaluation, which may result (as in WebsterCounty) from further classi\u00aecations of properties within aclass, is supported by a rational basis. But not since thecoming of modern equal protection jurisprudence has thisCourt supplanted the rational judgments of state representa-tives with its own notions of \u00aarough equality,\u00ba \u00aaundervalua-tion,\u00ba or \u00aafairness.\u00ba Cumberland Coal, which fails even to mention rational-basis review, con\u00aficts with our current caselaw. Allegheny Pittsburgh did not, in my view, mean to return us to the era when this Court sometimes second-guessed state tax of\u00aecials. In rejecting today respondents'reading of Allegheny Pittsburgh, the Court, as I understand it, agrees. This brings me to the third explanation for Allegheny Pittsburgh, the one offered today by the Court. The Court proceeds in what purports to be our standard equal protec-tion framework, though it reapplies an old, and to my minddiscredited, gloss to rational-basis review. The Court con-cedes that the \u00aaEqual Protection Clause does not demand forpurposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or gov-erning decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the pur-pose or rationale supporting its classi\u00aecation.\u00ba Ante, at 15 (citing United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v.Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 179 (1980)). This principle applies, the Courtacknowledges, not only to an initial classi\u00aecation but toall further classi\u00aecations within a class. \u00aaNevertheless, thisCourt's review does require that a purpose may conceivablyor `may reasonably have been the purpose and policy' of therelevant governmental decisionmaker,\u00ba the Court says, ante, at 15 (quoting Allied Stores, supra, at 528\u00b1529), and \u00aa Alle- gheny Pittsburgh was the rare case where the facts pre- cluded any plausible inference that the reason for the un-505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 26 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Opinion of Thomas, J. equal assessment practice was to achieve the bene\u00aets of an acquisition-value tax scheme,\u00ba ante, at 16. Rather than obeying the \u00aalaw of a State, generally applied,\u00ba the countyassessor had administered an \u00aaaberrational enforcement pol-icy.\u00ba 488 U. S., at 344, n. 4. See ante, at 15. According to the Court, therefore, the problem in Allegheny Pittsburgh was that the Webster County scheme, though otherwise ra-tional, was irrational because it was contrary to state law.Any rational bases underlying the acquisition-value schemewere \u00aaimplausible\u00ba (or \u00aaunreasonable\u00ba) because they weremade so by the Constitution and laws of the State of WestVirginia. That explanation, like petitioner's and respondents', is in tension with settled case law. Even if the assessor did vio-late West Virginia law (and that she did is open to question,seeIn re 1975 Tax Assessments Against Oneida Coal Co., 178 W. Va. 485, 489, 360 S. E. 2d 560, 564 (1987)), she wouldnot have violated the Equal Protection Clause. A violationof state law does not by itself constitute a violation of theFederal Constitution. We made that clear in Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1 (1944), for instance, where a candidate for state of\u00aece complained that members of the local canvass-ing board had refused to certify his name as a nominee tothe Secretary of State, thus violating an Illinois statute. Be- cause the plaintiff had not alleged, say, that the defendantshad meant to discriminate against him on racial grounds, butmerely that they had failed to comply with a statute, werejected the argument that the defendants had thereby vio-lated the Equal Protection Clause. \u00aa[N]ot every denial of a right conferred by state law involves a denial of the equal protection of the laws,even though the denial of the right to one person mayoperate to confer it on another. . . . [W]here the of\u00aecialaction purports to be in conformity to the statutory clas-si\u00aecation, an erroneous or mistaken performance of thestatutory duty, although a violation of the statute, is not505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 27 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. without more a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\u00ba Id.,at 8. See also Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v.Browning, 310 U. S. 362 (1940). The Court today promises not to have overruled Snowden, see ante, at 16, n. 8, but its disclaimer, I think, is in vain. For if, as the Court suggests, what made the assessor'smethod unreasonable was her supposed violation of statelaw, the Court's interpretation of Allegheny Pittsburgh re- casts in this case the proposition that we had earlier re-jected. See Glennon, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev., at 268\u00b1269;Cohen, 38 UCLA L. Rev., at 93\u00b194; Ely, Another Spin onAllegheny Pittsburgh, 38 UCLA L. Rev. 107, 108\u00b1109 (1990). In repudiating Snowden, moreover, the Court threatens set- tled principles not only of the Fourteenth Amendment but ofthe Eleventh. We have held that the Eleventh Amendmentbars federal courts from ordering state actors to conformto the dictates of state law. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.Halderman, 465 U. S. 89 (1984). After today, however, a plaintiff might be able to invoke federal jurisdic-tion to have state actors obey state law, for a claim that thestate actor has violated state law appears to have become aclaim that he has violated the Constitution. See Cohen,supra, at 103; Ely, supra, at 109\u00b1110 (\u00aa[B]y the Court's logic, all violations of state law\u00d0at least those violations that end(as most do) in the treatment of some people better thanothers\u00d0are theoretically convertible into violations of theEqual Protection Clause\u00ba). I understand that the Court prefers to distinguish Alle- gheny Pittsburgh, but in doing so, I think, the Court has left our equal protection jurisprudence in disarray. The analy-sis appropriate to this case is straightforward. Unless aclassi\u00aecation involves suspect classes or fundamental rights,judicial scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause demandsonly a conceivable rational basis for the challenged state dis-tinction.

During the two past decades, California property owners have enjoyed extraordinary prosperity. As the State's pop-ulation has mushroomed, so has the value of its real estate.Between 1976 and 1986 alone, the total assessed value ofCalifornia property subject to property taxation increasedtenfold. 1Simply put, those who invested in California real estate in the 1970's are among the most fortunate capitalistsin the world. Proposition 13 has provided these successful investors with a tremendous windfall and, in doing so, has created se- 1Glennon, Taxation and Equal Protection, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 261, 270, n. 49 (1990). \u00aaFor the same period, [property values in] Hawaii roseapproximately 450%; D. C. approximately 350%; and NewYork approximately 125%.\u00ba Ibid. (citing 2 U. S.

The speci\u00aec disparity that prompted petitioner to chal- lenge the constitutionality of Proposition 13 is the fact thather annual property tax bill is almost \u00aeve times as large asthat of her neighbors who own comparable homes: While herneighbors' 1989 taxes averaged less than $400, petitioner wastaxed $1,700. App. 18\u00b120. This disparity is not unusualunder Proposition 13. Indeed, some homeowners pay 17times as much in taxes as their neighbors with comparableproperty. See id.,at 76\u00b177. For vacant land, the dispari- ties may be as great as 500 to 1. App. to Pet. for Cert. A7.Moreover, as Proposition 13 controls the taxation of commer-cial property as well as residential property, the regimegreatly favors the commercial enterprises of the Squires,placing new businesses at a substantial disadvantage. As a result of Proposition 13, the Squires, who own 44% of the owner-occupied residences, paid only 25% of the totaltaxes collected from homeowners in 1989. Report of SenateCommission on Property Tax Equity and Revenue to theCalifornia State Senate 33 (1991) (Commission Report).These disparities are aggravated by \u00a7 2 of Proposition 13,which exempts from reappraisal a property owner's homeand up to $1 million of other real property when that prop- erty is transferred to a child of the owner. This exemptioncan be invoked repeatedly and inde\u00aenitely, allowing theProposition 13 windfall to be passed from generation to gen-eration. As the California Senate Commission on PropertyTax Equity and Revenue observed: 2Proposition 13 was codi\u00aeed as Article XIIIA of the California Constitu- tion; for convenience sake, however, I refer to it by its colloquial name.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 30 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Stevens, J., dissenting \u00aaThe inequity is clear. One young family buys a new home and is assessed at full market value. Anotheryoung family inherits its home, but pays taxes basedon their parents' date of acquisition even though bothhomes are of identical value. Not only does this consti-tutional provision offend a policy of equal tax treatmentfor taxpayers in similar situations, it appears to favorthe housing needs of children with homeowner-parentsover children with non-homeowner-parents. With therepeal of the state's gift and inheritance tax in 1982, therationale for this exemption is negligible.\u00ba CommissionReport 9\u00b110. The commission was too generous. To my mind, the rationale for such disparity is not merely \u00aanegligible,\u00ba it is nonexis-tent. Such a law establishes a privilege of a medieval char-acter: Two families with equal needs and equal resources aretreated differently solely because of their different heritage. In my opinion, such disparate treatment of similarly situ- ated taxpayers is arbitrary and unreasonable. Although theCourt today recognizes these gross inequities, see ante, at 7, n. 2, its analysis of the justi\u00aecation for those inequities con-sists largely of a restatement of the bene\u00aets that accrueto long-time property owners. That a law bene\u00aets thoseit bene\u00aets cannot be an adequate justi\u00aecation for severeinequalities such as those created by Proposition 13. I The standard by which we review equal protection chal- lenges to state tax regimes is well established and properlydeferential. \u00aaWhere taxation is concerned and no speci\u00aecfederal right, apart from equal protection, is imperiled, theStates have large leeway in making classi\u00aecations and draw-ing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable sys-tems of taxation.\u00ba Lehnhausen v.Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356, 359 (1973). Thus, as the Court today notes, the issue in this case is \u00aawhether the difference in505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 31 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting treatment between newer and older owners rationally fur- thers a legitimate state interest.\u00ba Ante, at 11.3 But deference is not abdication and \u00aarational-basis scru- tiny\u00ba is still scrutiny. Thus we have, on several recent occa-sions, invalidated tax schemes under such a standard of re-view. See, e. g., Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.County Comm'n of Webster Cty., 488 U. S. 336 (1989); Hooper v.Ber- nalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. (1985); Williams v.Vermont, 472 U. S. 14 (1985); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869 (1985); cf. Zobel v.Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 60\u00b161 (1982). Just three Terms ago, this Court unanimously invalidated Webster County, West Virginia's assessment scheme underrational-basis scrutiny. Webster County employed a de facto Proposition 13 assessment system: The county assessed recently purchased property on the basis of its purchaseprice but made only occasional adjustments (averaging 3\u00b14% per year) to the assessments of other properties. Just as inthis case, \u00aa[t]his approach systematically produced dramaticdifferences in valuation between . . recently transferredproperty and otherwise comparable surrounding land.\u00ba Pittsburgh, 488 S., at 341. The \u00aa `[i]ntentional systematic undervaluation,' \u00ba id., at 345, found constitutionally in\u00aerm in Allegheny Pittsburgh has been codi\u00aeed in California by Proposition 13. That thediscrimination in Allegheny Pittsburgh was de facto and the discrimination in this case de jure makes little difference. \u00aaThe purpose of the equal protection clause of the Four-teenth Amendment is to secure every person within the 3As the Court notes, ante, at 10, petitioner contends that Proposition 13 infringes on the constitutional right to travel and that, accordingly, amore searching standard of review is appropriate. There is no need toaddress that issue because the gross disparities created by Proposition 13do not pass even the most deferential standard of review. Cf. Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612, 32 NORDLINGER v.HAHN jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrim- ination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents. \u00ba Sunday Lake Iron Co. v.Township of Wake\u00aeeld, 247 U. S. 350, 352\u00b1353 (1918) (emphasis added). If anything, the in-equality created by Proposition 13 is constitutionally moreproblematic because it is the product of a statewide policyrather than the result of an individual assessor's mal-administration. Nor can Allegheny Pittsburgh be distinguished because West Virginia law established a market-value assessment re- gime. Webster County's scheme was constitutionally in-valid not because it was a departure from state law, but be- cause it involved the relative \u00aa `systematic undervaluation . . .[of] property \u00ba (as that class was de\u00aened by state law). Allegheny Pittsburgh, 488 U. S., at 345 (em- phasis added). Our decisions have established that theEqual Protection Clause is offended as much by the arbitrarydelineation of classes of property (as in this case) as by thearbitrary treatment of properties within the same class (asinAllegheny Pittsburgh ). See Brown-Forman Co. v.Ken- tucky, 217 U. S. 563, 573 (1910); Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board of Revision of Tax Assessments of Greene County,284 U. S. 23, 28\u00b130 (1931). Thus, if our unanimous holdinginAllegheny Pittsburgh was sound\u00d0and I remain convinced that it was\u00d0it follows inexorably that Proposition 13, likeWebster County's assessment scheme, violates the EqualProtection Clause. Indeed, in my opinion, statewide dis-crimination is far more invidious than a local aberration thatcreates a tax disparity. The States, of course, have broad power to classify prop- erty in their taxing schemes and if the \u00aaclassi\u00aecation is nei-ther capricious nor arbitrary, and rests upon some reasonableconsideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of theequal protection of the law.\u00ba Brown-Forman Co. v.Ken- tucky, 217 U.

S.,at 344. Consistent with this standard, the Court has long upheld tax classes based on the taxpayer's ability to pay, see, e. g., Fox v.Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey, 294 U. S. 87, 101 (1935); the nature (tangible or intangible) of the property, see, e. g., Klein v.Board of Tax Supervisors of Jefferson County, 282 U. S. 19, 23\u00b124 (1930); the use of the property, see, e. g., Clark v.Kansas City, 176 U. S. 114 (1900); and the status (corporate or individual) of the property owner, see,e. g., Lehnhausen v.Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U. S. 356 (1973). Proposition 13 employs none of these familiarclassi\u00aecations. Instead, it classi\u00aees property based on itsnominal purchase price: All property purchased for the sameprice is taxed the same amount (leaving aside the 2% annualadjustment). That this scheme can be named (an \u00aaacquisi-tion value\u00ba system) does not render it any less arbitrary orunreasonable. Under Proposition 13, a majestic estate pur-chased for $150,000 in 1975 (and now worth more than $2million) is placed in the same tax class as a humble cottage purchased today for $150,000. The only feature those twoproperties have in common is that somewhere, sometime asale contract for each was executed that contained the price\u00aa$150,000.\u00ba Particularly in an environment of phenomenalreal property appreciation, to classify property based on itspurchase price is \u00aapalpably arbitrary.\u00ba Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v.Bowers, 358 U.

If the goal of the discriminatory classi\u00aecation is not inde- pendent from the policy itself, \u00aaeach choice [of classi\u00aecation]will import its own goal, each goal will count as acceptable,and the requirement of a `rational' choice-goal relation will be satis\u00aeed by the very making of the choice.\u00ba Ely, Legisla-tive and Administrative Motivation in Constitutional Law, 79Yale L.

Nonetheless, in some cases the underinclusiveness or the overinclusivenessof a classi\u00aecation will be so severe that it cannot be said thatthe legislative distinction \u00aarationally furthers\u00ba the positedstate interest. 4See, e. g., Jimenez v.Weinberger, 417 U.

It is beyond question that \u00aainhibit[ing the] displacement oflower income families by the forces of gentri\u00aecation,\u00ba ante, at 12, is a legitimate state interest; the central issue iswhether the disparate treatment of earlier and later purchas-ersrationally furthers this goal. Here the Court offers not an analysis, but only a conclusion: \u00aaBy permitting older own-ers to pay progressively less in taxes than new owners ofcomparable property, [Proposition 13] rationally furthersthis interest.\u00ba Ibid. I disagree. In my opinion, Proposition 13 sweeps too broadly and operates too indiscriminately to \u00aarationally fur-ther\u00ba the State's interest in neighborhood preservation.

It cannot be said thatthe legitimate state interest in preserving neighborhood character is \u00aarationally furthered\u00ba by tax bene\u00aets for ownersof commercial, industrial, vacant, and other nonresidentialproperties. 6It is just short of absurd to conclude that the legitimate state interest in protecting a relatively small 5As pointed out in the Commission Report, California has addressed this speci\u00aec problem with speci\u00aec legislation.

That, as the Court recognizes, Proposition13 discourages changes of ownership means that the law creates an imped-iment to the transfer and development of such property no matter howsocially desirable its improvement might be. It is equally plain that thecompetitive advantage enjoyed by the Squires who own commercial prop-erty is wholly unjusti\u00aeed. There is no rational state interest in providingthose entrepreneurs with a special privilege that tends to discourage oth-erwise desirable transfers of income-producing property. In a free econ-omy, the entry of new competitors should be encouraged, not arbitrarilyhampered by unfavorable tax treatment.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 37 Cite as: 505 U.

The Court's conclusion is unsound not only because of the lack of numerical \u00aet between the posited state interest andProposition 13's inequities but also because of the lack of log-ical \u00aet between ends and means. Although the State mayhave a valid interest in preserving some neighborhoods, 8 Proposition 13 not only \u00aainhibit[s the] displacement\u00ba of set-tled families, it also inhibits the transfer of unimproved land,abandoned buildings, and substandard uses. Thus, contraryto the Court's suggestion, Proposition 13 is not like a zoningsystem. A zoning system functions by recognizing differentuses of property and treating those different uses differently.SeeEuclid v.Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S., at 388\u00b1390. Prop- osition 13 treats all property alike, giving allowners tax breaks, and discouraging the transfer or improvement of all property\u00d0the developed and the dilapidated, the neighborlyand the nuisance. In short, although I agree with the Court that \u00aaneighbor- hood preservation\u00ba is a legitimate state interest, I cannotagree that a tax windfall for all persons who purchased prop-erty before 1978 rationally furthers that interest. To my mind, Proposition 13 is too blunt a tool to accomplish such a 7Brief for California Assessors' Association as Amicus Curiae 2. 8The ambiguous character of this interest is illustrated by the options faced by a married couple that owns a three- or four-bedroom home thatsuited their family needs while their children lived at home. After thechildren have moved out, increased taxes and maintenance expenseswould\u00d0absent Proposition 13\u00d0tend to motivate the sale of the home to ayounger family needing a home of that size, or perhaps the rental of aroom or two to generate the income necessary to pay taxes. Proposition13, however, subsidizes the wasteful retention of unused housing capacity,making the sale of the home unwise and the rental of the extra spaceunnecessary.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 38 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Stevens, J., dissenting specialized goal. The severe inequalities created by Propo- sition 13 cannot be justi\u00aeed by such an interest.9 The second state interest identi\u00aeed by the Court is the \u00aareliance interests\u00ba of the earlier purchasers. Here I \u00aendthe Court's reasoning dif\u00aecult to follow. Although the pro-tection of reasonable reliance interests is a legitimate gov-ernmental purpose, see Heckler v.Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 746 (1984), this case does not implicate such interests. Areliance interest is created when an individual justi\u00aeablyacts under the assumption that an existing legal conditionwill persist; thus reliance interests are most often implicatedwhen the government provides some bene\u00aet and then actsto eliminate the bene\u00aet. See, e. g., New Orleans v.Dukes, 427 U. S. 297 (1976). In this case, those who purchasedproperty before Proposition 13 was enacted received no as-surances that assessments would only increase at a limitedrate; indeed, to the contrary, many purchased property in the hope that property values (and assessments) would ap-preciate substantially and quickly. It cannot be said, there-fore, that the earlier purchasers of property somehow havea reliance interest in limited tax increases. Perhaps what the Court means is that post-Proposition 13 purchasers have less reliance interests than pre-Proposition 9Respondents contend that the inequities created by Proposition 13 are justi\u00aeed by the State's interest in protecting property owners from taxa-tion on unrealized appreciation. The California Supreme Court relied ona similar state interest. See Amador Valley Joint Union High School Dist. v.State Bd. of Equalization, 22 Cal. 3d 208, 236\u00b1238, 583 P. 2d 1281, 1309\u00b11311 (1978). This argument is closely related to the Court's reason-ing concerning \u00aaneighborhood preservation\u00ba; respondents claim the Statehas an interest in preventing the situation in which \u00aaskyrocketing realestate prices . . . driv[e] property taxes beyond some taxpayers' ability topay.\u00ba Brief for Respondents 19. As demonstrated above, whatever theconnection between acquisition price and \u00aaability to pay,\u00ba a blanket taxwindfall for all early purchasers of property (and their descendants) issimply too overinclusive to OPINPGT 39 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting 13 purchasers. The Court reasons that the State may tax earlier and later purchasers differently because \u00aaan existing owner rationally may be thought to have vested expectations in his property or home that aremore deserving of protection than the anticipatory ex-pectations of a new owner at the point of purchase. Anew owner has full information about the scope of futuretax liability before acquiring the property, and if hethinks the future tax burden is too demanding, he candecide not to complete the purchase at all. By contrast,the existing owner, already saddled with his purchase,does not have the option of deciding not to buy his homeif taxes become prohibitively high.\u00ba Ante, at 12\u00b113. 10 This simply restates the effects of Proposition 13. A pre- Proposition 13 owner has \u00aavested expectations\u00ba in reducedtaxes only because Proposition 13 gave her such expecta- tions; a later purchaser has no such expectations becauseProposition 13 does not provide her such expectations. Butthe same can be said of any arbitrary protection for an exist-ing class of taxpayers. Consider a law that establishes thathomes with even street numbers would be taxed at twice therate of homes with odd street numbers. It is certainly truethat the even-numbered homeowners could not decide to \u00aaun-purchase\u00ba their homes and that those considering buying aneven-numbered home would know that it came with an extratax burden, but certainly that would not justify the arbitraryimposition of disparate tax burdens based on house numbers.So it is in this case. Proposition 13 provides a bene\u00aet forearlier purchasers and imposes a burden on later purchasers.To say that the later purchasers know what they are gettinginto does not answer the critical question: Is it reasonable 10The Court's sympathetic reference to \u00aaexisting owner[s] already sad- dled\u00ba with their property should not obscure the fact that these earlypurchasers have already seen their property increase in value more thantenfold.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 40 NORDLINGER v.HAHN Stevens, J., dissenting and constitutional to tax early purchasers less than late pur- chasers when at the time of taxation their properties arecomparable? This question the Court does not answer. Distilled to its essence, the Court seems to be saying that earlier purchasers can bene\u00aet under Proposition 13 becauseearlier purchasers bene\u00aet under Proposition 13. If, how-ever, a law creates a disparity, the State's interest preserv-ing that disparity cannot be a \u00aalegitimate state interest\u00ba jus- tifying that inequity. As noted above, a statute's disparatetreatment must be justi\u00aeed by a purpose distinct from the very effects created by that statute. Thus, I disagree with the Court that the severe inequities wrought by Proposition13 can be justi\u00aeed by what the Court calls the \u00aareliance in-terests\u00ba of those who bene\u00aet from that scheme. 11 In my opinion, it is irrational to treat similarly situated persons differently on the basis of the date they joined theclass of property owners. Until today, I would have thoughtthis proposition far from controversial. In Zobel v.Wil- liams, 457 U. S. 55 (1982), we ruled that Alaska's program of distributing cash dividends on the basis of the recipient'syears of residency in the State violated the Equal ProtectionClause. The Court wrote: \u00aaIf the states can make the amount of a cash dividend depend on length of residence, what would precludevarying university tuition on a sliding scale based onyears of residence\u00d0or even limiting access of \u00aenite pub- 11Respondents, drawing on the analysis of the California Supreme Court, contend that the inequities created by Proposition 13 are also justi-\u00aeed by the State's interest in \u00aapermitting the taxpayer to make morecareful and accurate predictions of future tax liability.\u00ba Amador Valley, 22 Cal. 3d, at 239, 583 P. 2d, at 1312. This analysis suffers from the samein\u00aermity as the Court's \u00aareliance\u00ba analysis. I agree that Proposition 13permits greater predictability of tax liability; the relevant question, how-ever, is whether the inequities between earlier and later purchasers cre-ated by Proposition 13 can be justi\u00aeed by something other than the bene\u00aetto the early purchasers. I do not believe that they can.505us1$94N 07-15-96 22:52:56 PAGES OPINPGT 41 Cite as: 505 U.

It would permitthe states to divide citizens into expanding numbersof permanent classes. Such a result would be clearlyimpermissible.\u00ba Id., at 64 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). Similarly, the Court invalidated on equal protection grounds New Mexico's policy of providing a permanent taxexemption for Vietnam veterans who had been state resi-dents before May 8, 1976, but not to more recent arrivals.Hooper v.Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612 (1985). The Court expressly rejected the State's claim that it had alegitimate interest in providing special rewards to veteranswho lived in the State before 1976 and concluded that \u00aa[n]ei-ther the Equal Protection Clause, nor this Court's prece-dents, permit the State to prefer established resident veter-ans over newcomers in the retroactive apportionment of aneconomic bene\u00aet.\u00ba Id.,at 623. As these decisions demonstrate, the selective provision of bene\u00aets based on the timing of one's membership in a class(whether that class be the class of residents or the classof property owners) is rarely a \u00aalegitimate state interest.\u00baSimilarly situated neighbors have an equal right to sharein the bene\u00aets of local government. It would obviously beunconstitutional to provide one with more or better \u00aere orpolice protection than the other; it is just as plainly unconsti-tutional to require one to pay \u00aeve times as much in propertytaxes as the other for the same government services. In myopinion, the severe inequalities created by Proposition 13 arearbitrary and unreasonable and do not rationally further alegitimate state interest. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT 42 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM et al. certiorari to the supreme court of georgia No. 91\u00b1372.

The Georgia Su-preme Court af\u00aermed, distinguishing Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614\u00d0in which this Court held that private litigants cannot exercise peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner\u00d0on theground that it involved civil litigants rather than criminal defendants. Held: The Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the ground of race in the exercise of pe-remptory challenges. Pp. 46\u00b159. (a) The exercise of racially discriminatory peremptory challenges of- fends the Equal Protection Clause when the offending challenges aremade by the State, Batson v.Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79; Powers v.Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, and, in civil cases, when they are made by private litigants,Edmonson, supra. Whether the prohibition should be extended to dis- criminatory challenges made by a criminal defendant turns upon thefollowing four-factor analysis. Pp. 46\u00b148. (b) A criminal defendant's racially discriminatory exercise of peremp- tory challenges in\u00aficts the harms addressed by Batson. Regardless of whether it is the State or the defense who invokes them, discriminatorychallenges harm the individual juror by subjecting him to open and pub-lic racial discrimination and harm the community by undermining publiccon\u00aedence in this country's system of justice. Pp. 48\u00b150. (c) A criminal defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges consti- tutes state action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause under theanalytical framework summarized in Lugar v.Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922. Respondents' argument that the adversarial relationship be-tween the defendant and the prosecution negates a peremptory chal-lenge's governmental character is rejected. Unlike other actions takenin support of a defendant's defense, the exercise of a peremptory chal-lenge determines the composition of a governmental body. The factthat a defendant exercises a peremptory challenge to further his inter-est in acquittal does not con\u00afict with a \u00aending of state action, since505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT 43 Cite as: 505 U.

(d) The State has third-party standing to challenge a defendant's dis- criminatory use of peremptory challenges, since it suffers a concreteinjury when the fairness and the integrity of its own judicial process isundermined; since, as the representative of all its citizens, it has a closerelation to potential jurors; and since the barriers to suit by an excludedjuror are daunting. See Powers, 499 U. S., at 411, 413, 414. Pp. 55\u00b156. (e) A prohibition against the discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges does not violate a criminal defendant's constitutional rights.It is an affront to justice to argue that the right to a fair trial includesthe right to discriminate against a group of citizens based upon theirrace. Nor does the prohibition violate the Sixth Amendment right tothe effective assistance of counsel, since counsel can normally explainthe reasons for peremptory challenges without revealing strategy orcon\u00aedential communication, and since neither the Sixth Amendment northe attorney-client privilege gives a defendant the right to carry outthrough counsel an unlawful course of conduct. In addition, the prohibi-tion does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by a jurythat is impartial with respect to both parties. Removing a juror whomthe defendant believes harbors racial prejudice is different from exercis-ing a peremptory challenge to discriminate invidiously against jurors onaccount of race.

Shortly afterthe events, a lea\u00afet was widely distributed in the localAfrican-American community reporting the assault andurging community residents not to patronize respondents'business. Before jury selection began, the prosecution moved to pro- hibit respondents from exercising peremptory challenges in *Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were \u00aeled for the Criminal Jus- tice Legal Foundation by Kent Scheidegger and Charles L.

The State explained that it expected to show that the victims' race was a factor in thealleged assault. According to the State, counsel for re-spondents had indicated a clear intention to use peremptorystrikes in a racially discriminatory manner, arguing that thecircumstances of their case gave them the right to excludeAfrican-American citizens from participating as jurors in thetrial. Observing that 43 percent of the county's populationis African-American, the State contended that, if a statis-tically representative panel is assembled for jury selection,18 of the potential 42 jurors would be African-American. 1 With 20 peremptory challenges, respondents therefore wouldbe able to remove all the African-American potential jurors. 2 Relying on Batson v.Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the Sixth Amendment, and the Georgia Constitution, the State soughtan order providing that, if it succeeded in making out a primafacie case of racial discrimination by respondents, the latterwould be required to articulate a racially neutral explanationfor peremptory challenges. The trial judge denied the State's motion, holding that \u00aa[n]either Georgia nor federal law prohibits criminal defend-ants from exercising peremptory strikes in a racially dis-criminatory manner.\u00ba App. 14. The issue was certi\u00aeed forimmediate appeal. Id.,at 15 and 18. The Supreme Court of Georgia, by a 4-to-3 vote, af\u00aermed the trial court's ruling. 261 Ga. 473, 405 S.

We granted certiorari to resolve a question left open by our prior cases\u00d0whether the Constitution prohibits a crimi-nal defendant from engaging in purposeful racial discrimina-tion in the exercise of peremptory challenges. 3502 U. S. 937 (1991). II Over the last century, in an almost unbroken chain of deci- sions, this Court gradually has abolished race as a consider-ation for jury service. In Strauder v.West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880), the Court invalidated a state statute provid-ing that only white men could serve as jurors. While stat-ing that a defendant has no right to a \u00aapetit jury composedin whole or in part of persons of his own race,\u00ba id.,at 305, the Court held that a defendant does have the right to betried by a jury whose members are selected by nondiscrimi-natory criteria. See also Neal v.Delaware, 103 U. S. 370, 3The Ninth Circuit recently has prohibited criminal defendants from exercising peremptory challenges on the basis of gender. United States v.De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433 (1992) (en banc). Although the panel decision now has been vacated by the granting of rehearing en banc, a Fifth Circuitpanel has held that criminal defendants may not exercise peremptorystrikes in a racially discriminatory manner.

S. 202 (1965), the Court was confronted with the question whether an African-Americandefendant was denied equal protection by the State's exer-cise of peremptory challenges to exclude members of his racefrom the petit jury. Id., at 209\u00b1210. Although the Court rejected the defendant's attempt to establish an equal pro-tection claim premised solely on the pattern of jury strikesin his own case, it acknowledged that proof of systematicexclusion of African-Americans through the use of perempto-ries over a period of time might establish such a violation.Id.,at 224\u00b1228. InBatson v.Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the Court dis- carded Swain 's evidentiary formulation. The Batson Court held that a defendant may establish a prima facie case ofpurposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury basedsolely on the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challengesat the defendant's trial. Id., at 87. \u00aaOnce the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challengingblack jurors.\u00ba Id.,at 97. 4 Last Term this Court applied the Batson framework in two other contexts.

Justice Marshall agreed, stating: \u00aa[O]ur criminal justice system `requires not only freedom from any bias againstthe accused, but also from any prejudice against his prosecution. Be-tween him and the state the scales are to be evenly held.' Hayes v.Mis- souri, 120 U. 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT 48 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM Opinion of the Court on the basis of race. In Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991), the Court decided that in a civil case,private litigants cannot exercise their peremptory strikes ina racially discriminatory manner. 5 In deciding whether the Constitution prohibits criminal defendants from exercising racially discriminatory peremp-tory challenges, we must answer four questions. First,whether a criminal defendant's exercise of peremptory chal-lenges in a racially discriminatory manner in\u00aficts the harmsaddressed by Batson. Second, whether the exercise of peremptory challenges by a criminal defendant constitutesstate action. Third, whether prosecutors have standing toraise this constitutional challenge. And fourth, whether theconstitutional rights of a criminal defendant nonetheless pre-clude the extension of our precedents to this case. III A The majority in Powers recognized that \u00aa Batson `was de- signed \u00aato serve multiple ends,\u00ba ' only one of which was toprotect individual defendants from discrimination in the se-lection of jurors.\u00ba 499 U. S., at 406. As in Powers and Ed- monson, the extension of Batson in this context is designed to remedy the harm done to the \u00aadignity of persons\u00ba and tothe \u00aaintegrity of the courts.\u00ba Powers, 499 U. S., at 402. As long ago as Strauder, this Court recognized that deny- ing a person participation in jury service on account of hisrace unconstitutionally discriminates against the excludedjuror. 100 U. S., at 308. See also Batson, 476 U. S., at 87. While \u00aa[a]n individual juror does not have a right to sit onany particular petit jury ,...h eo rs h e does possess the right not to be excluded from one on account of race.\u00ba Powers, 5In his dissent in Edmonson, Justice Scalia stated that the effect of that decision logically must apply to defendants in criminal prosecutions.500 U. S., at 644.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT 49 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) Opinion of the Court 499 U. S., at 409. Regardless of who invokes the discrimina- tory challenge, there can be no doubt that the harm is thesame\u00d0in all cases, the juror is subjected to open and publicracial discrimination. But \u00aa[t]he harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that in\u00aficted on the defendant and the excluded jurorto touch the entire community.\u00ba Batson, 476 U. S., at 87. One of the goals of our jury system is \u00aato impress upon thecriminal defendant and the community as a whole that a ver-dict of conviction or acquittal is given in accordance withthe law by persons who are fair.\u00ba Powers, 499 U. S., at 413. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude African-Americans from juries undermine that public con\u00aedence\u00d0aswell they should. \u00aaThe overt wrong, often apparent to theentire jury panel, casts doubt over the obligation of the par-ties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the lawthroughout the trial of the cause.\u00ba Id.,at 412. See gener- ally Underwood, Ending Race Discrimination in Jury Selec-tion: Whose Right Is It, Anyway?, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 725,748\u00b1750 (1992). The need for public con\u00aedence is especially high in cases involving race-related crimes. In such cases, emotions inthe affected community will inevitably be heated and vola-tile. Public con\u00aedence in the integrity of the criminal jus-tice system is essential for preserving community peace intrials involving race-related crimes. See Alschuler, The Su-preme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Chal-lenges, and the Review of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev.153, 195\u00b1196 (1989) (describing two trials in Miami, Fla., inwhich all African-American jurors were peremptorily struckby white defendants accused of racial beating, and the publicoutrage and riots that followed the defendants' acquittal). \u00aa[B]e it at the hands of the State or the defense,\u00ba if a court allows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, \u00aa[it] is [a]willing par ticipant in a scheme that could only undermine the very foundation of our system of justice\u00d0our citizens'505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT 50 GEORGIA the Court con\u00aedence in it.\u00ba State v.Alvarado, 221 N. J. Super. 324, 328, 534 A. 2d 440, 442 (1987). Just as public con\u00aedence incriminal justice is undermined by a conviction in a trialwhere racial discrimination has occurred in jury selection, sois public con\u00aedence undermined where a defendant, assistedby racially discriminatory peremptory strikes, obtains anacquittal. 6 B The fact that a defendant's use of discriminatory peremp- tory challenges harms the jurors and the community doesnot end our equal protection inquiry. Racial discrimination,although repugnant in all contexts, violates the Constitutiononly when it is attributable to state action. See Moose Lodge No. 107 v.Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 172 (1972). Thus, the second question that must be answered is whether a criminaldefendant's exercise of a peremptory challenge constitutesstate action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. Until Edmonson, the cases decided by this Court that pre- sented the problem of racially discriminatory peremptorychallenges involved assertions of discrimination by a prose-cutor, a quintessential state actor. In Edmonson, by con- trast, the contested peremptory challenges were exercisedby a private defendant in a civil action. In order to deter-mine whether state action was present in that setting, the 6The experience of many state jurisdictions has led to the recognition that a race-based peremptory challenge, regardless of who exercises it,harms not only the challenged juror, but the entire community. Actingpursuant to their state constitutions, state courts have ruled that criminaldefendants have no greater license to violate the equal protection rightsof prospective jurors than have prosecutors. See, e. g., State v.Levinson, 71 Haw. 492, 795 P. 2d 845 (1990); People v.Kern, 149 App. Div. 2d 187, 545 N. Y . S. 2d 4 (1989), aff'd, 75 N. Y . N. Y . S. 2d 647 (1990);State v.Alvarado, 221 N. J.

S. 922 (1982).7 The \u00aerst inquiry is \u00aawhether the claimed [constitutional] deprivation has resulted from the exercise of a right or privi-lege having its source in state authority.\u00ba Id., at 939. \u00aaThere can be no question\u00ba that peremptory challenges sat-isfy this \u00aerst requirement, as they \u00aaare permitted only whenthe government, by statute or decisional law, deems it appro-priate to allow parties to exclude a given number of personswho otherwise would satisfy the requirements for service onthe petit jury.\u00ba Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 620. As in Ed- monson, a Georgia defendant's right to exercise peremptory challenges and the scope of that right are established by aprovision of state law. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 15\u00b112\u00b1165 (1990). The second inquiry is whether the private party charged with the deprivation can be described as a state actor. SeeLugar, 457 U. S., at 941\u00b1942. In resolving that issue, the Court in Edmonson found it useful to apply three principles: (1) \u00aathe extent to which the actor relies on governmentalassistance and bene\u00aets\u00ba; (2) \u00aawhether the actor is performinga traditional governmental function\u00ba; and (3) \u00aawhether theinjury caused is aggravated in a unique way by the incidentsof governmental authority.\u00ba 500 U. S., at 621\u00b1622. As to the \u00aerst principle, the Edmonson Court found that the peremptory challenge system, as well as the jury sys-tem as a whole, \u00aasimply could not exist\u00ba without the \u00aaovert,signi\u00aecant participation of the government.\u00ba Id., at 622.

At court, potential jurors areplaced in panels in order to facilitate examination by counsel,\u00a7 15\u00b112\u00b1131; they are administered an oath, \u00a7 15\u00b112\u00b1132; theyare questioned on voir dire to determine whether they are impartial, \u00a7 15\u00b112\u00b1164; and they are subject to challenge forcause, \u00a7 15\u00b112\u00b1163. In light of these procedures, the defendant in a Georgia criminal case relies on \u00aagovernmental assistance and bene-\u00aets\u00ba that are equivalent to those found in the civil contextinEdmonson. \u00aaBy enforcing a discriminatory peremptory challenge, the Court `has . . . elected to place its power,property and prestige behind the [alleged] discrimination.' \u00baEdmonson, 500 U. S., at 624 (citation omitted). In regard to the second principle, the Court in Edmonson found that peremptory challenges perform a traditional func-tion of the government: \u00aaTheir sole purpose is to permitlitigants to assist the government in the selection of an im-partial trier of fact.\u00ba Id., at 620. And, as the Edmonson Court recognized, the jury system in turn \u00aaperforms the crit-ical governmental functions of guarding the rights of liti-gants and `ensur[ing] continued acceptance of the laws by allof the people' \u00ba Id., at 624 (citation omitted). These same conclusions apply with even greater force in the criminal con-text because the selection of a jury in a criminal case ful\u00aellsa unique and constitutionally compelled governmental func-tion. Compare Duncan v.Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968) (making Sixth Amendment applicable to States throughFourteenth Amendment), with Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co.v.Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211 (1916) (States do not have a constitutional obligation to provide a jury trial in civil cases).Cf.West v.Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 53, n. 10, 57 (1988) (private505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 53 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) Opinion of the Court physician hired by State to provide medical care to prisoners was state actor because doctor was hired to ful\u00aell State'sconstitutional obligation to attend to necessary medical careof prison inmates). The State cannot avoid its constitutionalresponsibilities by delegating a public function to privateparties. Cf. Ter ry v.Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953) (private political party's determination of quali\u00aecations for primaryvoters held to constitute state action). Finally, the Edmonson Court indicated that the courtroom setting in which the peremptory challenge is exercised inten-si\u00aees the harmful effects of the private litigant's discrimina-tory act and contributes to its characterization as state ac-tion. These concerns are equally present in the context ofa criminal trial. Regardless of who precipitated the jurors'removal, the perception and the reality in a criminal trialwill be that the court has excused jurors based on race, anoutcome that will be attributed to the State. 8 Respondents nonetheless contend that the adversarial re- lationship between the defendant and the prosecution ne-gates the governmental character of the peremptory chal-lenge. Respondents rely on Polk County v.Dodson, 454 U. S. 312 (1981), in which a defendant sued, under 42 U. S. C.\u00a7 1983, the public defender who represented him. The de-fendant claimed that the public defender had violated hisconstitutional rights in fa iling to provide adequate represen- tation. This Court determined that a public defender doesnot qualify as a state actor when engaged in his general rep-resentation of a criminal defendant. 9 8Indeed, it is common practice not to reveal the identity of the challeng- ing party to the jurors and potential jurors, thus enhancing the perceptionthat it is the court that has rejected them. See Underwood, Ending RaceDiscrimination in Jury Selection: Whose Right Is It, Anyway?, 92 Colum.L. Rev. 725, 751, n. 117 (1992). 9Although Polk County determined whether or not the public defend- er's actions were under color of state law, as opposed to whether or notthey constituted state action, this Court subsequently has held that the505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 54 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM Opinion of the Court Polk County did not hold that the adversarial relationship of a public defender with the State precludes a \u00aendingof state action\u00d0it held that this adversarial relationshipprevented the attorney's public employment from alone being suf\u00aecient to support a \u00aending of state action. In-stead, the determination whether a public defender is a stateactor for a particular purpose depends on the nature andcontext of the function he is performing. For example, inBranti v.Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980), this Court held that a public defender, in making personnel decisions on behalfof the State, is a state actor who must comply with consti-tutional requirements. And the Polk County Court itself noted, without deciding, that a public defender may actunder color of state law while performing certain administra-tive, and possibly investigative, functions. See 454 U. S., at325. The exercise of a peremptory challenge differs signi\u00ae- cantly from other actions taken in support of a defendant'sdefense. In exercising a peremptory challenge, a criminaldefendant is wielding the power to choose a quintessentialgovernmental body\u00d0indeed, the institution of governmenton which our judicial system depends. Thus, as we held inEdmonson, when \u00aaa government confers on a private body the power to choose the government's employees or of\u00aecials,the private body will be bound by the constitutional mandateof race neutrality.\u00ba 500 U. S., at 625. Lastly, the fact that a defendant exercises a peremptory challenge to further his interest in acquittal does not con\u00afictwith a \u00aending of state action. Whenever a private actor'sconduct is deemed \u00aafairly attributable\u00ba to the government, itis likely that private motives will have animated the actor'sdecision. Indeed, in Edmonson, the Court recognized that the private party's exercise of peremptory challenges consti- two inquiries are the same, see, e. g., Rendell-Baker v.Kohn, 457 U. S. 830, 838 (1982), and has speci\u00aecally extended Polk County 's reasoning to state- action cases, see Blum v.Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1009, n. 20 (1982).505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 55 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) Opinion of the Court tuted state action, even though the motive underlying the exercise of the peremptory challenge may be to protect aprivate interest. See id.,at 626. 10 C Having held that a defendant's discriminatory exercise of a peremptory challenge is a violation of equal protection, wemove to the question whether the State has standing to chal-lenge a defendant's discriminatory use of peremptory chal-lenges. In Powers, 499 U. S., at 416, this Court held that a white criminal defendant has standing to raise the equalprotection rights of black jurors wrongfully excluded fromjury service. While third-party standing is a limited excep-tion, the Powers Court recognized that a litigant may raise a claim on behalf of a third party if the litigant can demon-strate that he has suffered a concrete injury, that he has aclose relation to the third party, and that there exists somehindrance to the third party's ability to protect its own in-terests. Id., at 411. In Edmonson, the Court applied the same analysis in deciding that civil litigants had standing toraise the equal protection rights of jurors excluded on thebasis of their race. In applying the \u00aerst prong of its standing analysis, the Powers Court found that a criminal defendant suffered cog- 10Numerous commentators similarly have concluded that a defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action.

S., at 411 (citation omitted). In Edmonson, this Court found that these harms were not limited to the crimi-nal sphere. 500 U. S., at 630. Surely, a State suffers a simi-lar injury when the fairness and integrity of its own judicialprocess is undermined. In applying the second prong of its standing analysis, the Powers Court held that voir dire permits a defendant to \u00aaestablish a relation, if not a bond of trust, with the jurors,\u00baa relation that \u00aacontinues throughout the entire trial.\u00ba 499U. S., at 413. \u00aaExclusion of a juror on the basis of racesevers that relation in an invidious way.\u00ba Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 629. The State's relation to potential jurors in this case is closer than the relationships approved in Powers and Edmonson. As the representative of all its citizens, the State is the logi-cal and proper party to assert the invasion of the constitu-tional rights of the excluded jurors in a criminal trial. In-deed, the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the State to denypersons within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws. In applying the \u00aenal prong of its standing analysis, the Powers Court recognized that, although individuals excluded from jury service on the basis of race have a right to bringsuit on their own behalf, the \u00aabarriers to a suit by an ex-cluded juror are daunting.\u00ba 499 U. S., at 414. See alsoEdmonson, 500 U. S., at 629. The barriers are no less formi- dable in this context. See Note, Discrimination by the De-fense: Peremptory Challenges after Batson v. Kentucky, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 355, 367 (1988); Underwood, 92 Colum. L.Rev., at 757 (summarizing barriers to suit by excluded juror).Accordingly, we hold that the State has standing to assertthe excluded jurors' rights.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 57 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) Opinion of the Court D The \u00aenal question is whether the interests served by Bat- sonmust give way to the rights of a criminal defendant. As a preliminary matter, it is important to recall that peremp-tory challenges are not constitutionally protected fundamen-tal rights; rather, they are but one state-created means tothe constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial. This Court repeatedly has stated that the right to a peremp-tory challenge may be withheld altogether without impairingthe constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury and a fairtrial. See Frazier v.United States, 335 U. S. 497, 505, n. 11 (1948); United States v.Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 145 (1936); Stil- sonv.United States, 250 U. S. 583, 586 (1919); see also Swain, 380 U. S., at 219. Yet i n Swain, the Court reviewed the \u00aavery old creden- tials,\u00ba id.,at 212, of the peremptory challenge and noted the \u00aalong and widely held belief that the peremptory challengeis a necessary part of trial by jury,\u00ba id.,at 219; see id.,at 212\u00b1219. This Court likewise has recognized that \u00aathe roleof litigants in determining the jury's composition providesone reason for wide acceptance of the jury system and of itsverdicts.\u00ba Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 630. We do not believe that this decision will undermine the contribution of the peremptory challenge to the administra-tion of justice. Nonetheless, \u00aaif race stereotypes are theprice for acceptance of a jury panel as fair,\u00ba we reaf\u00aermtoday that such a \u00aaprice is too high to meet the standard ofthe Constitution.\u00ba Id., at 630. Defense counsel is limited to \u00aalegitimate, lawful conduct.\u00ba Nix v.Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 166 (1986) (defense counsel does not render ineffectiveassistance when he informs his client that he would disclosethe client's perjury to the court and move to withdraw fromrepresentation). It is an affront to justice to argue that afair trial includes the right to discriminate against a groupof citizens based upon their race.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 58 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM Opinion of the Court Nor does a prohibition of the exercise of discriminatory peremptory challenges violate a defendant's Sixth Amend-ment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Counselcan ordinarily explain the reasons for peremptory challengeswithout revealing anything about trial strategy or any con-\u00aedential client communications. In the rare case in whichthe explanation for a challenge would entail con\u00aedential com-munications or reveal trial strategy, an in camera discussion can be arranged. See United States v.Zolin, 491 U. S. 554 (1989); cf. Batson, 476 U. S., at 97 (expressing con\u00aedence that trial judges can develop procedures to implement the Court's holding). In any event, neither the Sixth Amendment rightnor the attorney-client privilege gives a criminal defendantthe right to carry out through counsel an unlawful course ofconduct. See Nix, 475 U. S., at 166; Zolin, 491 U. S., at 562\u00b1 563. See Swift, Defendants, Racism and the PeremptoryChallenge, 22 Colum. Hum. Rights L. Rev. 177, 207\u00b1208(1991). Lastly, a prohibition of the discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges does not violate a defendant's SixthAmendment right to a trial by an impartial jury. The goalof the Sixth Amendment is \u00aajury impartiality with respectto both contestants.\u00ba Holland v.Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 483 (1990). See also Hayes v.Missouri, 120 U. S. 68 (1887). We recognize, of course, that a defendant has the right to an impartial jury that can view him without racial animus,which so long has distorted our system of criminal justice.We have, accordingly, held that there should be a mechanismfor removing those on the venire whom the defendant hasspeci\u00aec reason to believe would be incapable of confrontingand suppressing their racism. See Ham v.South Carolina, 409 U. S. 524, 526\u00b1527 (1973); Rosales-Lopez v.United States, 451 U. S. 182, (plurality opinion of White, J .). Cf.Morgan v.Illinois, 504 U.

S. 42 (1992) Rehnquist, C. J., concurring But there is a distinction between exercising a peremptory challenge to discriminate invidiously against jurors on ac-count of race and exercising a peremptory challenge to re-move an individual juror who harbors racial prejudice. ThisCourt \u00aermly has rejected the view that assumptions of par-tiality based on race provide a legitimate basis for disqualify-ing a person as an impartial juror. As this Court stated justlast Term in Powers, \u00aa[w]e may not accept as a defense to racial discrimination the very stereotype the law condemns.\u00ba499 U. S., at 410. \u00aaIn our heterogeneous society policy aswell as constitutional considerations militate against the di-visive assumption\u00d0as a per se rule\u00d0that justice in a court of law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin, the accidentof birth, or the choice of religion.\u00ba Ristaino v.Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 596, n. 8 (1976). We therefore reaf\u00aerm today thatthe exercise of a peremptory challenge must not be based oneither the race of the juror or the racial stereotypes held bythe party. IV We hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal defend- ant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on theground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges.Accordingly, if the State demonstrates a prima facie case ofracial discrimination by the defendants, the defendants mustarticulate a racially neutral explanation for peremptory chal-lenges. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Chief Justice Rehnquist , concurring. I was in dissent in Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991), and continue to believe that case to havebeen wrongly decided. But so long as it remains the law, Ibelieve that it controls the disposition of this case on the505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 60 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM Thomas, J., concurring in judgment issue of \u00aastate action\u00ba under the Fourteenth Amendment. I therefore join the opinion of the Court. Justice Thomas , concurring in the judgment. As a matter of \u00aerst impression, I think that I would have shared the view of the dissenting opinions: A criminal de-fendant's use of peremptory strikes cannot violate the Four-teenth Amendment because it does not involve state action.Yet, I agree with the Court and The Chief Justice that our decision last Term in Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991), governs this case and requires the opposite conclusion. Because the respondents do not ques-tion Edmonson, I believe that we must accept its conse- quences. I therefore concur in the judgment reversing theGeorgia Supreme Court. I write separately to express my general dissatisfaction with our continuing attempts to use the Constitution to regu-late peremptory challenges. See, e. g., Batson v.Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986); Powers v.Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991); Ed- monson, supra. In my view, by restricting a criminal de- fendant's use of such challenges, this case takes us furtherfrom the reasoning and the result of Strauder v.West Vir- ginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880). I doubt that this departure will produce favorable consequences. On the contrary, I am cer-tain that black criminal defendants will rue the day that thisCourt ventured down this road that inexorably will lead tothe elimination of peremptory strikes. InStrauder, as the Court notes, we invalidated a state law that prohibited blacks from serving on juries. In the courseof the decision, we observed that the racial composition of ajury may affect the outcome of a criminal case. We ex-plained: \u00aaIt is well known that prejudices often exist againstparticular classes in the community, which sway the judg-ment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some casesto deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of thatprotection which others enjoy.\u00ba Id.,at 309.

Simply stated, securing represen- tation of the defendant's race on the jury may help to over-come racial bias and provide the defendant with a betterchance of having a fair trial. Post, at 68\u00b169. I do not think that this basic premise of Strauder has be- come obsolete. The public, in general, continues to believethat the makeup of juries can matter in certain instances.Consider, for example, how the press reports criminal trials.Major newspapers regularly note the number of whites andblacks that sit on juries in important cases. 1Their editors and readers apparently recognize that conscious and uncon-scious prejudice persists in our society and that it may in\u00afu-ence some juries. Common experience and common sensecon\u00aerm this understanding. InBatson, however, this Court began to depart from Strauder by holding that, without some actual showing, sup- positions about the possibility that jurors may harbor preju-dice have no legitimacy. We said, in particular, that a prose-cutor could not justify peremptory strikes \u00aaby statingmerely that he challenged jurors of the defendant's race onthe assumption\u00d0or his intuitive judgment\u00d0that they wouldbe partial to the defendant because of their shared race.\u00ba476 U. S., at 97. As noted, however, our decision in Strauder rested on precisely such an \u00aaassumption\u00ba or \u00aaintuition.\u00ba Wereasonably surmised, without direct evidence in any particu-lar case, that all-white juries might judge black defendantsunfairly. Our departure from Strauder has two negative conse- quences. First, it produces a serious misordering of ourpriorities. In Strauder, we put the rights of defendants foremost. Today's decision, while protecting jurors, leavesdefendants with less means of protecting themselves. Un- 1A computer search, for instance, reveals that the phrase \u00aaall white jury\u00ba has appeared over 200 times in the past \u00aeve years in the New YorkTimes, Chicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Times.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 62 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting less jurors actually admit prejudice during voir dire, defend- ants generally must allow them to sit and run the risk thatracial animus will affect the verdict. Cf. Fed. Rule Evid.606(b) (generally excluding juror testimony after trial to im-peach the verdict). In effect, we have exalted the right ofcitizens to sit on juries over the rights of the criminal defend-ant, even though it is the defendant, not the jurors, who facesimprisonment or even death. At a minimum, I think thatthis inversion of priorities should give us pause. Second, our departure from Strauder has taken us down a slope of inquiry that had no clear stopping point. Today,we decide only that white defendants may not strike blackveniremen on the basis of race. Eventually, we will have todecide whether black defendants may strike white venire-men. 2See, e. g., State v.Carr, 261 Ga. 845, 413 S. E. 2d 192 (1992). Next will come the question whether defendantsmay exercise peremptories on the basis of sex. See, e. g., United States v.De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433 (CA9 1992). The consequences for defendants of our decision and of these fu-ture cases remain to be seen. But whatever the bene\u00aetswere that this Court perceived in a criminal defendant's hav-ing members of his class on the jury, see Strauder, 100 U. S., at 309\u00b1310, they have evaporated. Justice O\u0092Connor , dissenting. The Court reaches the remarkable conclusion that criminal defendants being prosecuted by the State act on behalf oftheir adversary when they exercise peremptory challengesduring jury selection. The Court purports merely to follow 2The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., has submitted a brief arguing, in all sincerity, that \u00aawhether white defendants can useperemptory challenges to purge minority jurors presents quite differentissues from whether a minority defendant can strike majority group ju-rors.\u00ba Brief for NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., asAmicus Curiae 3\u00b14. Although I suppose that this issue technically re- mains open, it is dif\u00aecult to see how the result could be different if thedefendants here were black.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 63 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting precedents, but our cases do not compel this perverse result. To the contrary, our decisions speci\u00aecally establish that crim-inal defendants and their lawyers are not government actorswhen they perform traditional trial functions. I It is well and properly settled that the Constitution's equal protection guarantee forbids prosecutors to exercise peremp-tory challenges in a racially discriminatory fashion. SeeBatson v.Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986); Powers v.Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 409 (1991). The Constitution, however, affordsno similar protection against private action. \u00aaEmbedded inour Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is a dichotomybetween state action, which is subject to scrutiny under theAmendmen[t] . . . , and private conduct, against which theAmendment affords no shield, no matter how unfair that con-duct may be.\u00ba National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v.Tar- kanian, 488 U. S. 179, 191 (1988) (footnote omitted). This distinction appears on the face of the Fourteenth Amend-ment, which provides that \u00aa No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws.\u00ba U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). Thecritical but straightforward question this case presents iswhether criminal defendants and their lawyers, when exer-cising peremptory challenges as part of a defense, are stateactors. InLugar v.Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), the Court developed a two-step approach to identifying stateaction in cases such as this. First, the Court will ask\u00aawhether the claimed deprivation has resulted from the ex-ercise of a right or privilege having its source in state au-thority.\u00ba Id., at 939. Next, it will decide whether, on the particular facts at issue, the parties who allegedly caused thedeprivation of a federal right can \u00aaappropriately\u00ba and \u00aain allfairness\u00ba be characterized as state actors.

S. 614, 620 The505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 64 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting Court's determination in this case that the peremptory chal- lenge is a creation of state authority, ante, at 51, breaks no new ground. See Edmonson, supra, at 620\u00b1621. But dis- posing of this threshold matter leaves the Court with thetask of showing that criminal defendants who exercise pe-remptories should be deemed governmental actors. Whatour cases require, and what the Court neglects, is a realisticappraisal of the relationship between defendants and thegovernment that has brought them to trial. We discussed that relationship in Polk County v.Dodson, 454 U. S. 312 (1981), which held that a public defender does not act \u00aaunder color of state law\u00ba for purposes of 42 U. S. C.\u00a7 1983 \u00aawhen performing a lawyer's traditional functions ascounsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u00ba 454 U. S.,at 325. We began our analysis by explaining that a publicdefender's obligations toward her client are no different thanthe obligations of any other defense attorney. Id., at 318. These obligations preclude attributing the acts of defenselawyers to the State: \u00aa[T]he duties of a defense lawyer arethose of a personal counselor and advocate. It is often saidthat lawyers are `of\u00aecers of the court.' But the Courts ofAppeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client isnot, by virtue of being an of\u00aecer of the court, a statea c t o r.... \u00ba Ibid. We went on to stress the inconsistency between our ad- versarial system of justice and theories that would make de-fense lawyers state actors. \u00aaIn our system,\u00ba we said, \u00aaadefense lawyer characteristically opposes of the State.\u00ba Ibid. This adversarial pos- ture rests on the assumption that a defense lawyer bestserves the public \u00aanot by acting on behalf of the State or inconcert with it, but rather by advancing `the undivided erri v.Acker- man, 444 U. S. 193, 204 (1979)). Moreover, we pointed out that the independence of defense attorneys from state con-trol has a constitutional dimension. Gideon v.Wainwright,505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 65 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting 372 U.

S., at 322 (internalquotation marks omitted). Implicit in this right \u00aais the as-sumption that counsel will be free of state control. Therecan be no fair trial unless the accused receives the servicesof an effective and independent advocate.\u00ba Ibid. Thus, the defense's freedom from state authority is not just empiricallytrue, but is a constitutionally mandated attribute of our ad-versarial system. Because this Court deems the \u00aaunder color of state law\u00ba requirement that was not satis\u00aeed in Dodson identical to the Fourteenth Amendment's state action requirement, seeLugar, supra, at 929, the holding of Dodson simply cannot be squared with today's decision. In particular, Dodson cannot be explained away as a case concerned exclusivelywith the employment status of public defenders. See ante, at 54. The Dodson Court reasoned that public defenders performing traditional defense functions are not state actorsbecause they occupy the same position as other defense at-torneys in relevant respects. 454 U. S., at 319\u00b1325. Thisreasoning followed on the heels of a critical determination:Defending an accused \u00aais essentially a private function,\u00ba notstate action. Id., at 319. The Court's refusal to acknowl- edge Dodson 's initial holding, on which the entire opinion turned, will not make that holding go away. The Court also seeks to evade Dodson 's logic by spinning out a theory that defendants and their lawyers transmogrifyfrom government adversaries into state actors when theyexercise a peremptory challenge, and then change back toperform other defense functions. See ante, at 54. Dodson, however, established that even though public defendersmight act under color of state law when carrying out admin-istrative or investigative functions outside a courtroom, theyare not vested with state authority \u00aawhen performing a law-yer's traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 66 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting criminal proceeding.\u00ba 454 U. S., at 325. Since making pe- remptory challenges plainly quali\u00aees as a \u00aatraditional func-tion\u00ba of criminal defense lawyers, see Swain v.Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 212\u00b1219 (1965); Lewis v.United States, 146 U. S. 370, 376 (1892), Dodson forecloses the Court's functional analysis. Even aside from our prior rejection of it, the Court's func- tional theory fails. \u00aa[A] State normally can be held respon-sible for a private decision only when it has exercised coer-cive power or has provided such signi\u00aecant encouragement. . . that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\u00ba Blum v.Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1004 (1982). Thus, a private party's exercise of choice allowed by state law doesnot amount to state action for purposes of the FourteenthAmendment so long as \u00aathe initiative comes from [the pri-vate party] and not from the State.\u00ba Jackson v.Metropoli- tan Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345, 357 (1974). See Flagg Bros., Inc. v.Brooks, 436 U. S. 149, 165 (1978) (State not responsible for a decision it \u00aapermits but does not compel\u00ba). The gov-ernment in no way in\u00afuences the defense's decision to use aperemptory challenge to strike a particular juror. Our ad-versarial system of criminal justice and the traditions of theperemptory challenge vest the decision to strike a juror en-tirely with the accused. A defendant \u00aamay, if he chooses,peremptorily challenge `on his own dislike, without showingany cause;' he may exercise that right without reason or forno reason, arbitrarily and capriciously.\u00ba Pointer v.United States, 151 U. S. 396, 408 (1894) (quoting 1 E. Coke, Institutes 156b (19th ed. 1832)). \u00aaThe essential nature of the peremp-tory challenge is that it is one exercised without a reasonstated, without inquiry and without being subject to thecourt's control.\u00ba Swain, supra, at 220. See Dodson, supra, Lewis, supra, at 376, 378. Certainly, Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co. did not ren- derDodson and its realistic approach to the state action in- quiry dead letters. The Edmonson Court distinguished505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 67 Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting Dodson by saying: \u00aaIn the ordinary context of civil litigation in which the government is not a party, an adversarial rela-tion does not exist between the government and a privatelitigant. In the jury selection process, the government andprivate litigants work for the same end.\u00ba Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 627. While the nonpartisan administrative inter-ests of the State and the partisan interests of private liti-gants may not be at odds during civil jury selection, the samecannot be said of the partisan interests of the State and thedefendant during jury selection in a criminal trial. A pri-vate civil litigant opposes a private counterpart, but a crimi- nal defendant is by design in an adversarial relationship withthe government. Simply put, the defendant seeks to strikejurors predisposed to convict, while the State seeks to strikejurors predisposed to acquit. The Edmonson Court clearly recognized this point when it limited the statement that \u00aaanadversarial relation does not exist between the governmentand a private litigant\u00ba to \u00aathe ordinary context of civil liti- gation in which the government is not a party. \u00baIbid. (em- phasis added). From arrest, to trial, to possible sentencing and punish- ment, the antagonistic relationship between government andthe accused is clear for all to see. Rather than squarely fac-ing this fact, the Court, as in Edmonson, rests its \u00aending of governmental action on the points that defendants exerciseperemptory challenges in a courtroom and judges alter thecomposition of the jury in response to defendants' choices.I found this approach wanting in the context of civil contro-versies between private litigants, for reasons that need notbe repeated here. See id.,at 632 ( O\u0092Connor, J. , dissenting). But even if I thought Edmonson was correctly decided, I could not accept today's simplistic extension of it. Dodson makes clear that the unique relationship between criminaldefendants and the State precludes attributing defendants'actions to the State, whatever is the case in civil trials.How could it be otherwise when the underlying question is505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT 68 GEORGIA v.McCOLLUM O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting whether the accused \u00aac[an] be described in all fairness as a state actor\u00ba? 500 U. S., at 620. As Dodson accords with our state action jurisprudence and with common sense, Iwould honor it. II What really seems to bother the Court is the prospect that leaving criminal defendants and their attorneys free to makeracially motivated peremptory challenges will undermine theideal of nondiscriminatory jury selection we espoused inBatson, 476 U. S., at 85\u00b188. The concept that the govern- ment alone must honor constitutional dictates, however, is afundamental tenet of our legal order, not an obstacle to becircumvented. This is particularly so in the context of crim-inal trials, where we have held the prosecution to uniquelyhigh standards of conduct. See Brady v.Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963) (disclosure of evidence favorable to the ac-cused); Berger v.United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935) (\u00aaThe [prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party toa controversy, but of a sovereignty . . . whose interest ...i n a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but thatjustice shall be done\u00ba). Considered in purely pragmatic terms, moreover, the Court's holding may fail to advance nondiscriminatory crimi-nal justice. It is by now clear that conscious and uncon-scious racism can affect the way white jurors perceive minor-ity defendants and the facts presented at their trials,perhaps determining the verdict of guilt or innocence. SeeDevelopments in the Law\u00d0Race and the Criminal Process,101 1472, 1559\u00b11560 Colbert, Challeng-ing the Challenge: Thirteenth Amendment as a Prohibitionagainst the Racial Use of Peremptory Challenges, 76 CornellL. Rev. 1, 110\u00b1112 (1990). Using peremptory challenges tosecure minority representation on the jury may help to over-come such racial bias, for there is substantial reason to be-lieve that the distorting in\u00afuence of race is minimized on aracially mixed jury.

As amicus NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund explained in this case: \u00aaThe ability to use peremptory challenges to exclude majority race jurors may be crucial to empaneling a fairjury. In many cases an African American, or otherminority defendant, may be faced with a jury array inwhich his racial group is underrepresented to some de-gree, but not suf\u00aeciently to permit challenge under theFourteenth Amendment. The only possible chance thedefendant may have of having any minority jurors onthe jury that actually tries him will be if he uses hisperemptories to strike members of the majority race.\u00baBrief for NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,Inc., as Amicus Curiae 9\u00b110 (footnote omitted). See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Law- yers as Amicus Curiae 56\u00b157; Edmonson, supra, at 644 (Scalia, J. , dissenting). In a world where the outcome of a minority defendant's trial may turn on the misconceptions orbiases of white jurors, there is cause to question the implica-tions of this Court's good intentions. That the Constitution does not give federal judges the reach to wipe all marks of racism from every courtroom inthe land is frustrating, to be sure. But such limitations arethe necessary and intended consequence of the FourteenthAmendment's state action requirement. Because I cannotaccept the Court's conclusion that government is responsiblefor decisions criminal defendants make while \u00aeghting stateprosecution, I respectfully dissent. Justice Scalia , dissenting. I agree with the Court that its judgment follows logically from Edmonson v.Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991).

Argued April 22, 1992\u00d0Decided June 18, 1992 The Iowa statute that imposes a business tax on corporations uses the federal tax code's de\u00aenition of \u00aanet income\u00ba with certain adjustments.Like the federal scheme, Iowa allows corporations to take a deductionfor dividends received from domestic, but not foreign, subsidiaries. How-ever, unlike the federal scheme, Iowa does not allow a credit for taxespaid to foreign countries. Petitioner Kraft General Foods, Inc., a uni-tary business with operations in the United States and several foreigncountries, deducted its foreign subsidiary dividends from its taxable in-come on its 1981 Iowa return, notwithstanding the contrary provisionsof Iowa law. Respondent Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance(Iowa) assessed a de\u00aeciency, which Kraft challenged in administrativeproceedings and subsequently in Iowa courts. The Iowa SupremeCourt rejected Kraft's argument that the disparate treatment of domes-tic and foreign subsidiary dividends violated the Commerce Clause ofthe Federal Constitution, holding that Kraft failed to demonstrate thatthe taxing scheme gave Iowa businesses a commercial advantage overforeign commerce. Held: The Iowa statute facially discriminates against foreign commerce in violation of the Foreign Commerce Clause. It is indisputable that thestatute treats dividends received from foreign subsidiaries less favor-ably than those received from domestic subsidiaries by including theformer, but not the latter, in taxable income. None of the several argu-ments made by Iowa and its amici \u00d0that, since a corporation's domicile does not necessarily establish that it is engaged in either foreign ordomestic commerce, the disparate treatment is not discrimination basedon the business activity's location or nature; that a taxpayer can avoidthe discrimination by changing a subsidiary's domicile from a foreign toa domestic location; that the statute does not treat Iowa subsidiariesmore favorably than those located elsewhere; that the bene\u00aet to domes-tic subsidiaries might be offset by the taxes imposed on them by otherStates and the Federal Government; and that the statute is intendedto promote administrative convenience rather than economic protec-tionism\u00d0justi\u00aees Iowa's differential treatment of foreign commerce.Pp. 75\u00b182. 465 N. 2d 664, reversed and remanded.505us1$96I 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT 72 KRAFT GEN.

The question presented is whether thedisparate treatment of dividends from foreign and from do-mestic subsidiaries violates the Foreign Commerce Clause. 3 I The Iowa statute uses the federal de\u00aenition of \u00aanet in- come\u00ba with certain adjustments.4For federal tax purposes, corporations are generally allowed a deduction for dividendsreceived from domestic subsidiaries. 5As the earnings of the domestic subsidiaries, themselves, are subject to federaltaxation, this deduction avoids a second federal tax on thoseearnings. 6The Federal Government generally does not tax the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and the dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries are not deductible. The parent cor-poration, however, does receive a credit for the foreign taxespaid on the dividends and on the underlying foreign earn-ings. 7Like the deduction for domestic subsidiary dividends, the foreign tax credit is intended to mitigate multiple taxa-tion of corporate earnings. 8 3\u00aaThe Congress shall have Power . . .

OF REVENUE AND FINANCE Opinion of the Court In following the federal scheme for the calculation of tax- able income, Iowa allows a deduction for dividends receivedfrom domestic subsidiaries, but not for those received fromforeign subsidiaries. Iowa does not directly tax the income of a subsidiary unless the subsidiary, itself, does businessin Iowa. 9Thus, if a domestic subsidiary transacts business in Iowa, its income is taxed, but if it does not do business in Iowa, neither its income nor the dividends paid to its parentare taxed. In the case of the foreign subsidiary doing busi-ness abroad, Iowa does not tax the corporate income, butdoes tax the dividends paid to the parent. 10Unlike the Federal Government, Iowa does not allow a credit for taxes paid to foreign countries. See 465 N. W. 2d 664, 665 (Iowa1991). 11 In computing its taxable income on its 1981 Iowa return, Kraft deducted foreign subsidiary dividends, notwithstand-ing contrary provisions of Iowa law. 12Respondent Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance (Iowa) assessed a de\u00ae- 9Iowa is not a State that taxes an apportioned share of the entire income of a unitary business, without regard for formal corporate lines. See Tr.of Oral Arg. 37; cf. Container Corp. of America v.Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 164\u00b1169 (1983). 10At oral argument, counsel for Kraft offered the following illustration: \u00aaIf an Iowa parent company had a Kentucky subsidiary, [that] did all itsbusiness in Kentucky, and another subsidiary that did all its business inGermany, Iowa would not tax the income of either of those subsidiaries.If each paid a dividend to the Iowa parent, Iowa would tax the Germandividends and would not tax the Kentucky dividends.\u00ba Tr. of Oral Arg.47\u00b148. 11If in calculating its federal tax liability, a taxpayer elects to deduct foreign tax withheld on foreign subsidiary dividends, a taxpayer may alsodeduct these tax payments in calculating its Iowa taxes. Electing thededuction, then, allows the taxpayer to reduce, but not eliminate, the Iowatax on foreign subsidiary dividends. In the relevant year, Kraft electedto take the foreign tax credit, see 465 N. W. 2d, at 666, and thus could notdeduct the foreign taxes in computing its federal or Iowa taxable income,see n. 7, supra. 12See 465 N. W. 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT 75 Cite as: 505 U. S. 71 (1992) Opinion of the Court ciency. After its administrative protest was denied,13Kraft challenged the assessment in Iowa courts, alleging that the disparate treatment of domestic and foreign subsidiary divi-dends violated the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protec-tion Clause 14of the Federal Constitution. The Iowa Su- preme Court rejected the Commerce Clause claim becausepetitioner failed to demonstrate \u00aathat Iowa businesses re-ceive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due toIowa's taxing scheme.\u00ba Id.,at 668. In considering Kraft's challenge under the Equal Protection Clause, the court foundthat Iowa's use of the federal formula for calculation of tax-able income was convenient both for the taxpayer and forthe State. Concluding that the Iowa statute was rationallyrelated to the goal of administrative ef\u00aeciency, the IowaSupreme Court held that the statute did not violate equalprotection. Id., at 669. We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 1056 (1992). II The principal dispute between the parties concerns whether, on its face, the Iowa statute discriminates againstforeign commerce. It is indisputable that the Iowa statutetreats dividends received from foreign subsidiaries less fa-vorably than dividends received from domestic subsidiaries.Iowa includes the former, but not the latter, in the calcula-tion of taxable income. While admitting that the two kindsof dividends are treated differently, Iowa and its amici ad- vance several arguments in support of the proposition thatthis differential treatment does not constitute prohibited dis-crimination against foreign commerce. Amicus United States notes that a subsidiary's place of incorporation does not necessarily correspond to the locus ofits business operations. A domestic corporation might do 13See App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a. 14\u00aaNo state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u00ba U. S.

OF REVENUE AND FINANCE Opinion of the Court business abroad, and its dividends might re\u00afect earnings from its foreign activity. Conversely, a foreign corporationmight do business in the United States, with its dividendpayments re\u00afecting domestic business operations. On thisbasis, the United States contends that the disparate treat-ment of dividends from foreign and domestic subsidiariesdoes not translate into discrimination based on the locationor nature of business activity and is thus not prohibited bythe Commerce Clause. We recognize that the domicile of a corporation does not necessarily establish that it is engaged in either foreign ordomestic commerce. In this case, however, it is stipulatedthat the foreign subsidiaries did, in fact, operate in foreigncommerce and, further, that the decision to do businessabroad through foreign subsidiaries is typically supported bylegitimate business reasons. 15By its nature, a unitary busi- ness is characterized by a \u00afow of value among its compo-nents. See Container Corp. of America v.Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 178 (1983). The \u00afow of value between Kraft and its foreign subsidiaries clearly constitutes foreigncommerce; this \u00afow includes the foreign subsidiary divi-dends, which, as Iowa acknowledges, themselves constituteforeign commerce. 16 Moreover, through the interplay of the federal and Iowa tax statutes, the applicability of the Iowa tax necessarily de-pends not only on the domicile of the subsidiary, but alsoon the location of the subsidiary's business activities. The 15The parties stipulated as follows: \u00aaDomestic Corporations typically do business in foreign countries through corporations organized in the country in which they are doing business fora variety of reasons. Reasons include, but are not limited to, the require-ments of the local country, a better ability to limit their liability in thatcountry, the marketing advantage of being perceived by customers as alocal company, greater ease in repatriating funds, greater ease in borrow-ing funds locally, and ability to own property and manufacture in thatcountry.\u00ba App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a\u00b131a. 16See PAGES OPINPGT 77 Cite as: 505 U. S. 71 (1992) Opinion of the Court Federal Government generally taxes the income that a for- eign corporation earns in the United States.17To avoid mul- tiple taxation, the Government allows a deduction for foreignsubsidiary dividends that re\u00afect such domestic earnings. 18 In adopting the federal pattern, Iowa also allows a deductionfor dividends received from a foreign subsidiary if the divi-dends re\u00afect business activity in the United States. Accord-ingly, while the dividends of all domestic subsidiaries areexcluded from the Iowa tax base, the dividends of foreignsubsidiaries are excluded only to the extent they re\u00afect do-mestic earnings. 19In sum, the only subsidiary dividend pay- ments taxed by Iowa are those re\u00afecting the foreign busi-ness activity of foreign subsidiaries. We do not think thatthis discriminatory treatment can be justi\u00aeed on the groundthat some of the (untaxed) dividend payments from domesticsubsidiaries also re\u00afect foreign earnings. In a related argument, Iowa and amicus United States assert that Kraft could conduct its foreign business throughdomestic subsidiaries instead of foreign subsidiaries or, alter-natively, could set up a domestic company to hold the stockof the foreign subsidiaries and receive the foreign dividendpayments. In either case, Kraft, itself, would receive nodividends from foreign subsidiaries and would thus avoidpaying Iowa tax on income attributable to the foreign opera-tions. Iowa and the United States contend that these alter-natives further demonstrate that it is not foreign commerce, 17See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 882. 18See \u00a7 245. 19The dissent presents the example of a subsidiary incorporated in a foreign country, but engaged in business exclusively in the United States.The dissent doubts whether a dividend payment from such a subsidiaryis properly characterized as \u00aaforeign commerce.\u00ba Post, at 85. As dis- cussed above, however, a dividend payment from such a subsidiary wouldnot be taxed by Iowa. Iowa taxes foreign subsidiary dividends only to the extent that they re\u00afect foreign earnings.

FOODS, INC. v.IOWA DEPT. OF REVENUE AND FINANCE Opinion of the Court but, at most, a particular form of corporate organization that is burdened. This argument is not persuasive. Whether or not the sug- gested methods of tax avoidance would be practical as abusiness matter, and whether or not they might generateadverse tax consequences in other jurisdictions, we do notthink that a State can force a taxpayer to conduct its foreignbusiness through a domestic subsidiary in order to avoid dis-criminatory taxation of foreign commerce. Cf. Metropoli- tan Life Ins. Co. v.Ward, 470 U. S. 869, 878\u00b1879 (1985). We have previously found that the Commerce Clause is not vio-lated when the differential tax treatment of two categoriesof companies \u00aaresults solely from differences between thenature of their businesses, not from the location of their ac-tivities.\u00ba Amerada Hess Corp. v.Director, Div. of Taxation, N. J. Dept. of Treasury, 490 U. S. 66, 78 (1989). 20We \u00aend no authority for the different proposition advanced here that atax that does discriminate against foreign commerce may beupheld if a taxpayer could avoid that discrimination bychanging the domicile of the corporations through which itconducts its business. Our cases suggest the contrary. SeeWestinghouse Electric Corp. v.Tully, 466 U. S. 388, 406 (1984); Halliburton Oil Well C ementing Co. v.Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 72 (1963). Repeating the argument that prevailed in the Iowa Su- preme Court, Iowa next insists that its tax system does notviolate the Commerce Clause because it does not favor localinterests. To the extent corporations do business in Iowa,an apportioned share of their entire corporate income is sub-ject to Iowa tax. In the case of a foreign subsidiary doingbusiness abroad, Iowa would tax the dividends paid to thedomestic parent, but would not tax the subsidiary's earnings. 20InAmerada Hess, we rejected the contention that a New Jersey tax violated the Commerce Clause because it \u00aadiscriminate[d] against oil pro-ducers who market their oil in favor of independent retailers who do notproduce oil.\u00ba 490 U.

Far from favoring local commerce, Iowaargues, the tax system places additional burdens on Iowabusinesses. We agree that the statute does not treat Iowa subsidiaries more favorably than subsidiaries located elsewhere. We arenot persuaded, however, that such favoritism is an essentialelement of a violation of the Foreign Commerce Clause. InJapan Line, Ltd. v.County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434 (1979), we concluded that the constitutional prohibitionagainst state taxation of foreign commerce is broader thanthe protection afforded to interstate commerce, id., at 445\u00b1 446, in part because matters of concern to the entire Nationare implicated, id., at 448\u00b1451. Like the Import-Export Clause, 21the Foreign Commerce Clause recognizes that dis- criminatory treatment of foreign commerce may create prob-lems, such as the potential for international retaliation, thatconcern the Nation as a whole. Id., at 450. So here, we think that a State's preference for domestic commerce overforeign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clauseeven if the State's own economy is not a direct bene\u00aeciary ofthe discrimination. As the absence of local bene\u00aet does noteliminate the international implications of the discrimina-tion, it cannot exempt such discrimination from CommerceClause prohibitions. Iowa and amicus United States also assert the stronger claim that Iowa's tax system does not favor business activityin the United States generally over business activity abroad.If true, this would indeed suggest that the statute does not 21\u00aaNo State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessaryfor executing its inspection Laws . . . .\u00ba 2.505us1$96I 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT 80 KRAFT GEN. FOODS, INC. v.IOWA DEPT. OF REVENUE AND FINANCE Opinion of the Court discriminate against foreign commerce. We are not con- vinced, however, that this description adequately character-izes the relevant features of the Iowa statute. It is truethat if a subsidiary were located in another State, its earn-ings would be subject to taxation by the Federal Govern- ment and by the other State (assuming that the State wasone of the great majority that impose a corporate incometax). 22This state and federal tax burden might exceed the sum of the foreign tax that a foreign subsidiary would payand the tax that Iowa collects on dividends received from aforeign subsidiary. But whatever the tax burdens imposedby the Federal Government or by other States, the fact re-mains that Iowa imposes a burden on foreign subsidiaries that it does not impose on domestic subsidiaries. 23We have no reason to doubt the assertion of the United States that\u00aa[i]n evaluating the alleged facial discrimination effected bythe Iowa tax, it is not proper to ignore the operation of other 22Corporate income is taxed by 45 States and by the District of Colum- bia. See 1 J. Hellerstein, State Taxation: Corporate Income and Fran-chise Taxes \u00b6 1.6 (1983). 23If one were to compare the aggregate tax imposed by Iowa on a uni- tary business which included a subsidiary doing business throughout theUnited States (including Iowa) with the aggregate tax imposed by Iowaon a unitary business which included a foreign subsidiary doing businessabroad, it would be dif\u00aecult to say that Iowa discriminates against thebusiness with the foreign subsidiary. Iowa would tax an apportionedshare of the domestic subsidiary's entire earnings, but would tax only theamount of the foreign subsidiary's earnings paid as a dividend to theparent. In considering claims of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce Clause, however, it is necessary to compare the taxpayers who are \u00aamostsimilarly situated.\u00ba Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v.Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 71 (1963). A corporation with a subsidiary doing business inIowa is not situated similarly to a corporation with a subsidiary doingbusiness abroad. In the former case, the Iowa operations of the subsid-iary provide an independent basis for taxation not present in the case ofthe foreign subsidiary. A more appropriate comparison is between corpo-rations whose subsidiaries do not do business in Iowa.505us1$96I 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT 81 Cite as: 505 U.

We \u00aend no au- thority, however, for the principle that discrimination againstforeign commerce can be justi\u00aeed if the bene\u00aet to domesticsubsidiaries might happen to be offset by other taxes im-posed not by Iowa, but by other States and by the FederalGovernment. Finally, Iowa insists that even if discrimination against foreign commerce does result, the statute is valid because itis intended to promote administrative convenience ratherthan economic protectionism. Iowa contends that the adop-tion of the federal de\u00aenition of \u00aataxable income,\u00ba whichincludes foreign subsidiary dividends, provides signi\u00aecantadvantages both to the taxpayers and to the taxing authori-ties. Taxpayers may compute their Iowa tax easily basedon their federal calculations, and the Iowa authorities mayrely on federal regulations and interpretations and may take advantage of federal efforts to monitor taxpayer compliance.See 465 N. W. 2d, at 669. We do not minimize the value of having state forms and auditing procedures replicate federal practice. Absent acompe lling justi\u00aecation, however, a State may not advance its legitimate goals by means that facially discriminateagainst foreign commerce. See Philadelphia v.New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 626\u00b1628 (1978); Maine v.Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 148, n. 19 (1986). In this instance, Iowa could enjoy substan-tially the same administrative bene\u00aets by ut ilizing the fed- eral de\u00aenition of taxable income, while making adjustmentsthat avoid the discriminatory treatment of foreign subsidiarydividends. Many other States have adopted this approach. 24 It is apparent, then, that this is not a case in which theState's goals \u00aacannot be adequately served by reasonablenondiscriminatory alternatives.\u00ba New Energy Co. of Indi- ana v.Limbach, 486 U.

Nor, having chosen to follow the federal system inpart, must Iowa duplicate that scheme in all respects. Theadoption of the federal system in whole or in part, however,cannot shield a state tax statute from Commerce Clausescrutiny. The Iowa statute cannot withstand this scrutiny,for it facially discriminates against foreign commerce andtherefore violates the Foreign Commerce Clause. 25 The judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Chief Justice Rehnquist , with whom Justice Black- mun joins, dissenting. Petitioner in this case limits its Commerce Clause chal- lenge to a single argument\u00d0that Iowa's taxing scheme un-constitutionally discriminates against foreign commerce. Ithas brought a facial challenge to the Iowa taxing scheme. The burden on one making a facial challenge to the constitu-tionality of a statute is heavy; the litigant must show that\u00aano set of circumstances exists under which the Act wouldbe valid.

In the present case,like Container Corporation, the Iowa tax is imposed on a domestic corporation, not on a foreign entity. And in thepresent case, the Executive Branch has not merely remainedneutral, as it did in Container Corporation, but has \u00aeled a brief urging that the tax be sustained against the ForeignCommerce Clause challenge. The Court agrees that the Iowa tax involved here does not favor subsidiaries incorporated in Iowa over foreign subsidi-aries, but points out that the tax does favor subsidiaries in-corporated in other States over foreign subsidiaries.

In- deed, petitioner carries on operations in Iowa, where the\u00aaState's own political processes [can] serve as a check againstunduly burdensome regulations.\u00ba Kassel v.Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U. S. 662, 675 (1981). But assuming that it is suf\u00aecient to show simply that non- Iowa domestic \u00aacommerce\u00ba enjoys a bene\u00aet not enjoyed byforeign \u00aacommerce,\u00ba the Court surely errs in concluding that such a showing has been made in the present case. Becausepetitioner has chosen to make a facial challenge to the Iowastatute, the record is largely devoid of any evidence to sug-gest that Iowa's taxing scheme systematically works to dis-courage foreign commerce to the advantage of its domesticcounterpart. Petitioner's failures in this respect are severalfold. First, it is unclear on the present record what amount of foreigncommerce is affected by the Iowa statute. The dif\u00aeculty\u00afows from our inability to make any useful generalizationsabout a corporation's business activity based solely on thecorporation's country of incorporation. The Court recog-nizes that, in this era of substantial international trade, it issimple-minded to assume that a corporation's foreign domi-cile necessarily re\u00afects that it is principally, or even substan-tially, engaged in foreign commerce. Ante, at 76. To the contrary, foreign domiciled corporations may engage in littleor even zero foreign activity. In such cases, the suggestionthat Iowa's tax has any real effect on foreign commerce isabsurd; petitioner certainly has not demonstrated \u00aaby state tax] results in being taxed\u00ba in all cases. Franchise Tax Bd., supra, at 175. In turn, Iowa's tax can hardly be found to always unconstitutionally discriminate against foreigncommerce. Given that petitioner's burden is to demonstrate505us1$96I 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT 85 Cite as: 505 U. S. 71 (1992) Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting that there are no circumstances in which Iowa's statute could be constitutionally applied, the existence of such a possibilityshould be fatal to petitioner's chances of success in this case. The Court suggests that, even if foreign domiciled corpora- tions are involved in no foreign trade, the dividend paymentsfrom subsidiary to parent are themselves \u00aaforeign com-merce.\u00ba Ante, at 76. Again, this may be true in certain circumstances, as the payment of a dividend may representa real \u00afow of capital across international boundaries. Butcertainly there are other situations where the \u00aaforeign\u00ba as-pects of a transaction are extraordinarily attenuated, and any burdening of such transactions concomitantly would notraise Foreign Commerce Clause concerns. Consider, forexample, the case of a \u00aaforeign\u00ba subsidiary\u00d0 i. e., one that is incorporated in a foreign country\u00d0but with operationsexclusively in the United States. It has no assets in theforeign country, no operations, nothing of value whatsoever.The corporation declares a dividend payable to its UnitedStates parent. The payment in such circumstance may wellbe accomplished simply by debiting one New York bank ac-count and crediting another. To characterize this as \u00aafor-eign commerce\u00ba seems to me to stretch that term beyond allrecognition. And again, the existence of such a possibilityis suf\u00aecient to undermine petitioner's facial challenge. The Court appears to think these problems are sur- mounted by the parties' stipulation that petitioner's sub-sidiaries operated in \u00aaforeign commerce\u00ba and that foreignsubsidiaries are often established for legitimate businessreasons. Ibid. Of course, a stipulation between parties cannot bind this Court on a question of law. Moreover, eventhe facts that the stipulation establishes are sparse. It tellsus nothing about the ratio in modern commerce of \u00aareal\u00baforeign subsidiaries to their domestically oriented cousins.Indeed, on the present record it is impossible even to estab-lish the scope of operation of Kraft's subsidiaries.

J., dissenting ments by 6 of petitioner's subsidiaries) with id.,at 76a\u00b179a (listing petitioner's 86 nonwholly owned subsidiaries). With-out some greater detail, I think it is impossible to concludethat the Iowa taxing scheme would have such real and sub-stantial effects that it could never survive constitutionalmuster. Finally, I cannot agree that, even if the dividend payments made taxable by the Iowa scheme are foreign commerce, thatIowa impermissibly discriminates against such payments.To be sure, two Iowa corporations, one with a foreign subsid-iary and one with a domestic non-Iowa subsidiary will insome cases pay a different total tax. But this does not con-stitute unconstitutional discrimination because, as far as therecord demonstrates, Iowa's taxing scheme does not resultin foreign commerce being systematically subject to higher tax burdens than domestic commerce. Given that 45 of 50States tax corporations on their net income, ante, at 80, n. 22, in deciding to tax only a foreign subsidiary's dividend pay-ments, rather than the subsidiary's total income, Iowa as-sures that the subsidiary's tax burden is less than that facedby its domestic counterpart. The deduction that Iowa ex-tends to domestically based dividend payments simply helpsto avoid what would otherwise be the near certainty that thedomestic income would be doubly taxed\u00d0once when earnedas income by the subsidiary and a second time when paid tothe parent corporation. But Iowa's attempt to take account of this near certainty with respect to domestic earnings does not in turn require itto make a similar assumption with respect to income earnedby foreign sources. As amicus United States correctly points out, \u00aa[t]he record in this case fails to indicate even theexistence, much less the nature, of such local-level foreigntaxes . . . . Nor is there any evidence to re\u00afect the creditsor reductions that foreign local governments would apply orallow.\u00ba Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15, n. 21.505us1$96I 07-22-96 16:30:34 PAGES OPINPGT 87 Cite as: 505 U.

It does not. In defend-ing a tax classi\u00aecation such as this, a State need only dem-onstrate that the classi\u00aecation is rationally related to le-gitimate state purposes. Exxon Corp. v.Eagerton, 462 U. S. 176, 195 (1983).

Administrative ef\u00aeciency is certainly a legitimate state in-terest and Iowa's reliance on the federal taxing scheme ob-viously furthers its achievement. Petitioner's claim, there-fore, must fail.

Argued March 23, 1992\u00d0Decided June 18, 1992 Pursuant to authority contained in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act or Act), the Occupational Safety and Health Ad-ministration (OSHA) promulgated regulations implementing a require-ment of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986(SARA) that standards be set for the initial and routine training ofworkers who handle hazardous wastes. Subsequently, Illinois enactedtwo acts requiring the licensing of workers at certain hazardous wastefacilities. Each state act has the dual purpose of protecting workersand the general public and requires workers to meet speci\u00aeed trainingand examination requirements. Claiming, among other things, that theacts were pre-empted by the OSH Act and OSHA regulations, respond-ent, an association of businesses involved in, inter alia, hazardous waste management, sought injunctive relief against petitioner Gade's prede-cessor as director of the state environmental protection agency to pre-vent enforcement of the state acts. The District Court held that thestate acts were not pre-empted because they protected public safety inaddition to promoting job safety, but it invalidated some provisions ofthe acts. The Court of Appeals af\u00aermed in part and reversed in part,holding that the OSH Act pre-empts all state law that \u00aaconstitutes, ina direct, clear and substantial way, regulation of worker health andsafety,\u00ba unless the Secretary of Labor has explicitly approved the lawpursuant to \u00a7 18 of the OSH Act. In remanding, the court did not con-sider which, if any, of the provisions would be pre-empted. Held: The judgment is af\u00aermed. 918 F. 2d 671, af\u00aermed. Justice O\u0092Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III, and IV , concluding that: 1. A state law requirement that directly, substantially, and speci\u00aecally regulates occupational safety and health is an occupational safety andhealth standard within the meaning of the OSH Act regardless ofwhether it has another, nonoccupational purpose. In assessing a statelaw's impact on the federal scheme, this Court has refused to rely solely505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT 89 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Syllabus on the legislature's professed purpose and has looked as well to the law's effects. See, e. g., Perez v.Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 651\u00b1652. State laws of general applicability, such as traf\u00aec and \u00aere safety laws, wouldgenerally not be pre-empted, because they regulate workers simply asmembers of the general public. Pp. 104\u00b1108. 2. The state licensing acts are pre-empted by the OSH Act to the extent that they establish occupational safety and health standards fortraining those who work with hazardous wastes. The Act's saving pro-visions are not implicated and Illinois does not have an approved plan.Illinois' interest in establishing standards for licensing various occupa-tions, cf., e. g., Goldfarb v.Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792, cannot save from OSH Act pre-emption those provisions that directly and sub-stantially affect workplace safety, since any state law, however clearlywithin a State's acknowledged power, must yield if it interferes with oris contrary to federal law, Felder v.Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138. Nor can the acts be saved from pre-emption by Gade's argument that they regu-late a \u00aapre-condition\u00ba to employment rather than occupational safetyand health, since SARA makes clear that the training of employees en-gaged in hazardous waste operations is an occupational safety and healthissue and that certi\u00aecation requirements before an employee may en-gage in such work are occupational safety and health standards. ThisCourt does not speci\u00aecally consider which of the licensing acts' provi-sions will be pre-empted under the foregoing analysis. Pp. 108\u00b1109. Justice O\u0092Connor, joined by The Chief Justice ,Justice White , and Justice Scalia , concluded in Part II that the OSH Act impliedly pre-empts any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issuewith respect to which a federal standard has been established, unless astate plan has been submitted and approved pursuant to \u00a7 18(b) of theAct. The Act as a whole demonstrates that Congress intended to pro-mote occupational safety and health while avoiding subjecting workersand employers to duplicative regulation. Thus, it established a systemof uniform federal standards, but gave States the option of pre-emptingthe federal regulations entirely pursuant to an approved state plan that displaces the federal standards. This intent is indicated principally in\u00a7 18(b)'s statement that a State \u00aashall\u00ba submit a plan if it wishes to\u00aaassume responsibility\u00ba for developing and enforcing health and safetystandards. Gade's interpretation of \u00a7 18(b)\u00d0that the Secretary's ap-proval is required only if a State wishes to replace, not merely supple-ment, the federal regulations\u00d0would be inconsistent with the federalscheme and is untenable in light of the surrounding provisions. Thelanguage and purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 18(a), (c), (f), and (h) all con\u00aerm the viewthat the States cannot assume an enforcement role without the Secre-tary's approval, unless no federal standard is in effect.

Syllabus able is Gade's argument that the OSH Act does not pre-empt noncon- \u00aficting state laws because those laws, like the Act, are designed topromote worker safety. Even where such laws share a common goal, astate law will be pre-empted if it interferes with the methods by which a federal statute was intended to reach that goal. International Paper Co.v.Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494. Here, the Act does not foreclose a State from enacting its own laws, but it does restrict the ways in whichit can do so. Pp. 96\u00b1104. Justice Kennedy , agreeing that the state laws are pre-empted, con- cluded that the result is mandated by the express terms of \u00a7 18(b) of theOSH Act and that the scope of pre-emption is also de\u00aened by the statu-tory text. Such a \u00aending is not contrary to the longstanding rule thatthis Court will not i nfer pre-emption of the States' historic police pow- ers absent a clear statement of intent by Congress. Unartful though\u00a7 18(b)'s language may be, its structure and language, in conjunctionwith subsections (a), (c), and (f), leave little doubt that in the OSH ActCongress intended to pre-empt supplementary state regulation of anoccupational safety and health issue with respect to which a federalstandard exists.

Opinion of the Court I The OSH Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promul- gate federal occupational safety and health standards. 29U. S. C. \u00a7 655. In the Superfund Amendments and Reau-thorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Congress directed the Sec-retary of Labor to \u00aapromulgate standards for the health andsafety protection of employees engaged in hazardous wasteoperations\u00ba pursuant to her authority under the OSH Act.SARA, Pub.

In relevant part,SARA requires the Secretary to establish standards for theinitial and routine training of workers who handle hazard-ous wastes. In response to this congressional directive, OSHA, to which the Secretary has delegated certain of her statutoryresponsibilities, see Martin v.Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 147, n. 1 (1991), pro- mulgated regulations on \u00aaHazardous Waste Operations andEmergency Response,\u00ba including detailed regulations onworker training requirements. 51 Fed.

The OSHA regulations require, among other things,that workers engaged in an activity that may expose themto hazardous wastes receive a minimum of 40 hours of in-struction off the site, and a minimum of three days actual\u00aeeld experience under the supervision of a trained supervi-sor. \u00a7 1910.120(e)(3)(i). Workers who are on the site onlyoccasionally or who are working in areas that have been de-termined to be under the permissible exposure limits mustcomplete at least 24 hours of off-site instruction and one dayof actual \u00aeeld experience. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.120(e)(3)(ii) and (iii). On-site managers and supervisors directly responsible forhazardous waste operations must receive the same initialtraining as general employees, plus at least eight additionalhours of specialized training on various health and safety505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT 93 Cite as: 505 U.

Those who have satis\u00aeed the and \u00aeeld experience requirement receive a written certi-\u00aecation; uncerti\u00aeed workers are prohibited from engaging inhazardous waste operations. \u00a7 1910.120(e)(6). In 1988, while OSHA's interim hazardous waste regula- tions were in effect, the State of Illinois enacted the licensing acts at issue here. The laws are designated as acts \u00aain rela-tion to environmental protection,\u00ba and their stated aim is toprotect both employees and the general public by licensing hazardous waste equipment operators and laborers workingat certain facilities. Both licensing acts require a licenseapplicant to provide a certi\u00aeed record of at least 40 hoursof training under an approved program conducted withinIllinois, to pass a written examination, and to complete an annual refresher course of at least eight hours of instruc-tion. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 111, \u00b6\u00b6 In addition, hazardous waste crane operator's license must submit\u00aaa certi\u00aeed record showing operation of equipment used inhazardous waste handling for a minimum of 4,000 hours.\u00ba\u00b6 7705(d). Employees who work without the proper license,and employers who knowingly permit an unlicensed em-ployee to work, are subject to escalating \u00aenes for eachoffense. \u00b6\u00b6 7715, 7716, 7814. The respondent in this case, National Solid Wastes Man- agement Association (Association), is a national trade asso-ciation of businesses that remove, transport, dispose, andhandle waste material, including hazardous waste. The As-sociation's members are subject to the OSH Act and OSHAregulations, and are therefore required to train, qualify, andcertify their hazardous waste remediation workers. 29CFR \u00a7 1910.120 (1991). For hazardous waste operationsconducted in Illinois, certain of the workers employed by the Association's members are also required to obtain licenses505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT 94 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Opinion of the Court pursuant to the Illinois licensing acts. Thus, for example, some of the Association's members must ensure that theiremployees receive not only the 3 days of \u00aeeld experiencerequired for certi\u00aecation under the OSHA regulations, butalso the 500 days of experience (4,000 hours) required forlicensing under the state statutes. Shortly before the state licensing acts were due to go into effect, the Association brought a declaratory judgment ac-tion in United States District Court against Bernard K illian, the former Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA); petitioner Mary Gade is K illian's successor in of\u00aece and has been substituted as a party pursuant to thisCourt's Rule 35.3. The Association sought to enjoin IEPAfrom enforcing the Illinois licensing acts, claiming that the acts were pre-empted by the OSH Act and OSHA regula-tions and that they violated the Commerce Clause of theUnited States Constitution. The District Court held thatstate laws that attempt to regulate workplace safety andhealth are not pre-empted by the OSH Act when the lawshave a \u00aalegitimate and substantial purpose apart from pro-moting job safety.\u00ba App. to Pet. for Cert. 54. Applyingthis standard, the District Court held that the Illinois licens- ing acts were not pre-empted because each protected publicsafety in addition to promoting job safety. Id., at 56\u00b157. The court indicated that it would uphold a state regulationimplementing the 4,000-hour experience requirement, as longas it did not con\u00afict with federal regulations, because it wasreasonable to conclude that workers who satisfy the require-ment \u00aawill be better skilled than those who do not; and bet-ter skilled means fewer accidents, which equals less risk topublic safety and the environment.\u00ba Id., at 59.

Because many of the regulations mandated by the Illi nois licensing acts had not yet reached their \u00aenal form, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the DistrictCourt without considering which, if any, of the Illinois provi- sions would be pre-empted. Id., at 684. The court made clear, however, its view that Illinois \u00aacannot regulate worker health and safety under the guise of environmental regula-tion,\u00ba and it rejected the District Court's conclusion that theState's 4,000-hour experience requirement could survive pre-emption simply because the rule might also enhance publichealth and safety.

S. C. \u00a7 667(a). Congress not only reserved certain areas to state regula- tion, but it also, in \u00a7 18(b) of the Act, gave the States theoption of pre-empting federal regulation entirely. That sec-tion provides: \u00aaSubmission of State plan for development and enforce- ment of State standards to preempt applicable Federalstandards. \u00aaAny State which, at any time, desires to assume re- sponsibility for development and enforcement therein ofoccupational safety and health standards relating to anyoccupational safety or health issue with respect to whicha Federal standard has been promulgated [by the Secre-tary under the OSH Act] shall submit a State plan forthe development of such standards and their enforce-ment.\u00ba 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(b). About half the States have received the Secretary's approval for their own state plans as described in this provision. 29CFR pts. 1952, 1956 (1991). Illinois is not among them. In the decision below, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 18(b) \u00aaunquestionably\u00ba pre-empts any state law or reg-ulation that establishes an occupational health and safetystandard on an issue for which OSHA has already pro-mulgated a standard, unless the State has obtained theSecretary's approval for its own plan. 918 F. 2d, at 677.Every other federal and state court confronted with an OSHAct pre-emption challenge has reached the same conclusion, 1 and so do we. 1E. g., Associated Industries of Massachus etts v.Snow, 898 F. 2d 274, 278 (CA1 1990); Environmental Encapsulating Corp. v.N e wY o r kC i t y , 855 F. 2d 48, 55 (CA2 1988); v.Brock, 258 U.

Absent explicit pre-emptive language,we have recognized at least two types of implied pre-emption: \u00aeeld pre-emption, where the scheme of federal reg-ulation is \u00aa `so pervasive as to make reasonable the inferencethat Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,' \u00baid.,at 153 (quoting Rice v.Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.

Our ultimate task in any pre-emption case is to determine whether state regulation is consistent with the structure andpurpose of the statute as a whole. Looking to \u00aathe provi-sions of the whole law, and to its object and policy,\u00ba Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.Dedeaux, 481 U.

S. 88 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. sues for which a federal standard is in effect is impliedly pre- empted as in con\u00afict with the full purposes and objectives ofthe OSH Act, Hines v.Davidowitz, supra. The design of the statute persuades us that Congress intended to subjectemployers and employees to only one set of regulations, beit federal or state, and that the only way a State may regu-late an OSHA-regulated occupational safety and health issueis pursuant to an approved state plan that displaces the fed-eral standards. The principal indication that Congress intended to pre- empt state law is \u00a7 18(b)'s statement that a State \u00aashall\u00ba sub- mit a plan if it wishes to \u00aaassume responsibility\u00ba for \u00aadevel-opment and enforcement ...o f occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety orhealth issue with respect to which a Federal standard hasbeen promulgated.\u00ba The unavoidable implication of thisprovision is that a State may not enforce its own occupationalsafety and health standards without obtaining the Secre-tary's approval, and petitioner concedes that \u00a7 18(b) wouldrequire an approved plan if Illinois wanted to \u00aaassume re- sponsibility\u00ba for the regulation of occupational safety andhealth within the State. Petitioner contends, however, thatan approved plan is necessary only if the State wishes com-pletely to replace the federal regulations, not merely to sup-plement them. She argues that the correct interpretationof \u00a7 18(b) is that posited by Judge Easterbrook below: i. e., a State may either \u00aaoust\u00ba the federal standard by submittinga state plan to the Secretary for approval or \u00aaadd to\u00ba thefederal standard without seeking the interpretation of \u00a7 18(b) might be plausible were we to interpret that provision in isolation, but it simplyis not tenable in light of the OSH Act's surrounding provi-sions. \u00aa[W]e must not be guided by a single sentence ormember of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the wholelaw.\u00ba Dedeaux, supra, at 51 (internal OPINPGT 100 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. citations omitted). The OSH Act as a whole evidences Con- gress' intent to avoid subjecting workers and employers toduplicative regulation; a State may develop an occupationalsafety and health program tailored to its own needs, but onlyif it is willing completely to displace the applicable federal regulations. Cutting against petitioner's interpretation of \u00a7 18(b) is the language of \u00a7 18(a), which saves from pre-emption any statelaw regulating an occupational safety and health issue withrespect to which no federal standard is in effect. 29 U. S. C.\u00a7 667(a). Although this is a saving clause, not a pre-emption clause, the natural implication of this provision is that statelaws regulating the same issue as federal laws are not saved,even if they merely supplement the federal standard. More-over, if petitioner's reading of \u00a7 18(b) were correct, and ifa State were free to enact noncon\u00aficting safety and healthregulations, then \u00a7 18(a) would be super\u00afuous: There is nopossibility of con\u00afict where there is no federal regulation.Because \u00aa[i]t is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to everyclause and word of a statute,' \u00ba United States v.Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538\u00b1539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v.Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883)), we conclude that \u00a7 18(a)'s preserva-tion of state authority in the absence of a federal standardpresupposes a background pre-emption of all state occupa-tional safety and health standards whenever a federal stand-ard governing the same issue is in effect. Our understanding of the implications of \u00a7 18(b) is likewise bolstered by \u00a7 18(c) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(c), which setsforth the conditions that must be satis\u00aeed before the Secre-tary can approve a plan submitted by a State under subsec-tion (b). State standards that affect interstate commercewill be approved only if they \u00aaare required by compe lling local conditions\u00ba and \u00aado not unduly burden interstate com-merce.\u00ba \u00a7 667(c)(2). If a State could supplement federalregulations without undergoing the \u00a7 18(b) approval process,then the com-505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 101 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. merce would easily be undercut. It would make little sense to impose such a condition on state programs intended tosupplant federal regulation and not those that merely supple-ment it: The burden on interstate commerce remains thesame. Section 18(f) also con\u00aerms our view that States are not permitted to assume an enforcement role without the Secre-tary's approval, unless no federal standard is in effect. Thatprovision gives the Secretary the authority to withdraw herapproval of a state plan. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(f). Once ap-proval is withdrawn, the plan \u00aacease[s] to be in effect\u00ba and the State is permitted to assert jurisdiction under its occupa-tional health and safety law only for those cases \u00aacommencedbefore the withdrawal of the plan.\u00ba continuedexercise of over purely \u00aasupplemental\u00ba andnoncon\u00aficting standards. Instead, \u00a7 18(f) assumes that theState loses the power to enforce all of its occupational safetyand health standards once approval is withdrawn. The same assumption of exclusive federal jurisdiction in the absence of an approved state plan is apparent in thetransitional provisions contained in \u00a7 18(h) of the Act. 29U. S. C. \u00a7 667(h). Section 18(h) authorized the Secretary ofLabor, during the \u00aerst two years after passage of the Act,to enter into an agreement with a State by which the Statewould be permitted to continue to enforce its own occupa-tional health and safety standards for two years or until \u00aenalaction was taken by the Secretary pursuant to \u00a7 18(b), which-ever was earlier. Signi\u00aecantly, \u00a7 18(h) does not say thatsuch an agreement is only necessary when the State wishesfully to supplant federal standards. Indeed, the originalSenate version of the provision would have allowed a Stateto enter into such an agreement only when it wished to en-force standards \u00aanot in con\u00afict with Federal occupationalhealth and safety standards,\u00ba a category which included \u00aaanyState occupational health and safety standard which pro-505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 102 GADE ASSN. Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. vides for more stringent health and safety regulations than do the Federal standards.\u00ba S. 2193, \u00a7 17(h), reprinted in 116Cong. Rec. 37637 (1970). Although that provision was elimi-nated from the \u00aenal draft of the bill, thereby allowing agree-ments for the temporary enforcement of less stringent statestandards, it is indicative of the congressional understandingthat a State was required to enter into a transitional agree-ment even when its standards were stricter than federalstandards. The Secretary's contemporaneous interpreta-tion of \u00a7 1901.2 (1972) (\u00aaSection 18(h) permits the Secretary to provide an alternative to the exclusive Federal jurisdiction [over] occupational safety and health issue[s]. This alterna-tive is temporary and may be considered a step toward themore permanent alternative to exclusive Federal jurisdic- tion provided by sections 18(b) and (c) following submission and approval of a plan submitted by a State for the develop-ment and enforcement of occupational safety and healthstandards\u00ba) (emphases added). Looking at the provisions of \u00a7 18 as a whole, we conclude that the OSH Act precludes any state regulation of an occu-pational safety or health issue with respect to which a fed-eral standard has been established, unless a state plan hasbeen submitted and approved pursuant to \u00a7 18(b). Our re-view of the Act persuades us that Congress sought to pro-mote occupational safety and health while at the same timeavoiding duplicative, and possibly counterproductive, regula-tion. It thus established a system of uniform federal occu-pational health and safety standards, but gave States theoption of pre-empting federal regulations by developing theirown occupational safety and health programs. In addition,Congress offered the States substantial federal grant moneysto assist them in developing their own programs. See OSHAct \u00a7 23, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 672(a), (b), and (f) (for three yearsfollowing enactment, the Secretary may award up to 90% ofthe costs to a State of developing a state occupational safety505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 103 Cite as: 505 U.

C. \u00a7 672(g) (States that develop ap- proved plans may receive funding for up to 50% of the costsof operating their occupational health and safety programs).To allow a State selectively to \u00aasupplement\u00ba certain federalregulations with ostensibly noncon\u00aficting standards wouldbe inconsistent with this federal scheme of establishing uni-form federal standards, on the one hand, and encouragingStates to assume full responsibility for development and en-forcement of their own OSH programs, on the other. We cannot accept petitioner's argument that the OSH Act does not pre-empt noncon\u00aficting state laws because those laws, like the Act, are designed to promote worker safety.In determining whether state law \u00aastands as an obstacle\u00ba tothe full implementation of a federal law, Hines v.Davido- witz, 312 U. S., at 67, \u00aait is not enough to say that the ulti- mate goal of both federal and state law\u00ba is the same, Inter- national Paper Co. v.Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987). \u00aaA state law also is pre-empted if it interferes with the meth-ods by which the federal statute was designed to reach th[at]goal.\u00ba Ibid.; see also Michigan Canners & Freezers Assn., Inc. v.Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467 U. S. 461, 477 (1984) (state statute establishing association torepresent agricultural producers pre-empted even though itand the federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act \u00aashare thegoal of augmenting the producer's bargaining power\u00ba); Wis- consin of Industry v.Gould Inc., 475 U.

The OSH Act doesnot foreclose a State from enacting its own laws to advancethe goal of worker safety, but it does restrict the ways inwhich it can do so. If a State wishes to regulate an issue ofworker safety for which a federal standard is in effect, its505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 104 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Opinion of the Court only option is to obtain the prior approval of the Secretary of Labor, as described in \u00a7 18 of the Act.2 III Petitioner next argues that, even if Congress intended to pre-empt all nonapproved state occupational safety andhealth regulations whenever a federal standard is in effect,the OSH Act's pre-emptive effect should not be extended tostate laws that address public safety as well as occupationalsafety concerns. As we explained in Part II, we understand 2Justice Kennedy , while agreeing on the pre-emptive scope of the OSH Act, \u00aends that its pre-emption is express rather than implied. Post, at 112 ( Kennedy, J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The Court's previous observation that our pre-emption categories are not\u00aarigidly distinct,\u00ba English v.General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79, n. 5 (1990), is proved true by this case. We, too, are persuaded that the textof the Act provides the strongest indication that Congress intended thepromulgation of a federal safety and health standard to pre-empt all non-approved state regulation of the same issue, but we cannot say that itrises to the level of express pre-emption. In the end, even Justice Ken- nedy \u00aends express pre-emption by relying on the negative \u00aainference\u00ba of \u00a7 18(b), which governs when state law will pre-empt federal law. Post, at 112. We cannot agree that the negative implications of the text, althoughultimately dispositive to our own analysis, expressly address the issue of federal pre-emption of state law. We therefore prefer to place this casein the category of implied pre-emption. Supra, at 98\u00b199. Although we have chosen to use the term \u00aacon\u00afict\u00ba pre-emption, we could as easilyhave stated that the promulgation of a federal safety and health standard\u00aapre-empts the \u00aeeld\u00ba for any nonapproved state law regulating the samesafety and health issue. See English, supra, at 79\u00b180, n. 5 (\u00aa[F]ield pre- emption may be understood as a species of con\u00afict pre-emption: A statelaw that falls within a pre-empted \u00aeeld con\u00aficts with Congress' intent(either express or plainly implied) to exclude state regulation\u00ba); post, at 116 ( Souter, J. , dissenting). Frequently, the pre-emptive \u00aalabel\u00ba we choose will carry with it substantive implications for the scope of pre- emption. In this case, however, it does not. Our disagreement with Jus- tice Kennedy as to whether the OSH Act's pre-emptive effect is labeled \u00aaexpress\u00ba or \u00aaimplied\u00ba is less important than our agreement that the im-plications of the text of the statute evince a congressional intent to pre-empt nonapproved state regulations when a federal standard is in effect.505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 105 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Opinion of the Court \u00a7 18(b) to mean that the OSH Act pre-empts all state \u00aaoccu- pational safety and health standards relating to any occupa-tional safety or health issue with respect to which a Federalstandard has been promulgated.\u00ba 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(b). Wenow consider whether a dual impact law can be an \u00aaoccupa-tional safety and health standard\u00ba subject to pre-emptionunder the Act. The OSH Act de\u00aenes an \u00aaoccupational safety and health standard\u00ba as \u00aaa standard which requires conditions, or theadoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods,operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appro-priate to provide safe or healthful employment and places ofemployment.\u00ba 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 652(8). Any state law require-ment designed to promote health and safety in the workplacefalls neatly within the Act's de\u00aenition of an \u00aaoccupationalsafety and health standard.\u00ba Clearly, under this de\u00aenition,a state law that expressly declares a legislative purpose ofregulating occupational health and safety would, in the ab-sence of an approved state plan, be pre-empted by an OSHAstandard regulating the same subject matter. But peti-tioner asserts that if the state legislature articulates a pur-pose other than (or in addition to) workplace health andsafety, then the OSH Act loses its pre-emptive force. Wedisagree. Although \u00aapart of the pre-empted \u00aeeld is de\u00aened by refer- ence to the purpose of the state law in question, . . . anotherpart of the state law's actual effect.\u00baEnglish v.General Electric Co., 496 U.

In assessing the impact of a state law on the federalscheme, we have refused to rely solely on the legislature'sprofessed purpose and have looked as well to the effects ofthe law. As we explained over two decades ago: \u00aaWe can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine . . . that state law may frustrate federal505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 106 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Our precedents leave no doubt that a dual impact state regulation cannot avoid OSH Act pre-emption simply be-cause the regulation serves several objectives rather thanone. As the Court of Appeals observed, \u00aa[i]t would defeatthe purpose of section 18 if a state could enact measuresstricter than OSHA's and largely accomplished through regu-lation of worker health and safety simply by asserting a non-occupational purpose for the legislation.\u00ba 918 F. 2d, at 679.505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 107 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Opinion of the Court Whatever the purpose or purposes of the state law, pre- emption analysis cannot ignore the effect of the challengedstate action on the pre-empted \u00aeeld. The key question isthus at what point the state regulation suf\u00aeciently interfereswith federal regulation that it should be deemed pre-emptedunder the Act. InEnglish v.General Electric Co., supra, we held that a state tort claim brought by an employee of a nuclear-fuelsproduction facility against her employer was not pre-emptedby a federal whistle-blower provision because the state lawdid not have a \u00aadirect and substantial effect\u00ba on the federal scheme. Id.,at 85. In the decision below, the Court of Ap- peals relied on English to hold that, in the absence of the approval of the Secretary, the OSH Act pre-empts all statelaw that \u00aaconstitutes, in a direct, clear and substantial way,regulation of worker health and safety.\u00ba 918 F. 2d, at 679.We agree that this is the appropriate standard for determin-ing OSH Act pre-emption. On the other hand, state laws ofgeneral applicability (such as laws regarding traf\u00aec safety or\u00aere safety) that do not con\u00afict with OSHA standards andthat regulate the conduct of workers and nonworkers alikewould generally not be pre-empted. Although some laws ofgeneral applicability may have a \u00aadirect and substantial\u00ba ef-fect on worker safety, they cannot fairly be characterizedas \u00aaoccupational\u00ba standards, because they regulate workerssimply as members of the general public. In this case, weagree with the court below that a law directed at workplacesafety is not saved from pre-emption simply because theState can demonstrate some additional effect outside of theworkplace. In sum, a state law requirement that directly, substan- tially, and speci\u00aecally regulates occupational safety andhealth is an occupational safety and health standard withinthe meaning of the Act. That such a law may also have anonoccupational impact does not render it any less of an oc-cupational standard for purposes of pre-emption analysis.505us1$97L 07-15-96 108 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Opinion of the Court If the State wishes to enact a dual impact law that regulates an occupational safety or health issue for which a federalstandard is in effect, \u00a7 18 of the Act requires that the Statesubmit a plan for the approval of the Secretary. IV We recognize that \u00aathe States have a compe lling i nterest in the practice of professions within their boundaries, andthat as part of their power to protect the public health,safety, and other valid interests they have broad power toestablish standards for licensing practitioners and regulatingthe practice of professions.\u00ba Goldfarb v.Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792 (1975); see also Ferguson v.Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 731 (1963); Dent v.West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 122 (1889). But under the Supremacy Clause, fromwhich our pre-emption doctrine is derived, \u00aa `any state law,however clearly within a State's acknowledged power, whichinterferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.' \u00baFelder v.Casey, 487 U. S., at 138 (quoting Free v.Bland, 369 U. S. 663, 666 (1962)); see also De Canas v.Bica, 424 U. S. 351, 357 (1976) (\u00aa[E]ven state regulation designed to protectvital state interests must give way to paramount federal leg-islation\u00ba). We therefore reject petitioner's argument thatthe State's interest in licensing various occupations can savefrom OSH Act pre-emption those provisions that directly andsubstantially affect workplace safety. We also reject petitioner's argument that the Illinois li- censing acts do not regulate occupational safety and healthat all, but are instead a \u00aapre-condition\u00ba to employment. Bythat reasoning, the OSHA regulations themselves wouldnot be considered occupational standards. SARA, how-ever, makes clear that the training of employees engaged inhazardous waste operations is an occupational safety andhealth issue, and that certi\u00aecation requirements before anemployee may engage in such work are occupational safetyand health standards.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby Af\u00aermed. Justice Kennedy , concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Though I concur in the Court's judgment and with the ulti- mate conclusion that the state law is pre-empted, I would\u00aend express pre-emption from the terms of the federal stat-ute. I cannot agree that we should denominate this case asone of implied pre-emption. The contrary view of the plu-rality is based on an undue expansion of our implied pre-emption jurisprudence which, in my view, is neither wisenor necessary. As both the majority and dissent acknowledge, we have identi\u00aeed three circumstances in which a federal statute pre-empts state law: First, Congress can adopt express languagede\u00aening the existence and scope of pre-emption. Second,state law is pre-empted where Congress creates a schemeof federal regulation so pervasive as to leave no room forsupplementary state regulation. And third, \u00aastate law ispre-empted to the extent that it actually con\u00aficts with fed-eral law.\u00ba English v.General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 78\u00b179 (1990); ante, at 98; post, at 115. This of pre-emption, so-called actual con\u00afict pre-emption, occurseither \u00aawhere it is impossible for a private party to complywith both state and federal requirements . . . or where statelaw `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-tion of the full purposes and objectives of 07-15-96 MANAGEMENT ASSN. Opinion of Kennedy, J. lish, supra, at 79 (quoting Hines v.Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)). The plurality would hold today that state occu-pational safety and health standards regulating an issue onwhich a federal standard exists con\u00afict with Congress' pur-pose to \u00aasubject employers and employees to only one set ofregulations.\u00ba Ante, at 99. This is not an application of our pre-emption standards, it is but a conclusory statement ofpre-emption, as it assumes that Congress intended exclusivefederal jurisdiction. I do not see how such a mode of analy-sis advances our consideration of the case. Our decisions establish that a high threshold must be met if a state law is to be pre-empted for con\u00aficting with thepurposes of a federal Act. Any con\u00afict must be \u00aairreconcil-able . . . . The existence of a hypothetical or potential con-\u00afict is insuf\u00aecient to warrant the pre-emption of the statestatute.\u00ba Rice v.Norman Williams Co., 458 U. S. 654, 659 (1982); see also English, supra, at 90 (\u00aaThe `teaching of this Court's decision s...e n j o i n [ s ] seeking out con\u00aficts between state and federal regulation where none clearly exists' \u00ba(quoting Huron Portland Cement Co. v.Detroit, 362 U.

In my view, this type of pre-emptionshould be limited to state laws which impose prohibitionsor obligations which are in direct contradiction to Congress'primary objectives, as conveyed with clarity in the federallegislation. I do not believe that supplementary state regulation of an occupational safety and health issue can be said to create thesort of actual con\u00afict required by our decisions. The pur-pose of state supplementary regulation, like the federalstandards promulgated by the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA), is to protect worker safetyand health. Any potential tension between a scheme of fed-eral regulation of the workplace and a concurrent, supple-mentary state scheme would not, in my view, rise to the level505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 111 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Opinion of Kennedy, J. of \u00aaactual con\u00afict\u00ba described in our pre-emption cases. Ab- sent the express provisions of \u00a7 18 of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667, I wouldnot say that state supplementary regulation con\u00aficts withthe purposes of the OSH Act, or that it \u00aa `interferes with themethods by which the federal statute was designed to reach[its] goal.' \u00ba Ante, at 103 (quoting International Paper Co. v.Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987)). The plurality's broad view of actual con\u00afict pre-emption is contrary to two basic principles of our pre-emption jurispru-dence. First, we begin \u00aawith the assumption that the his- toric police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded. . . unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con-gress.\u00ba Rice v.Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see also ante, at 96. Second, \u00aa `[t]he purpose of Con- gress is the ultimate touchstone' \u00ba in all pre-emption cases.Malone v.White Motor Corp., S. 497, 504 (1978) (quot- ingRetail Clerks v.Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103 (1963)). A freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statuteis in tension with federal objectives would undercut the prin-ciple that it is Congress rather than the courts that pre-empts state law. Nonetheless, I agree with the Court that \u00aathe OSH Act pre-empts all state `occupational safety and health standardsrelating to any occupational safety or health issue with re-spect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated.' \u00baAnte, at 105 (quoting 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(b)). I believe, how- ever, that this result is mandated by the express terms of\u00a7 18(b) of the OSH Act. It follows from this that the pre-emptive scope of the Act is also limited to the language ofthe statute. When the existence of pre-emption is evidentfrom the statutory text, our inquiry must begin and end withthe statutory framework itself. A \u00aending of express pre-emption in this case is not con- trary to our longstanding rule that we will not infer pre-emption of the States' historic police powers absent a clear505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 112 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.

Though most statutes creating express pre-emption contain an explicit statementto that effect, a statement admittedly lacking in \u00a7 18(b), wehave never required any particular magic words in our ex-press pre-emption cases. Our task in all pre-emption casesis to enforce the \u00aaclear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u00baRice v.Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, at 230. We have held, in express pre-emption cases, that Congress' intentmust be divined from the language, structure, and purposesof the statute as a whole. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.McClen- don, 498 U. S. 133, 138 (1990); Pilot Life Ins. Co. v.Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 51 (1987). The language of the OSH statutesets forth a scheme in light of which the provisions of \u00a7 18must be interpreted, and from which the express pre-emption that displaces state law follows. As the plurality's analysis amply demonstrates, ante, at 98\u00b1103, Congress has addressed the issue of pre-emptionin the OSH Act. The dissent's position that the Act doesnot pre-empt supplementary state regulation becomes mostimplausible when the language of \u00a7 18(b) is considered inconjunction with the other provisions of \u00a7 18. Section 18(b)provides as follows: \u00aaAny State which . . . desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement therein of occupa-tional safety and health standards relating to any occu-pational safety or health issue with respect to which aFederal standard has been promulgated . . . shall submit a State plan .... \u00ba 2 9U .S .C .\u00a7 667(b) (emphasis added). The statute is clear: When a State desires to assume respon- sibility for an occupational safety and health issue alreadyaddressed by the Federal Government, it must submit astate plan. The most reasonable inference from this lan-guage is that when a State does not submit and secure ap-505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 113 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Opinion of Kennedy, J. proval of a state plan, it may not enforce occupational safety and health standards in that area. Any doubt that this iswhat Congress intended disappears when subsection (b) isconsidered in conjunction with subsections (a), (c), and (f).Ante, at 100\u00b1101. I will not reiterate the plurality's persua- sive discussion on this point. Unartful though the languageof \u00a7 18(b) may be, the structure and language of \u00a7 18 leavelittle doubt that in the OSH statute Congress intended topre-empt supplementary state regulation of an occupationalsafety and health issue with respect to which a federal stand-ard exists. In this regard I disagree with the dissent, see post, p. 114, and \u00aend unconvincing its conclusion that Congress intendedto allow concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over occu-pational safety and health issues. The dissent would givethe States, rather than the Federal Government, the powerto decide whether as to any particular occupational safetyand health issue there will exist a single or dual regulatoryscheme. Under this theory the State may choose exclusivefederal jurisdiction by not regulating; or exclusive statejurisdiction by submitting a state plan; or dual regulationby adopting supplementary rules, as Illinois did here. That position undermines the authority of OSHA in many re-spects. For example, \u00a7 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act allowsOSHA to disapprove state plans which \u00aaunduly burden inter-state commerce.\u00ba The dissent would eviscerate this impor-tant administrative mechanism by allowing the States tosidestep OSHA's authority through the mechanism of supple-mentary regulation. See post, at 118\u00b1121. Furthermore, concurrent state and federal jurisdiction might interferewith the enforcement of the federal regulations without cre-ating a situation where compliance with both schemes is aphysical impossibility, which the dissent would require forpre-emption. Post, at 121; see also Brief for Respondent 32\u00b133. I would not attribute to Congress the intent to cre-ate such a hodgepodge scheme of authority. My views in505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 114 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Souter, J., dissenting this regard are con\u00aermed by the fact that OSHA has as a consistent matter, since the enactment of the OSH Act,viewed \u00a7 18 as providing it with exclusive jurisdiction inareas where it issues a standard. 29 CFR \u00a7 1901.2 (1991);36 Fed. Reg. States as Amicus Curiae 12\u00b121. Therefore, while the dissent may be correct that as a theoretical matter the separate provisions of \u00a7 18may be reconciled with allowing concurrent jurisdiction, itis neither a natural nor a sound reading of the statutoryscheme. The necessary implication of \u00aending express pre-emption in this case is that the pre-emptive scope of the OSH Act isde\u00aened by the language of \u00a7 18(b). Because this provisionrequires federal approval of state occupational safety and health standards alone, only state laws \u00aetting within thatdescription are pre-empted. For that reason I agree withthe Court that state laws of general applicability are not pre-empted. Ante, at 107. I also agree that \u00aaa state law re- quirement that directly, substantially, and speci\u00aecally regu-lates occupational safety and health is an occupational safetyand health standard within the meaning of the Act,\u00ba ibid., and therefore falls within the scope of pre-emption. So-called \u00aadual impact\u00ba state regulations which meet this stand-ard are pre-empted by the OSH Act, regardless of any addi-tional purpose the law may serve, or effect the law may have,outside the workplace. As a \u00aenal matter, I agree that theIllinois Acts are not saved because they operate through a licensing mechanism rather than through direct regulation ofthe workplace. I therefore join all but Part II of the Court'sopinion, and concur in the judgment of the Court. Justice Souter , with whom Justice Blackmun, Jus- tice Stevens , and Justice Thomas join, dissenting. The Court holds today that \u00a7 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667, pre-emptsstate regulation of any occupational safety or health issue as505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 115 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Souter, J., dissenting to which there is a federal standard, whether or not the state regulation con\u00aficts with the federal standard in the sensethat enforcement of one would preclude application of theother. With respect, I dissent. In light of our rule thatfederal pre-emption of state law is only to be found in a clearcongressional purpose to supplant exercises of the States'traditional police powers, the text of the Act fails to supportthe Court's conclusion. I Our cases recognize federal pre-emption of state law in three variants: Develo pment S. 190, 203 (1983), citing Jones v.Rath Pack- ing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977). Field pre-emption is wrought by a manifestation of congressional intent to occupyan entire \u00aeeld such that even without a federal rule on someparticular matter within the \u00aeeld, state regulation on thatmatter is pre-empted, leaving it untouched by either state orfederal law. 461 U. S., at 204. Finally, there is con\u00afict pre-emption in either of two senses. The \u00aerst is found whencompliance with both state and federal law is impossible,ibid., the second when a state law \u00aastands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes andobjectives of Congress,\u00ba Hines v.Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). The plurality today \u00aends pre-emption of this last sort, dis- cerning a con\u00afict between any state legislation on a givenissue as to which a federal standard is in effect, and a con-gressional purpose \u00aato subject employers and employees toonly one set of regulations.\u00ba Ante, at 99. Thus, under the plurality's reading, any regulation on an issue as to which afederal standard has been promulgated has been pre-empted.As one commentator has observed, this kind of purpose-con\u00afict pre-emption, which occurs when state law is held to505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 116 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Souter, J., dissenting \u00aaundermin[e] a congressional decision in favor of national uniformity of standards,\u00ba presents \u00aaa situation similar inpractical effect to that of federal occupation of a \u00aeeld.\u00ba L.Tribe, American Constitutional Law 486 (2d ed. 1988). Still,whether the pre-emption at issue is described as occupationof each narrow \u00aeeld in which a federal standard has beenpromulgated, as pre-emption of those regulations that con-\u00afict with the federal objective of single regulation, or, asJustice Kennedy describes it, as express pre-emption, see ante, at 111 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), the key is congressional intent, and I \u00aend thelanguage of the statute insuf\u00aecient to demonstrate an intentto pre-empt state law in this way. II Analysis begins with the presumption that \u00aaCongress did not intend to displace state law.\u00ba Maryland v.Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981). \u00aaWhere, as here, the \u00aeeld whichCongress is said to have pre-empted has been traditionallyoccupied by the States, see, e. g., U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10; Patapsco Guano Co. v.North Carolina, 171 U. S. 345, 358 (1898), `we start with the assumption that the historic policepowers of the States were not to be superseded by the Fed-eral Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose ofCongress.' Rice v.Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). This assumption provides assurance that the`federal-state balance,' United States v.Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971), will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congressor unnecessarily by the courts. But when Congress has `un-mistakabl y... ordained,' Florida Lime & Avocado Gr owers, Inc. v.Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142 (1963), that its enactments alone are to regulate a part of commerce, state laws regulat-ing that aspect of commerce must fall.\u00ba Jones, supra, at 525. Subject to this principle, the enquiry into the possiblypre-emptive effect of federal legislation is an exercise of stat-utory construction. If the statute's terms can be read sensi-505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 117 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Souter, J., dissenting bly not to have a pre-emptive effect, the presumption con- trols and no pre-emption may be inferred. III At \u00aerst blush, respondent's strongest argument might seem to rest on \u00a7 18(a) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(a), the fulltext of which is this: \u00aa(a) Assertion of State standards in absence of applica- ble Federal standards \u00aaNothing in this chapter shall prevent any State agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under Statelaw over any occupational safety or health issue withrespect to which no standard is in effect under section655 of this title.\u00ba That is to say, where there is no federal standard in effect, there is no pre-emption. The plurality reasons that theremust be pre-emption, however, when there is a federal stand-ard in effect, else \u00a7 18(a) would be rendered super\u00afuous be-cause \u00aa[t]here is no possibility of con\u00afict where there is nofederal regulation.\u00ba Ante, at 100. The plurality errs doubly. First, its premise is incorrect. In the sense in which the plurality uses the term, there isthe possibility of \u00aacon\u00afict\u00ba even absent federal regulationsince the mere enactment of a federal law like the Act mayamount to an occupation of an entire \u00aeeld, preventing stateregulation. Second, the necessary implication of \u00a7 18(a) isnot that every federal regulation pre-empts all state law onthe issue in question, but only that some federal regulationsmay pre-empt some state law. The plurality ignores thepossibility that the provision simply rules out \u00aeeld pre-emption and is otherwise entirely compatible with the possi-bility that pre-emption will occur only when actual con\u00afictbetween a federal regulation and a state rule renders compli-ance with both impossible. Indeed, if Congress had meantto say that any state rule should be pre-empted if it deals505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 118 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Souter, J., dissenting with an issue as to which there is a federal regulation in effect, the text of subsection (a) would have been a veryinept way of trying to make the point. It was not, however,an inept way to make the different point that Congress in-tended no \u00aeeld pre-emption of the sphere of health and safetysubject to regulation, but not necessarily regulated, underthe Act. Unlike the case where \u00aeeld pre-emption occurs,the provision tells us, absence of a federal standard leaves aState free to do as it will on the issue. Beyond this, subsec-tion (a) does not necessarily mean anything, and the provi-sion is perfectly consistent with the conclusion that as longas compliance with both a federal standard and a state regu-lation is not physically impossible, see Florida Lime & Avo- cado Gr owers, Inc. v.Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142\u00b1143 (1963), each standard shall be enforceable. If, indeed, the presump-tion against pre-emption means anything, \u00a7 18(a) must beread in just this way. Respondent also relies on \u00a7 18(b), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(b): \u00aa(b) Submission of State plan for development and en- forcement of State standards to preempt applicable Fed-eral standards \u00aaAny State which, at any time, desires to assume re- sponsibility for development and enforcement therein ofoccupational safety and health standards relating to anyoccupational safety or health issue with respect to whicha Federal standard has been promulgated under section655 of this title shall submit a State plan for the develop-ment of such standards and their enforcement.\u00ba Respondent argues that the necessary implication of this provision is clear: the only way that a state rule on a particu-lar occupational safety and health issue may be enforced oncea federal standard on the issue is also in place is by incorpo-rating the state rule in a plan approved by the Secretary. As both the plurality and Justice Kennedy acknowledge, however, that is not the necessary implication of \u00a7 18(b).505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 119 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Souter, J., dissenting See ante, at 99 (plurality opinion); ante, at 112\u00b1113 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The sub-section simply does not say that unless a plan is approved,state law on an issue is pre-empted by the promulgation ofa federal standard. In fact it tugs the other way, and inactually providing a mechanism for a State to \u00aaassume re-sponsibility\u00ba for an issue with respect to which a federalstandard has been promulgated (that is, to pre-empt federallaw), \u00a7 18(b) is far from pre-emptive of anything adopted bythe States. Its heading, enacted as part of the statute andproperly considered under our canons of construction for whatever light it may shed, see, e. g., Strathearn S. S. Co. v. Dillon, 252 U. S. 348, 354 (1920); FTC v.Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385 (1959), speaks expressly of the \u00aadevelop- ment and enforcement of State standards to preempt applica-ble Federal standards.\u00ba The provision does not in any wayprovide that absent such state pre-emption of federal rules,the State may not even supplement the federal standardswith consistent regulations of its own. Once again, nothingin the provision's language speaks one way or the other tothe question whether promulgation of a federal standard pre-empts state regulation, or whether, in the absence of a plan,consistent federal and state regulations may coexist. Theprovision thus makes perfect sense on the assumption that adual regulatory scheme is permissible but subject to statepre-emption if the State wishes to shoulder enough of thefederal mandate to gain approval of a plan. Nor does the provision setting out conditions for the Sec- retary's approval of a plan indicate that a state regulationon an issue federally addressed is never enforceable unlessincorporated in a plan so approved. Subsection (c)(2) re-quires the Secretary to approve a plan when in her judg-ment, among other things, it will not \u00aaunduly burdeninterstate commerce.\u00ba 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(c)(2). Respondentargues, and the plurality concludes, that if state regulationswere not pre-empted, this provision would somehow suggest505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 120 GADE v.NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN. Souter, J., dissenting that States acting independently could enforce regulations that did burden interstate commerce unduly. Brief for Re-spondent 17; see ante, at 100\u00b1101. But this simply does not follow. The subsection puts a limit on the Secretary's au-thority to approve a plan that burdens interstate commerce,thus capping the discretion that might otherwise have beenread into the congressional delegation of authority to theSecretary to approve state plans. From this restrictionapplying only to the Secretary's federal authority it is clearlya non sequitur to conclude that pre-emption must have beenintended to avoid the equally objectionable undue burdenthat independent state regulation might otherwise impose.Quite the contrary; the dormant Commerce Clause can takecare of that, without any need to assume pre-emption. The \u00aenal provision that arguably suggests pre-emption merely by promulgation of a federal standard is \u00a7 18(h), 29U. S. C. \u00a7 667(h): \u00aa(h) Temporary enforcement of State standards \u00aaThe Secretary may enter into an agreement with a State under which the State will be permitted to con-tinue to enforce one or more occupational health andsafety standards in effect in such State until \u00aenal actionis taken by the Secretary with respect to a plan sub-mitted by a State under subsection (b) of this section,or two years from December 29, 1970, whichever isearlier.\u00ba This provision of course expired in 1972, but its language may suggest something about the way Congress understoodthe rest of \u00a7 18. Since, all are agreed, a State would not have had reason to \u00aele a plan unless a federal standard wasin place, \u00a7 18(h) necessarily refers to a situation in whichthere is a federal standard. Respondent argues that theprovision for agreements authorizing continued enforcementof a state standard following adoption of a federal standardon the issue it addresses implies that, absent such agree-505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT 121 Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992) Souter, J., dissenting ment, a State would have been barred from enforcing any standard of its own. Once again, however, that is not the necessary implication of the text. A purely permissive provision for enforcementof state regulations does not imply that all state regulationsare otherwise unenforceable. All it necessarily means isthat the Secretary could agree to permit the State for a lim-ited time to enforce whatever state regulations would other-wise have been pre-empted, as would have been true whenthey actually so con\u00aficted with the federal standard that anemployer could not comply with them and still comply withfederal law as well. Thus, in the case of a State wishing tosubmit a plan, the provision as I read it would have allowedfor the possibility of just one transition, from the pre-Actstate law to the post-Act state plan. Read as the Courtreads it, however, employers and employees in such a Statewould have been subjected \u00aerst to state law on a given issue;then, after promulgation of a federal standard, to that stand-ard; and then, after approval of the plan, to a new state re-gime. One enforced readjustment would have been betterthan two, and the statute is better read accordingly.* IV In sum, our rule is that the traditional police powers of the State survive unless Congress has made a purpose to *The plurality also relies on \u00a7 18(f), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 667(f), which deals with withdrawal of approval of a state plan. See ante, at 101. The section provides that \u00aathe State may retain jurisdiction in any case commencedbefore the withdrawal of the plan in order to enforce standards under theplan whenever the issues involved do not relate to the reasons for thewithdrawal of the plan.\u00ba The plurality is mistaken in concluding that\u00a7 18(f) \u00aaassumes that the State loses the power to enforce all of its occupa-tional safety and health standards once approval is withdrawn.\u00ba Ibid. At most it assumes that the State loses its capacity to enforce the plan(except for pending cases).

The Act does not, in so many words, pre-empt all state regulation ofissues on which federal standards have been promulgated,and respondent's contention at oral argument that readingsubsections (a), (b), and (h) could leave no other \u00aalogical\u00baconclusion but one of pre-emption is wrong. Each provisioncan be read consistently with the others without any implica-tion of pre-emptive intent. See National Solid Wastes Management Assn. v.Killian, 918 F. 2d 671, 685\u00b1688 (CA7 1990) (Easterbrook, J., dubitante ). They are in fact just as consistent with a purpose and objective to permit overlap-ping state and federal regulation as with one to guaranteethat employers and employees would be subjected to onlyone regulatory regime. Restriction to one such regime byprecluding supplemental state regulation might or might notbe desirable. But in the absence of any clear expression ofcongressional intent to pre-empt, I can only conclude that, aslong as compliance with federally promulgated standardsdoes not render obedience to Illinois' regulations impossible, the enforcement of the state law is not prohibited by theSupremacy Clause.

Argued March 31, 1992\u00d0Decided June 19, 1992 Petitioner county's Ordinance 34 mandates permits for private demonstra- tions and other uses of public property; declares that the cost of protect-ing participants in such activities exceeds the usual and normal cost oflaw enforcement and should be borne by the participants; requires everypermit applicant to pay a fee of not more than $1,000; and empowers thecounty administrator to adjust the fee's amount to meet the expenseincident to the ordinance's administration and to the maintenance ofpublic order. After the county attempted to impose such a fee for re-spondent's proposed demonstration in opposition to the Martin LutherKing, Jr., federal holiday, respondent \u00aeled this suit, claiming that theordinance violates the free speech guarantees of the First and Four-teenth Amendments. The District Court denied relief, ruling that theordinance was not unconstitutional as applied in this case. The Courtof Appeals reversed, holding that an ordinance which charges more than a nominal fee for using public forums for public issue speech is faciallyunconstitutional. Held: The ordinance is facially invalid. Pp. 129\u00b1137. (a) In order to regulate competing uses of public forums, government may impose a permit requirement on those wishing to hold a march,parade, or rally, if, inter alia, the permit scheme does not delegate overly broad licensing discretion to a government of\u00aecial, Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 56, and is not based on the content of the mes- sage, see United States v.Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. Pp. 129\u00b1130. (b) An examination of the county's implementation and authoritative constructions of the ordinance demonstrates the absence of the constitu-tionally required \u00aanarrowly drawn, reasonable and de\u00aenite standards,\u00baNiemotko v.Maryland, 340 U.

The decision how much tocharge for police protection or administrative time\u00d0or even whether tocharge at all\u00d0is left to the unbridled discretion of the administrator,who is not required to rely on objective standards or provide any expla-nation for his decision. Pp. 130\u00b1133.

In 1912, in one month, its en- tire African-American population, over 1,000 citizens, wasdriven systematically from the county in the wake of therape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of heraccused assailant. 1Seventy-\u00aeve years later, in 1987, the county population remained 99% white.2 Spurred by this history, Hosea W illiams, an Atlanta city councilman and civil rights personality, proposed a ForsythCounty \u00aaMarch Against Fear and Intimidation\u00ba for Janu-ary 17, 1987. Approximately 90 civil rights demonstratorsattempted to parade in Cumming, the county seat. Themarchers were met by members of the Forsyth CountyDefense League (an independent af\u00aeliate of respondent,The Nationalist Movement), of the Ku Klux Klan, and otherCumming residents. In all, some 400 counterdemonstratorslined the parade route, shouting racial slurs. Eventually,the counterdemonstrators, dramatically outnumbering policeof\u00aecers, forced the parade to a premature halt by throwingrocks and beer bottles. Williams planned a return march the following weekend. It developed into the largest civil rights demonstration inthe South since the 1960's. On January 24, approximately20,000 marchers joined civil rights leaders, United StatesSenators, Presidential candidates, and an Assistant UnitedStates Attorney General in a parade and rally. 3The 1,000 counterdemonstrators on the parade route were contained 1The 1910 census counted 1,098 African-Americans in Forsyth County.

The fee did not include any calculation for expenses incurred by law enforcement author-ities, but was based on 10 hours of the county administrator'stime in issuing the permit.

II Respondent mounts a facial challenge to the Forsyth County ordinance. It is well established that in the area offreedom of expression an overbroad regulation may be sub-ject to facial review and invalidation, even though its applica- tion in the case under consideration may be constitutionallyunobjectionable. See, e. g., City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 798\u00b1799, and n. 15 (1984); Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v.Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 574 (1987). This exception from general standing rules is based on an appreciation that thevery existence of some broadly written laws has the poten-tial to chill the expressive activity of others not before thecourt. See, e. g., New York v.Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 772 (1982); Brockett v.Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 503 (1985). Thus, the Court has permitted a party to challengean ordinance under the overbreadth doctrine in cases whereevery application creates an impermissible risk of suppres-sion of ideas, such as an ordinance that delegates overlybroad discretion to the decisionmaker, see Thornhill v.Ala- 8Compare the Eleventh Circuit's opinions in this litigation, 913 F. 2d 885, 891 (1990), and 934 F. 2d 1482, 1483 (1991), with Stonewall Union v.

S. 601 (1973); Jews for Jesus, 482 U. S., at 574\u00b1575. The Forsyth County ordinance requiring a permit and a fee before authorizing public speaking, parades, or assem-blies in \u00aathe archetype of a traditional public forum,\u00ba Frisby v.Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 480 (1988), is a prior restraint on speech, see Shuttlesworth v.Birmingham, 394 U. S. 147, 150\u00b1151 (1969); Niemotko v.Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271 (1951). Although there is a \u00aaheavy presumption\u00ba againstthe validity of a prior restraint, Bantam Books, Inc. v.Sulli- van, 372 U. S. 58, 70 (1963), the Court has recognized that government, in order to regulate competing uses of publicforums, may impose a permit requirement on those wishingto hold a march, parade, or rally, see Cox v.New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574\u00b1576 (1941). Such a scheme, however,must meet certain constitutional requirements. It may notdelegate overly broad licensing discretion to a governmentof\u00aecial. See Freedman v.Maryland, supra. Further, any permit scheme contro lling the time, place, and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a signi\u00aecant governmen-tal interest, and must leave open ample alternatives for com-munication. See United States v.Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983). A Respondent contends that the county ordinance is facially invalid because it does not prescribe adequate standards forthe administrator to apply when he sets a permit fee. Agovernment regulation that allows arbitrary application is\u00aainherently inconsistent with a valid time, place, and mannerregulation because such discretion has the potential for be-coming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.\u00ba505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT 131 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 546, 553 (1975). In evaluating respondent's facial challenge, we must con- sider the county's authoritative constructions of the ordi-nance, including its own implementation and interpretationof it. See Ward v.Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 795\u00b1 796 (1989); Lakewood v.Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750, 770, n. 11 (1988); Gooding v.Wilson, 405 U. S. 518, 524\u00b1528 (1972). In the present litigation, the county hasmade clear how it interprets and implements the ordinance.The ordinance can apply to any activity on public property\u00d0from parades, to street corner speeches, to bike races\u00d0andthe fee assessed may re\u00afect the county's police and adminis-trative costs. Whether or not, in any given instance, the feewould include any or all of the county's administrative andsecurity expenses is decided by the county administrator. 9 9In pertinent part, the ordinance, as amended, states that the adminis- trator \u00aa shall adjust the amount to be paid in order to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenance ofpublic order.\u00ba \u00a7 3(6) (emphasis added), App. to Pet. for Cert. 119. Thiscould suggest that the administrator has no authority to reduce or waivethese expenses. It has not been so understood, however, by the county.See 934 F. 2d, at 1488, n. 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting inpart).

Although the countypaid for clerical support and staff as an \u00aaexpense incident tothe administration\u00ba of the permit, the administrator testi\u00aeedthat he chose in this instance not to include that expense inthe fee. The administrator also attested that he had delib-erately kept the fee low by undervaluing the cost of the timehe spent processing the application. Even if he had spentmore time on the project, he claimed, he would not havecharged more. He further testi\u00aeed that, in this instance, hechose not to include any charge for expected security ex-pense. Tr. 135\u00b1139. The administrator also explained that the county had im- posed a fee pursuant to a permit on two prior occasions.The year before, the administrator had assessed a fee of $100for a permit for the Movement. The administrator testi\u00aeedthat he charged the same fee the following year (the year inquestion here), although he did not state that the Movementwas seeking the same use of county property or that it re-quired the same amount of administrative time to process.Id., at 138. The administrator also once charged bike-race organizers $25 to hold a race on county roads, but he didnot explain why processing a bike-race permit demanded lessadministrative time than processing a parade permit or whyhe had chosen to assess $25 in that instance.

S. 123 (1992) Opinion of the Court \u00aanarrowly drawn, reasonable and de\u00aenite standards,\u00ba Nie- motko, 340 U. S., at 271, guiding the hand of the Forsyth County administrator. The decision how much to charge forpolice protection or administrative time\u00d0or even whether to charge at all\u00d0is left to the whim of the administrator. There are no articulated standards either in the ordinanceor in the county's established practice. The administrator isnot required to rely on any objective factors. He need notprovide any explanation for his decision, and that decision isunreviewable. Nothing in the law or its application pre-vents the of\u00aecial from encouraging some views and discour-aging others through the arbitrary application of fees. 10 The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbri-dled discretion in a government of\u00aecial. 11 B The Forsyth County ordinance contains more than the pos- sibility of censorship through uncontrolled discretion. As 10The District Court's \u00aending that in this instance the Forsyth County administrator applied legitimate, content-neutral criteria, even if correct,is irrelevant to this facial challenge. Facial attacks on the discretiongranted a decisionmaker are not dependent on the facts surrounding anyparticular permit decision. See Lakewood v.Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U. S. 750, 770 (1988). \u00aaIt is not merely the sporadic abuse of power by the censor but the pervasive threat inherent in its very existencethat constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion.\u00ba Thornhill v.Ala- bama, 310 U. S. 88, 97 (1940). Accordingly, the success of a facial chal- lenge on the grounds that an ordinance delegates overly broad discretionto the decisionmaker rests not on whether the administrator has exercisedhis discretion in a content-based manner, but whether there is anythingin the ordinance preventing him from doing so. 11Petitioner also claims that Cox v.New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941), excuses the administrator's discretion in setting the fee. Reliance on Cox is misplaced. Although the discretion granted to the administrator underthe language in this ordinance is the same as in the statute at issue inCox, the interpretation and application of that language are different. Un- like this case, there was in Cox no testimony or evidence that the statute granted unfettered discretion to the licensing authority.

The county envisions that the administrator, in appro- priate instances, will assess a fee to cover \u00aathe cost of neces-sary and reasonable protection of persons participating in orobserving said . . . activit[y].\u00ba See App. to Pet. for Cert.100.

S. 364, 383 (1984), estimate the response of others to thatcontent, and judge the number of police necessary to meetthat response. The fee assessed will depend on the adminis-trator's measure of the amount of hostility likely to be cre-ated by the speech based on its content.

When directly faced with the Court of Appeals' concern about\u00aathe enhanced cost associated with policing expressive activity whichwould generate potentially violent reactions,\u00ba id., at 36, petitioner re- sponded not by arguing that it did not intend to charge for police protec-tion, but that such a charge was permissible because the ordinance pro-vided a cap. See id.,at 36\u00b137; Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. At no point, in any level of proceedings, has petitioner intimated that it did not construe theordinance consistent with its language permitting fees to be charged forthe cost of police protection from hostile crowds. We \u00aend no disputedinterpretation of the ordinance necessitating PAGES OPINPGT 136 FORSYTH COUNTY MOVEMENT Opinion of the Court justi\u00aecation for this ordinance: raising revenue for police services. While this undoubtedly is an important govern-ment responsibility, it does not justify a content-based permitfee. See id.,at 229\u00b1231. Petitioner insists that its ordinance cannot be unconstitu- tionally content based because it contains much of the samelanguage as did the state statute upheld in Cox v.New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). Although the Supreme Court of New Hampshire had interpreted the statute atissue in Cox to authorize the municipality to charge a permit fee for the \u00aamaintenance of public order,\u00ba no fee was actuallyassessed. See id.,at 577. Nothing in this Court's opinion suggests that the statute, as interpreted by the New Hamp-shire Supreme Court, called for charging a premium in thecase of a controversial political message delivered before ahostile audience. In light of the Court's subsequent FirstAmendment jurisprudence, we do not read Cox to permit such a premium. C Petitioner, as well as the Court of Appeals and the District Court, all rely on the maximum allowable fee as the touch-stone of constitutionality. Petitioner contends that the$1,000 cap on the fee ensures that the ordinance will notresult in content-based discrimination. The ordinance wasfound unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals because the$1,000 cap was not suf\u00aeciently low to be \u00aanominal.\u00ba Neitherthe $1,000 cap on the fee charged, nor even some lower nomi-nal cap, could save the ordinance because in this context, thelevel of the fee is irrelevant. A tax based on the content ofspeech does not become more constitutional because it is asmall tax. The lower courts derived their requirement that the per- mit fee be \u00aanominal\u00ba from a sentence in the opinion in Mur- dock v.Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943). In Murdock, the Court invalidated a \u00afat license fee levied on distributors ofreligious literature. In distinguishing the case from Cox,505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 137 Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992) Rehnquist, C.

S., at 116. This sentence does not mean that an in-valid fee can be saved if it is nominal, or that only nominalcharges are constitutionally permissible. It re\u00afects merelyone distinction between the facts in Murdock and those in Cox. The tax at issue in Murdock was invalid because it was unrelated to any legitimate state interest, not because it wasof a particular size. Similarly, the provision of the ForsythCounty ordinance relating to fees is invalid because it uncon-stitutionally ties the amount of the fee to the content of thespeech and lacks adequate procedural safeguards; no limit onsuch a fee can remedy these constitutional violations. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is af\u00aermed. It is so ordered. Chief Justice Rehnquist , with whom Justice White , Justice Scalia , and Justice Thomas join, dissenting. We granted certiorari in this case to consider the follow- ing question: \u00aaWhether the provisions of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution limit the amount of a li-cense fee assessed pursuant to the provisions of a countyparade ordinance to a nominal sum or whether theamount of the license fee may take into account the ac-tual expense incident to the administration of the ordi-nance and the maintenance of public order in the matterlicensed, up to the sum of $1,000.00 per day of the activ-ity.\u00ba Pet. for Cert. i.

The rest of the opinion505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 138 FORSYTH COUNTY v.NATIONALIST MOVEMENT Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting takes up and decides other perceived unconstitutional de- fects in the Forsyth County ordinance. None of these claimswere passed upon by the Court of Appeals; that court de-cided only that the First Amendment forbade the chargingof more than a nominal fee for a permit to parade on publicstreets. Since that was the question decided by the Courtof Appeals below, the question which divides the Courts ofAppeals, and the question presented in the petition for cer-tiorari, one would have thought that the Court would at leastauthoritatively decide, if not limit itself to, that question. I The answer to this question seems to me quite simple, be- cause it was authoritatively decided by this Court more thanhalf a century ago in Cox v.New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). There we confronted a state statute which requiredpayment of a license fee of up to $300 to local governmentsfor the right to parade in the public streets. The SupremeCourt of New Hampshire had construed the provision as re-quiring that the amount of the fee be adjusted based on thesize of the parade, as the fee \u00aafor a circus parade or a celebra-tion procession of length, each drawing crowds of observers,would take into account the greater public expense of polic-ing the spectacle, compared with the slight expense of a lessexpansive and attractive parade or procession.\u00ba Id.,at 577 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the state court'sconstruction, the fee provision was \u00aanot a revenue tax, butone to meet the expense incident to the administration of theAct and to the maintenance of public order in the matterlicensed.\u00ba Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court, in a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, up-held the statute, saying: \u00aaThere is nothing contrary to the Constitution in the charge of a fee limited to the purpose stated. The sug-gestion that a \u00afat fee should have been charged fails totake account of the dif\u00aeculty of framing a fair schedule505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 139 Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992) Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting to meet all circumstances, and we perceive no constitu- tional ground for denying to local governments that\u00afexibility of adjustment of fees which in the light ofvarying conditions would tend to conserve rather thanimpair the liberty sought. \u00aaThere is no evidence that the statute has been ad- ministered otherwise than in the fair and non-discriminatory manner which the state court has con-strued it to require.\u00ba Ibid. Two years later, in Murdock v.Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943), this Court confronted a municipal ordinance thatrequired payment of a \u00afat license fee for the privilege ofcanvassing door-to-door to sell one's wares. Pursuant tothat ordinance, the city had levied the \u00afat fee on a group ofJehovah's Witnesses who sought to distribute religious liter-ature door-to-door for a small price. Id., at 106\u00b1107. The Court held that the \u00afat license tax, as applied against thehand distribution of religious tracts, was unconstitutional onthe ground that it was \u00aaa \u00afat tax imposed on the exercise ofa privilege granted by the Bill of Rights.\u00ba Id., at 113. In making this ruling, the Court distinguished Cox by stating that \u00aathe fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatorymeasure and calculated to defray the expense of protectingthose on the streets and at home against the abuses of solici-tors.\u00ba 319 U. S., at 116. This language, which suggestedthat the fee involved in Cox was only nominal, led the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the present case toconclude that a city is prohibited from charging any morethan a nominal fee for a parade permit. 913 F. 2d 885, 890\u00b1891, and n. 6 (1990). But the clear holding of Cox is to the contrary. In that case, the Court expressly recognized thatthe New Hampshire state statute allowed a city to levy muchmore than a nominal parade fee, as it stated that the feeprovision \u00aahad a permissible range from $300 to a nominalamount.\u00ba Cox v.New Hampshire, supra, at 576. The use of the word \u00aanominal\u00ba in Murdock was thus unfortunate, as505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 140 FORSYTH COUNTY v.NATIONALIST MOVEMENT Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting it represented a mistaken characterization of the fee statute inCox. But a mistaken allusion in a later case to the facts of an earlier case does not by itself undermine the holding ofthe earlier case. The situations in Cox and Murdock were clearly different; the \u00aerst involved a sliding fee to accountfor administrative and security costs incurred as a result ofa parade on public property, while the second involved a \u00afattax on protected religious expression. I believe that the de-cision in Cox squarely controls the disposition of the question presented in this case, and I therefore would explicitly holdthat the Constitution does not limit a parade license fee to anominal amount. II Instead of deciding the particular question on which we granted certiorari, the Court concludes that the county ordi-nance is facially unconstitutional because it places too muchdiscretion in the hands of the county administrator andforces parade participants to pay for the cost of contro lling those who might oppose their speech. Ante, at 130\u00b1137. But, because the lower courts did not pass on these issues,the Court is forced to rely on its own interpretation of theordinance in making these rulings. The Court unnecessar-ily reaches out to interpret the ordinance on its own at thisstage, even though there are no lower court factual \u00aendingson the scope or administration of the ordinance. Becausethere are no such factual \u00aendings, I would not decide at thispoint whether the ordinance fails for lack of adequate stand-ards to guide discretion or for incorporation of a \u00aaheckler'sveto,\u00ba but would instead remand the case to the lower courtsto initially consider these issues. The Court \u00aerst \u00aends fault with the alleged standardless discretion possessed by the county administrator. The ordi-nance provides that the administrator \u00aashall adjust theamount to be paid in order to meet the expense incident tothe administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenanceof public order in the matter licensed.\u00ba App. to Pet. for505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 141 Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992) Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting Cert. 119. In this regard, the ordinance clearly parallels the construction of the statute we upheld in Cox. 312 U. S., at 577 (statute did not impose \u00aaa revenue tax, but one to meetthe expense incident to the administration of the Act and tothe maintenance of public order in the matter licensed\u00ba (in-ternal quotation marks omitted)). The Court worries, how-ever, about the possibility that the administrator has the dis-cretion to set fees based upon his approval of the messagesought to be conveyed, and concludes that \u00aathe county's au-thoritative constructio[n] of the ordinance\u00ba allows for such apossibility. Ante, at 131. The Court apparently envisions a situation where the administrator would impose a $1,000parade fee on a group whose message he opposed, but wouldwaive the fee entirely for a similarly situated group withwhom he agreed. But the county has never rendered any\u00aaauthoritative construction\u00ba indicating that of\u00aecials have\u00aaunbridled discretion,\u00ba ante, at 133, in setting parade fees, nor has any lower court so found. In making its own factual\u00aending that the ordinance does allow for standardless feesetting, this Court simply cites four situations in which theadministrator set permit fees\u00d0two fees of $100, one of $25,and one of $5. Ante, at 132. On the basis of this evidence, the Court \u00aends that the administrator has unbridled discre-tion to set permit fees. The mere fact that the permit feesdiffered in amount does not invalidate the ordinance, how-ever, as our decision in Cox clearly allows a governmental entity to adopt an adjustable permit fee scheme. See Cox v.New Hampshire, supra, at 577 (\u00aa[W]e perceive no constitu- tional ground for denying to local governments th[e] \u00afexibil-ity of adjustment of fees\u00ba). It is true that the Constitutiondoes not permit a system in which the county administratormay vary fees at his pleasure, but there has been no lowercourt \u00aending that that is what this \u00afedgling ordinance cre-ates. And, given the opportunity, the District Court might\u00aend that the county has a policy that precludes the administra-tor from arbitrarily imposing fees. Of course, the District505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 142 FORSYTH COUNTY v.NATIONALIST MOVEMENT Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting Court might \u00aend that the administrator does possess too much discretion. In either case, I believe \u00aendings by theDistrict Court on the issue would be preferable. The Court relies on Ward v.Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 795\u00b1796 (1989), for the proposition that the county'sinterpretation of the ordinance must be considered. In thatcase, however, we relied upon District Court \u00aendings con-cerning New York City's limiting interpretation of a noiseregulation. Id.,at 795. I would prefer to remand this case so that the Court might rely on such express \u00aendings hereas well. The Court's second reason for invalidating the ordinance is its belief that any fee imposed will be based in part on thecost of security necessary to control those who oppose the message endorsed by those marching in a parade. Assum-ing 100 people march in a parade and 10,000 line the routein protest, for example, the Court worries that, under thisordinance, the county will charge a premium to control thehostile crowd of 10,000, resulting in the kind of \u00aaheckler'sveto\u00ba we have previously condemned. Ante, at 133\u00b1136. But there have been no lower court \u00aendings on the questionwhether or not the county plans to base parade fees on antici-pated hostile crowds. It has not done so in any of the in-stances where it has so far imposed fees. Ante, at 132. And it most certainly did not do so in this case. The DistrictCourt below noted that: \u00aa[T]he instant ordinance alternatively permits fees to be assessed based upon `the expense incident to . . . themaintenance of public order.' If the county had appliedthis portion of the statute, the phrase might run afoulo f... constitutional concerns .... \u00aaHowever, in the instant case, plaintiff did not base their [sic] argument upon this phrase, but contended that the mere fact that a $100 fee was imposed is uncon-stitutional, especially in light of the organization's \u00ae-nancial circumstances. The evidence was clear that the505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT 143 Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992) Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting fee was based solely upon the costs of processing the application and plaintiff produced no evidence to thecontrary.\u00ba App. to Pet. for Cert. 14 (emphasis added). The Court's analysis on this issue rests on an assumption that the county will interpret the phrase \u00aamaintenance ofpublic order\u00ba to support the imposition of fees based on op-position crowds. There is nothing in the record to supportthis assumption, however, and I would remand for a hearingon this question. For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 144 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit No. 91\u00b1543. Argued March 30, 1992\u00d0Decided June 19, 1992* Faced with a looming shortage of disposal sites for low level radioactive waste in 31 States, Congress enacted the Low-Level Radioactive WastePolicy Amendments Act of 1985, which, among other things, imposesupon States, either alone or in \u00aaregional compacts\u00ba with other States,the obligation to provide for the disposal of waste generated within theirborders, and contains three provisions setting forth \u00aaincentives\u00ba toStates to comply with that obligation. The \u00aerst set of incentives\u00d0themonetary incentives\u00d0works in three steps: (1) States with disposalsites are authorized to impose a surcharge on radioactive waste receivedfrom other States; (2) the Secretary of Energy collects a portion of thissurcharge and places it in an escrow account; and (3) States achieving a series of milestones in developing sites receive portions of this fund.The second set of incentives\u00d0the access incentives\u00d0authorizes sitedStates and regional compacts gradually to increase the cost of access totheir sites, and then to deny access altogether, to waste generated inStates that do not meet federal deadlines. The so-called third \u00aaincen-tive\u00ba\u00d0the take title provision\u00d0speci\u00aees that a State or regional com-pact that fails to provide for the disposal of all internally generatedwaste by a particular date must, upon the request of the waste's genera-tor or owner, take title to and possession of the waste and become liablefor all damages suffered by the generator or owner as a result of theState's failure to promptly take possession. Petitioners, New YorkState and two of its counties, \u00aeled this suit against the United States,seeking a declaratory judgment that, inter alia, the three incentives provisions are inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment\u00d0which declaresthat \u00aapowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\u00ba\u00d0and withthe Guarantee Clause of Article IV , \u00a7 4\u00d0which directs the United Statesto \u00aaguarantee to every Stat e...a Republican Form of Government.\u00ba The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appealsaf\u00aermed. *Together with No. 91\u00b1558, County of Allegany, New York v.United States et al., and No. 91\u00b1563, County of Cortland, New York v.United States et al., also on certiorari to the same court.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 145 Cite as: 505 U.

The Act's monetary incentives and access incentives provisions are consistent with the Constitution's allocation of power between theFederal and State Governments, but the take title provision is not.Pp. 155\u00b1183. (a) In ascertaining whether any of the challenged provisions over- steps the boundary between federal and state power, the Court mustdetermine whether it is authorized by the af\u00aermative grants to Con-gress contained in Article I's Commerce and Spending Clauses orwhether it invades the province of state sovereignty reserved by theTenth Amendment. Pp. 155\u00b1159. (b) Although regulation of the interstate market in the disposal of low level radioactive waste is well within Congress' Commerce Clauseauthority, cf. Philadelphia v.New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 621\u00b1623, and Congress could, if it wished, pre-empt entirely state regulation in thisarea, a review of this Court's decisions, see, e. g., Hodel v.Virginia Sur- face Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288, and the his- tory of the Constitutional Convention, demonstrates that Congress maynot commandeer the States' legislative processes by directly compellingthem to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program, but must exer-cise legislative authority directly upon individuals. Pp. 159\u00b1166. (c) Nevertheless, there are a variety of methods, short of outright coercion, by which Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislativeprogram consistent with federal interests. As relevant here, Congressmay, under its spending power, attach conditions on the receipt of fed-eral funds, so long as such conditions meet four requirements. See,e. g., South Dakota v.Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\u00b1208, and n. 3. Moreover, where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under theCommerce Clause, it may, as part of a program of \u00aacooperative federal-ism,\u00ba offer States the choice of regulating that activity according tofederal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation.See, e. g., Hodel, supra, at 288, 289. Pp. 166\u00b1169. (d) This Court declines petitioners' invitation to construe the Act's provision obligating the States to dispose of their radioactive wastes asa separate mandate to regulate according to Congress' instructions.That would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and statepowers, whereas the constitutional problem is avoided by construing theAct as a whole to comprise three sets of incentives to the States.Pp. 169\u00b1170. (e) The Act's monetary incentives are well within Congress' Com- merce and Spending Clause authority and thus are not inconsistent withthe Tenth Amendment. The authorization to sited States to imposesurcharges is an unexceptionable exercise of Congress' power to enable505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 146 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Syllabus the States to burden interstate commerce. The Secretary's collection of a percentage of the surcharge is no more than a federal tax on inter-state commerce, which petitioners do not claim to be an invalid exerciseof either Congress' commerce or taxing power. Finally, in conditioningthe States' receipt of federal funds upon their achieving speci\u00aeed mile-stones, Congress has not exceeded its Spending Clause authority in anyof the four respects identi\u00aeed by this Court in Dole, supra, at 207\u00b1208. Petitioners' objection to the form of the expenditures as nonfederal is unavailing, since the Spending Clause has never been construedto deprive Congress of the power to collect money in a segregated trustfund and spend it for a particular purpose, and since the States'ability largely to control whether they will pay into the escrow ac- count or receive a share was expressly provided by Congress as amethod of encouraging them to regulate according to the federal plan.Pp. 171\u00b1173. (f) The Act's access incentives constitute a conditional exercise of Congress' commerce power along the lines of that approved in Hodel, supra, at 288, and thus do not intrude on the States' Tenth Amendment sovereignty. These incentives present nonsited States with the choiceeither of regulating waste disposal according to federal standards orhaving their waste-producing residents denied access to disposal sites.They are not compelled to regulate, expend any funds, or participate inany federal program, and they may continue to regulate waste in theirown way if they do not accede to federal direction. Pp. 173\u00b1174. (g) Because the Act's take title provision offers the States a \u00aachoice\u00ba between the two unconstitutionally coercive alternatives\u00d0either accepting ownership of waste or regulating according to Con-gress' instructions\u00d0the provision lies outside Congress' enumeratedpowers and is inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment. On the onehand, either forcing the transfer of waste from generators to the Statesor requiring the States to become liable for the generators' damageswould \u00aacommandeer\u00ba States into the service of federal regulatory pur-poses. On the other hand, requiring the States to regulate pursuant toCongress' direction would present a simple unconstitutional commandto implement legislation enacted by Congress. Thus, the States'\u00aachoice\u00ba is no choice at all. Pp. 174\u00b1177. (h) The United States' alternative arguments purporting to \u00aend limited circumstances in which congressional compulsion of state regula-tion is constitutionally permissible\u00d0that such compulsion is justi\u00aeedwhere the federal interest is suf\u00aeciently important; that the Constitu-tion does, in some circumstances, permit federal directives to state gov-ernments; and that the Constitution endows Congress with the power505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 147 Cite as: 505 U.

(i) Also rejected is the sited state respondents' argument that the Act cannot be ruled an unconstitutional infringement of New York sov-ereignty because of\u00aecials of that State lent their support, and consented,to the Act's passage. A departure from the Constitution's plan for theintergovernmental allocation of authority cannot be rati\u00aeed by the \u00aacon-sent\u00ba of state of\u00aecials, since the Constitution protects state sovereigntyfor the bene\u00aet of individuals, not States or their governments, and sincethe of\u00aecials' interests may not coincide with the Constitution's alloca-tion. Nor does New York's prior support estop it from asserting theAct's unconstitutionality. Pp. 180\u00b1183. (j) Even assuming that the Guarantee Clause provides a basis upon which a State or its subdivisions may sue to enjoin the enforcement ofa federal statute, petitioners have not made out a claim that the Act'smoney incentives and access incentives provisions are inconsistent withthat Clause. Neither the threat of loss of federal funds nor the possibil-ity that the State's waste producers may \u00aend themselves excluded fromother States' disposal sites can reasonably be said to deny New York arepublican form of government.

The take title provision is severable from the rest of the Act, since severance will not pre vent the operation of the rest of the Act or defeat its purpose of encouraging the States to attain local or regional self-suf\u00aeciency in low level radioactive waste disposal; since the Act stillincludes two incentives to encourage States along this road; sincea State whose waste generators are unable to gain access to out-of- state disposal sites may encounter considerable internal pressure to pro-vide for disposal, even without the prospect of taking title; and sinceany burden caused by New York's failure to secure a site will not be borne by other States' residents because the sited regional compactsneed not accept New York's waste after the \u00aenal transition period.Pp. 186\u00b1187. 942 F. 2d 114, af\u00aermed in part and reversed in part.

S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court Justice O\u0092Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. These cases implicate one of our Nation's newest problems of public policy and perhaps our oldest question of constitu-tional law. The public policy issue involves the disposal ofradioactive waste: In these cases, we address the constitu-tionality of three provisions of the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99\u00b1240, 99Stat. 1842, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2021b et seq. The constitutional question is as old as the Constitution: It consists of discern-ing the proper division of authority between the FederalGovernment and the States. We conclude that while Con-gress has substantial power under the Constitution to en-courage the States to provide for the disposal of the radioac-tive waste generated within their borders, the Constitutiondoes not confer upon Congress the ability simply to compelthe States to do so. We therefore \u00aend that only two of theAct's three provisions at issue are consistent with the Consti-tution's allocation of power to the Federal Government. I We live in a world full of low level radioactive waste. Ra- dioactive material is present in luminous watch dials, smokealarms, measurement devices, medical \u00afuids, research mate-rials, and the protective gear and construction materialsused by workers at nuclear power plants. Low level radio-active waste is generated by the Government, by hospitals,by research institutions, and by various industries.

M illions of cubic feet of low level radioactive waste must be disposed of each year. SeeApp. 110a\u00b1111a; Berkovitz, Waste Wars: Did Congress\u00aaNuke\u00ba State Sovereignty in the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Amendments Act of 1985?, 11 Harv. Envtl. L.Rev. 437, 439\u00b1440 (1987). Our Nation's \u00aerst site for the land disposal of commercial low level radioactive waste opened in 1962 in Beatty, Nevada.Five more sites opened in the following decade: Maxey Flats,Kentucky (1963), West Valley, New York (1963), Hanford,Washington (1965), Shef\u00aeeld, Illinois (1967), and Barnwell, South Carolina (1971). Between 1975 and 1978, the Illinois site closed because it was full, and water management prob-lems caused the closure of the sites in Kentucky and NewYork. As a result, since 1979 only three disposal sites\u00d0those in Nevada, Washington, and South Carolina\u00d0havebeen in operation. Waste generated in the rest of thecountry must be shipped to one of these three sites for dis-posal. See Low-Level Radioactive Waste Regulation 39\u00b140(M. Burns ed. 1988). In 1979, both the Washington and Nevada sites were forced to shut down temporarily, leaving South Carolina toshoulder the responsibility of storing low level radioactivewaste produced in every part of the country. The Governorof South Carolina, understandably perturbed, ordered a 50%reduction in the quantity of waste accepted at the Barnwellsite. The Governors of Washington and Nevada announcedplans to shut their sites permanently. App. 142a, 152a. Faced with the possibility that the Nation would be left with no disposal sites for low level radioactive waste, Con-gress responded by enacting the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Act, Pub. L. 96\u00b1573, 94 Stat. 3347. Relyinglargely on a report submitted by the National Governors'Association, see App. 105a\u00b1141a, Congress declared a federalpolicy of holding each State \u00aaresponsible for providing forthe availability of capacity either within or outside the State505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 151 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders,\u00ba and found that such waste could be dis-posed of \u00aamost safely and ef\u00aeciently ...o nar e g i o n a l basis.\u00ba \u00a7 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980 Act authorized States toenter into regional compacts that, once rati\u00aeed by Congress,would have the authority beginning in 1986 to restrict theuse of their disposal facilities to waste generated withinmember States. \u00a7 4(a)(2)(B), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980 Actincluded no penalties for States that failed to participate inthis plan. By 1985, only three approved regional compacts had oper- ational disposal facilities; not surprisingly, these were thecompacts formed around South Carolina, Nevada, and Wash-ington, the three sited States. The following year, the 1980Act would have given these three compacts the ability toexclude waste from nonmembers, and the remaining 31States would have had no assured outlet for their low levelradioactive waste. With this prospect looming, Congressonce again took up the issue of waste disposal. The resultwas the legislation challenged here, the Low-Level Radioac-tive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985. The 1985 Act was again based largely on a proposal sub- mitted by the National Governors' Association. In broadoutline, the Act embodies a compromise among the sited andunsited States. The sited States agreed to extend for sevenyears the period in which they would accept low level radio-active waste from other States. In exchange, the unsitedStates agreed to end their reliance on the sited States by1992. The mechanics of this compromise are intricate. The Act directs: \u00aaEach State shall be responsible for providing, eitherby itself or in cooperation with other States, for the disposalof . . . low-level radioactive waste generated within theState,\u00ba U. S. C. \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A), with the exception ofcertain waste generated by the Federal Government,\u00a7\u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(B), 2021c(b). The Act authorizes States to505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 152 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court \u00aaenter into such [interstate] compacts as may be neces- sary to provide for the establishment and operation ofregional disposal facilities for low-level radioactive waste.\u00ba\u00a7 2021d(a)(2). For an additional seven years beyond the pe-riod contemplated by the 1980 Act, from the beginning of1986 through the end of 1992, the three existing disposalsites \u00aashall make disposal capacity available for low-levelradioactive waste generated by any source,\u00ba with certainexceptions not relevant here. \u00a7 2021e(a)(2). But the threeStates in which the disposal sites are located are permittedto exact a graduated surcharge for waste arriving from out- side the regional compact\u00d0in 1986\u00b11987, $10 per cubic approved regional compacts may exclude radioac-tive waste generated outside the region. \u00a7 2021d(c). The Act provides three types of incentives to encourage the States to comply with their statutory obligation to pro-vide for the disposal of waste generated within their borders. 1.Monetary ince ntives. One quarter of the surcharges collected by the sited States must be transferred to anescrow account held by the Secretary of Energy. \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(A). The Secretary then makes payments from thisaccount to each State that has complied with a series of dead-lines. By July 1, 1986, each State was to have rati\u00aeed legis-lation either joining a regional compact or indicating an in-tent to develop a disposal facility within the State. \u00a7\u00a7 2021e(e)(1)(A), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(i). By January 1, 1988, each unsitedcompact was to have identi\u00aeed the State in which its facilitywould be located, and each compact or stand-alone State wasto have developed a siting plan and taken other identi\u00aeedsteps. \u00a7\u00a7 2021e(e)(1)(B), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(ii). By January 1,1990, each State or compact was to have \u00aeled a completeapplication for a license to operate a disposal facility, or theGovernor of any State that had not \u00aeled an application wasto have certi\u00aeed that the State would be capable of disposing505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 153 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court of all waste generated in the State after 1992. \u00a7\u00a7 2021e (e)(1)(C), 2021e(d)(2)(B) (iii). The rest of the account is to be paid out to those States or compacts able to dispose ofall low level radioactive waste generated within their bor-ders by January 1, 1993. \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iv). Each Statethat has not met the 1993 deadline must either take titleto the waste generated within its borders or forfeit to thewaste generators the incentive payments it has received.\u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(C). 2.Access ince ntives. The second type of incentive in- volves the denial of access to disposal sites. States that failto meet the July 1986 deadline may be charged twice theordinary surcharge for the remainder of 1986 and may bedenied access to disposal facilities thereafter. \u00a7 2021e(e)(2)(A). States that fail to meet the 1988 deadline may becharged double surcharges for the \u00aerst half of 1988 and quad-ruple surcharges for the second half of 1988, and may bedenied access thereafter. \u00a7 2021e(e)(2)(B). States that failto meet the 1990 deadline may be denied access. \u00a7 2021e(e)(2)(C). Finally, States that have not \u00aeled complete ap-plications by January 1, 1992, for a license to operate a dis-posal facility, or States belonging to compacts that have not\u00aeled such applications, may be charged triple surcharges.\u00a7\u00a7 2021e(e)(1)(D), 2021e(e)(2)(D). 3.The take title provision. The third type of incentive is the most severe. The Act provides: \u00aaIf a State (or, where applicable, a compact region) in which low-level radioactive waste is generated is unableto provide for the disposal of all such waste generatedwithin such State or compact region by January 1, 1996,each State in which such waste is generated, upon therequest of the generator or owner of the waste, shalltake title to the waste, be obligated to take possessionof the waste, and shall be liable for all damages directlyor indirectly incurred by such generator or owner as aconsequence of the failure of the State to take possession505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 154 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court of the waste as soon after January 1, 1996, as the genera- tor or owner noti\u00aees the State that the waste is available for shipment.\u00ba \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(C). These three incentives are the focus of petitioners' constitu- tional challenge. In the seven years since the Act took effect, Congress has approved nine regional compacts, encompassing 42 of theStates. All six unsited compacts and four of the unaf\u00aeliatedStates have met the \u00aerst three statutory milestones. Brieffor United States 10, n. 19; id.,at 13, n. 25. New York, a State whose residents generate a relatively large share of the Nation's low level radioactive waste, didnot join a regional compact. Instead, the State compliedwith the Act's requirements by enacting legislation provid-ing for the siting and \u00aenancing of a disposal facility in NewYork. The State has identi\u00aeed \u00aeve potential sites, three inAllegany County and two in Cortland County. Residents ofthe two counties oppose the State's choice of location.

S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court II A In 1788, in the course of explaining to the citizens of New York why the recently drafted Constitution provided for fed-eral courts, Alexander Hamilton observed: \u00aaThe erection ofa new government, whatever care or wisdom may distin-guish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacyand nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be ex-pected to \u00afow from the the establishment of a constitutionfounded upon the total or partial incorporation of a numberof distinct sovereignties.\u00ba The Federalist No. 82, p. 491 (C.Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton's prediction has proved quiteaccurate. While no one disputes the proposition that \u00aa[t]heConstitution created a Federal Government of limited pow-ers,\u00ba Gregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991); and while the Tenth Amendment makes explicit that \u00aa[t]he powers notdelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor pro-hibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respec-tively, or to the people\u00ba; the task of ascertaining the constitu-tional line between federal and state power has given rise tomany of the Court's most dif\u00aecult and celebrated cases. Atleast as far back as Martin v.Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324 (1816), the Court has resolved questions \u00aaof great impor-tance and delicacy\u00ba in determining whether particular sover-eign powers have been granted by the Constitution to theFederal Government or have been retained by the States. These questions can be viewed in either of two ways. In some cases the Court has inquired whether an Act of Con-gress is authorized by one of the powers delegated to Con-gress in Article I of the Constitution. See, e. g., Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971); McCulloch v.Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819). In other cases the Court has sought todetermine whether an Act of Congress invades the provinceof state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment.See, e. g., Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Au-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 156 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court thority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985); Lane County v.Oregon, 7W a l l . 71 (1869). In a case like these, involving the division ofauthority between federal and state governments, the twoinquiries are mirror images of each other. If a power is del-egated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amend-ment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power tothe States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereigntyreserved by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a powerthe Constitution has not conferred on Congress. See United States v.Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 649 (1961); Case v.Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 102 (1946); Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v.Guy F . Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 534 (1941). It is in this sense that the Tenth Amendment \u00aastates but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.\u00baUnited States v.Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941). As Justice Story put it, \u00aa[t]his amendment is a mere af\u00aermation of what,upon any just reasoning, is a necessary rule of interpretingthe constitution. Being an instrument of limited and enu-merated powers, it follows irresistibly, that what is not con-ferred, is withheld, and belongs to the state authorities.\u00ba 3J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the UnitedStates 752 (1833). This has been the Court's consistent un-derstanding: \u00aaThe States unquestionably do retai[n] a sig-ni\u00aecant measure of sovereign authority ...t ot h e extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their originalpowers and transferred those powers to the Federal Govern-ment.\u00ba Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Au- thority, supra, at 549 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress exercises its conferred powers subject to the lim- itations contained in the Constitution. Thus, for example,under the Commerce Clause Congress may regulate publish-ers engaged in interstate commerce, but Congress is con-strained in the exercise of that power by the First Amend-ment. The Tenth Amendment likewise restrains the powerof Congress, but this limit is not derived from the text ofthe Tenth Amendment itself, which, as we have discussed,505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 157 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court is essentially a tautology. Instead, the Tenth Amendment con\u00aerms that the power of the Federal Government is sub-ject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power tothe States. The Tenth Amendment thus directs us to deter-mine, as in this case, whether an incident of state sover-eignty is protected by a limitation on an Article I power. The bene\u00aets of this federal structure have been exten- sively cataloged elsewhere, see, e. g., Gregory v.Ashcroft, supra, at 457\u00b1460; Merritt, The Guarantee Clause and State Autonomy: Federalism for a Third Century, 88 Colum. L.Rev. 1, 3\u00b110 (1988); McConnell, Federalism: Evaluating the Founders' Design, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1484, 1491\u00b11511 (1987),but they need not concern us here. Our task would be thesame even if one could prove that federalism secured no ad-vantages to anyone. It consists not of devising our pre-ferred system of government, but of understanding andapplying the framework set forth in the Constitution. \u00aaThequestion is not what power the Federal Government oughtto have but what powers in fact have been given by the peo-ple.\u00ba United States v.Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936). This framework has been suf\u00aeciently \u00afexible over the past two centuries to allow for enormous changes in the natureof government. The Federal Government undertakes activ-ities today that would have been unimaginable to the Fram-ers in two senses; \u00aerst, because the Framers would not haveconceived that any government would conduct such activi- ties; and second, because the Framers would not have be-lieved that the Federal Government, rather than the States, would assume such responsibilities. Yet the powers con-ferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitutionwere phrased in language broad enough to allow for theexpansion of the Federal Government's role. Among theprovisions of the Constitution that have been particularlyimportant in this regard, three concern us here. First, the Constitution allocates to Congress the power \u00aa[t]o regulate Commerce . among the 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 158 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Interstate commerce was an established feature of life in the late 18th century. See, e. g., The Feder- alist No. 42, p. 267 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (\u00aaThe defect ofpower in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commercebetween its several members [has] been clearly pointed outby experience\u00ba). The volume of interstate commerce andthe range of commonly accepted objects of government regu-lation have, however, expanded considerably in the last 200years, and the regulatory authority of Congress has ex-panded along with them. As interstate commerce has be-come ubiquitous, activities once considered purely local have come to have effects on the national economy, and haveaccordingly come within the scope of Congress' commercepower. See, e. g., Katzenbach v.McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964); Wickard v.Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942). Second, the Constitution authorizes Congress \u00aato pay the Debts and provide for th e... general Welfare of the United States.\u00ba Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. As conventional notions of theproper objects of government spending have changed overthe years, so has the ability of Congress to \u00aa\u00aex the terms onwhich it shall disburse federal money to the States.\u00ba Penn- hurst State School and Hospital v.Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). Compare, e. g., United States v.Butler, supra, at 72\u00b175 (spending power does not authorize Congress to sub-sidize farmers), with South Dakota v.Dole, 483 U. S. 203 (1987) (spending power permits Congress to condition high-way funds on States' adoption of minimum drinking age).While the spending power is \u00aasubject to several general re-strictions articulated in our cases,\u00ba id.,at 207, these restric- tions have not been so severe as to prevent the regulatoryauthority of Congress from generally keeping up with thegrowth of the federal budget. The Court's broad construction of Congress' power under the Commerce and Spending Clauses has of course beenguided, as it has with respect to Congress' power generally,by the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause, which505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 159 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court authorizes Congress \u00aa[t]o make all Laws which shall be nec- essary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoingPowers.\u00ba U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18. See, e. g., Legal Tender Case, 110 U. S. 421, 449\u00b1450 (1884); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 411\u00b1421. Finally, the Constitution provides that \u00aathe Laws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . .any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to theContrary notwithstanding.\u00ba U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Asthe Federal Government's w illing ness to exercise power within the con\u00aenes of the Constitution has grown, the au-thority of the States has correspondingly diminished to theextent that federal and state policies have con\u00aficted. See,e. g., Shaw v.Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85 (1983). We have observed that the Supremacy Clause gives the FederalGovernment \u00aaa decided advantage in th[e] delicate balance\u00bathe Constitution strikes between state and federal power.Gregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460. The actual scope of the Federal Government's authority with respect to the States has changed over the years, there-fore, but the constitutional structure underlying and limitingthat authority has not. In the end, just as a cup may be halfempty or half full, it makes no difference whether one viewsthe question at issue in these cases as one of ascertainingthe limits of the power delegated to the Federal Governmentunder the af\u00aermative provisions of the Constitution or oneof discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the Statesunder the Tenth Amendment. Either way, we must deter-mine whether any of the three challenged provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 oversteps the boundary between federal and stateauthority. B Petitioners do not contend that Congress lacks the power to regulate the disposal of low level radioactive waste.Space in radioactive waste disposal sites is frequently sold505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 160 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court by residents of one State to residents of another. Regula- tion of the resulting interstate market in waste disposal istherefore well within Congress' authority under the Com-merce Clause. Cf. Philadelphia v.New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 621\u00b1623 (1978); Fort Gratiot Sanitary Land\u00aell, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 359 (1992). Petitioners likewise do not dispute that under theSupremacy Clause Congress could, if it wished, pre-emptstate radioactive waste regulation. Petitioners contendonly that the Tenth Amendment limits the power of Con-gress to regulate in the way it has chosen. Rather than ad- dressing the problem of waste disposal by directly regulatingthe generators and disposers of waste, petitioners argue,Congress has impermissibly directed the States to regulatein this \u00aeeld. Most of our recent cases interpreting the Tenth Amend- ment have concerned the authority of Congress to subjectstate governments to generally applicable laws. TheCourt's jurisprudence in this area has traveled an unsteadypath. See Maryland v.Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968) (state schools and hospitals are subject to Fair Labor StandardsAct); National League of Cities v.Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976) (overruling Wirtz ) (state employers are not subject to Fair Labor Standards Act); Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985) (overruling National League of Cities ) (state employers are once again subject to Fair Labor Standards Act). See also New York v.United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946); Fry v.United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975); Transportation Union v.Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982); EEOC v.Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); South Carolina v.Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988); Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra. This litigation presents no occasion to apply or revisit the holdings of any of these cases, as this isnot a case in which Congress has subjected a State to thesame legislation applicable to private parties. Cf. FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 758\u00b1759 (1982).505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 161 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court This litigation instead concerns the circumstances under which Congress may use the States as implements of regula-tion; that is, whether Congress may direct or otherwise moti-vate the States to regulate in a particular \u00aeeld or a particularway. Our cases have established a few principles that guideour resolution of the issue. 1 As an initial matter, Congress may not simply \u00aacomman- dee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly com-pelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory pro- gram.\u00ba Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288 (1981). In Hodel, the Court upheld the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of1977 precisely because it did not \u00aacommandeer\u00ba the States into regulating mining. The Court found that \u00aathe Statesare not compelled to enforce the steep-slope standards, toexpend any state funds, or to participate in the federal regu-latory program in any manner whatsoever. If a State doesnot wish to submit a proposed permanent program that com-plies with the Act and implementing regulations, the full reg-ulatory burden will be borne by the Federal Government.\u00baIbid. The Court reached the same conclusion the following year inFERC v.Mississippi, supra. At issue in FERC was the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, a federal stat-ute encouraging the States in various ways to develop pro-grams to combat the Nation's energy crisis. We observedthat \u00aathis Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federalcommand to the States to promulgate and enforce laws andregulations.\u00ba Id., at 761\u00b1762. As in Hodel, the Court up- held the statute at issue because it did not view the statuteas such a command. The Court emphasized: \u00aaTitles I andIII of [the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978(PURPA)] require only consideration of federal standards. And if a State has no utilities commission, or simply stopsregulating in the \u00aeeld, it need not even entertain the federal505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 162 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court proposals.\u00ba 456 U. S., at 764 (emphasis in original). \u00aa[t]here [wa]s nothing in PURPA `directly compe lling' the States to enact a legislative program,\u00ba the statute wasnot inconsistent with the Constitution's division of authoritybetween the Federal Government and the States. Id., at 765 (quoting Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclama- tion Assn., Inc., supra, at 288). See also South Carolina v. Baker, supra, at 513 (noting \u00aathe possibility that the Tenth Amendment might set some limits on Congress' power tocompel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests\u00ba);Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, at 556 (same). These statements in FERC and Hodel were not innova- tions. While Congress has substantial powers to govern theNation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to theStates, the Constitution has never been understood to conferupon Congress the ability to require the States to governaccording to Congress' instructions. See Coyle v.Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911). The Court has been explicit aboutthis distinction. \u00aaBoth the States and the United States ex-isted before the Constitution. The people, through that in-strument, established a more perfect union by substitutinga national government, acting, with ample power, directly upon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government, which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon theStates.\u00ba Lane County v.Oregon, 7 Wall., at 76 (emphasis added). The Court has made the same point with more rhe-torical \u00afourish, although perhaps with less precision, on anumber of occasions. In Chief Justice Chase's much-quotedwords, \u00aathe preservation of the States, and the maintenanceof their governments, are as much within the design and careof the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and themaintenance of the National government. The Constitu-tion, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union,composed of indestructible States.\u00ba Texas v.White, 7W & 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 163 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court U. S. 514, 523 (1926) (\u00aa[N]either government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise ofits powers\u00ba); Taf\u00afin v.Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990) (\u00aa[U]nder our federal system, the States possess sovereigntyconcurrent with that of the Federal Government\u00ba); Gregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 461 (\u00aa[T]he States retain substantial sovereign powers under our constitutional scheme, powerswith which Congress does not readily interfere\u00ba). Indeed, the question whether the Constitution should per- mit Congress to employ state governments as regulatoryagencies was a topic of lively debate among the Framers. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress lacked theauthority in most respects to govern the people directly. Inpractice, Congress \u00aacould not directly tax or legislate uponindividuals; it had no explicit `legislative' or `governmental'power to make binding `law' enforceable as such.\u00ba Amar, OfSovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425, 1447 (1987). The inadequacy of this governmental structure was re- sponsible in part for the Constitutional Convention. Alexan-der Hamilton observed: \u00aaThe great and radical vice in theconstruction of the existing Confederation is in the principleoflegislation , contradistin- guished from the individuals of whom they consist.\u00ba The Federalist No. 15, p. 108 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). As Hamiltonsaw it, \u00aawe must resolve to incorporate into our plan thoseingredients which may be considered as forming the charac-teristic difference between a league and a government; wemust extend the authority of the Union to the persons of thecitizens\u00d0the only proper objects of government.\u00ba Id., at 109. The new National Government \u00aamust carry its agencyto the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need ofno intermediate legislations . . . . The government of the Union, like that of each State, must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals.\u00baId.,No. 16, at 116.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 164 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court The Convention generated a great number of proposals for the structure of the new Government, but two quickly tookcenter stage. Under the Virginia Plan, as \u00aerst introducedby Edmund Randolph, Congress would exercise legislativeauthority directly upon individuals, without employing theStates as intermediaries. 1 Records of the Federal Conven-tion of 1787, p. 21 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). Under the NewJersey Plan, as \u00aerst introduced by W illiam Paterson, Con- gress would continue to require the approval of the Statesbefore legislating, as it had under the Articles of Confedera-tion. 1 id.,at 243\u00b1244. These two plans underwent various revisions as the Convention progressed, but they remainedthe two primary options discussed by the delegates. Onefrequently expressed objection to the New Jersey Plan wasthat it might require the Federal Government to coerce theStates into implementing legislation. As Randolph ex-plained the distinction, \u00aa[t]he true question is whether weshall adhere to the federal plan [ i. e., the New Jersey Plan], or introduce the national plan. The insuf\u00aeciency of the for-mer has been fully displaye d.... There are but two modes, by which the end of a Gen[eral] Gov[ernment] can be at-tained: the 1st is by coercion as proposed by Mr. P[aterson's]plan[, the 2nd] by real legislation as prop[osed] by the otherplan. Coercion impracticable, expensive, cruel to in- dividuals. . . . We must resort therefore to a national Legis- lation over individuals. \u00ba1 id., at 255\u00b1256 (emphasis in original). Madison echoed this view: \u00aaThe practicability ofmaking laws, with coercive sanctions, for the States as politi-cal bodies, had been exploded on all hands.\u00ba 2 id.,at 9. Under one preliminary draft of what would become the New Jersey Plan, state governments would occupy a positionrelative to Congress similar to that contemplated by the Actat issue in these cases: \u00aa[T]he laws of the United States ought,as far as may be consistent with the common interests of the Union, to be carried into execution by the judiciary and executive of\u00aecers of the respective states, wherein the exe-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 165 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court cution thereof is required.\u00ba 3 id.,at 616. This idea appar- ently never even progressed so far as to be debated by thedelegates, as contemporary accounts of the Convention donot mention any such discussion. The delegates' many de-scriptions of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans speak onlyin general terms about whether Congress was to derive itsauthority from the people or from the States, and whether itwas to issue directives to individuals or to States. See 1 id., at 260\u00b1280. In the end, the Convention opted for a Constitution in which Congress would exercise its legislative authority di- rectly over individuals rather than over States; for a varietyof reasons, it rejected the New Jersey Plan in favor of theVirginia Plan. 1 id.,at 313. This choice was made clear to the subsequent state ratifying conventions. Oliver Ells-worth, a member of the Connecticut delegation in Philadel-phia, explained the distinction to his State's convention:\u00aaThis Constitution does not attempt to coerce sovereign bod-ies, states, in their political capacity. . . . But . . individual.\u00ba 2 Elliot, Debates onthe Federal Constitution 197 (2d ed. 1863). Charles Pinck-ney, another delegate at the Constitutional Convention, em-phasized to the South Carolina House of Representativesthat in Philadelphia \u00aathe necessity of having a governmentwhich should at once operate upon the people, and not uponthe states, was conceived to be indispensable by every dele-gation present.\u00ba 4 id.,at 256. Rufus King, one of Massa- chusetts' delegates, returned home to support rati\u00aecation byreca lling the Commonwealth's unhappy experience under the Articles of Confederation and arguing: \u00aaLaws, to be effec-tive, therefore, must not be laid on states, but upon individu-als.\u00ba 2 id.,at 56. At New York's convention, Hamilton (an- other delegate in Philadelphia) exclaimed: \u00aaBut can webelieve that one state will ever suffer itself to be used as aninstrument of coercion? The thing is a dream; it is impossi-ble. Then we are brought to this dilemma\u00d0either a federal505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 166 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court standing army is to enforce the requisitions, or the federal treasury is left without supplies, and the government with-out support. What, sir, is the cure for this great evil?Nothing, but to enable the national laws to operate on indi-viduals, in the same manner as those of the states do.\u00ba 2id.,at 233. At North Carolina's convention, Samuel Spencer recognized that \u00aaall the laws of the Confederation were bind-ing on the states in their political capacities ,...b u tn o w the thing is entirely different. The laws of Congress will bebinding on individuals.\u00ba 4 id.,at 153. In providing for a stronger central government, therefore, the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers uponCongress the power to regulate individuals, not States. Aswe have seen, the Court has consistently respected thischoice. We have always understood that even where Con-gress has the authority under the Constitution to pass lawsrequiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power di-rectly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts.E. g., FERC v.Mississippi, 456 U. S., at 762\u00b1766; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288\u00b1289; Lane County v.Oregon, 7 Wall., at 76. The allocation of power contained in the Commerce Clause,for example, authorizes Congress to regulate interstate com-merce directly; it does not authorize Congress to regulatestate governments' regulation of interstate commerce. 2 This is not to say that Congress lacks the ability to encour- age a State to regulate in a particular way, or that Congressmay not hold out incentives to the States as a method ofin\u00afuencing a State's policy choices. Our cases have identi-\u00aeed a variety of methods, short of outright coercion, bywhich Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislativeprogram consistent with federal interests. Two of thesemethods are of particular relevance here.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT 167 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court First, under Congress' spending power, \u00aaCongress may at- tach conditions on the receipt of federal funds.\u00ba South Da- kota v.Dole, 483 U. S., at 206. Such conditions must (among other requirements) bear some relationship to the purposeof the federal spending, id.,at 207\u00b1208, and n. 3; otherwise, of course, the spending power could render academic theConstitution's other grants and limits of federal authority.Where the recipient of federal funds is a State, as is notunusual today, the conditions attached to the funds byCongress may in\u00afuence a State's legislative choices. SeeKaden, Politics, Money, and State Sovereignty: The Judicial Role, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 847, 874\u00b1881 (1979). Dole was one such case: The Court found no constitutional \u00afaw in a federalstatute directing the Secretary of Transportation to with-hold federal highway funds from States fa iling to adopt Con- gress' choice of a minimum drinking age. Similar examplesabound. See, e. g., Fullilove v.Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, U. S. 444, (1978); Lau v.Nichols, 414 U. S. 563, 568\u00b1569 (1974); Oklahoma v.United States Civil Service Comm'n, 330 U. S. 127, 142\u00b1144 (1947). Second, where Congress has the authority to regulate pri- vate activity under the Commerce Clause, we have recog-nized Congress' power to offer States the choice of regulat-ing that activity according to federal standards or havingstate law pre-empted by federal regulation. Hodel v.Vir- ginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at 288. See also FERC v.Mississippi, supra, at 764\u00b1765. This arrangement, which has been termed \u00aaa program of co-operative federalism,\u00ba Hodel, supra, at 289, is replicated in numerous federal statutory schemes. These include theClean Water Act, 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251et seq., seeArkansas v.Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91, 101 (1992) (Clean Water Act \u00aaanticipates a partnership between theStates and the Federal Government, animated by a sharedobjective\u00ba); the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 168 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court 84 Stat. 1590, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 651 et seq., seeGade v.National Solid Wastes Management Assn., ante, at 97; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2796, asamended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 6901 611\u00b1612 (1992); and the Alaska Na- tional Interest Lands Conservation Act, 94 Stat. 2374, 16U. S. C. \u00a7 3101 et 314 (CA9 1988), cert. denied, 491 U. S. 905(1989). By either of these methods, as by any other permissible method of encouraging a State to conform to federal policy choices, the residents of the State retain the ultimate deci-sion as to whether or not the State will comply. If a State'scitizens view federal policy as suf\u00aeciently contrary to localinterests, they may elect to decline a federal grant. If stateresidents would prefer their government to devote its atten-tion and resources to problems other than those deemed im-portant by Congress, they may choose to have the FederalGovernment rather than the State bear the expense of a fed-erally mandated regulatory program, and they may continueto supplement that program to the extent state law is notpre-empted. Where Congress encourages state regulationrather than compe lling it, state governments remain the local electorate's preferences; state of\u00aecials re-main accountable to the people. By contrast, where the Federal Government compels States to regulate, the accountability of both state and fed-eral of\u00aecials is diminished. If the citizens of New York, forexample, do not consider that making provision for the dis-posal of radioactive waste is in their best interest, they mayelect state of\u00aecials who share their view. That view can al-ways be pre-empted under the Supremacy Clause if it is con-trary to the national view, but in such a case it is the FederalGovernment that makes the decision in full view of the pub-lic, and it will be federal of\u00aecials that suffer the consequencesif the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 169 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court But where the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state of\u00aecials who will bear the brunt ofpublic disapproval, while the federal of\u00aecials who devised theregulatory program may remain insulated from the electoralrami\u00aecations of their decision. Accountability is thus dimin-ished when, due to federal coercion, elected state of\u00aecialscannot regulate in accordance with the views of the localelectorate in matters not pre-empted by federal regulation.See Merritt, 88 Colum. L. Rev., at 61\u00b162; La Pierre, PoliticalAccountability in the National Political Process\u00d0The Alter-native to Judicial Review of Federalism Issues, 80 Nw. U. L.Rev. 577, 639\u00b1665 (1985). With these principles in mind, we turn to the three chal- lenged provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Pol-icy Amendments Act of 1985. III The parties in these cases advance two quite different views of the Act. As petitioners see it, the Act imposes a require-ment directly upon the States that they regulate in the \u00aeeldof radioactive waste disposal in order to meet Congress'mandate that \u00aa[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing. . . for the disposal o f... low-level radioactive waste.\u00ba 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A). Petitioners understand this provi-sion as a direct command from Congress, enforceable inde-pendent of the three sets of incentives provided by the Act.Respondents, on the other hand, read this provision togetherwith the incentives, and see the Act as affording the Statesthree sets of choices. According to respondents, the Actpermits a State to choose \u00aerst between regulating pursuantto federal standards and losing the right to a share of theSecretary of Energy's escrow account; to choose second be-tween regulating pursuant to federal standards and progres-sively losing access to disposal sites in other States; and tochoose third between regulating pursuant to federal stand-ards and taking title to the waste generated within the State.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 170 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court Respondents thus interpret \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A), despite the stat- ute's use of the word \u00aashall,\u00ba to provide no more than anoption which a State may elect or eschew. The Act could plausibly be understood either as a mandate to regulate or as a series of incentives. Under petitioners'view, however, \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A) of the Act would clearly\u00aacommandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by di-rectly compe lling them to enact and enforce a federal program.\u00ba Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Recla- mation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288. We must reject this interpretation of the provision for two reasons. First, suchan outcome would, to say the least, \u00aaupset the usual constitu-tional balance of federal and state powers.\u00ba Gregory v.Ash- croft, 501 U. S., at 460. \u00aa[I]t is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress' intent before \u00aending that federal law overrides this balance,\u00ba ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), but the Act's amenability to an equally plau-sible alternative construction prevents us from possessingsuch certainty. Second, \u00aawhere an otherwise acceptableconstruction of a statute would raise serious constitutionalproblems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid suchproblems unless such construction is plainly contrary to theintent of Congress.\u00ba Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). This rule of statutory constructionpushes us away from petitioners' understanding of \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A) of the Act, under which it compels the States toregulate according to Congress' instructions. We therefore decline petitioners' invitation to construe \u00a7 2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to theStates independent of the remainder of the Act. Construedas a whole, the Act comprises three sets of \u00aaincentives\u00ba forthe States to provide for the disposal of low level radioactivewaste generated within their borders. We consider each inturn.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 171 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court A The \u00aerst set of incentives works in three steps. First, Congress has authorized States with disposal sites to imposea surcharge on radioactive waste received from other States.Second, the Secretary of Energy collects a portion of thissurcharge and places the money in an escrow account.Third, States achieving a series of milestones receive por-tions of this fund. The \u00aerst of these steps is an unexceptionable exercise of Congress' power to authorize the States to burden interstatecommerce. While the Commerce Clause has long been un-derstood to limit the States' ability to discriminate againstinterstate commerce, see, e. g., Wyoming v.Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454\u00b1455 (1992); Cooley v.Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Society for Relief of Distressed Pi-lots, 12 How. 299 (1852), that limit may be lifted, as it has been here, by an expression of the \u00aaunambiguous intent\u00ba ofCongress. Wyoming, supra, at 458; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408, 427\u00b1431 (1946). Whether or not the States would be permitted to burden the interstatetransport of low level radioactive waste in the absence ofCongress' approval, the States can clearly do so with Con- gress' approval, which is what the Act gives them. The second step, the Secretary's collection of a percentage of the surcharge, is no more than a federal tax on interstatecommerce, which petitioners do not claim to be an invalidexercise of either Congress' commerce or taxing power. Cf.United States v.Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42, 44\u00b145 (1950); Steward Machine Co. v.Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 581\u00b1583 (1937). The third step is a conditional exercise of Congress' au- thority under the Spending Clause: Congress has placed con-ditions\u00d0the achievement of the milestones\u00d0on the receiptof federal funds. Petitioners do not contend that Congresshas exceeded its authority in any of the four respects ourcases have identi\u00aeed. See generally South Dakota v.Dole, 483 U. S., at 207\u00b1208. The expenditure is for the general505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 172 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court welfare, Helvering v.Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640\u00b1641 (1937); the States are required to use the money they receive forthe purpose of assuring the safe disposal of radioactivewaste. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(E). The conditions imposedare unambiguous, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S., at 17; the Act informs the States ex- actly what they must do and by when they must do it inorder to obtain a share of the escrow account. The condi-tions imposed are reasonably related to the purpose of theexpenditure, Massachusetts v.United States, 435 U. S., at 461; both the conditions and the payments embody Congress' efforts to address the pressing problem of radioactive wastedisposal. Finally, petitioners do not claim that the condi-tions imposed by the Act violate any independent constitu-tional prohibition. Lawrence County v.Lead-Deadwood School Dist. No. 40\u00b11, 469 U. S. 256, 269\u00b1270 (1985). Petitioners contend nevertheless that the form of these expenditures removes them from the scope of Congress'spending power. Petitioners emphasize the Act's instruc-tion to the Secretary of Energy to \u00aadeposit all funds receivedin a special escrow account. The funds so deposited shallnot be the property of the United States.\u00ba 42 U. S. C.\u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(A). Petitioners argue that because the moneycollected and redisbursed to the States is kept in an accountseparate from the general treasury, because the Secretaryholds the funds only as a trustee, and because the Statesthemselves are largely able to control whether they will payinto the escrow account or receive a share, the Act \u00aain nomanner calls for the spending of federal funds.\u00ba ReplyBrief for Petitioner State of New York 6. The Constitution's grant to Congress of the authority to \u00aapay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare\u00ba hasnever, however, been thought to mandate a particular formof accounting. A great deal of federal spending comes fromsegregated trust funds collected and spent for a particularpurpose. See, e. g., 23 U. S.

C. \u00a7 401(a) (Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insur- ance Trust S. C. \u00a7 401(b) (Federal Disability In-surance Trust Fund); 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1395t (Federal Supplemen-tary Medical Insurance Trust Fund). The Spending Clausehas never been construed to deprive Congress of the powerto structure federal spending in this manner. Petitioners'argument regarding the States' ability to determine the es-crow account's income and disbursements ignores the factthat Congress speci\u00aecally provided the States with this abil-ity as a method of encouraging the States to regulate accord-ing to the federal plan. That the States are able to choosewhether they will receive federal funds does not make theresulting expenditures any less federal; indeed, the locationof such choice in the States is an inherent element in anyconditional exercise of Congress' spending power. The Act's \u00aerst set of incentives, in which Congress has conditioned grants to the States upon the States' attainmentof a series of milestones, is thus well within the authority ofCongress under the Commerce and Spending Clauses. Be-cause the \u00aerst set of incentives is supported by af\u00aermativeconstitutional grants of power to Congress, it is not incon-sistent with the Tenth Amendment. B In the second set of incentives, Congress has authorized States and regional compacts with disposal sites graduallyto increase the cost of access to the sites, and then to denyaccess altogether, to radioactive waste generated in Statesthat do not meet federal deadlines. As a simple regulation,this provision would be within the power of Congress to au-thorize the States to discriminate against interstate com-merce. See Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v.Board of Governors, FRS, 472 U. S. 159, 174\u00b1175 (1985). Where federal regula- tion of private activity is within the scope of the CommerceClause, we have recognized the ability of Congress to offerStates the choice of regulating that activity according to fed-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 174 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court eral standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation. See Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Recla- mation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288; FERC v.Mississippi, 456 U. S., at 764\u00b1765. This is the choice presented to nonsited States by the Act's second set of incentives: States may either regulate the dis-posal of radioactive waste according to federal standards byattaining local or regional self-suf\u00aeciency, or their residentswho produce radioactive waste will be subject to federal reg-ulation authorizing sited States and regions to deny accessto their disposal sites. The affected States are not com-pelled by Congress to regulate, because any burden causedby a State's refusal to regulate will fall on those who gener-ate waste and \u00aend no outlet for its disposal, rather than onthe State as a sovereign. A State whose citizens do notwish it to attain the Act's milestones may devote its attentionand its resources to issues its citizens deem more worthy;the choice remains at all times with the residents of theState, not with Congress. The State need not expend anyfunds, or participate in any federal program, if local residentsdo not view such expenditures or participation as worth-while. Cf. Hodel, supra, at 288. Nor must the State aban- don the \u00aeeld if it does not accede to federal direction; theState may continue to regulate the generation and disposalof radioactive waste in any manner its citizens see \u00aet. The Act's second set of incentives thus represents a con- ditional exercise of Congress' commerce power, along thelines of those we have held to be within Congress' author-ity. As a result, the second set of incentives does not in-trude on the sovereignty reserved to the States by theTenth Amendment. C The take title provision is of a different character. This third so-called \u00aaincentive\u00ba offers States, as an alternative toregulating pursuant to Congress' direction, the option of tak-ing title to and possession of the low level radioactive waste505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 175 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court generated within their borders and becoming liable for all damages waste generators suffer as a result of the States'failure to do so promptly. In this provision, Congress hascrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion. We must initially reject respondents' suggestion that, be- cause the take title provision will not take effect until Janu-ary 1, 1996, petitioners' challenge thereto is unripe. It takesmany years to develop a new disposal site. All parties agreethat New York must take action now in order to avoid thetake title provision's consequences, and no party suggeststhat the State's waste generators will have ceased producing waste by 1996. The issue is thus ripe for review. Cf. Pa- ci\u00aec Gas & Elec. Co. v.State Energy Resources Conserva- and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 201 (1983); Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 144\u00b1 145 (1974). The take title provision offers state governments a \u00aachoice\u00ba of either accepting ownership of waste or regulatingaccording to the instructions of Congress. Respondents donot claim that the Constitution would authorize Congress toimpose either option as a freestanding requirement. On onehand, the Constitution would not permit Congress simply totransfer radioactive waste from generators to state govern-ments. Such a forced transfer, standing alone, would inprinciple be no different than a congressionally compelledsubsidy from state governments to radioactive waste produc-ers. The same is true of the provision requiring the Statesto become liable for the generators' damages. Standingalone, this provision would be indistinguishable from an Actof Congress directing the States to assume the liabilities ofcertain state residents. Either type of federal action would\u00aacommandeer\u00ba state governments into the service of federalregulatory purposes, and would for this reason be inconsist-ent with the Constitution's division of authority between fed-eral and state governments. On the other hand, the secondalternative held out to state governments\u00d0regulating pur-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 176 NEW YORK Opinion of the Court suant to Congress' direction\u00d0would, standing alone, present a simple command to state governments to implement legis-lation enacted by Congress. As we have seen, the Constitu-tion does not empower Congress to subject state govern-ments to this type of instruction. Because an instruction to state governments to take title to waste, standing alone, would be beyond the authority ofCongress, and because a direct order to regulate, standingalone, would also be beyond the authority of Congress, itfollows that Congress lacks the power to offer the States achoice between the two. Unlike the \u00aerst two sets of incen- tives, the take title incentive does not represent the condi-tional exercise of any congressional power enumerated in theConstitution. In this provision, Congress has not held outthe threat of exercising its spending power or its commercepower; it has instead held out the threat, should the Statesnot regulate according to one federal instruction, of simplyforcing the States to submit to another federal instruction.A choice between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatorytechniques is no choice at all. Either way, \u00aathe Act com-mandeers the legislative processes of the States by directlycompe lling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program,\u00ba Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at 288, an outcome that has never been understood to lie within the authority conferred upon Con-gress by the Constitution. Respondents emphasize the latitude given to the States to implement Congress' plan. The Act enables the States toregulate pursuant to Congress' instructions in any numberof different ways. States may avoid taking title by con-tracting with sited regional compacts, by building a disposalsite alone or as part of a compact, or by permitting privateparties to build a disposal site. States that host sites mayemploy a wide range of designs and disposal methods, sub-ject only to broad federal regulatory limits. This line of rea-soning, however, only underscores the critical alternative a505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 177 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court State lacks: A State may not decline to administer the fed- eral program. No matter which path the State chooses, itmust follow the direction of Congress. The take title provision appears to be unique. No other federal statute has been cited which offers a state govern-ment no option other than that of implementing legislationenacted by Congress. Whether one views the take title pro-vision as lying outside Congress' enumerated powers, or asinfringing upon the core of state sovereignty reserved bythe Tenth Amendment, the provision is inconsistent with thefederal structure of our Government established by theConstitution. IV Respondents raise a number of objections to this under- standing of the limits of Congress' power. A The United States proposes three alternative views of the constitutional line separating state and federal authority.While each view concedes that Congress generally may not compel state governments to regulate pursuant to federaldirection, each purports to \u00aend a limited domain in whichsuch coercion is permitted by the Constitution. First, the United States argues that the Constitution's prohibition of congressional directives to state governmentscan be overcome where the federal interest is suf\u00aecientlyimportant to justify state submission. This argument con-tains a kernel of truth: In determining whether the TenthAmendment limits the ability of Congress to subject stategovernments to generally applicable laws, the Court has in some cases stated that it will evaluate the strength of federalinterests in light of the degree to which such laws wouldprevent the State from functioning as a sovereign; that is,the extent to which such generally applicable laws would im-pede a state government's responsibility to represent and beaccountable to the citizens of the State. See, e. g., EEOC v.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 178 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 242, n. 17; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 684, n. 9; National League of Cities v.Usery, 426 U. S., at 853. The Court has more recently departed from this approach. See, e. g., South Car- olina v.Baker, 485 U. S., at 512\u00b1513; Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 556\u00b1557. But whether or not a particularly strong federal interest enablesCongress to bring state governments within the orbit of gen-erally applicable federal regulation, no Member of the Court has ever suggested that such a federal interest would enableCongress to command a state government to enact state reg- ulation. No matter how powerful the federal interest in-volved, the Constitution simply does not give Congress theauthority to require the States to regulate. The Constitu-tion instead gives Congress the authority to regulate mat-ters directly and to pre-empt contrary state regulation.Where a federal interest is suf\u00aeciently strong to cause Con-gress to legislate, it must do so directly; it may not conscriptstate governments as its agents. Second, the United States argues that the Constitution does, in some circumstances, permit federal directives tostate governments. Various cases are cited for this proposi-tion, but none support it. Some of these cases discuss thewell established power of Congress to pass laws enforceablein state courts. See Testa v.Katt, 330 U. S. 386 (1947); Palmore v.United States, 411 U. S. 389, 402 (1973); see also Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 57 (1912); Cla\u00afin v.Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136\u00b1137 (1876). These cases involve no more than an application of the SupremacyClause's provision that federal law \u00aashall be the supremeLaw of the Land,\u00ba enforceable in every State. More to thepoint, all involve congressional regulation of individuals, notcongressional requirements that States regulate. Federalstatutes enforceable in state courts do, in a sense, directstate judges to enforce them, but this sort of federal \u00aadirec-tion\u00ba of state judges is mandated by the text of the Suprem-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 179 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court acy Clause. No comparable constitutional provision author- izes Congress to command state legislatures to legislate. Additional cases cited by the United States discuss the power of federal courts to order state of\u00aecials to comply with federal law. See Puerto Rico v.Branstad, 483 U. S. 219, 228 (1987); Washington v.Washington State Commercial Pas- senger Fishing 658, 695 (1979); Illi- nois v.City of Milwaukee, 406 106\u00b1108 (1972); see also Cooper v.Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18\u00b119 (1958); Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955); Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 155\u00b1156 (1908). Again, however, the text of the Constitution plainly confers this authority on thefederal courts, the \u00aajudicial Power\u00ba of which \u00aashall extendto all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitu-tion, [and] the Laws of the United States . . . ; [and] to Con-troversies between two or States; [and] between aState and Citizens of another State.\u00ba U. S. Const., Art. III,\u00a7 2. The Constitution contains no analogous grant of author-ity to Congress. Moreover, the Supremacy Clause makesfederal law paramount over the contrary positions of stateof\u00aecials; the power of federal courts to enforce federal lawthus presupposes some authority to order state of\u00aecials tocomply. See Puerto Rico v.Branstad, supra, at 227\u00b1228 (overruling Kentucky v.Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861)). In sum, the cases relied upon by the United States hold only that federal law is enforceable in state courts and thatfederal courts may in proper circumstances order state of\u00ae-cials to comply with federal law, propositions that by nomeans imply any authority on the part of Congress to man-date state regulation. Third, the United States, supported by the three sited re- gional compacts as amici, argues that the Constitution envi- sions a role for Congress as an arbiter of interstate disputes.The United States observes that federal courts, and thisCourt in particular, have frequently resolved con\u00aficts amongStates. See, e. g., Arkansas v.Oklahoma, 503 U. 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 180 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court (1992); Wyoming v.Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437 (1992). Many of these disputes have involved the allocation of shared re-sources among the States, a category perhaps broad enoughto encompass the allocation of scarce disposal space for radio-active waste. See, e. g., Colorado v.New Mexico, 459 U. S. 176 (1982); Arizona v.California, 373 U. S. 546 (1963). The United States suggests that if the Court may resolve suchinterstate disputes, Congress can surely do the same underthe Commerce Clause. The regional compacts support thisargument with a series of quotations from The Federalistand other contemporaneous documents, which the compactscontend demonstrate that the Framers established a strongNational Legislature for the purpose of resolving trade dis-putes among the States. Brief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact et al. as Amici Curiae 17, and n. 16. While the Framers no doubt endowed Congress with the power to regulate interstate commerce in order to avoid fur-ther instances of the interstate trade disputes that werecommon under the Articles of Confederation, the Framersdid not intend that Congress should exercise that power through the mechanism of mandating state regulation. TheConstitution established Congress as \u00aaa superintending au-thority over the reciprocal trade\u00ba among the States, TheFederalist No. 42, p. 268 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), by empower-ing Congress to regulate that trade directly, not by authoriz-ing Congress to issue trade-related orders to state govern-ments. As Madison and Hamilton explained, \u00aaa sovereigntyover sovereigns, a government over governments, a legisla-tion for communities, as contradistinguished from individu-als, as it is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is subversiveof the order and ends of civil polity.\u00ba Id.,No. 20, at 138. B The sited state respondents focus their attention on the process by which the Act was formulated. They correctly505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 181 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court observe that public of\u00aecials representing the State of New York lent their support to the Act's enactment. A DeputyCommissioner of the State's Energy Of\u00aece testi\u00aeed favorof the Act. See Low-Level Waste Legislation: Hearings onH. R. 862, H. R. 1046, H. R. 1083, and H. R. 1267 before theSubcommittee on Energy and the Environment of the HouseCommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 99th Cong., 1stSess., 97\u00b198, 190\u00b1199 (1985) (testimony of Charles Guinn).Senator Moynihan of New York spoke in support of the Acton the \u00afoor of the Senate. 131 Cong. Rec. 38423 (1985).Respondents note that the Act embodies a bargain amongthe sited and unsited States, a compromise to which NewY ork was a willing par ticipant and from which New York has reaped much bene\u00aet. Respondents then pose what ap-pears at \u00aerst to be a troubling question: How can a federal statute be found an unconstitutional infringement of statesovereignty when state of\u00aecials consented to the statute'senactment? The answer follows from an understanding of the funda- mental purpose served by our Government's federal struc-ture. The Constitution does not protect the sovereignty ofStates for the bene\u00aet of the States or state governments asabstract political entities, or even for the bene\u00aet of the publicof\u00aecials governing the States. To the contrary, the Consti-tution divides authority between federal and state govern-ments for the protection of individuals. State sovereigntyis not just an end in itself: \u00aaRather, federalism secures tocitizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sov-ereign power.\u00ba Coleman v.Thompson, 501 U. Blackmun , J., dissenting). \u00aaJust as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the FederalGovernment serve to prevent the accumulation of excessivepower in any one branch, a healthy balance of power betweenthe States and the Federal Government will reduce the riskof tyranny and abuse from either front.\u00ba Gregory v.Ash-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 182 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court croft, 501 U. S., at 458. See The Federalist No. 51, p. 323 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Where Congress exceeds its authority relative to the States, therefore, the departure from the constitutional plancannot be rati\u00aeed by the \u00aaconsent\u00ba of state of\u00aecials. Ananalogy to the separation of powers among the branches ofthe Federal Government clari\u00aees this point. The Constitu-tion's division of power among the three branches is violatedwhere one branch invades the territory of another, whetheror not the encroached-upon branch approves the encroach-ment. In Buckley v.Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 118\u00b1137 (1976), for instance, the Court held that Congress had infringed thePresident's appointment power, despite the fact that thePresident himself had manifested his consent to the statutethat caused the infringement by signing it into law. See Na- tional League of Cities v.Usery, 426 U. S., at 842, n. 12. In INS v.Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944\u00b1959 (1983), we held that the legislative veto violated the constitutional requirementthat legislation be presented to the President, despite Presi-dents' approval of hundreds of statutes containing a legisla-tive veto provision. See id.,at 944\u00b1945. The constitutional authority of Congress cannot be expanded by the \u00aaconsent\u00baof the governmental unit whose domain is thereby narrowed,whether that unit is the Executive Branch or the States. State of\u00aecials thus cannot consent to the enlargement of the powers of Congress beyond those enumerated in theConstitution. Indeed, the facts of these cases raise the pos-sibility that powerful incentives might lead both federal andstate of\u00aecials to view departures from the federal structureto be in their personal interests. Most citizens recognizethe need for radioactive waste disposal sites, but few wantsites near their homes. As a result, while it would be wellwithin the authority of either federal or state of\u00aecials tochoose where the disposal sites will be, it is likely to be inthe political interest of each individual of\u00aecial to avoid beingheld accountable to the voters for the choice of location. If505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 183 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court a federal of\u00aecial is faced with the alternatives of choosing a location or directing the States to do it, the of\u00aecial may wellprefer the latter, as a means of shifting responsibility for theeventual decision. If a state of\u00aecial is faced with the sameset of alternatives\u00d0choosing a location or having Congressdirect the choice of a location\u00d0the state of\u00aecial may alsoprefer the latter, as it may permit the avoidance of personalresponsibility. The interests of public of\u00aecials thus may notcoincide with the Constitution's intergovernmental allocationof authority. Where state of\u00aecials purport to submit to thedirection of Congress in this manner, federalism is hardlybeing advanced. Nor does the State's prior support for the Act estop it from asserting the Act's unconstitutionality. While New Yorkhas received the bene\u00aet of the Act in the form of a few moreyears of access to disposal sites in other States, New Yorkhas never joined a regional radioactive waste compact. Anyestoppel implications that might \u00afow from membership in acompact, see West Virginia ex rel. Dyer v.Sims, 341 U. S. 22, 35\u00b136 (1951) (Jackson, J., concurring), thus do not concernus here. The fact that the Act, like much federal legislation,embodies a compromise among the States does not elevatethe Act (or the antecedent discussions among representa-tives of the States) to the status of an interstate agreementrequiring Congress' approval under the Compact Clause.Cf.Holmes v.Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 572 (1840) (plurality opinion). That a party collaborated with others in seekinglegislation has never been understood to estop the partyfrom challenging that legislation in subsequent litigation. V Petitioners also contend that the Act is inconsistent with the Constitution's Guarantee Clause, which directs theUnited States to \u00aaguarantee to every State in this Union aRepublican Form of Government.\u00ba U. S. Const., Art. IV , \u00a7 4.Because we have found the take title provision of the Act505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 184 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court irreconcilable with the powers delegated to Congress by the Constitution and hence with the Tenth Amendment's reser-vation to the States of those powers not delegated to theFederal Government, we need only address the applicabilityof the Guarantee Clause to the Act's other two challengedprovisions. We approach the issue with some trepidation, because the Guarantee Clause has been an infrequent basis for litigationthroughout our history. In most of the cases in which theCourt has been asked to apply the Clause, the Court hasfound the claims presented to be nonjusticiable under the \u00aapolitical question\u00ba doctrine. See, e . g . ,C i t yo fR o m e v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 182, n. 17 (1980) (challenge to the preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act);Baker v.Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 218\u00b1229 (1962) (challenge to apportionment of state legislative districts); Paci\u00aec States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, 140\u00b1151 (1912) (challenge to initiative and referendum provisions ofstate constitution). The view that the Guarantee Clause implicates only non- justiciable political questions has its origin in Luther v.Bor- den, 7 How. 1 (1849), in which the Court was asked to decide, in the wake of Dorr's Rebellion, which of two rival govern-ments was the legitimate government of Rhode Island. TheCourt held that \u00aait rests with Congress,\u00ba not the judiciary,\u00aato decide what government is the established one in aState.\u00ba Id.,at 42. Over the following century, this limited holding metamorphosed into the sweeping assertion that\u00aa[v]iolation of the great guaranty of a republican form of gov-ernment in States cannot be challenged in the courts.\u00ba Cole- grove v.Green, 328 U. S. 549, 556 (1946) (plurality opinion). This view has not always been accepted. In a group of cases decided before the holding of Luther was elevated into a general rule of nonjusticiability, the Court addressed themerits of claims founded on the Guarantee Clause withoutany suggestion that the claims were not justiciable. See At-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 185 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court torney General of Michigan ex rel. Kies v.Lowrey, 199 U. S. 233, 239 (1905); Forsyth v.Hammond, 166 U. S. 506, 519 (1897); In re Duncan, 139 U. S. 449, 461\u00b1462 (1891); Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175\u00b1176 (1875). See also Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 563\u00b1564 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissent- ing) (racial segregation \u00aainconsistent with the guaranteegiven by the Constitution to each State of a republican formof government\u00ba). More recently, the Court has suggested that perhaps not all claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiablepolitical questions. See Reynolds v.Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 582 (1964) (\u00aa[S]ome questions raised under the Guarantee Clauseare nonjusticiable\u00ba). Contemporary commentators have like-wise suggested that courts should address the merits of suchclaims, at least in some circumstances. See, e. g., L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 398 (2d ed. 1988); J. Ely,Democracy and Distrust: A Judicial Review 118,n., and 122\u00b1123 (1980); W. Wiecek, The Guarantee Clause ofthe U. S. Constitution 287\u00b1289, 300 (1972); Merritt, 88 Colum.L. Rev., at 70\u00b178; Bon\u00aeeld, The Guarantee Clause of ArticleIV , Section 4: A Study in Constitutional Desuetude, 46 Minn.L. Rev. 513, 560\u00b1565 (1962). We need not resolve this dif\u00aecult question today. Even if we assume that petitioners' claim is justiciable, neither themonetary incentives provided by the Act nor the possibilitythat a State's waste producers may \u00aend themselves excludedfrom the disposal sites of another State can reasonably besaid to deny any State a republican form of government. Aswe have seen, these two incentives represent permissibleconditional exercises of Congress' authority under theSpending and Commerce Clauses respectively, in forms thathave now grown commonplace. Under each, Congress of-fers the States a legitimate choice rather than issuing anunavoidable command. The States thereby retain the abil-ity to set their legislative agendas; state government of\u00aecialsremain accountable to the local electorate. The twin threats505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 186 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court imposed by the \u00aerst two challenged provisions of the Act\u00d0 that New York may miss out on a share of federal spending orthat those generating radioactive waste within New York maylose out-of-state disposal outlets\u00d0do not pose any realisticrisk of altering the form or the method of functioning ofNew York's government. Thus even indulging the assump-tion that the Guarantee Clause provides a basis upon whicha State or its subdivisions may sue to enjoin the enforcementof a federal statute, petitioners have not made out such aclaim in these cases. VI Having determined that the take title provision exceeds the powers of Congress, we must consider whether it is sev-erable from the rest of the Act. \u00aaThe standard for determining the severability of an un- constitutional provision is well established: Unless it is evi-dent that the Legislature would not have enacted those pro-visions which are within its power, independently of thatwhich is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is leftis fully operative as a law.\u00ba Alaska Airlines, Inc. v.Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).While the Act itself contains no statement of whether itsprovisions are severable, \u00aa[i]n the absence of a severabilityclause ,... Congress' silence is just that\u00d0silence\u00d0and does not raise a presumption against severability.\u00ba Id., at 686. Common sense suggests that where Congress has enacted astatutory scheme for an obvious purpose, and where Con-gress has included a series of provisions operating as incen-tives to achieve that purpose, the invalidation of one of theincentives should not ordinarily cause Congress' overall in-tent to be frustrated. As the Court has observed, \u00aait is notto be presumed that the legislature was legislating for themere sake of imposing penalties, but the penaltie s... were simply in aid of the main purpose of the statute. They mayfail, and still the great body of the statute have operativeforce, and the force contemplated by the legislature in its505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 187 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of the Court enactment.\u00ba Reagan v.Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U. S. 362, 396 (1894). See also United States v.Jackson, 390 U. S. 570, 585\u00b1586 (1968). It is apparent in light of these principles that the take title provision may be severed without doing violence to the restof the Act. The Act is still operative and it still serves Con-gress' objective of encouraging the States to attain local or regional self-suf\u00aeciency in the disposal of low level radioac-tive waste. It still includes two incentives that coax theStates along this road. A State whose radioactive wastegenerators are unable to gain access to disposal sites in otherStates may encounter considerable internal pressure to pro-vide for the disposal of waste, even without the prospect oftaking title. The sited regional compacts need not acceptNew York's waste after the 7-year transition period expires,so any burden caused by New York's failure to secure a dis-posal site will not be borne by the residents of other States.The purpose of the Act is not defeated by the invalidation ofthe take title provision, so we may leave the remainder ofthe Act in force. VII Some truths are so basic that, like the air around us, they are easily overlooked. Much of the Constitution is con-cerned with setting forth the form of our government, andthe courts have traditionally invalidated measures deviatingfrom that form. The result may appear \u00aaformalistic\u00ba in agiven case to partisans of the measure at issue, because suchmeasures are typically the product of the era's perceived ne-cessity. But the Constitution protects us from our own bestintentions: It divides power among sovereigns and amongbranches of government precisely so that we may resist thetemptation to concentrate power in one location as an ex-pedient solution to the crisis of the day. The shortage ofdisposal sites for radioactive waste is a pressing nationalproblem, but a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 188 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. government with each issue of comparable gravity would, in the long run, be far worse. States are not mere political subdivisions of the United States. State governments are neither regional of\u00aeces noradministrative agencies of the Federal Government. Thepositions occupied by state of\u00aecials appear nowhere on theFederal Government's most detailed organizational chart.The Constitution instead \u00aaleaves to the several States a re-siduary and inviolable sovereignty,\u00ba The Federalist No. 39,p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), reserved explicitly to the Statesby the Tenth Amendment. Whatever the outer limits of that sovereignty may be, one thing is clear: The Federal Government may not compel theStates to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. The Constitution permits both the Federal Government andthe States to enact legislation regarding the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste. The Constitution enables the Fed-eral Government to pre-empt state regulation contrary tofederal interests, and it permits the Federal Government tohold out incentives to the States as a means of encouragingthem to adopt suggested regulatory schemes. It does not,however, authorize Congress simply to direct the States toprovide for the disposal of the radioactive waste generatedwithin their borders. While there may be many constitu-tional methods of achieving regional self-suf\u00aeciency in radio-active waste disposal, the method Congress has chosen isnot one of them. The judgment of the Court of Appealsis accordingly Af\u00aermed in part and reversed in part. Justice White , with whom Justice Blackmun and Jus- tice Stevens join, concurring in part and dissenting in part. The Court today af\u00aerms the constitutionality of two facets of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Actof 1985 (1985 Act), Pub. L. 99\u00b1240, 99 Stat. 1842, 42 U. S. C.\u00a7 2021b et seq. These provisions include the monetary in-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 189 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. centives from surcharges collected by States with low-level radioactive waste storage sites and rebated by the Secre-tary of Energy to States in compliance with the 1985 Act'sdeadlines for achieving regional or in-state disposal, see\u00a7\u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(A) and 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iv), and the \u00aaaccess in-centives,\u00ba which deny access to disposal sites for States thatfail to meet certain deadlines for low-level radioactive wastedisposal management, \u00a7 2021e(e)(2). The Court strikesdown and severs a third component of the 1985 Act, the \u00aataketitle\u00ba provision, which requires a noncomplying State to taketitle to or to assume liability for its low-level radioactivewaste if it fails to provide for the disposal of such wasteby January 1, 1996. \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(C). The Court deems thislast provision unconstitutional under principles of federal-ism. Because I believe the Court has mischaracterized theessential inquiry, misanalyzed the inquiry it has chosen toundertake, and undervalued the effect the seriousness of thispublic policy problem should have on the constitutionality ofthe take title provision, I can only join Parts III\u00b1A andIII\u00b1B, and I respectfully dissent from the rest of its opinionand the judgment reversing in part the judgment of theCourt of Appeals. I My disagreement with the Court's analysis begins at the basic descriptive level of how the legislation at issue in thesecases came to be enacted. The Court goes some way towardsetting out the bare facts, but its omissions cast the statutorycontext of the take title provision in the wrong light. Toread the Court's version of events, see ante, at 150\u00b1151, one would think that Congress was the sole proponent of a solu-tion to the Nation's low-level radioactive waste problem.Not so. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of1980 (1980 Act), Pub. L. 96\u00b1573, 94 Stat. 3347, and its amend-atory 1985 Act, resulted from the efforts of state leaders toachieve a state-based set of remedies to the waste problem.They sought not federal pre-emption or intervention, but505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 190 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. rather congressional sanction of interstate compromises they had reached. The two signal events in 1979 that precipitated move- ment toward legislation were the temporary closing of theNevada disposal site in July 1979, after several serioustransportation-related incidents, and the temporary shuttingof the Washington disposal site because of similar transpor-tation and packaging problems in October 1979. At thattime the facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, received ap-proximately three-quarters of the Nation's low-level radioac-tive waste, and the Governor ordered a 50 percent reduction in the amount his State's plant would accept for disposal.National Governors' Association Task Force on Low-LevelRadioactive Waste Disposal, Low-Level Waste: A Programfor Action 3 (Nov. 1980) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court)(hereinafter A Program for Action). The Governor ofWashington threatened to shut down the Hanford, Washing-ton, facility entirely by 1982 unless \u00aasome meaningful prog-ress occurs toward\u00ba development of regional solutions to thewaste disposal problem. Id., at 4, n. Only three sites ex- isted in the country for the disposal of low-level radioactivewaste, and the \u00aasited\u00ba States confronted the undesirable al-ternatives either of continuing to be the dumping groundsfor the entire Nation's low-level waste or of eliminating orreducing in a constitutional manner the amount of wasteaccepted for disposal. The imminence of a crisis in low-level radioactive waste management cannot be overstated. In December 1979, theNational Governors' Association convened an eight-membertask force to coordinate policy proposals on behalf of theStates. See Status of Interstate Compacts for the Disposalof Low-Level Radioactive Waste: Hearing before the on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1983).In May 1980, the State Planning Council on RadioactiveWaste Management submitted the following unanimous rec-ommendation to President Carter:505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 191 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. \u00aaThe national policy of the United States on low-level radioactive waste shall be that every State is responsi-ble for the disposal of the low-level radioactive wastegenerated by nondefense related activities within itsboundaries and that States are authorized to enter intointerstate compacts, as necessary, for the purpose ofcarrying out this responsibility.\u00ba 126 Cong. Rec. 20135(1980). This recommendation was adopted by the National Gover- nors' Association a few months later. See A Program forAction 6\u00b17; H. R. Rep. No. 99\u00b1314, pt. 2, p. 18 (1985) .The Governors recognized that the Federal Government could as-sert its preeminence in achieving a solution to this problem,but requested instead that Congress oversee state-developedregional solutions. Accordingly, the Governors' Task Forceurged that \u00aaeach state should accept primary responsibilityfor the safe disposal of low-level radioactive waste generatedwithin its borders\u00ba and that \u00aathe states should pursue a re-gional approach to the low-level waste disposal problem.\u00baA Program for Action 6. The Governors went further, however, in recommending that \u00aaCongress should authorize the states to enter into in-terstate compacts to establish regional disposal sites\u00ba andthat \u00aa[s]uch authorization should include the power to ex-clude waste generated outside the region from the regionaldisposal site.\u00ba Id.,at 7. The Governors had an obvious in- centive in urging Congress not to add more coercive meas-ures to the legislation should the States fail to comply, butthey nevertheless anticipated that Congress might eventu- ally have to take stronger steps to ensure compliance withlong-range planning deadlines for low-level radioactive wastemanagement. Accordingly, the Governors' Task Force \u00aarecommend[ed] that Congress defer consideration of sanctions to compel the establishment of new disposalsites until at least two years after the enactment of com-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 192 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. pact consent legislation. States are already confronting the diminishing capacity of present sites and an unequiv-ocal political warning from those states' Governors. Ifat the end of the two-year period states have not re-sponded effectively, or if problems still exist, strongerfederal action may be necessary. But until that time,Congress should con\u00aene its role to removing obstaclesand allow the states a reasonable chance to solve theproblem themselves.\u00ba Id.,at 8\u00b19. Such concerns would have been mooted had Congress en- acted a \u00aafederal\u00ba solution, which the Senate considered inJuly 1980. See ca lling for federal study, oversight, and management of radioactive waste).This \u00aafederal\u00ba solution, however, was opposed by one of thesited State's Senators, who introduced an amendment toadopt and implement the recommendations of the State Plan-ning Council on Radioactive Waste Management. See 126Cong. Rec. 20136 (1980) (statement of Sen. Thurmond). The\u00aastate-based\u00ba solution carried the day, and as enacted, the1980 Act announced the \u00aapolicy of the Federal Governmentt h a t... each State is responsible for providing for the avail- ability of capacity either within or outside the State for thedisposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within itsborders.\u00ba Pub. L. 96\u00b1573, \u00a7 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980Act further authorized States to \u00aaenter into such compactsas may be necessary to provide for the establishment andoperation of regional disposal facilities for low-level radioac-tive waste,\u00ba \u00a7 4(a)(2)(A), compacts its consent. \u00a7 4(a)(2)(B). The 1980 Act alsoprovided that, beginning on January 1, 1986, an approvedcompact could reserve access to its disposal facilities forthose States which had joined that particular regional com-pact. Ibid. As well described by one of the amici, the attempts by States to enter into compacts and to gain congressional ap-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 193 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. proval sparked a new round of political squabbling between elected of\u00aecials from unsited States, who generally opposedrati\u00aecation of the compacts that were being formed, andtheir counterparts from the sited States, who insisted thatthe promises made in the 1980 Act be honored. See Brieffor American Federation of Labor and Congress of IndustrialOrganizations as Amicus Curiae 12\u00b114. In its effort to keep the States at the forefront of the policy amendmentprocess, the National Governors' Association organized morethan a dozen meetings to achieve a state consensus. See H.Brown, The Low-Level Waste Handbook: A User's Guide tothe Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Actof 1985, p. iv (Nov. 1986) (describing \u00aathe states' desire toin\u00afuence any revisions of the 1980 Act\u00ba). These discussions were not merely academic. The sited States grew increasingly and justi\u00aeably frustrated by theseeming inaction of unsited States in meeting the projectedactions called for in the 1980 Act. Thus, as the end of 1985approached, the sited States viewed the January 1, 1986,deadline established in the 1980 Act as a \u00aadrop-dead\u00ba date,on which the regional compacts could begin excluding theentry of out-of-region waste. See 131 Cong. Rec. 35203(1985). Since by this time the three disposal facilities oper-ating in 1980 were still the only such plants accepting low-level radioactive waste, the unsited States perceived a veryserious danger if the three existing facilities actually carriedout their threat to restrict access to the waste generatedsolely within their respective compact regions. A movement thus arose to achieve a compromise between the sited and the unsited States, in which the sited Statesagreed to continue accepting waste in exchange for the im-position of stronger measures to guarantee compliance withthe unsited States' assurances that they would develop al-ternative disposal facilities. As Representative Derrickexplained, the compromise 1985 legislation \u00aagives nonsited505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 194 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. States more time to develop disposal sites, but also estab- lishes a very \u00aerm timetable and sanctions for liveup [to] the agreement.\u00ba Id.,at 35207. Representative Mar- key added that \u00aa[t]his compromise became the basis for ouramendments to the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Actof 1980. In the process of drafting such amendments, vari-ous concessions have been made by all sides in an effort toarrive at a bill which all parties could accept.\u00ba Id.,at 35205. The bill that in large measure became the 1985 Act \u00aarepre-sent[ed] the diligent negotiating undertaken by\u00ba the Na-tional Governors' Association and \u00aaembodied\u00ba the \u00aafunda-mentals of their settlement.\u00ba Id., at 35204 (statement of Rep. Udall). In sum, the 1985 Act was very much the prod-uct of cooperative federalism, in which the States bargainedamong themselves to achieve compromises for Congress tosanction. There is no need to resummarize the essentials of the 1985 legislation, which the Court does ante, at 151\u00b1154. It does, however, seem critical to emphasize what is accurately de-scribed in one amicus brief as the assumption by Congress of \u00aathe role of arbiter of disputes among the several States.\u00baBrief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive WasteCompact et al. as Amici Curiae 9. Unlike legislation that directs action from the Federal Government to the States,the 1980 and 1985 Acts re\u00afected hard-fought agreements among States as refereed by Congress. The distinction iskey, and the Court's failure properly to characterize this leg-islation ultimately affects its analysis of the take title provi-sion's constitutionality. II To justify its holding that the take title provision contra- venes the Constitution, the Court posits that \u00aa[i]n this provi-sion, Congress has crossed the line distinguishing encourage-ment from coercion.\u00ba Ante, at 175. Without attempting to understand properly the take title provision's place in the505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 195 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. interstate bargaining process, the Court isolates the measure analytically and proceeds to dissect it in a syllogistic fashion.The Court candidly begins with an argument respondents donotmake: that \u00aathe Constitution would not permit Congress simply to transfer radioactive waste from generators to stategovernments.\u00ba Ibid. \u00aaSuch a forced transfer,\u00ba it contin- ues, \u00aastanding alone, would in principle be no different thana congressionally compelled subsidy from state governmentsto radioactive waste producers.\u00ba Ibid. Since this is notan argument respondents make, one naturally wonders why theCourt builds its analysis that the take title provision is un-constitutional around this opening premise. But havingcarefully built its straw man, the Court proceeds impres-sively to knock him down. \u00aaAs we have seen,\u00ba the Courtteaches, \u00aathe Constitution does not empower Congress tosubject state governments to this type of instruction.\u00baAnte, at 176. Curiously absent from the Court's analysis is any effort to place the take title provision within the overall context ofthe legislation. As the discussion in Part I of this opinionsuggests, the 1980 and 1985 statutes were enacted against abackdrop of national concern over the availability of addi-tional low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Con- gress could have pre-empted the \u00aeeld by directly regulatingthe disposal of this waste pursuant to its powers under theCommerce and Spending Clauses, but instead it unani- mously assented to the States' request for congressional rat- i\u00aecation of agreements to which they had acceded. See 131Cong. Rec. 35252 (1985); id.,at 38425. As the \u00afoor state- of Members of Congress reveal, see supra, at 193\u00b1194, the States wished to take the lead in achieving a solution tothis problem and agreed among themselves to the variousincentives and penalties implemented by Congress to ensure505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 196 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. adherence to the various deadlines and goals.1The chief executives of the States proposed this approach, and I amunmoved by the Court's vehemence in taking away Con-gress' authority to sanction a recalcitrant unsited State nowthat New York has reaped the bene\u00aets of the sited States'concessions. A In my view, New York's actions subsequent to enactment of the 1980 and 1985 Acts fairly indicate its approval of theinterstate agreement process embodied in those laws withinthe meaning of Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution, whichprovides that \u00aa[n]o State shall, without the Consent ofCongress ,... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State.\u00ba First, the States\u00d0including New York\u00d0worked through their Governors to petition Congress for the1980 and 1985 Acts. As I have attempted to demonstrate,these statutes are best understood as the products of collec-tive state action, rather than as impositions placed on Statesby the Federal Government. Second, New York acted incompliance with the requisites of both statutes in key re-spects, thus signifying its assent to the agreement achievedamong the States as codi\u00aeed in these laws. After enact-ment of the 1980 Act and pursuant to its provision in \u00a7 4(a)(2),94 Stat. 3348, New York entered into compact negotiationswith several other northeastern States before withdrawingfrom them to \u00aago it alone.\u00ba Indeed, in 1985, as the January1, 1986, deadline crisis approached and Congress consideredthe 1985 legislation that is the subject of this lawsuit, theDeputy Commissioner for Policy and Planning of the New 1As Senator McClure pointed out: \u00aa[T]he actions taken in the Commit- tee on Energy and Natural Resources met the objections and the objec-tives of the States point by point; and I want to underscore what theSenator from Louisiana has indicated\u00d0that it is important that we havereal milestones. It is important to note that the discussions betweenstaffs and principals have produced a[n] agreement that does have somereal teeth in it at some points.\u00ba 131 Cong.

York State Energy Of\u00aece testi\u00aeed before Congress that \u00aaNew York State supports the efforts of Mr. Udall and themembers of this Subcommittee to resolve the current im-passe over Congressional consent to the proposed LLRWcompacts and provide interim access for states and regionswithout sites. New York State has been participating with the National Governors' Association and the other largestates and compact commissions in an effort to furtherre\u00aene the recommended approach in HR 1083 and reach aconsensus between all groups. \u00ba See Low-Level Waste Leg- islation: Hearings on H. R. 862, H. R. 1046, H. R. 1083, and H. R. 1267 before the Subcommittee on Energy and the En-vironment of the House Committee on Interior and Insu-lar Affairs, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 197 (1985) (testimony ofCharles Guinn) (emphasis added). Based on the assumption that \u00aaother states will [not] con- tinue inde\u00aenitely to provide access to facilities adequate forthe permanent disposal of low-level radioactive waste gener-ated in New York,\u00ba 1986 N. Y . Laws, ch. 673, \u00a7 2, the statelegislature enacted a law providing for a waste disposal facil-ity to be sited in the State. Ibid. This measure comported with the 1985 Act's proviso that States which did not joina regional compact by July 1, 1986, would have to establishan in-state waste disposal facility. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2021e(e)(1)(A). New York also complied with another provisionof the 1985 Act, \u00a7 2021e(e)(1)(B), which provided that by Jan-uary 1, 1988, each compact or independent State would iden-tify a facility location and develop a siting plan, or contractwith a sited compact for access to that region's facility. By1988, New York had identi\u00aeed \u00aeve potential sites in Cortlandand Allegany Counties, but public opposition there causedthe State to reconsider where to locate its waste disposalfacility. See Of\u00aece of Environmental Restoration and WasteManagement, U. S. Dept. of Energy, Report to Congress inResponse to Public Law 99\u00b1240: 1990 Annual Report onLow-Level Radioactive Waste Management Progress 32\u00b135505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 198 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. (1991) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court). As it was un- dertaking these initial steps to honor the interstate compro-mise embodied in the 1985 Act, New York continued to takefull advantage of the import concession made by the sitedStates, by exporting its low-level radioactive waste for thefull 7-year extension period provided in the 1985 Act. Bygaining these bene\u00aets and complying with certain of the 1985Act's deadlines, therefore, New York fairly evidenced itsacceptance of the federal-state arrangement\u00d0including thetake title provision. Although unlike the 42 States that compose the nine exist- ing and approved regional compacts, see Brief for UnitedStates 10, n. 19, New York has never formalized its assentto the 1980 and 1985 statutes, our cases support the viewthat New York's actions signify assent to a constitutionalinterstate \u00aaagreement\u00ba for purposes of Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3. InHolmes v.Jennison, 14 Pet. 540 (1840), Chief Justice Taney stated that \u00aa[t]he word `agreement,' does not necessarily im-port any direct and express stipulation; nor is it necessarythat it should be in writing. If there is a verbal understand-ing to which both parties have assented, and upon which both are acting, it is an `agreement.' And the use of all of these terms, `treaty,' `agreement,' `compact,' show that itwas the intention of the framers of the Constitution to usethe broadest and most comprehensive terms; . . . and we shallfail to execute that evident intention, unless we give to theword `agreement' its most extended signi\u00aecation; and soapply it as to prohibit every agreement, written or verbal,formal or informal, positive or implied, by the mutual under-standing of the parties.\u00ba Id.,at 572. (emphasis added). In my view, New York acted in a manner to signify its assentto the 1985 Act's take title provision as part of the elaboratecompromise reached among the States. The State should be estopped from asserting the unconsti- tutionality of a provision that seeks merely to ensure that,after deriving substantial advantages from the 1985 Act,505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 199 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. New York in fact must live up to its bargain by establishing an in-state low-level radioactive waste facility or assumingliability for its failure to act. Cf. West Virginia ex rel. Dyer v.Sims, 341 U. S. 22, 35\u00b136 (1951), Jackson, J., concurring: \u00aaWest Virginia of\u00aecials induced sister States to contract withher and Congress to consent to the Compact. She now at-tempts to read herself out of this interstate Compact . . . .Estoppel is not often to be invoked against a government. But West Virginia assumed a contractual obligation withequals by permission of another government that is sover-eign in the \u00aeeld. After Congress and sister States had been induced to alter their positions and bind themselves toterms of a covenant, West Virginia should be estopped from repudiating her act.\u00ba (Emphasis added.) B Even were New York not to be estopped from challenging the take title provision's constitutionality, I am convincedthat, seen as a term of an agreement entered into betweenthe several States, this measure proves to be less constitu-tionally odious than the Court opines. First, the practicaleffect of New York's position is that because it is unw illing to honor its obligations to provide in-state storage facilitiesfor its low-level radioactive waste, other States with such plants must accept New York's waste, whether they wish to or not. Otherwise, the many economically and sociallybene\u00aecial producers of such waste in the State would haveto cease their operations. The Court's refusal to force NewYork to accept responsibility for its own problem inevitablymeans that some other State's sovereignty will be impingedby it being forced, for public health reasons, to accept NewYork's low-level radioactive waste. I do not understand theprinciple of federalism to impede the National Governmentfrom acting as referee among the States to prohibit one frombullying another.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 200 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. Moreover, it is utterly reasonable that, in crafting a deli- cate compromise between the three overburdened Statesthat provided low-level radioactive waste disposal facilitiesand the rest of the States, Congress would have to ratifysome punitive measure as the ultimate sanction for noncom-pliance. The take title provision, though surely onerous,does not take effect if the generator of the waste does not request such action, or if the State lives up to its bargain ofproviding a waste disposal facility either within the State orin another State pursuant to a regional compact arrange-ment or a separate contract. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(C). Finally, to say, as the Court does, that the incursion on state sovereignty \u00aacannot be rati\u00aeed by the `consent' of stateof\u00aecials,\u00ba ante, at 182, is \u00afatly wrong. In a case involving a congressional rati\u00aecation statute to an interstate compact, the Court upheld a provision that Tennessee and Missourihad waived their immunity from suit. Over their objection,the Court held that \u00aa[t]he States who are parties to thecompact by accepting it and acting under it assume the conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached.\u00ba Petty v.Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275, 281\u00b1282 (1959) (emphasis added). In so holding, the Courtdetermined that a State may be found to have waived a fun-damental aspect of its sovereignty\u00d0the right to be immunefrom suit\u00d0in the formation of an interstate compact evenwhen in subsequent litigation it expressly denied its waiver.I fail to understand the reasoning behind the Court's selec-tive distinctions among the various aspects of sovereigntythat may and may not be waived and do not believe thesedistinctions will survive close analysis in future cases. Hardpublic policy choices sometimes require strong measures, andthe Court's holding, while not irremediable, essentially mis-understands that the 1985 take title provision was part of acomplex interstate agreement about which New York shouldnot now be permitted to complain.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 201 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. III The Court announces that it has no occasion to revisit such decisions as Gregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991); South Carolina v.Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988); Garcia v.San Anto- nio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985); EEOC v.Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); and National League of Cities v.Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976); see ante, at 160, because \u00aathis is not a case in which Congress has sub-jected a State to the same legislation applicable to privateparties.\u00ba Ibid. Although this statement sends the wel- come signal that the Court does not intend to cut a wideswath through our recent Tenth Amendment precedents,it nevertheless is unpersuasive. I have several dif\u00aecultieswith the Court's analysis in this respect: It builds its rulearound an insupportable and illogical distinction in the typesof alleged incursions on state sovereignty; it derives its rulefrom cases that do not support its analysis; it fails to applythe appropriate tests from the cases on which it purports tobase its rule; and it omits any discussion of the most recentand pertinent test for determining the take title provision'sconstitutionality. The Court's distinction between a federal statute's regula- tion of States and private parties for general purposes, asopposed to a regulation solely on the activities of States, isunsupported by our recent Tenth Amendment cases. In nocase has the Court rested its holding on such a distinction.Moreover, the Court makes no effort to explain why this pur-ported distinction should affect the analysis of Congress'power under general principles of federalism and the TenthAmendment. The distinction, facilely thrown out, is notbased on any defensible theory. Certainly one would behard pressed to read the spirited exchanges between theCourt and dissenting Justices in National League of Cities, supra, and in Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, as having been based on the distinction now drawn by the Court. An incursion on state sovereignty505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 202 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. hardly seems more constitutionally acceptable if the federal statute that \u00aacommands\u00ba speci\u00aec action also applies to pri-vate parties. The alleged diminution in state authority overits own affairs is not any less because the federal mandaterestricts the activities of private parties. Even were such a distinction to be logically sound, the Court's \u00aaanticommandeering\u00ba principle cannot persuasivelybe read as springing from the two cases cited for the proposi-tion, Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288 (1981), and FERC v.Missis- sippi, 456 U. S. 742, 761\u00b1762 (1982). The Court purports to draw support for its rule against Congress \u00aacommandeer-[ing]\u00ba state legislative processes from a solitary statementin dictum in Hodel. See ante, at 161: \u00aaAs an initial matter, Congress may not simply `commandee[r] the legislative proc-esses of the States by directly compe lling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program' \u00ba (quoting Hodel, supra, at 288). That statement was not necessary to the decision in Hodel, which involved the question whether the Tenth Amendment interfered with Congress' authority topre-empt a \u00aeeld of activity that could also be subject to stateregulation and not whether a federal statute could dictatecertain actions by States; the language about \u00aacommandeer-[ing]\u00ba States was classic dicta. In holding that a federalstatute regulating the activities of private coal mine opera-tors was constitutional, the Court observed that \u00aa[i]t would. . . be a radical departure from long-established precedentfor this Court to hold that the Tenth Amendment prohibitsCongress from displacing state police power laws regulatingprivate activity.\u00ba 452 U. S., at 292. The Court also claims support for its rule from our deci- sion in FERC, and quotes a passage from that case in which we stated that \u00aa `this Court never has sanctioned explicitlya federal command to the States to promulgate and enforcelaws and regulations.' \u00ba Ante, at at505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 203 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. 761\u00b1762). In so reciting, the Court extracts from the rele- vant passage in a manner that subtly alters the Court'smeaning. In full, the passage reads: \u00aa While this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to theStates to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations, cf.EPA v.Brown, 431 U. S. 99 (1977), there are instances where the Court has upheld federal stat utory struct ures that in effect directed state decisionmakers to take or to refrainfrom taking certain actions. \u00baIbid. (citing Fry v.United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975) (emphasis added)). 2The phrase highlighted by the Court merely means that we have not hadthe occasion to address whether Congress may \u00aacommand\u00bathe States to enact a certain law, and as I have argued inParts I and II of this opinion, these cases do not raise thatissue. Moreover, it should go without saying that the ab- sence of any on-point precedent from this Court has no bear- ing on the question whether Congress has properly exercisedits constitutional authority under Article I. Silence by thisCourt on a subject is not authority for anything. The Court can scarcely rest on a distinction between fed- eral laws of general applicability and those ostensibly di-rected solely at the activities of States, therefore, when thedecisions from which it derives the rule not only made nosuch distinction, but validated federal statutes that con-stricted state sovereignty in ways greater than or similar to 2It is true that under the majority's approach, Fry is distinguishable because it involved a statute generally applicable to both state govern-ments and private parties. The law at issue in that case was the Eco-nomic Stabilization Act of 1970, which imposed wage and salary limitationson private and state workers alike. In Fry, the Court upheld this stat- ute's application to the States over a Tenth Amendment challenge. In myview, Fry perfectly captures the weakness of the majority's distinction, because the law upheld in that case involved a far more pervasive intru-sion on state sovereignty\u00d0the authority of state governments to pay sala-ries and wages to its employees below the federal minimum\u00d0than thetake title provision at issue here.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 204 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. the take title provision at issue in these cases. As Fry, Hodel, andFERC make clear, our precedents prior to Garcia upheld provisions in federal statutes that directed States toundertake certain actions. \u00aa[I]t cannot be constitutionallydeterminative that the federal regulation is likely to move the States to act in a given way,\u00ba we stated in FERC, \u00aaor even to `coerc[e] the States' into assuming a regulatory roleby affecting their `freedom to make decisions in areas of \u00aain-tegral governmental functions.\u00ba ' \u00ba 456 U. S., at 766. I thusam unconvinced that either Hodel orFERC supports the rule announced by the Court. And if those cases do stand for the proposition that in cer- tain circumstances Congress may not dictate that the Statestake speci\u00aec actions, it would seem appropriate to apply thetest stated in FERC for determining those circumstances. The crucial threshold inquiry in that case was whether thesubject matter was pre-emptible by Congress. See 456U. S., at 765. \u00aaIf Congress can require a state administra-tive body to consider proposed regulations as a condition toits continued involvement in a pre-emptible \u00aeeld \u00d0and we hold today that it can\u00d0there is nothing unconstitutionalabout Congress' requiring certain procedural minima goes about undertaking its tasks.\u00ba Id.,at 771 (empha- sis added). The FERC Court went on to explain that if Congress is legislating in a pre-emptible \u00aeeld\u00d0as the Courtconcedes it was doing here, see ante, at 173\u00b1174\u00d0the proper test before our decision in Garcia was to assess whether the alleged intrusions on state sovereignty \u00aado not threaten theStates' `separate and independent existence,' Lane County v.Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869); Coyle v.Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 580 (1911), and do not impair the ability of the States `tofunction effectively in a federal system.' Fry v.United States, 421 U. S., at 547, n. 7; National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.

S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. neither score does the take title provision raise constitutional problems. It certainly does not threaten New York's inde-pendent existence nor impair its ability to function effec-tively in the system, all the more so since the provision wasenacted pursuant to compromises reached among state lead- ers and then rati\u00aeed by Congress. It is clear, therefore, that even under the precedents selec- tively chosen by the Court, its analysis of the take title provi-sion's constitutionality in these cases falls far short of beingpersuasive. I would also submit, in this connection, that theCourt's attempt to carve out a doctrinal distinction for stat-utes that purport solely to regulate state activities is espe-cially unpersuasive after Garcia. It is true that in that case we considered whether a federal statute of general appli-cability\u00d0the Fair Labor Standards Act\u00d0applied to statetransportation entities but our most recent statements haveexplained the appropriate analysis in a more general manner.Just last Term, for instance, Justice O\u0092Connor wrote for the Court that \u00aa[w]e are constrained in our ability to considerthe limits that the state-federal balance places on Congress'powers under the Commerce Clause. See Garcia v.San An- tonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985) (declining to review limitations placed on Congress' Com-merce Clause powers by our federal system).\u00ba Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 464. Indeed, her opinion went on to state that \u00aathis Court in Garcia has left primarily to the political process the protection of the States against in- trusive exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause powers.\u00baIbid. (emphasis added). Rather than seek guidance from FERC and Hodel, there- fore, the more appropriate analysis should \u00afow from Garcia, even if these cases do not involve a congressional law gener-ally applicable to both States and private parties. In Gar- cia, we stated the proper inquiry: \u00aa[W]e are convinced that505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 206 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. the fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme imposes on the Commerce Clause to protect the `States asStates' is one of process rather than one of result. Any sub-stantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause pow-ers must \u00aend its justi\u00aecation in the procedural nature of thisbasic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate forpossible fa ilings in the national political process rather than to dictate a `sacred province of state autonomy.' \u00ba 469 U. S.,at 554 (quoting EEOC v.Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 236). Where it addresses this aspect of respondents' argument, seeante, at 180\u00b1183, the Court tacitly concedes that a fa iling of the political process cannot be shown in these cases becauseit refuses to rebut the unassailable arguments that theStates were well able to look after themselves in the legis-lative process that culminated in the 1985 Act's passage.Indeed, New York acknowledges that its \u00aacongressional dele-gation participated in the drafting and enactment of both the1980 and the 1985 Acts.\u00ba Pet. for Cert. in No. 91\u00b1543, p. 7.The Court rejects this process-based argument by resortingto generalities and platitudes about the purpose of federal-ism being to protect individual rights. Ultimately, I suppose, the entire structure of our federal constitutional government can be traced to an interest in es-tablishing checks and balances to prevent the exercise of tyr-anny against individuals. But these fears seem extremelyfar distant to me in a situation such as this. We face a crisisof national proportions in the disposal of low-level radioac-tive waste, and Congress has acceded to the wishes of theStates by permitting local decisionmaking rather than im-posing a solution from Washington. New York itself partici-pated and supported passage of this legislation at both thegubernatorial and federal representative levels, and then en-acted state laws speci\u00aecally to comply with the deadlines andtimetables agreed upon by the States in the 1985 Act.

S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. me, the Court's civics lecture has a decidedly hollow ring at a time when action, rather than rhetoric, is needed to solvea national problem. 3 3With selective quotations from the era in which the Constitution was adopted, the majority attempts to bolster its holding that the take titleprovision is tantamount to federal \u00aacommandeering\u00ba of the States. Inview of the many Tenth Amendment cases decided over the past two dec-ades in which resort to the kind of historical analysis generated in themajority opinion was not deemed necessary, I do not read the majority'smany invocations of history to be anything other than elaborate windowdressing. Certainly nowhere does the majority announce that its rule iscompelled by an understanding of what the Framers may have thoughtabout statutes of the type at issue here. Moreover, I would observe that,while its quotations add a certain \u00afavor to the opinion, the majority'shistorical analysis has a distinctly wooden quality. One would not knowfrom reading the majority's account, for instance, that the nature offederal-state relations changed fundamen tally after the Civil War. That con\u00afict produced in its wake a tremendous expansion in the scope of theFederal Government's law-making authority, so much so that the personswho helped to found the Republic would scarcely have recognized themany added roles the National Government assumed for itself. Moreover,the majority fails to mention the New Deal era, in which the Court recog-nized the enormous growth in Congress' power under the CommerceClause. See generally F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, The Business of theSupreme Court 56\u00b159 (1927); H. Hyman, A More Perfect Union: The Im-pact of the Civil War and Reconstruction on the Constitution (1973); Cor-win, The Passing of Dual Federalism, 36 Va. L. Rev. 1 (1950); Wiecek, TheReconstruction of Federal Judicial Power, 1863\u00b11875, 13 Am.

J. 453 (1989). While I believe we should not be blind to history, neither should we read it so selectively asto restrict the proper scope of Congress' powers under Article I, especiallywhen the history not mentioned by the majority fully supports a moreexpansive understanding of the legislature's authority than may have ex-isted in the late 18th century. Given the scanty textual support for the majority's position, it would be far more sensible to defer to a coordinate branch of government in itsdecision to devise a solution to a national problem of this kind. Certainlyin other contexts, principles of federalism have not insulated States frommandates by the National Government. The Court has upheld congres-505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 208 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of White, J. IV Though I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the take title provision is unconstitutional, I do not read its opin-ion to preclude Congress from adopting a similar measurethrough its powers under the Spending or CommerceClauses. The Court makes clear that its objection is to thealleged \u00aacommandeer[ing]\u00ba quality of the take title provi-sion. See ante, at 175. As its discussion of the surcharge and rebate incentives reveals, see ante, at 171\u00b1172, the spending power offers a means of enacting a take title provi-sion under the Court's standards. Congress could, in otherwords, condition the payment of funds on the State's w illing- ness to take title if it has not already provided a waste dis-posal facility. Under the scheme upheld in these cases, forexample, moneys collected in the surcharge provision mightbe withheld or disbursed depending on a State's w illing ness to take title to or otherwise accept responsibility for the low-level radioactive waste generated in state after the statutorydeadline for establishing its own waste disposal facility haspassed. See ibid.; South Dakota v.Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 208\u00b1 209 (1987); Massachusetts v.United States, 435 U. S. 444, 461 (1978). Similarly, should a State fail to establish a waste disposal facility by the appointed deadline (under the statute as pres-ently drafted, January 1, 1996, \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(C)), Congresshas the power pursuant to the Commerce Clause to regulatedirectly the producers of the waste. See ante, at 174. Thus, as I read it, Congress could amend the statute to saythat if a State fails to meet the January 1, 1996, deadline for sional statutes that impose clear directives on state of\u00aecials, including those enacted pursuant to the Extradition Clause, see, e. g., Puerto Rico v.Branstad, 483 U. S. 219, 227\u00b1228 (1987), the post-Civil War Amend- ments, see, e. g., South Carolina v.Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 319\u00b1320, 334\u00b1335 (1966), as well as congressional statutes that require state courtsto hear certain actions, see, e. g., Testa v.Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 392\u00b1394 (1947).505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 209 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of White, J. achieving a means of waste disposal, and has not taken title to the waste, no low-level radioactive waste may be shippedout of the State of New York. See, e. g., Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288. As the legislative history of the 1980 and 1985 Actsindicates, faced with the choice of federal pre-emptive regu-lation and self-regulation pursuant to interstate agreementwith congressional consent and rati\u00aecation, the States deci-sively chose the latter. This background suggests that thethreat of federal pre-emption may suf\u00aece to induce States toaccept responsibility for fa iling to meet critical time dead- lines for solving their low-level radioactive waste disposal problems, especially if that federal intervention also wouldstrip state and local authorities of any input in locatingsites for low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Andshould Congress amend the statute to meet the Court's ob-jection and a State refuse to act, the National Legislaturewill have ensured at least a federal solution to the wastemanagement problem. Finally, our precedents leave open the possibility that Con- gress may create federal rights of action in the generatorsof low-level radioactive waste against persons acting undercolor of state law for their failure to meet certain functionsdesignated in federal-state programs. Thus, we have up-held 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 suits to enforce certain rights createdby statutes enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause, see,e. g., Wilder v.Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990); Wright v.Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418 (1987), although Congress must be cautious inspelling out the federal right clearly and distinctly, see, e. g., Suter v.Artist M., 503 U. S. 347 (1992) (not permitting a \u00a7 1983 suit under a Spending Clause statute when the osten-sible federal right created was too vague and amorphous).In addition to compensating injured parties for the State'sfailure to act, the exposure to liability established by suchsuits also potentially serves as an inducement to compliancewith the program mandate.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT 210 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of Stevens, J. V The ultimate irony of the decision today is that in its for- malistically rigid obeisance to \u00aafederalism,\u00ba the Court givesCongress fewer incentives to defer to the wishes of stateof\u00aecials in achieving local solutions to local problems. Thislegislation was a classic example of Congress acting as arbi-ter among the States in their attempts to accept responsibil-ity for managing a problem of grave import. The States urged the National Legislature not to impose from Washing-ton a solution to the country's low-level radioactive wastemanagement problems. Instead, they sought a reasonablelevel of local and regional autonomy consistent with Art. I,\u00a7 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution. By invalidating the measuredesigned to ensure compliance for recalcitrant States, suchas New York, the Court upsets the delicate compromiseachieved among the States and forces Congress to erect sev-eral additional formalistic hurdles to clear before achievingexactly the same objective. Because the Court's justi\u00aeca-tions for undertaking this step are unpersuasive to me, Irespectfully dissent. Justice Stevens , concurring in part and dissenting in part. Under the Articles of Confederation, the Federal Govern- ment had the power to issue commands to the States. SeeArts. VIII, IX. Because that indirect exercise of federalpower proved ineffective, the Framers of the Constitutionempowered the Federal Government to exercise legislativeauthority directly over individuals within the States, eventhough that direct authority constituted a greater intrusionon state sovereignty. Nothing in that history suggests thatthe Federal Government may not also impose its will uponthe several States as it did under the Articles. The Consti-tution enhanced, rather than diminished, the power of theFederal Government.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:09 PAGES OPINPGT 211 Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. The notion that Congress does not have the power to issue \u00aaa simple command to state governments to implement legis-lation enacted by Congress,\u00ba ante, at 176, is incorrect and unsound. There is no such limitation in the Constitution.The Tenth Amendment 1surely does not impose any limit on Congress' exercise of the powers delegated to it by ArticleI. 2Nor does the structure of the constitutional order or the values of federalism mandate such a formal rule. To thecontrary, the Federal Government directs state governmentsin many realms. The Government regulates state-operatedrailroads, state school systems, state prisons, state elections,and a host of other state functions. Similarly, there can beno doubt that, in time of war, Congress could either draftsoldiers itself or command the States to supply their quotasof troops. I see no reason why Congress may not also com-mand the States to enforce federal water and air qualitystandards or federal standards for the disposition of low-levelradioactive wastes. The Constitution gives this Court the power to resolve controversies between the States. Long before Congress 1The Tenth Amendment provides: \u00aaThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, arereserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u00ba 2InUnited States v.Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), we explained: \u00aaThe amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to sug-gest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between thenational and state governments as it had been established by the Constitu-tion before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allayfears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers notgranted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their re-served powers. See e. g., II Elliot's Debates, 123, 131, III id.450, 464, 600; IV id.140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767\u00b1768; Story, Com- mentaries on the Constitution, \u00a7\u00a7 1907\u00b11908. \u00aaFrom the beginning and for many years the amendment has been con- strued as not depriving the national government of authority to resort toall means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate andplainly adapted to the permitted end.\u00ba Id.,at 124; see also ante, at 155\u00b1157.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:09 PAGES OPINPGT 212 NEW YORK v.UNITED STATES Opinion of Stevens, J. enacted pollution-control legislation, this Court crafted a body of \u00aa `interstate common law,' \u00ba Illinois v.City of Mil- waukee, 406 U.

In such contexts, we have not hesitated to direct States to undertake speci\u00aec actions.For example, we have \u00aaimpose[d] on States an af\u00aermativeduty to take reasonable steps to conserve and augment thewater supply of an interstate stream.\u00ba Colorado v.New Mexico, 459 U.

Thus, we unquestionably have the power to command an upstream State that is pollutingthe waters of a downstream State to adopt appropriate regu-lations to implement a federal statutory command. With respect to the problem presented by the cases at hand, if litigation should develop between States that have joineda compact, we would surely have the power to grant relief inthe form of speci\u00aec enforcement of the take title provision. 3 Indeed, even if the statute had never been passed, if oneState's radioactive waste created a nuisance that harmed itsneighbors, it seems clear that we would have had the power 3Even if \u00a7 2021e(d)(2)(C) is \u00aainvalidated\u00ba insofar as it applies to the State of New York, it remains enforceable against the 44 States that have joinedinterstate compacts approved by Congress because the compacting Stateshave, in their agreements, embraced that provision and given it independ-ent effect.

Argued January 22, 1992\u00d0Decided June 19, 1992 During 1973\u00b11978, respondent chewing gum manufacturer, which is based in Chicago, sold its products in Wisconsin through a sales force consist-ing of a regional manager and various \u00aa\u00aeeld\u00ba representatives, all ofwhom engaged in various activities in addition to requesting ordersfrom customers. Wisconsin orders were sent to Chicago for acceptance,and were \u00aelled by shipment through common carrier from outside theState. In 1980, petitioner Wisconsin Department of Revenue concludedthat respondent's in-state business activities during the years in ques-tion had been suf\u00aecient to support imposition of a franchise tax. Re-spondent objected to the assessment of that tax, maintaining that it wasimmune under 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 381(a), which prohibits a State from taxingthe income of a corporation whose only business activities within theState consist of \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba for tangible goods, provided thatthe orders are sent outside the State for approval and the goods aredelivered from out of state. Ultimately, the State Supreme Court dis- allowed the imposition of the tax. Held: Respondent's activities in Wisconsin fell outside the protection of \u00a7 381(a). Pp. 220\u00b1235. (a) In addition to any speech or conduct that explicitly or implicitly proposes a sale, \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba as used in \u00a7 381(a) covers thoseactivities that are entirely ancillary to requests for purchases\u00d0those that serve no independent business function apart from their connectionto the soliciting of orders. The statutory phrase should not be inter-preted narrowly to cover only actual requests for purchases or the ac-tions that are absolutely essential to making those requests, but includesthe entire process associated with inviting an order. Thus, providing acar and a stock of free samples to salesmen is part of the \u00aasolicitation oforders,\u00ba because the only reason to do it is to facilitate requests forpurchases. On the other hand, the statutory phrase should not be in-terpreted broadly to include all activities that are routinely, or evenclosely, associated with solicitation or customarily performed by sales-men. Those activities that the company would have reason to engagein anyway but chooses to allocate to its in-state sales force are not cov-ered. For example, employing salesmen to repair or service the com-pany's products is not part of the \u00aasolicitation of orders,\u00ba since there is505us1100Z 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 215 Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992) Syllabus good reason to get that done whether or not the company has a sales force. Pp. 223\u00b1231. (b) There is a de minimis exception to the activities that forfeit \u00a7 381 immunity. Whether a particular activity is suf\u00aeciently de minimis to avoid loss of \u00a7 381 immunity depends upon whether that activity es-tablishes a nontrivial additional connection with the taxing State.Pp. 231\u00b1232. (c) Respondent's Wisconsin business activities were not limited to those speci\u00aeed in \u00a7 381. Although the regional manager's recruitment,training, and evaluation of employees and intervention in credit dis-putes, as well as the company's use of hotels and homes for sales-relatedmeetings, must be viewed as ancillary to requesting purchases, the salesrepresentatives' practices of replacing retailers' stale gum without cost,of occasionally using \u00aaagency stock checks\u00ba to sell gum to retailers whohad agreed to ins tall new display racks, and of storing gum for these purposes at home or in rented space cannot be so viewed, since thoseactivities constituted independent business functions quite separatefrom the requesting of orders and respondent had a business purposefor engaging in them whether or not it employed a sales force. More-over, the nonimmune activities, when considered together, are not de minimis. While their relative magnitude was not large compared to respondent's other Wisconsin operations, they constituted a nontrivialadditional connection with the State.

Opinion of the Court Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court. Section 101(a) of Public Law 86\u00b1272, 73 Stat. 555, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 381, prohibits a State from taxing the income of acorporation whose only business activities within the Stateconsist of \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba for tangible goods, providedthat the orders are sent outside the State for approval andthe goods are delivered from out of state. The issue in thiscase is whether respondent's activities in Wisconsin fell out-side the protection of this provision. I Respondent W illiam Wrigley, Jr., Co., is the world's largest manufacturer of chewing gum. Based in Chicago, it sellsgum nationwide through a marketing system that dividesthe country into districts, regions, and territories.

The district manager for the midwestern district had his residence and company of\u00aece in Illinois, and visited Wis- consin only six to nine days each year, usually for a salesmeeting or to call on a particularly important account. Theregional manager of the Milwaukee region resided in Wis-consin, but Wrigley did not provide him with a company of-\u00aece. He had general responsibility for sales activities in theregion, and would typically spend 80-to-95% of his timeworking with the sales representatives in the \u00aeeld or con- tacting certain \u00aakey\u00ba accounts. The remainder of his timewas devoted to administrative activities, including writingand reviewing company reports, recruiting new sales repre-sentatives, making recommendations to the district managerconcerning the hiring, \u00aering, and compensation of sales rep-resentatives, and evaluating their performance. He wouldpreside at full-day sales strategy meetings for all regionalsales representatives once or twice a year. The managerfrom 1973 to 1976, John Kroyer, generally held these meet-ings in the \u00aaof\u00aece\u00ba he maintained in the basement of hishome, whereas his successor, Gary Hecht, usually held themat a hotel or motel. (Kroyer claimed income tax deductionsfor this of\u00aece, but Wrigley did not reimburse him for it,though it provided a \u00aeling cabinet.) Mr. Kroyer also inter- vened two or three times a year to help arrange a solutionto credit disputes between the Chicago of\u00aece and importantlocal accounts. Mr. Hecht testi\u00aeed that he never engaged insuch activities, although Wrigley's formal position descrip-tion for regional sales manager continued to list as one ofthe assigned duties \u00aa[r]epresent[ing] the company on creditproblems as necessary.\u00ba The sales or \u00aa\u00aeeld\u00ba representatives in the Milwaukee re- gion, each of whom was assigned his own territory, residedin Wisconsin. They were provided with company cars, butnot with of\u00aeces. They were also furnished a stock of gum505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 218 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court (with an average wholesale value of about $1,000), a supply of display racks, and promotional literature. These materialswere kept at home, except that one salesman, whose apart-ment was too small, rented storage space at about $25 permonth, for which he was reimbursed by Wrigley. On a typical day, the sales representative would load up the company car with a supply of display racks and severalcases of gum, and would visit accounts within his territory.In addition to handing out promotional materials and freesamples, and directly requesting orders of Wrigley products,he would engage in a number of other activities which Wrig- ley asserts were designed to promote sales of its products.He would, for example, provide free display racks to retailers(perhaps several on any given day), and would seek to havethese new racks, as well as pre-existing ones, prominentlylocated. The new racks were usually \u00aelled from the retail-er's existing stock of Wrigley gum, but it would sometimeshappen\u00d0perhaps once a month\u00d0that the retailer had noWrigley products on hand and did not want to wait until theycould be ordered from the wholesaler. In that event, therack would be \u00aelled from the stock of gum in the salesman'scar. This gum, which would have a retail value of $15 to$20, was not provided without charge. The representativewould issue an \u00aaagency stock check\u00ba to the retailer, indicat-ing the quantity supplied; he would send a copy of this tothe Chicago of\u00aece or to the wholesaler, and the retailerwould ultimately be billed (by the wholesaler) in the properamount. When visiting a retail account, Wrigley's sales representa- tive would also check the retailer's stock of gum for fresh-ness, and would replace stale gum at no cost to the retailer.This was a regular part of a representative's duties, and atany given time up to 40% of the stock of gum in his posses-sion would be stale gum that had been removed from retailstores. After accumulating a suf\u00aecient amount of staleproduct, the representative either would ship it back to505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 219 Cite as: 505 U.

Wrigley did not own or lease real property in Wisconsin, did not operate any manufacturing, training, or warehousefacility, and did not have a telephone listing or bank account.All Wisconsin orders were sent to Chicago for acceptance,and were \u00aelled by shipment through common carrier fromoutside the State. Credit and collection activities were sim-ilarly handled by the Chicago of\u00aece. Although Wrigley en-gaged in print, radio, and television advertising in Wisconsin,the purchase and placement of that advertising was managedby an independent advertising agency located in Chicago. Wrigley had never \u00aeled tax returns or paid taxes in Wis- consin; indeed, it was not licensed to do business in thatState. In 1980, petitioner Wisconsin Department of Reve- nue concluded that the company's in-state business activitiesduring the years 1973\u00b11978 had been suf\u00aecient to supportimposition of a franchise tax, and issued a tax assessment ona percentage of the company's apportionable income forthose years. Wrigley objected to the assessment, maintain-ing that its Wisconsin activities were limited to \u00aasolicitationof orders\u00ba within the meaning of 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 381, and thatit was therefore immune from Wisconsin franchise taxes.After an evidentiary hearing, the Wisconsin Tax AppealsCommission unanimously upheld the imposition of the tax.CCH Wis.

TheWisconsin Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion, reversedyet once again, thus \u00aenally disallowing the Wisconsin tax.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 220 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.

II InNorthwestern States Portland Cement Co. v.Minne- sota, 358 U. S. 450, 454 (1959), we considered Minnesota's im- position of a properly apportioned tax on the net income ofan Iowa cement corporation whose \u00aaactivities in Minnesotaconsisted of a regular and systematic course of solicitation oforders for the sale of its products, each order being subjectto acceptance, \u00aelling and del ivery by it from its plant [in Iowa].\u00ba The company's salesmen, operating out of a three-room of\u00aece in Minneapolis rented by their employer, solicitedpurchases by cement dealers and by customers of cementdealers. They also received complaints about goods thathad been lost or damaged in shipment, and forwarded theseback to Iowa for further instructions. Id.,at 454\u00b1455. The cement company's contacts with Minnesota were otherwisevery limited; it had no bank account, real property, or ware-housed merchandise in the State. We nonetheless rejectedCommerce Clause and due process challenges to the tax: \u00aaWe conclude that net income from the interstate opera- tions of a foreign corporation may be subjected to statetaxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and isproperly apportioned to local activities within the taxingState forming suf\u00aecient nexus to support the same.\u00baId.,at 452. The opinion in Northwestern States was handed down in February 1959. Less than a week later, we granted a mo-tion to dismiss (apparently on mootness grounds) the appealof a Louisiana Supreme Court decision that had rejected dueprocess and Commerce Clause challenges to the impositionof state net-income taxes based on local solicitation of ordersthat were sent out of state for approval and shipping.Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.Collector of Revenue, 234505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 221 Cite as: 505 U.

That decision was particularly signi\u00aecant because,unlike the Iowa cement company in Northwestern States, the Kentucky liquor company in Brown-Forman didnot lease (or own) any real estate in the taxing State. Rather, itsactivities were limited to \u00aathe presence of `missionary men' who call upon whole- sale dealers [in Louisiana] and who, on occasion, accom-pany the salesmen of these wholesalers to assist them inobtaining a suitable display of appellant's merchandiseat the business establishments of said retailers . . . .\u00ba234 La., at 653\u00b1654, 101 So. 2d, at 70. Two months later, we denied certiorari in another Louisiana case upholding the imposition of state tax on the income of anout-of-state corporation that neither leased nor owned realproperty in Louisiana and whose only activities in that State\u00aaconsist[ed] of the regular and systematic solicitation of or-ders for its product by \u00aefteen salesmen.\u00ba International Shoe Co. v.Fontenot, 236 La. 279, 280, 107 So. 2d 640 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U. S. 984 (1959). Although our refusals to disturb the Louisiana Supreme Court's decisions in Brown-Forman and International Shoe did not themselves have any legal signi\u00aecance, see Hopf- mann v.Connolly, 471 U. S. 459, 460\u00b1461 (1985); United States v.Carver, 260 U. S. 482, 490 (1923), our actions in those cases raised concerns that the broad language ofNorthwestern States might ultimately be read to suggest that a company whose only contacts with a State consistedof sending \u00aadrummers\u00ba or salesmen into that State could lawfully be subjected to (properly apportioned) income taxa-tion based on the interstate sales those representatives gen-erated.

Opinion of the Court the uncertainty created by these cases were the driving force behind the enactment of \u00a7 381: \u00aa `Persons engaged in interstate commerce are in doubt as to the amount of local activities within a State thatwill be regarded as forming a suf\u00aecient . . . connectio[n]with the State to support the imposition of a tax on netincome from interstate operations and `properly appor-tioned' to the State.' \u00ba Id.,at 280, n. 5 S.

S. C. \u00a7 381(a). Although we have stated that \u00a7 381 was \u00aadesigned to de- \u00aene clearly a lower limit\u00ba for the exercise of state taxingpower, and that \u00aaCongress' primary goal\u00ba was to provide\u00aa[c]larity remove [the] uncertainty\u00ba created byNorthwestern States, \u00a7 381's \u00aaminimum standard\u00ba to be somewhat lessthan entirely clear. The primary sources of confusion, inthis case as in others, have been two questions: (1) what isthe scope of the crucial term \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba; and(2) whether there is a de minimis exception to the activity (beyond \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba) that forfeits \u00a7 381 immunity.We address these issues in turn. A Section 381(a)(1) confers immunity from state income taxes on any company whose \u00aaonly business activities\u00ba inthat State consist of \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba interstatesales. \u00aaSolicitation,\u00ba commonly understood, means \u00aa[a]sk-ing\u00ba for, or \u00aaenticing\u00ba to, something, see Black's Law Dic-tionary 1393 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Dictionary 2169 (1981) (\u00aasolicit\u00ba means \u00aato approachwith a request or plea (as in se lling or begging)\u00ba). We think it evident that in this statute the term includes, not just ex-plicit verbal requests for orders, but also any speech or con-duct that implicitly invites an order. Thus, for example, asalesman who extols the virtues of his company's product tothe retailer of a competitive brand is engaged in \u00aasolicita-tion\u00ba even if he does not come right out and ask the retailerto buy some. The key question in this case is whether, andto what extent, \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba covers activities thatneither explicitly nor implicitly propose a sale.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 224 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court In seeking the answer to that question, we reject the prop- osition put forward by Wisconsin and its amici that we must construe \u00a7 381 narrowly because we said in Heublein that \u00aa `unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not bedeemed to have signi\u00aecantly changed the Federal-State bal-ance,' \u00ba 409 U. S., at 281\u00b1282 (citation omitted). That princi-ple\u00d0which we applied in Heublein to reject a suggested in- ference from \u00a7 381 that States cannot regulate solicitation ina manner that might cause an out-of-state company to forfeitits tax immunity\u00d0has no application in the present case. Be-cause \u00a7 381 unquestionably does limit the power of States to tax companies whose only in-state activity is \u00aathe solicitationof orders,\u00ba our task is simply to ascertain the fair meaningof that term. FMC Corp. v.Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 57 (1990). Wisconsin views some courts as having adopted the posi- tion that an out-of-state company forfeits its \u00a7 381 immunityif it engages in \u00aaany activity other than requesting the cus-tomer to purchase the product.\u00ba Brief for Petitioner 19, n. 8 (citing Hervey v.AMF 250 Ark. 147, 464 S.

Though Clairol is frequently cited for this construction, the opinion in the case does notin fact recite it. In any event, our summary disposition af\u00aermed only thejudgment below, and cannot be taken as adopting the reasoning of the lower court. Anderson v.Celebrezze, 460 U.

The judgment in Clairol would have been the same even under a broader construction of \u00aasolicitation of orders,\u00ba since the company's in-state activi-ties included sending nonsales representatives to provide customers tech-nical assistance in the use of Clairol products. 109 N.

S. 214 (1992) Opinion of the Court which expands the immunity of subsection (a) when the out- of-state seller does its marketing through independent con-tractors, to include not only solicitation of orders for sales,but also actual sales, and in addition \u00aathe maintenance . . . of an of\u00aece ...b yo n eo r more independent contractors whose activities . . . consist solely of making sales, for sales . . . .\u00ba 3The plain implication of this is that without that separate indulgence the maintenance of an of-\u00aece for the exclusive purpose of conducting the exemptedsolicitation and sales would have provided a basis for taxa-tion\u00d0 i. e., that the phrase \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba does not embrace the maintenance of an of\u00aece for the exclusive pur-pose of soliciting orders. Of course the phrase \u00aasolicitationof orders\u00ba ought to be accorded a consistent meaning withinthe section, see Sorenson v.Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986), and if it does not embrace maintaining anof\u00aece for soliciting in subsection (c), it does not do so in sub-section (a) either. One might argue that the necessity ofspecial permission for an of\u00aece establishes that the phrase\u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba covers only the actual requests forpurchases or, at most, the actions absolutely essential tomaking those requests. We think, however, that would be an unreasonable reading of the text. That the statutory phrase uses the term \u00aasolici-tation\u00ba in a more general sense that includes not merely theultimate act of inviting an order but the entire process asso-ciated with the invitation is suggested by the fact that \u00a7 381 3Title 15 U.

C. \u00a7 381(c) reads in its entirety as follows: \u00aaFor purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person shall not be considered to have engaged in business activities within a State duringany taxable year merely by reason of sales in such State, or the solicitationof orders for sales in such State, of tangible personal property on behalfof such person by one or more independent contractors, or by reason ofthe maintenance, of an of\u00aece in such State by one or more independentcontractors whose activities on behalf of such person in such State consistsolely of making sales, or soliciting orders for sales, or [sic] tangible per- sonal property.\u00ba505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 226 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court describes \u00aathe solicitation of orders\u00ba as a subcategory, not of in-state acts, but rather of in-state \u00aa business activities \u00ba\u00d0a term that more naturally connotes courses of conduct. SeeWebster's Third New International Dictionary 22 (1981) (de-\u00aening \u00aaactivity\u00ba as \u00aaan occupation, pursuit, or recreation inwhich a person is active\u00d0often used in pl. <business activi- ties>\u00ba). Moreover, limiting \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba to actual requests for purchases would reduce \u00a7 381(a)(1) to a nullity.(It is obviously impossible to make a request without someaccompanying action, such as placing a phone call or drivinga car to the customer's location.) And limiting it to acts \u00aaessential\u00ba for making requests would engender endless un-certainty, contrary to the whole purpose of the statute. (Isit \u00aaessential\u00ba to use a company car, or to take a taxi, in orderto conduct in-person solicitation? For that matter, is it \u00aaes-sential\u00ba to solicit in person?) It seems to us evident that\u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba embraces request-related activitythat is not even, strictly speaking, essential, or else it wouldnot cover salesmen's driving on the State's roads, spendingthe night in the State's hotels, or displaying within the Statesamples of their product. We hardly think the statute hadin mind only day-trips into the taxing jurisdiction by empty-handed drummers on foot. See United States Tobacco Co. v.Commonwealth, 478 Pa. 125, 140, 386 A. 2d 471, 478 (\u00aaCon- gress could hardly have intended to exempt only walkingsolicitors\u00ba), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 880 (1978). And \u00aenally,this extremely narrow interpretation of \u00aasolicitation\u00ba wouldcause \u00a7 381 to leave virtually unchanged the law that existedbefore its enactment. Both Brown-Forman (where the salesman assisted wholesalers in obtaining suitable displaysfor whiskey at retail stores) and International Shoe (where hotel rooms were used to display shoes) would be decided asthey were before, upholding the taxation. At the other extreme, Wrigley urges that we adopt a broad interpretation of \u00aasolicitation\u00ba which it describes as havingbeen adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court based on that505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 227 Cite as: 505 U.

According toWrigley, this would treat as \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba any ac-tivities that are \u00aaordinary and necessary `business activities'accompanying the solicitation process\u00ba or are \u00aaroutinelyassociated with deploying a sales force to conduct the so-licitation, so long as there is no of\u00aece, plant, warehouse orinventory in the State.\u00ba Brief for Respondent 9, 19\u00b120; seealso J. Hellerstein, State Taxation \u00b6 6.11[2], p. 245 (1983)(\u00aa[S]olicitation ought to be held to embrace other normalincidents of activities of salesmen\u00ba or the \u00aacustomary func-tions of sales representatives of out-of-state merchants\u00ba).We reject this \u00aaroutinely-associated-with-solicitation\u00ba or\u00aacustomarily-performed-by-salesmen\u00ba approach, since it con-verts a standard embracing only a particular activity (\u00aasolici-tation\u00ba) into a standard embracing all activities routinelyconducted by those who engage in that particular activity(\u00aasalesmen\u00ba). If, moreover, the approach were to be applied(as respondent apparently intends) on an industry-by-industry basis, it would render the limitations of \u00a7 381(a)toothless, permitting \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba to be whatevera particular industry wants its salesmen to do. 4 4The dissent explicitly agrees with our rejection of the \u00aaordinary and necessary\u00ba standard advocated by Wrigley.

It is obvious that those activities that a reasonable buyer would consider \u00aapart of thesolicitation itself\u00ba rather than an \u00aaindependent service\u00ba are those that arecustomarily performed in connection with solicitation. Any doubt that this is what the dissent intends is removed by its later elaboration of its505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 228 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court In any case, we do not regard respondent's proposed ap- proach to be an accurate characterization of the WisconsinSupreme Court's opinion. The Wisconsin court construed\u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba to reach only those activities that are\u00aaclosely associated\u00ba with solicitation, industry practice beingonly one factor to be considered in judging the \u00aaclose[ness]\u00baof the connection between the challenged activity and theactual requests for orders. 160 Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d,at 811\u00b1812. The problem with that standard, it seems tous, is that it merely reformulates rather than answers thecrucial question. \u00aaWhat constitutes the `solicitation or-ders'?\u00ba becomes \u00aaWhat is `closely related' to a solicitationrequest?\u00ba This fails to provide the \u00aa[c]larity that would re-move uncertainty\u00ba which we identi\u00aeed as the primary goalof \u00a7 381. Heublein, 409 U. S., at 280. We proceed, therefore, to describe what we think the proper standard to be. Once it is acknowledged, as we haveconcluded it must be, that \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba coversmore than what is strictly essential to making requests for purchases, the next (and perhaps the only other) clear line isthe one between those activities that are entirely ancillary to requests for purchases\u00d0those that serve no independent test in the context of the facts of this case. The dissent repeatedly in- quires whether an activity is a \u00aa normal ac[t] of courtesy from seller to buyer,\u00ba post, at 242 (emphasis added); whether it is a \u00aa common solicita- tion practic[e],\u00ba post, at 244 (emphasis added); and whether Wrigley \u00aaex- ceed[ed] the normal scope of solicitation,\u00ba post, at 242 (emphasis added). Of course, given Wrigley's signi\u00aecant share of the Wisconsin chewing gummarket, most activities it chooses to \u00aaconduc[t] in the course of solicita- tion,\u00ba post, at 246, will be v iewed as a normal part of the solicitation proc- ess itself. Had Wrigley's sales representatives routinely approved orderson the spot; or accepted payments on past-due accounts; or even madeoutright sales of gum, it is dif\u00aecult to see how a reasonable buyer wouldhave thought that was not\u00aapart of the solicitation itself\u00ba\u00d0it certainly has no \u00aaindependent value\u00ba to him. Nothing in the text of the statute sug- gests that it was intended to confer tax immunity on whatever activitiesare engaged in by sales agents in a particular industry.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 229 Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992) Opinion of the Court business function apart from their connection to the solicit- ing of orders\u00d0and those activities that the company wouldhave reason to engage in anyway but chooses to allocate toits in-state sales force. 5Cf.National Tires, Inc. v.Lindley, 68 Ohio App. 2d 71, 78\u00b179, 426 N. E. 2d 793, 798 (1980) (com- pany's activities went beyond solicitation to \u00aafunctions morecommonly related to maintaining an on-going business\u00ba).Providing a car and a stock of free samples to salesmen ispart of the \u00aasolicitation of orders,\u00ba because the only reasonto do it is to facilitate requests for purchases. Contrariwise,employing salesmen to repair or service the company's prod-ucts is not part of the \u00aasolicitation of orders,\u00ba since there isgood reason to get that done whether or not the companyhas a sales force. Repair and servicing may help to increase purchases; but it is not ancillary to requesting purchases, and cannot be converted into \u00aasolicitation\u00ba by merely beingassigned to salesmen. See, e. g., Herff Jones Co. v.State Tax Comm'n, 247 Ore. 404, 412, 430 P. 2d 998, 1001\u00b11002 5The dissent states that ancillarity should be judged, not from the per- spective of the seller, but from the persective of the buyer. Post, at 237 (test is whether \u00aareasonable buyers would consider [the activities] to be a part of the solicitation itself\u00ba) (emphasis added); post, at 243 (\u00aaThe test I propose . . . requires an objective assessment from the vantage point of areasonable buyer \u00ba) (emphasis added); post, at 246 (question is whether the activities \u00aapossess independent value to the customer \u00ba) (emphasis added). As explained earlier, see n. 4, supra, this rule inevitably results in a whatever-the-industry-wants standard, despite the dissent's unequivocaldisavowal of such a test. The dissent also suggests that ancillarity should be judged by asking whether a particular challenged activity is \u00aa related to a particular sales call or to a particular sales solicitation,\u00ba post, at 244 (emphasis added). This standard, besides being amorphous, cannot be correct. Those activi-ties that are most clearly notimmunized by the statute\u00d0 e. g., actual sales, collection of funds\u00d0would seem to be the ones most closely \u00aarelated\u00ba to particular acts of actual solicitation.

OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court (1967) (no \u00a7 381 immunity for sales representatives' collec- tion activities).6 As we have discussed earlier, the text of the statute (the \u00aaof\u00aece\u00ba exception in subsection (c)) requires one exceptionto this principle: Even if engaged in exclusively to facilitaterequests for purchases, the maintenance of an of\u00aece withinthe State, by the company or on its behalf, would go beyondthe \u00aasolicitation of orders.\u00ba We would not make any moregeneralized exception to our immunity standard on the basisof the \u00aaof\u00aece\u00ba provision. It seemingly represents a judg-ment that a company of\u00aece within a State is such a signi\u00ae-cant manifestation of company \u00aapresence\u00ba that, absent a spe-ci\u00aec exemption, income taxation should always be allowed.Jantzen, Inc. v.District of Columbia, 395 A. 2d 29, 32 (D. C. 1978); see generally Hellerstein, State Taxation \u00b6 6.4. Wisconsin urges us to hold that no postsale activities can be included within the scope of covered \u00aasolicitation.\u00ba Wedecline to do so. Activities that take place after a sale willordinarily not be entirely ancillary in the sense we have de-scribed, see, e. g., Miles Laboratories v.Department of Reve- nue, 274 Ore. 395, 400, 546 P. 2d 1081, 1083 (1976) (replacing damaged goods), but we are not prepared to say that willinvariably be true. Moreover, the presale/postsale distinc-tion is hopelessly unworkable. Even if one disregards theconfusion that may exist concerning when a sale takes place,cf. Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 2\u00b1401, 1A U. L.

B The Wisconsin Supreme Court also held that a company does not necessarily forfeit its tax immunity under \u00a7 381 byperforming some in-state business activities that go beyond \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba; rather, it said, \u00aa[c]ourts should alsoanalyze\u00ba whether these additional activities were \u00aa the \u00ba or \u00aa de minimis 160 Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d, at 811 (citation omitted). Wiscon-sin asserts that the plain language of the statute bars thisrecognition of a de minimis exception, because the immunity is limited to situations where \u00aathe only business activities within [the] State\u00ba are those described, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 381 (em-phasis added). This ignores the fact that the venerablemaxim de minimis non curat lex (\u00aathe law cares not for tri\u00afes\u00ba) is part of the established background of legal princi-ples against which all enactments are adopted, and which allenactments (absent contrary indication) are deemed to ac-cept. See, e. g., Republic of Argentina v.Weltover, Inc., 504 U. S. 607, 618 (1992); U. S. Laboratories v.Portland Retail Druggists Assn., Inc., 425 U. S. 1, 18 (1976); Industrial Assn. of San Francisco v. United States, 268 U. S. 64, 84 (1925). It would be especially unreasonable to abandon normal application of the de mini- mis principle in construing \u00a7 381, which operates in such stark, all-or-nothing fashion: A company either has completenet-income tax immunity or it has none at all, even for itssolicitation activities. Wisconsin's reading of the statuterenders a company liable for hundreds of thousands of dollarsin taxes if one of its salesmen sells a 10-cent item in state.Finally, Wisconsin is wrong in asserting that application ofthede minimis principle \u00aaexcise[s] the word `only' from the The word \u00aaonly\u00ba places505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 232 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court a strict limit upon the categories of activities that are cov- ered by \u00a7 381, not upon their substantiality. See, e. g., Drackett Prods. Co. v.Conrad, 370 N. W. 2d 723, 726 (N. D. 1985); Kimberly Clark, 275 Ind., at 383\u00b1384, 416 N. E. 2d, at 1268. Whether a particular activity is a de minimis deviation from a prescribed standard must, of course, be determinedwith reference to the purpose of the standard. Section 381was designed to increase\u00d0beyond what Northwestern States suggested was required by the Constitution\u00d0the connectionthat a company could have with a State before subjectingitself to tax. Accordingly, whether in-state activity otherthan \u00aasolicitation of orders\u00ba is suf\u00aeciently de minimis to avoid loss of the tax immunity conferred by \u00a7 381 dependsupon whether that activity establishes a nontrivial additionalconnection with the taxing State. III Wisconsin asserts that at least six activities performed by Wrigley within its borders went beyond the \u00aasolicitation oforders\u00ba: the replacement of stale gum by sales representa-tives; the supplying of gum through \u00aaagency stock checks\u00ba;the storage of gum, racks, and promotional materials; therental of space for storage; the regional managers' recruit-ment, training, and evaluation of employees; and the regionalmanagers' intervention in credit disputes. 7Since none of 7Wisconsin has also argued that the scope of the regional managers' activities caused their residences to be, \u00aa[in] economic reality,\u00ba Wrigleyof\u00aeces in the State.

See supra, at 230.

S. 214 (1992) Opinion of the Court these activities can reasonably be viewed as requests for or- ders covered by \u00a7 381, Wrigley was subject to tax unless theywere either ancillary to requesting orders or de minimis. We conclude that the replacement of stale gum, the supply- ing of gum through \u00aaagency stock checks,\u00ba and the storageof gum were not ancillary. As to the \u00aerst: Wrigley wouldwish to attend to the replacement of spoiled product whetheror not it employed a sales force. Because that activityserves an independent business function quite separate fromrequesting orders, it does not qualify for \u00a7 381 immunity.Miles Laboratories, 274 Ore., at 400, 546 P. 2d, at 1083. Al- though Wrigley argues that gum replacement was a \u00aapromo-tional necessity\u00ba designed to ensure continued sales, Brieffor Respondent 31, it is not enough that the activity facilitatesales; it must facilitate the requesting of sales, which this did not. 8 The provision of gum through \u00aaagency stock checks\u00ba pre- sents a somewhat more complicated question. It appearsfrom the record that this activity occurred only in connectionwith the furnishing of display racks to retailers, so that itwas arguably ancillary to a form of consumer solicitation. Section 381(a)(2) shields a manufacturer's \u00aamissionary\u00ba re-quest that an indirect customer (such as a consumer) placean order, if a successful request would ultimately result inan order's being \u00aelled by a \u00a7 381 \u00aa customer \u00ba of the manufac- must be more formally attributed to the out-of-state company itself, or to the agents of that company in their agency capacity\u00d0as was, for example,the rented of\u00aece in Northwestern States. 8The dissent argues that this activity must be considered part of \u00aasolici- tation\u00ba because, inter alia, it was \u00aaminimal,\u00ba and not \u00aasigni\u00aecant.\u00ba Post, at 243. We disagree. It was not, as the dissent suggests, a practice thatinvolved simple \u00aaacts of courtesy\u00ba that occurred only because a salesmanhappened to be on the scene and did not wish to \u00aaharm the company.\u00baPost, at 242, 244. Wrigley deliberately chose to use its sales force to en- gage in regular and systematic replacement of stale product on a levelthat amounted to several thousand dollars per year, which is a lot of chew-ing gum.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 234 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Opinion of the Court turer, i. e., by the wholesaler who \u00aells the orders of the re- tailer with goods shipped to the wholesaler from out of state.Cf.Gillette, 56 App. Div. 2d, at 482, 393 N. Y . S. 2d, at 191 (\u00aaAdvice to retailers on the art of displaying goods to thepublic can hardly be more thoroughly solicitation . . .\u00ba). Itmight seem, therefore, that setting up general advertising in Wisconsin, wouldbe immunized by \u00a7 381(a)(2). What destroys this analysis,however, is the fact that Wrigley made the retailers pay for the gum, thereby providing a business purpose for supplying the gum quite independent from the purpose of solicitingconsumers. Since providing the gum was not entirely ancil-lary to requesting purchases, it was not within the scope of\u00aasolicitation of orders.\u00ba 9And because the vast majority of the gum stored by Wrigley in Wisconsin was used in connec-tion with stale gum swaps and agency stock checks, thatstorage (and the indirect rental of space for that storage)was in no sense ancillary to \u00aasolicitation.\u00ba By contrast, Wrigley's in-state recruitment, training, and evaluation of sales representatives and its use of hotels andhomes for sales-related meetings served no purpose apartfrom their role in facilitating solicitation. The same mustbe said of the instances in which Wrigley's regional salesmanager contacted the Chicago of\u00aece about \u00aarather nasty\u00bacredit disputes involving important accounts in order to \u00aagetthe account and [Wrigley's] credit department communicat- 9The dissent speculates, without any basis in the record, that Wrigley might have chosen to charge for the gum, not for the pro\u00aet, but becausegiving it away would \u00aalower the per unit cost of all goods purchased,\u00bawhich \u00aacould create either the fact or the perception that retailers werenot receiving the same price.\u00ba Post, at 245. Though Wrigley's motive for choosing to make a pro\u00aet on these items seems to us irrelevant in anyevent, we cannot avoid observing how unlikely it is that this was the rea-son Wrigley did not include free gum in its (per-unit-cost-distorting) freeracks, although it did, as the record shows, regularly give away other (presumably per-unit-cost-distorting) free gum. Wrigley itself did nothave the temerity to make this argument.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 235 Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992) Opinion of the Court ing.\u00ba App. 71, 72. It hardly appears likely that this medi- ating function between the customer and the central of\u00aecewould have been performed by some other employee\u00d0somecompany ombudsman, so to speak\u00d0if the on-location salesstaff did not exist. The purpose of the activity, in otherwords, was to ingratiate the salesman with the customer,thereby facilitating requests for purchases. Finally, Wrigley argues that the various nonimmune ac- tivities, considered singly or together, are de minimis. In particular, Wrigley emphasizes that the gum sales through\u00aaagency stock checks\u00ba accounted for only 0.00007% of Wrig-ley's annual Wisconsin sales, and in absolute terms amountedto only several hundred dollars a year. We need not decidewhether any of the nonimmune activities was de minimis in isolation; taken together, they clearly are not. Wrigley'ssales representatives exchanged stale gum, as a matter ofregular company policy, on a continuing basis, and Wrigleymaintained a stock of gum worth several thousand dollars inthe State for this purpose, as well as for the less frequentlypursued (but equally unprotected) purpose of se lling gum through \u00aaagency stock checks.\u00ba Although the relative mag-nitude of these activities was not large compared to Wrig-ley's other operations in Wisconsin, we have little dif\u00aecultyconcluding that they constituted a nontrivial additional con-nection with the State. Because Wrigley's business activi-ties within Wisconsin were not limited to those speci\u00aeed in\u00a7 381, the prohibition on net-income taxation contained inthat provision was inapplicable. *** Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wis- consin is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.505us1100J 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 236 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.

I do not agree, however, that the replacement of stale gum servedan independent business function. The replacement of stalegum by the sales representatives was part of ensuring theproduct was available to the public in a form that may bepurchased. Making sure that one's product is available andproperly displayed serves no independent business functionapart from requesting purchases; one cannot offer a productfor sale if it is not available. I agree, however, that the stor-age of gum in the State and the use of agency stock checkswere not ancillary to solicitation and were not de minimis. On that basis, I would hold that Wrigley's income is subjectto taxation by Wisconsin. Justice Kennedy , with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

I submit with all respect, though, that the Court does not allow its own analysis to take the propercourse. The Court instead devises a test that excludes busi-ness activities with a close relation to the solicitation of or-ders, activities that advance the purpose of the statute andits immunity.

Having done so, however, the Court exits apromising avenue of analysis and adopts a test with littlerelation to the practicalities of solicitation. The Court's rulewill yield results most dif\u00aecult to justify or explain. Mysubmission is that the two polarities suggest the proper anal- ysis and that the contro lling st andard lies between. It is dif\u00aecult to formulate a complete test in one case, but thegeneral rule ought to be that the statute exempts businessactivities performed in connection with solicitation if reason-able buyers would consider them to be a part of the solicita-tion itself and not a signi\u00aecant and independent service orcomponent of value. I begin with the statute. Section 381(a) provides as follows: \u00aaNo State, or political subdivision thereof, shall have power to impose, for any taxable year ending after Sep-tember 14, 1959, a net income tax on the income derivedwithin such State by any person from interstate com-merce if the only business activities within such Stateby or on behalf of such person during such taxable yearare either, or both, of the following: \u00aa(1) the solicitation of orders by such person, or his representative, in such State for sales of tangible per-sonal property, which orders are sent outside the Statefor approval or rejection, and, if approved, are \u00aelled byshipment or delivery from a point outside the State; and \u00aa(2) the solicitation of orders by such person, or his representative, in such State in the name of or for thebene\u00aet of a prospective customer of such person, if or-ders by such customer to such person to enable suchcustomer to \u00aell orders resulting from such solicitationare orders described in paragraph (1).\u00ba 15 U.

Thedecision to use the phrase \u00aabusiness activities,\u00ba while notunambiguous, suggests that the statute must be read toaccord with the practical realities of interstate sales solici-tations, which, after all, Congress acted to protect. The textual implication I \u00aend draws support from legal and historical context. Even those who approach legislativehistory with much trepidation must acknowledge that thestatute was a response to three speci\u00aec court decisions:Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v.Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959), International Shoe Co. v.Fontenot, 236 La. 279, 107 So. 2d 640 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.

These decisions departed from what had beenperceived as a well-settled rule, stated in Norton Co. v.De- partment of Revenue of Ill., 340 U. S. 534 (1951), that solici- tation in interstate commerce was protected from taxationin the State where the solicitation took place. \u00aaWhere a corporation chooses to stay at home in all respects except to send abroad advertising or drummersto solicit orders which are sent directly to the home of-\u00aece for acceptance, \u00aelling, and del ivery back to the buyer, it is obvious that the State of the buyer has nolocal grip on the seller.

S. 214 (1992) Kennedy, J., dissenting curs suf\u00aecient to bring the transaction within its taxing power, the vendor is not taxable.\u00ba Id.,at 537. Firm expectations within the business community were built upon the rule as restated in Norton. Companies engaging in interstate commerce conformed their activities to the lim-its our cases seemed to have endorsed. To be sure, the deci-sion to stay at home might have derived in some respectsfrom independent business concerns. The expense and com-mitment of an in-state sales of\u00aece, for example, might haveinformed a decision to send salesmen into a State withoutfurther staff support. Some interstate operations, though,carried the unmistakable mark of a legal, rather than busi-ness, justi\u00aecation. The technical requirement that ordersbe approved at the home of\u00aece, unless approval requiredjudgment or expertise (for example, if the order dependedon an ancillary decision to give credit or to name an of\u00aecialretailer), was no doubt the product of the legal rule. These settled expectations were upset in 1959, their continuing vitality put in doubt by Northwestern States, International Shoe, and Brown-Forman. InNorthwestern States, the Court upheld state income taxation against two companies whose in-state operations included a sales staffand sales of\u00aece. 358 U. S., at 454\u00b1455. Our disposition wasconsistent with prior law, since both companies maintainedof\u00aeces within the taxing State. Ibid. But the Court's opin- ion was broader than the holding itself and marked a depar-ture from prior law. \u00aaWe conclude that net income from the interstate opera- tions of a foreign corporation may be subjected to statetaxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and isproperly apportioned to local activities within the taxingState forming suf\u00aecient nexus to support the same.\u00baId.,at 452.

Its only activity within the State of Louisiana con-sisted of regular and systematic solicitation by 15 sales-people. No of\u00aece or warehouse was maintained insideLouisiana, and orders were accepted and shipped from out-side the State. The salespeople carried product samples,drove in company-owned automobiles, and rented hotelrooms or rooms of public buildings in order to make displays.International Shoe, 236 La., at 280, 107 So. 2d, at 640; Hart- man, \u00aaSolicitation\u00ba and \u00aaDelivery\u00ba Under Public Law 86\u00b1272:An Uncharted Course, 29 Vand.

There was no in-state of\u00aece of any kind.Brown-Forman salespeople performed two functions: theysolicited orders from wholesalers, who were direct customersof Brown-Forman; and they accompanied the wholesalers'own sales force on visits to retailers, who were solicited bythe wholesalers.

The business activities of Wrigley within Wisconsin have substantial parallels to those considered in International Shoe and Brown-Forman. Wrigley has no manufacturing facility in the State. It maintains no of\u00aeces or warehouses there. The only product it owns in the State is the smallamount necessary for its salespeople to call upon their ac-counts. All orders solicited by its salespeople are approvedor rejected outside of the State. All orders are shippedfrom outside of the State. Other activities, such as inter-vening in credit disputes, hiring salespeople, or holding salesmeetings in hotel rooms, do not exceed the scope of \u00a7 381(a);I agree with the Court that these too are the business activi-ties of solicitation. Ante, at 234\u00b1235; App. 10\u00b113. The Department of Revenue, in an apparent concession of the point, does not contend that the business activities ofWrigley exceed the normal scope of solicitation; instead theDepartment relies on a distinction between business activi-ties undertaken before and after the sale. Brief for Peti-tioner 18, 21. Under the Department's submission, actsleading to the sale are within the statutory safe harbor,while any act following the sale is beyond it. Ibid. I agree with the Court, as well as with the Supreme Court of Wis-consin, that this distinction is unworkable in the context ofa continuing business relation with many repeat sales.Ante, at 230\u00b1231; App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u00b141. As the Court indicates, the case really turns upon our as- sessment of two practices: replacing stale product and pro-viding gum in display racks. Ante, at 233. If the retailers relied on the Wrigley sales force to replace all stale product505us1100L 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 243 Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992) Kennedy, J., dissenting and that service was itself signi\u00aecant, say on the magnitude of routine deliveries of fresh bread, then a separate servicewould seem to be involved. But my understanding of therecord is that replacement of stale gum took place only dur-ing the course of regular solicitation. App. 27\u00b128, 41, 58,117\u00b1118. There was no contract to perform this service.There is no indication in the record that this was the onlymethod dealers relied upon to remove stale product. It isnot plausible to believe that by enacting \u00a7 381(a) Congressinsisted that every sales representative in every industrywould be prohibited from doing just what Wrigley did. Acceptance of the stale gum replacement does not allow industry practices to replace objective statutory inquiry.The existence of a contract to perform this service, or anindication in the record that this service provided an inde-pendent component of signi\u00aecant value, would alter thecase's disposition, regardless of the seller's intentions. Thetest I propose does not depend on the sellers' intentions ormotives whatsoever; rather it requires an objective assess-ment from the vantage point of a reasonable buyer. If areasonable buyer would consider the replacement of stalegum to provide signi\u00aecant independent value, then this serv-ice would subject Wrigley to taxation. The majority ap-pears to concede the point in part when it observes Wrigleyreplaced stale gum free of charge, ante, at 234, n. 9, which provides a strong indication that the replacement of stalegum is valuable to Wrigley, not its customers, as an assur-ance of quality given in the course of an ongoing solicitation. I agree with the Court's approach, which is to provide guidance by some general rule that is faithful to the preciselanguage of the statute. But it ought not to do so withoutrecognition of some of the most essential aspects of solicita-tion techniques. No responsible company would expect itssales force to decline giving minimal assistance to a retailerin replacing damaged or stale product. In enacting \u00a7 381(a),Congress recognized the importance of interstate solicitation505us1100L 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 244 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v. WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO. Kennedy, J., dissenting to the strength of our national economy. The statute must not to be interpreted to repeal the rules of good sales tech-niques or to forbid common solicitation practices under thethreat of forfeiting this important tax exemption. Congressacted to protect interstate solicitation, not to mandateinef\u00aeciency. Even accepting the majority's test on its own terms, the business activities which the Court \u00aends to be within thesafe harbor of the federal statute are less ancillary to a realsales solicitation than are the activities it condemns. Thecredit adjustment techniques and the training sessions the Court approves are not related to a particular sales call orto a particular sales solicitation, but the condemned displayand replacement practices are. I do not understand why theCourt thinks that a credit dispute over an old transaction,handled by telephone weeks or months later is exempt be-cause it \u00aaingratiate[s] the salesman with the customer,thereby facilitating requests for purchases,\u00ba ante, at 235, but that this same process of ingratiation does not occur when asalesperson who is on the spot to solicit an order refuses toharm the company by leaving the customer with bad producton the shelf. If there were any distinction between the two,I should think we would approve the replacement and con-demn the credit adjustment. The majority fails to addressthis anomaly under its test, responding instead that my ob-servation of it suggests ambiguity in my own. Ante, at 229, n. 5. In my view, both the gum replacement and credit ad-justment are within the scope of solicitation. I would agree with the Court that the furnishing of racks with gum that is sold to the customer presents a problemof a different order, ante, at 233, but here too I think it adds no independent value apart from the solicitation itself. Tobegin with, I think it rather well accepted that the settingup of display racks and the giving of advice on sales presen-tation is central to the salesperson's role in cultivating cus-tomers. There are dangers for the manufacturer, however,505us1100L 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 245 Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992) Kennedy, J., dissenting if the salesperson spends the time to set up a display and then stocks it with free goods, because this could createeither the fact or the perception that retailers were not re-ceiving the same price. Free goods lower the per unit costof all goods purchased. The simplest policy to avoid thisproblem is to charge for the goods displayed, and that is whatoccurred here. Moreover, I cannot ignore, as the Court ap-pears to do, that a minuscule amount of gum, no more than0.00007% (seven one-hundred thousands of one percent) ofWrigley's in-state sales, was stocked into display racks inthis fashion. Brief for Respondent 5; App. to Pet. for Cert.A\u00b143. Indeed, the testimony is that Wrigley salespeoplewould stock these display racks out of their own supply ofsamples only as a matter of last resort, in instances wherethe retailer possessed an inadequate supply of gum and couldnot await delivery in the normal course. \u00aaQ Well, I take it that if you put in the stand and it was a new stand, you took the gum out of your vehicleand transferred it to him there; is that correct? \u00aaA No, I would not say that's correct.\u00aaQ Well, did you ever stock new stands from your vehicle? \u00aaA I would say possibly on some\u00d0on a few occasions.\u00aaQ And how many few occasions were there during your tenure as a \u00aeeld representative in 1978? \u00aaA Boy.

Maybe a dozen times. \u00aaQ And just what would\u00d0what all happened in that circumstance that you wound up putting in a new standand taking the gum out of your vehicle and transferringit to the retailer? \u00aaA Well, like I said, primarily I wanted to get a stand in and then he wanted to get that order through hiswholesaler; but if he couldn't wait, if he said my whole-saler was just in yesterday or something or he wasnot going to be in for a week, he didn't want a stand505us1100L 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT 246 WISCONSIN DEPT.

Under the circumstances described here, I fail to see why the stocking of a gum display does not \u00aaingratiate the sales-man with the customer, thereby facilitating requests for pur-chases,\u00ba ante, at 235, as is required under the rule formu- lated by the Court. The small amount of gum involved instocking a display rack, no more than $15\u00b1$20 worth, beliesany speculation, ante, at 234, n. 9, that Wrigley was driven by a pro\u00aet motive in charging customers for this gum.App. 38. The Court pursues a laudable effort to state a workable rule, but in the attempt condemns business activities thatare bound to solicitation and do not possess independentvalue to the customer apart from what often accompanies asuccessful solicitation. The business activities of Wrigley inWisconsin, just as those considered in International Shoe and Brown-Forman, are the solicitation of orders. The swapping of stale gum and the infrequent stocking of freshgum into new displays are not services that Wrigley wasunder contract to perform; they are not activities that canbe said to have provided their own component of signi\u00aecantvalue; rather they are activities conducted in the course ofsolicitation and whose legal effect should be the same. Myexamination of the language of the statute, considered in thecontext of its enactment, demonstrates that the concerns towhich \u00a7 381(a) was directed, and for which its language wasdrafted, are misapprehended by the Court's decision today.

(b) Respondents' several arguments against this conclusion\u00d0that the well-pleaded complaint rule bars the removal; that language in congres-sional charters enacted closely in time to the 1947 amendment of theRed Cross Charter incorporating the provision in dispute show a coher-ent drafting pattern that casts doubt on congressional intent to conferfederal jurisdiction over Red Cross cases; and that the 1947 amendmentwas meant not to confer jurisdiction, but to clarify the Red Cross' capac-ity to sue in federal courts where an independent jurisdictional basisexists\u00d0are all unavailing.

After discovering that theRed Cross had supplied the tainted blood, respondents suedit, too, again in state court, and moved to consolidate the twoactions. Before the state court decided that motion, theRed Cross invoked the federal removal statute, 28 U. S.

The Red Crossclaimed federal jurisdiction based both on the diversity of the parties and on the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision of itscharter, which it argued conferred original federal jurisdic-tion over suits involving the organization. The DistrictCourt rejected respondents' motion to remand the case tostate court, holding that the charter provision conferredoriginal federal jurisdiction.

S. 976 (1991), to answer this dif\u00aecult and recurring question. 1 II Since its founding in 1881 as part of an international effort to ameliorate soldiers' wartime suffering, the American RedCross has expanded its activities to include, among others,the civilian blood-supply services here at issue. The organi-zation was reincorporated in 1893, and in 1900 received its\u00aerst federal charter, which was revised in 1905. See Ameri-can National Red Cross, Report of the Advisory Committeeon Organization 4 (1946) (hereinafter Advisory Report), re-printed at App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 90\u00b11873 (CA1),pp. 94, 101. 1Although more than 40 District Court cases have considered this issue, no result clearly predominates. Compare Pet. for Cert. 10, n. 4 (listingcases \u00aending jurisdictional grant in Red Cross Charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00baprovision), with id.,at 11, n. 5 (listing cases reaching opposite conclusion). Re\u00afecting this confusion, the only other Court of Appeals to consider thisissue decided differently from the First Circuit.

At that time the provision would not have had thejurisdictional signi\u00aecance of its modern counterpart, sincethe law of the day held the involvement of a federally char-tered corporation suf\u00aecient to render any case one \u00aaarisingunder\u00ba federal law for purposes of general statutory federal-question jurisdiction. See Paci\u00aec Railroad Removal Cases, 115 U. S. 1, 14 (1885). In 1925, however, Congress restrictedthe reach of this jurisdictional theory to federally charteredcorporations in which the United States owned more thanone-half of the capital stock.

Supp. 1018, 1020\u00b11022 (ED Mo. 1987) (noting split in authority over whether \u00a7 1349 applies to nonstockcorporations), 3its enactment invested the charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause with a potential jurisdiction signi\u00aecance pre-viously unknown to it. Its text, nevertheless, was left undisturbed for more than 20 years further, until its current form, authorizing the RedCross \u00aato sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, Stateor Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States,\u00batook shape with the addition of the term \u00aaState or Federal\u00bato the 1905 language, as part of an overall revision of theorganization's charter and bylaws. See Act of May 8, 1947, 2Congress had previously overruled much of Paci\u00aec Railroad Removal Cases, 115 U.

RED CROSS v.S. G. Opinion of the Court Pub. L. 80\u00b147, \u00a7 3, 61 Stat. 80, 81. It is this language upon which the Red Cross relies, and which the Court of Appealsheld to have conferred no federal jurisdiction. III A As indicated earlier, we do not face a clean slate. Begin- ning with Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in 1809, we havehad several occasions to consider whether the \u00aasue and besued\u00ba provision of a particular federal corporate charter con-ferred original federal jurisdiction over cases to which thatcorporation was a party, and our readings of those provisionsnot only represented our best efforts at divining congres-sional intent retrospectively, but have also placed Congresson prospective notice of the language necessary and suf\u00ae-cient to confer jurisdiction. See, e. g., United States v.Mer- riam, 263 U. S. 179, 186 (1923) (Congress presumed to intend judicially settled meaning of terms); Cannon v.University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696\u00b1698 (1979) (presuming congres- sional knowledge of interpretation of similarly worded ear-lier statute). Those cases therefore require visitation withcare. InDeveaux, we considered whether original federal juris- diction over suits by or against the \u00aerst Bank of the UnitedStates was conferred by its charter. The language in pointauthorized the Bank \u00aa `to sue and be sued, plead and be im-pleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended,in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever,' \u00ba 5Cranch, at 85. In the opinion written by Chief Justice Mar-shall, the Court held this language to confer no federal juris-diction, reading it as a mere grant to the bank of the normalcorporate capacity to sue, id., at 85\u00b186. The Court con- trasted the charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision with oneauthorizing the institution of certain suits against the bank'sof\u00aecers \u00aain any court of record of the United States, or of505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 253 Cite as: 505 U.

The Chief Justice concluded that this latter provision \u00aaevince[d] the opinion of congress,that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in thecourts of the union, unless it be expressed,\u00ba ibid. The same issue came to us again 15 years later in Osborn. By this time Congress had established the second Bank ofthe United States, by a charter that authorized it \u00aato sueand be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be an-swered, defend and be defended, in all state courts havingcompetent jurisdiction, and in any circuit court of the UnitedStates.\u00ba Act of Apr. 10, 1816, ch. 44, \u00a7 7, 3 Stat. 266, 269.In its interpretation of this language, the Court, again speak-ing through Chief Justice Marshall, relied heavily on itsDeveaux analysis, and especially on the contrast developed there between the \u00aerst bank charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00baprovision and its provision authorizing suits against bank of-\u00aecers. See Osborn, 9 Wheat., at 818. Holding that the lan- guage of the second bank's charter \u00aacould not be plainer byexplanation,\u00ba ibid., in conferring federal jurisdiction, the Os- born Court distinguished Deveaux as holding that \u00aaa general capacity in the Bank to sue, without mentioning the courtsof the Union, may not give a right to sue in those courts,\u00ba 9Wheat., at 818. With the basic rule thus established, our next occasion to consider the issue did not arise until Bankers Trust, nearly a century later. The federal charter considered in that caseauthorized a railroad corporation \u00aato sue and be sued, pleadand be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts oflaw and equity within the United States.\u00ba Act of Mar. 3,1871, ch. 122, \u00a7 1, 16 Stat. 573, 574. Testing this languageagainst that construed in Deveaux and Osborn, we concluded that it \u00aad[id] not literally follow\u00ba its analogues considered ineither of the earlier cases, 241 U. S., at 304, but held, never-505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 254 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Opinion of the Court theless, that it had \u00aathe same generality and natural import\u00ba as the clause contained in the \u00aerst Bank charter. Thus, wefollowed Deveaux and found in the failure to authorize fed- eral court litigation expressly no grant of federal jurisdic-tion. 241 U. S., at 304\u00b1305. Last came D'Oench, Duhme, where we held that the FDIC's charter granted original federal jurisdiction. Thatjurisdiction was not, we explained, \u00aabased on diversity ofcitizenship. Respondent, a federal corporation, brings thissuit under an Act of Congress authorizing it to sue or besued `in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.' \u00ba 315U. S., at 455\u00b1456 (citation and footnote omitted). It is per-fectly true, as respondents stressed in argument, that in anaccompanying footnote we quoted without comment anotherpart of the same statute, providing that \u00aa `[a]ll suits of a civilnature at common law or in equity to which the Corporationshall be a party shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States: Provided, That any such suit to which the Corporation is a party in its capacity as receiver of a Statebank and which involves only the rights or obligations of de-positors, creditors, stockholders and such State bank underState law shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of theUnited States.' \u00ba Id., at 455\u00b1456, n. 2. 4The footnote did not, however, raise any doubt that the Court held federaljurisdiction to rest on the terms of the \u00aasue and be sued\u00baclause. Quite the contrary, the footnote's treatment natu-rally expressed the subordinate importance of the provisionit quoted. While as a state bank's receiver the FDIC mightlose the bene\u00aet of the deemer clause as a grant of federal 4The \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba language was originally enacted in the statute creating the FDIC, see Banking Act of 1933, ch. 89, \u00a7 8, 48 Stat. 162, 172,and was reenacted in the 1935 amendments to that statute, see BankingAct of 1935, ch. 614, \u00a7 101, 49 Stat. 684, 692. The 1935 amendments alsoenacted for the \u00aerst time the deemer provision we quoted in footnote 2 ofour opinion in D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v.FDIC, 315 U. S. 447, 455 (1942).

S. 247 (1992) Opinion of the Court jurisdiction, the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause would settle the jurisdictional question conclusively, in any case.5 B These cases support the rule that a congressional charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision may be read to confer federalcourt jurisdiction if, but only if, it speci\u00aecally mentions the fed-eral courts. In Deveaux, the Court found a \u00aaconclusive argu- ment\u00ba against \u00aending a jurisdictional grant in the \u00aasue and besued\u00ba clause in the fact that another provision of the same doc-ument authorized suits by and against bank of\u00aecers \u00aain anycourt of record of the United States, or of [sic] either of them . . . .\u00ba See 5 Cranch, at 86. In contrasting these twoprovisions the Deveaux Court plainly intended to indicate the degree of speci\u00aecity required for a jurisdictional grant. 6 That is certainly how the Osborn Court understood Deveaux, as it described the latter provision as an \u00aaexpress grant ofjurisdiction,\u00ba 9 Wheat., at 818, in contrast to the \u00aerst Bankcharter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision, which, that the parties in D'Oench, Duhme did not litigate the jurisdictional issue. See Brief for Respondents 18\u00b122. But the par-ties' failure to challenge jurisdiction is irrelevant to the force of our hold-ing on that issue. See, e. g., FW/PBS, Inc. v.Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990) (federal courts have independent obligation to examine their ownjurisdiction); see also Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 100 (1807) (Marshall, C. J.) (giving controlling weight to previous jurisdictional holding by Courteven though parties to previous case had not raised jurisdictional issue). 6The dissent reads Deveaux as distinguishing between these two provi- sions not on this basis, but rather on the ground that the provision author-izing suits against bank of\u00aecers allowed the bringing of a particular causeof action. See post, at 270. That reading might be possible if Chief Jus- tice Marshall had not nipped it in the bud. He did not explain the differ-ence between the jurisdictional signi\u00aecance of the two clauses in questionby saying that jurisdiction may be granted only in provisions referring tocourts in which causes of action could be brought. He explained it simplyby inferring, from the drafting contrasts, \u00aathe opinion of congress that theright to sue does not imply the right to sue in the courts of the unionunless it be expressed. \u00baDeveaux, 5 Cranch, at 86 (emphasis added).505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 256 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Opinion of the Court tioning the courts of the Union,\u00ba ibid., was held merely to give the Bank \u00aaa general capacity . . . to those courts,\u00ba ibid. 7The Osborn Court thus found a jurisdictional grant suf\u00aeciently stated in the second Bankcharter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision, with its express fed-eral reference, remarking that \u00aa[t]o infer from [Deveaux] that words expressly conferring a right to sue in those courts do not give the right, is surely a conclusion which the prem-ises do not warrant.\u00ba Ibid. 8 Applying the rule thus established, in Bankers Trust we described the railroad charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision,with its want of any reference to federal courts, and, holdingit up against its analogues in Deveaux and Osborn, we found 7The dissent accuses us of repeating what it announces as Chief Justice Marshall's misunderstanding, in Osborn, of his own previous opinion in Deveaux. See post, at 271. We are honored. 8Contrary to respondents' argument, our cases do not support a require- ment that federal jurisdiction under a \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause requiresmention of the speci\u00aec federal court on which it is conferred. D'Oench, Duhme, of course, bars any such reading. Nor would Osborn v.Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), require such a speci\u00aecation even if D'Oench, Duhme were not on the books. When the second Bank was chartered, two sets of federal courts, the Circuit Courts and the DistrictCourts, shared overlapping original federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., E. Surrency, History of the Federal Courts 61 (1987). If (as apparently wasthe case) the framers of the second Bank's charter wished to provide thatall suits in federal court involving the Bank be brought in one set of courts,it would have been necessary for any jurisdictional grant to specify whichset of federal trial courts was being invested with jurisdiction. This needno longer exists, and the means chosen by the drafters of the early char-ters to resolve that problem should not be thought signi\u00aecant in resolvingthe very different issue before us today. Moreover, the larger part of theCourt's analysis in Osborn speaks only of the charter's mention of federal courts, not its speci\u00aecation of the Circuit Courts in particular. See 9Wheat., at 817\u00b1818. The charter's speci\u00aecation of those courts wouldhave made it natural for the Osborn Court to indicate its reliance on that narrower ground, had it believed such speci\u00aecity to be required. The factthat it did not so indicate is strong evidence that the Court thought itunnecessary.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 257 Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992) Opinion of the Court it closer to the former.9Finally, in D'Oench, Duhme we based our \u00aending of jurisdiction on the \u00aasue and be sued\u00baprovision of the FDIC charter, which mentioned the federalcourts in general, but not a particular federal court. The rule established in these cases makes it clear that the Red Cross Charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision should beread to confer jurisdiction. In expressly authorizing the or-ganization to sue and be sued in federal courts, using lan-guage resulting in a \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision in all rele-vant respects identical to one on which we based a holdingof federal jurisdiction just \u00aeve years before, the provisionextends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacityto sue, and suf\u00aeces to confer federal jurisdiction. IV Respondents offer several arguments against this conclu- sion, none of which we \u00aend ava iling. 9The dissent is playful in manufacturing a con\u00afict between our synthesis of the cases and the opinion in Bankers Trust Co. v.Texas and Paci\u00aec R. Co., 241 U. S. 295 (1916). See post, at 272. The dissent \u00aerst quotes the Court's construction in the Bankers Trust opinion, that the clause at issue there implied no jurisdictional grant, but simply rendered the corporation\u00aa `capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court of lawor equity\u00d0Federal, state or territorial\u00d0whose jurisdiction as otherwisecompetently de\u00aened was adequate to the occasion.' \u00ba Post, at 272 (empha- sis omitted) (quoting 241 U. S., at 303). The dissent then concludes that\u00aa[t]hat paraphrasing of the railroad charter, in terms that would spell ju-risdiction under the key the Court adopts today, belies any notion thatBankers Trust was using the same code book.\u00ba Post, at 273. The dis- sent thus attempts to set up a con\u00afict between our analysis and the resultinBankers Trust, by suggesting that that Court's interpretation of the provision ( i. e., to confer capacity to sue in courts including federal ones) should itself be subject to a second-order interpretation, which under ouranalysis might require a holding of jurisdiction, the conclusion rejectedby the Bankers Trust Court. This \u00aainterpretation of an interpretation\u00ba methodology is simply illegitimate, originating not in our opinion but inthe dissent's whimsy. Like our predecessors, we are construing a charter,not a paraphrase.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 258 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Opinion of the Court A First, we can make short work of respondents' argument that the charter's conferral of federal jurisdiction is never-theless subject to the requirements of the \u00aawell-pleaded com-plaint\u00ba rule (that the federal question must appear on theface of a well-pleaded complaint) limiting the removal ofcases from state to federal court. See Brief for Respond-ents 38\u00b146. Respondents erroneously invoke that rule out-side the realm of statutory \u00aaarising under\u00ba jurisdiction, i. e., jurisdiction based on 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331, to jurisdiction basedon a separate and independent jurisdictional grant, in thiscase, the Red Cross Charter's \u00aasue and be statutory\u00aaarising under\u00ba see Verlinden B.

Rev.67, 75, n. 17; it has no applicability here. B Respondents also claim that language used in congres- sional charters enacted closely in time to the 1947 amend-ment casts doubt on congressional intent thereby to conferfederal jurisdiction over cases involving the Red Cross. Re-spondents argue that the 1948 amendment to the charter ofthe Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the 1947 amend-ment to the charter of the Federal Crop Insurance Corpora-tion (FCIC), and the 1935 amendment to the FDIC's charter,each of which includes explicit grants of federal jurisdiction,together demonstrate \u00aaa practice of using clear and explicitlanguage to confer federal jurisdiction over corporations[Congress] had created.\u00ba Brief for Respondents 27. The argument does not hold up. The CCC amendment is irrelevant to this enquiry, as it conferred exclusive, ratherthan concurrent, federal jurisdiction.

There is every reason to expect Congress to take great care in its use of explicit lan-guage when it wishes to confer exclusive jurisdiction, givenour longstanding requirement to that effect. 10Its employ- ment of explicitly jurisdictional language in the CCC's casethus raises no suggestion that its more laconic Red Crossamendment was not meant to confer concurrent federaljurisdiction. Nor do the other two enactments support respondents' ar- gument. The statutes were passed 12 years apart and em-ployed verbally and doctrinally distinct formulations. Com-pare Banking Act of 1935, ch. 614, \u00a7 101, 49 Stat. 684, 692(providing that suits involving FDIC \u00aashall be deemed toarise under the laws of the United States\u00ba), with Act of Aug.1, 1947, ch. 440, \u00a7 7, 61 Stat. 719 (providing that FCIC \u00aamaysue and be sued in its corporate name in any court of recordof a State having general jurisdiction, or in any United States district court, and [that] jurisdiction is hereby con-ferred upon such district court to determine such controver-sies without regard to the amount in controversy\u00ba). 11These differences are not merely semantic: the jurisdictional effectof the FDIC's provision depends on the 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331grant of general federal-question jurisdiction, while the 10See Cla\u00afin 93 U. jurisdiction, where it isnot excluded by express provision, or by incompatibility in its exercisearising from the nature of the particular case\u00ba); see also Charles Dowd Box Co. v.Courtney, 368 U. S. 502, 508 (1962) ( Cla\u00afin 's analysis of this question \u00aahas remained unmodi\u00aeed through the years\u00ba). 11Respondents do not repeat the Court of Appeals's argument that the original language of the FCIC charter tracked in all relevant respects thatin the Red Cross's post-1947 charter, and that Congress's later amendmentof the FCIC charter to make jurisdiction more explicit thus implicitly sug-gests that Congress considered that language insuf\u00aecient to confer juris-diction. See 938 F. 2d 1494, 1500 (CA1 1991). We note here only thatthe Red Cross adequately rebuts that argument.

These differences of both form and substance belie respondents'claim of a coherent drafting pattern against which to judgethe ostensible intent behind the Red Cross amendment. If, indeed, respondents' argument could claim any plausi- bility, it would have to be at the cost of ignoring the 1942D'Oench, Duhme opinion citing the FDIC charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision as the source of federal jurisdiction inthat case. See 315 U. S., at 455. If the \u00aasue and be sued\u00baclause is suf\u00aecient for federal jurisdiction when it occurs inthe same charter with the language respondents claim to beat odds with its jurisdictional signi\u00aecance, it is certainly suf-\u00aecient standing alone. In any event, the fact that our opin-ion in D'Oench, Duhme was handed down before the 1947 amendment to the Red Cross Charter indicates that Con-gress may well have relied on that holding to infer thatamendment of the Red Cross Charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00baprovision to make it identical to the FDIC's would suf\u00aece toconfer federal jurisdiction. See, e. g., Cannon, 441 U. S., at 696\u00b1697. Congress was, in any event, entitled to draw theinference. C Respondents would have us look behind the statute to \u00aend quite a different purpose when they argue that the 1947amendment may have been meant not to confer jurisdiction,but to clarify the Red Cross's capacity to sue in federalcourts where an independent jurisdictional basis exists.See Brief for Respondents 23\u00b127. The suggestion is thatCongress may have thought such a clari\u00aecation necessaryafter passage of the 1925 statute generally bringing an endto federal incorporation as a jurisdictional basis. See 28U. S. C. \u00a7 1349. 12But this suggestion misconstrues of Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, \u00a7 12, 43 Stat. 941 (currently codi\u00aeed at 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1349). The exception, for federally chartered corporationsover one-half owned by the United States, is irrelevant to our enquiry.See n. 3, supra.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 261 Cite as: 505 U.

The only two relevant comments, both made by Sena-tor George, appear to be mutually contradictory on the matter at issuehere. At one point Senator George said: \u00aaI think the purpose of the billis very clear, and that is to give the jurisdiction in State courts and Fed-eral courts, and I think we had better leave it there,\u00ba ibid. Later, how- ever, he stated: \u00aaI think there might be some question about the right ofa Federal corporation to be sued in a State court. I thought that was,and I still think it is, the purpose of this provision,\u00ba id.,at 11.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:02 PAGES OPINPGT 262 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Opinion of the Court The Advisory Report's explicit concern with the limited jurisdiction of the federal courts indicates that the recom-mended change, which prompted the amendment to the \u00aasueand be sued\u00ba provision, spoke to jurisdiction rather thancapacity to sue. Against this, respondents argue only thatthe Advisory Report's use of the words \u00aacan\u00ba and \u00aapower\u00baindicate concern with the latter, not the former. See Brieffor Respondents 25. This is \u00aene parsing, too \u00aene to over-come the overall jurisdictional thrust of the Report'srecommendation. In a \u00aenal look toward the text, respondents speculate that the 1947 amendment can be explained as an attempt to clar-ify the Red Cross's capacity to enter the federal courts undertheir diversity jurisdiction. See Brief for Respondents 25\u00b126, 29. The argument turns on the theory that federallychartered corporations are not citizens of any particular State, and thus may not avail themselves of diversity juris-diction. See id.,at 26 829 (DC 1987)). Respondents com- pletely fail, however, to explain how the addition of thewords \u00aaState or Federal\u00ba to the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provisionmight address this claimed jurisdictional problem. Indeed,the 1947 amendment, by specifying the particular courtsopen to the Red Cross, as opposed to the Red Cross's statusas a party, seems particularly ill-suited to rectifying an as-serted party-based jurisdictional de\u00aeciency. 14 14At oral argument respondents carried the suggestion a further step by speculating that the 1947 amendment could be explained as an attemptto ensure the Red Cross's access to federal courts when diversity jurisdic-tion existed, due to concern, presumably present until our 1949 decision inNational Mut. Ins. Co. v.Tidewater Transfer Co., 337 U. S. 582, about the constitutionality of the 1940 statute giving District of Columbia-chartered corporations the same rights to sue in diversity as state-chartered corporations. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u00b131. But the speculation,if sound, would prove too much. For on this theory Congress would havebeen hedging against a constitutional problem of diversity jurisdiction byresorting to a special grant of jurisdiction to cover the Red Cross, which is505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 263 Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992) Opinion of the Court Perhaps most obviously, respondents' argument violates the ordinary sense of the language used, as well as somebasic canons of statutory construction. The 1905 charter,authorizing the Red Cross \u00aato sue and be sued in courts oflaw and equity within the jurisdiction of the United States,\u00basimply cannot be read as fa iling to empower the Red Cross to sue in federal courts having jurisdiction. That fact, whencombined with the Advisory Report's justi\u00aecation of the 1947amendment by reference to federal courts' limited jurisdic-tion, see supra, leaves it extremely doubtful that capacity to sue simpliciter motivated that amendment. Indeed, the Red Cross's clear preamendment capacity to sue in federalcourts calls into play the canon of statutory construction re-quiring a change in language to be read, if possible, to havesome effect, see, e. g., Brewster v.Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337 (1930); 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction\u00a7 46.06 (5th rev. ed. 1992), a rule which here tugs hard towarda jurisdictional reading of the 1947 amendment. 15 exactly what the Red Cross maintains was intended by following D'Oench, Duhme and Osborn. Respondents complain that the Red Cross's theory is of recent vintage, citing a 1951 case in which the Red Cross removed a suit against it fromstate to federal court based not on any independent jurisdictional grantimplicit in the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision, but rather on party diversity.See Brief for Respondents 29 (citing Patterson v.American National Red Cross, 101 F. Supp. 655 (SD Fla. 1951)). However, the Red Cross's failure in one 40-year-old case to base its removal petition on the theory it ad-vances today adds nothing to respondents' attack on the Red Cross's cur-rent interpretation. 15The dissent adopts and re\u00aenes respondents' argument, see Brief for Respondents 16, that the 1947 amendment's parallel treatment of federaland state courts counsels against reading that amendment as conferringjurisdiction, see post, at 267\u00b1268. The short answer is that D'Oench, Duhme forecloses the argument, since the charter language we held to confer federal jurisdiction in that case made exactly the same parallelmention of federal and state courts. But going beyond that, the referenceto state as well as federal courts presumably was included lest a mentionof federal courts alone (in order to grant jurisdiction to them) be taken asmotivated by an intent to confer exclusive federal jurisdiction. Moreover,the Red Cross Charter's \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba provision, like its counterparts505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 264 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Opinion of the Court V Our holding leaves the jurisdiction of the federal courts well within Article III's limits. As long ago as Osborn, this Court held that Article III's \u00aaarising under\u00ba jurisdiction isbroad enough to authorize Congress to confer federal-courtjurisdiction over actions involving federally chartered corpo-rations. See 9 Wheat., at 823\u00b1828. 16We have consistently reaf\u00aermed the breadth of that holding. See Paci\u00aec R. Re- moval Cases, 115 U. S., at 11\u00b114; In re Dunn, 212 U. S. 374, 383\u00b1384 (1909); Bankers Trust, 241 U. S., at 305\u00b1306; Puerto construed in Osborn and D'Oench, Duhme, confers both capacity to sue and jurisdiction. While capacity to sue in both federal and state courts was already clearly established before the 1947 amendment, it may havebeen feared that the addition of the word \u00aaFederal\u00ba to confer federal juris-diction would be misread to limit the Red Cross's capacity to sue in statecourts, if it were not reaf\u00aermed by explicit inclusion of the word \u00aaState.\u00ba It is the dissent's conclusion that the 1947 amendment was meant to \u00aaeliminat[e] the possibility that the language `courts of law and equitywithin the jurisdiction of the United States' that was contained in theoriginal charter might be read to limit the grant of capacity to sue infederal court,\u00ba post, at 275 (emphasis and citation omitted); that is dif\u00aecult to justify. Such a motivation is nowhere even hinted at in the AdvisoryReport, the document both Houses of Congress acknowledged as thesource for the amendment, see supra, at 261 (quoting congressional re- ports); indeed, the relevant part of the Advisory Report does not evenmention state courts, see Advisory Report 35\u00b136, reprinted at App. toBrief for Appellants in No. 90\u00b11873, at 132\u00b1133. It is hardly a \u00aareasonableconstruction,\u00ba post, at 275, of the amendment to view it as granting some- thing the Advisory Report never requested. While the dissent notes one of Senator George's comments supporting its hypothesis, it ignores theother, which explicitly notes a federal jurisdiction-conferring motivationbehind the amendment. See supra, at 261, n. 13. Neither party reads the 1947 amendment to clarify the Red Cross's ca- pacity to sue in state courts, and, as there is no evidence of such an intent,we do not embrace that reading here. 16Again, it should be pointed out that statutory jurisdiction in this case is not based on the Red Cross's federal incorporation, but rather upona speci\u00aec statutory grant. In contrast, the constitutional question askswhether Article III's provision for federal jurisdiction over cases \u00aaarisingunder federal law\u00ba is suf\u00aeciently broad to allow that grant.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 265 Cite as: 505 U.

VI The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia , with whom The Chief Justice ,Justice O\u0092Connor , and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting. The Court today concludes that whenever a statute grant- ing a federally chartered corporation the \u00aapower to sue andbe sued\u00ba speci\u00aecally mentions the federal courts (as opposedto merely embracing them within general language), the lawwill be deemed not only to confer on the corporation thecapacity to bring and suffer suit (which is all that the wordssay), but also to confer on federal district courts jurisdiction over any and all controversies to which that corporation isa party. This wonderland of linguistic confusion\u00d0in whichwords are sometimes read to mean only what they say andother times read also to mean what they do not say\u00d0is basedon the erroneous premise that our cases in this area establisha \u00aamagic words\u00ba jurisprudence that departs from ordinaryrules of English usage. In fact, our cases simply re\u00afect thefact that the natural reading of some \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clauses is that they confer both capacity and jurisdiction.Since the natural reading of the Red Cross Charter is thatit confers only capacity, I respectfully dissent. I Section 2 of the Red Cross Charter, 36 U. S. C. \u00a7 2, sets forth the various powers of the corporation, such as the505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 266 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G.

The presence of this language amidst a list of more or less ordinary corporate powers con-\u00aerms what the words themselves suggest: It merely estab-lishes that the Red Cross is a juridical person which may beparty to a lawsuit in an American court, and that the RedCross\u00d0despite its status as a federally chartered corpora-tion\u00d0does not share the Government's general immunityfrom suit. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(b) (\u00aaThe capacity of acorporation to sue or be sued shall be determined by the lawunder which it was organized\u00ba); 4 Thompson on Corporations 1Section 2, as amended, provides in its entirety: \u00aaThe name of this corporation shall be `The American National Red Cross', and by that name it shall have perpetual succession, with thepower to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal,within the jurisdiction of the United States; to have and to hold such realand personal estate as shall be deemed advisable and to dispose of thesame, to accept gifts, devises, and bequests of real and personal estate forthe purposes of this corporation hereinafter set forth; to adopt a seal andthe same to alter and destroy at pleasure; and to have the right to haveand to use, in carrying out its purposes hereinafter designated, as an em-blem and badge, a Greek red cross on a white ground, as the same hasbeen described in the treaties of Geneva, August twenty-second, eighteenhundred and sixty-four and July twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred andtwenty-nine, and adopted by the several nations acceding thereto; to or-dain and establish bylaws and regulations not inconsistent with the lawsof the United States of America or any State thereof, and generally to doall such acts and things as may be necessary to carry into effect the provi-sions of sections 1, 2 to 6, 8, and 9 of this title and promote the purposesof said organization; and the corporation created is designated as the orga-nization which is authorized to act in matters of relief under said treaties.In accordance with the said treaties, the delivery of the brassard allowedfor individuals neutralized in time of war shall be left to military author-ity.\u00ba 36 U.

S. 549, 554\u00b1557 (1988) (\u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause waives sovereign immunity). It is beyond question that nothing in the language of this provision suggests that it has anything to do with regulatingthe jurisdiction of the federal courts. The grant of corpo-rate power to sue and be sued in no way implies a grant offederal-court jurisdiction; it merely places the corporation onthe same footing as a natural person, who must look else-where to establish grounds for getting his case into court. Words conferring authority upon a corporation are a most illogical means of conferring jurisdiction upon a court, and would not normally be understood that way. Moreover, itwould be extraordinary to confer a new subject-matter juris-diction upon \u00aafederal courts\u00ba in general, rather than upon aparticular federal court or courts. The Court apparently believes, see ante, at 256, n. 8, that the language of \u00a7 2 is functionally equivalent to a speci\u00aecreference to the district courts, since no other court couldreasonably have been intended to be the recipient of thejurisdictional grant. Perhaps so, but applying that intuitionrequires such a random butchering of the text that it is muchmore reasonable to assume that nocourt was the intended recipient. The Red Cross is clearly granted the capacity to sue and be sued in allfederal courts, so that it could appear, for example, as a party in a third-party action in the Courtof International Trade, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1583, and in an actionbefore the United States Claims Court, see Claims CourtRule 14(a) (Mar. 15, 1991). There is simply no textual basis,and no legal basis except legal intuition, for saying that itmust in addition establish an independent basis of jurisdic- tion to proceed in those courts, though it does not in the district courts. In fact, the language of this provision not only does not distinguish among federal courts, it also does not treat fed-505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 268 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Scalia, J., dissenting eral courts differently from state courts; the Red Cross is granted the \u00aapower\u00ba to sue in both. This parallel treatmentof state and federal courts even further undermines a juris-dictional reading of the statute, since the provision cannotreasonably be read as allowing the Red Cross to enter astate court without establishing the independent basis ofjurisdiction appropriate under state law. Such a readingwould present serious constitutional questions. Cf. Brown v.Gerdes, 321 U. S. 178, 188 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., concur- ring); Howlett v.Rose, 496 U. S. 356, v.Pit- cairn, 324 U.

Mississippi and the Adequate State Ground:Proposals for a Revised Doctrine, 1965 S. Ct. Rev. 187, 207,n. 84. Since the language of the Red Cross Charter cannotfairly be read to create federal jurisdiction but not state ju-risdiction, we should not construe it as creating either. Ed- ward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.NLRB, 463 U. S. 147, 157 (1983); NLRB v.Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500\u00b1 501 (1979). I therefore conclude\u00d0indeed, I do not think it seriously contestable\u00d0that the natural reading of the \u00aasue and besued\u00ba clause of 36 U. S. C. \u00a7 2 confers upon the Red Crossonly the capacity to \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba in state and federal courts; it does not confer jurisdiction upon any court, stateor federal. II I do not understand the Court to disagree with my analy- sis of the ordinary meaning of the statutory language. Itstheory is that, regardless of ordinary meaning, our caseshave created what might be termed a \u00aaphrase of art,\u00bawhereby a \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause confers federal jurisdic-tion \u00aaif, but only if, it speci\u00aecally mentions the federalcourts.\u00ba Ante, at 255. Thus, while the uninitiated would consider the phrase \u00aasue and be sued in any court in theUnited States\u00ba to mean the same thing as \u00aasue sued505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 269 Cite as: 505 U. S. 247 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting in any court, state or federal,\u00ba the Court believes that our cases have established the latter (but not the former) as ashorthand for \u00aasue and be sued in any court, state or federal,and the federal district courts shall have jurisdiction overany such action. \u00ba Congress is assumed to have used this cleverly crafted code in enacting the charter provision atissue here. Ante, at 251\u00b1252. In my view, our cases do not establish the cryptology the Court attributes to them.Rather, the four prior cases in which we have considered thejurisdictional implications of \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clauses arebest understood as simply applications of conventional rules of statutory construction. InBank of the United States v.Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61 (1809), we held that a provision of the Act establishing the\u00aerst Bank of the United States which stated that the Bankwas \u00aamade able and capable in law . . . to sue and be sued. . . in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever,\u00ba1 Stat. 192, did not confer jurisdiction on the federal courtsto adjudicate suits brought by the Bank. Construing thestatutory terms in accordance with their ordinary meaning,we concluded (as I conclude with respect to the Red CrossCharter) that the provision merely gave \u00aaa capacity to the corporation to appear, as a corporation, in any court whichwould, by law, have cognisance of the cause, if brought byindividuals.\u00ba 5 Cranch, at 85\u00b186 (emphasis added). We ex-pressly noted (as I have in this case) that the Act's undiffer-entiated mention of all courts compelled the conclusion thatthe provision was not jurisdictional: \u00aa If jurisdiction is given by this clause to the federal courts, it is equally given to allcourts having original jurisdiction, and for all sums how-ever small they may be. \u00baId.,at 86 (emphasis added). That statement is immediately followed by contrasting this provi-sion with another section of the Act which provided that cer-tain actions against the directors of the Bank \u00aama y...b e brought . . . in any court of record of the United States, orof either of them.\u00ba 1 Stat. 194. That provision, we said,505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 270 AMERICAN NAT. RED CROSS v.S. G. Scalia, J., dissenting \u00aaexpressly authorizes the bringing of that action in the fed- eral or state courts,\u00ba which \u00aaevinces the opinion of congress,that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in thecourts of the union, unless it be expressed.\u00ba 5 Cranch, at86. It is clear, I think, that the reason the Court thoughtthe right to have been \u00aaexpressed\u00ba under the directors-suitprovision, but not \u00aaexpressed\u00ba under the provision before it,was notthat the former happened to mention courts \u00aaof the United States.\u00ba For that would have provided no contrastto the argument against jurisdiction (italicized above) thatthe Court had just made. Reference to suits \u00aain any courtof record of the United States, or of either of them,\u00ba is noless universal in its operative scope than reference to suits\u00aain courts of record,\u00ba and hence is subject to the same objec- tion (to which the Court was presumably giving a contrast-ing example) that jurisdiction was indiscriminately conferredon all courts of original jurisdiction and for any and allamounts. Deveaux establishes not, as the Court claims, the weird principle that mention of the federal courts in a \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause confers jurisdiction; but rather, the quite differ- ent (and quite reasonable) proposition that mention of thefederal courts in a provision allowing a particular cause of action to be brought does so. The contrast between the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause and the provision authorizing certainsuits against the directors lay, not in the mere substitutionof one broad phrase for another, but in the fact that the latterprovision, by authorizing particular actions to be brought in federal court, could not reasonably be read notto confer ju- risdiction. A provision merely conferring a general capac- ityto bring actions, however, cannot reasonably be read to confer jurisdiction. 2 2The Court believes that Deveaux 's statement that \u00aathe right to sue does not imply the right to sue in the courts of the union unless it be expressed, \u00baBank of United States v.Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86 (1809) (emphasis added), is somehow inconsistent with my analysis.

S. 247 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting This reading of Deveaux is fully consistent with our subse- quent decision in Osborn v.Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), which construed the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause ofthe second Bank's charter as conferring jurisdiction on fed-eral circuit courts. The second charter provided that theBank was \u00aamade able and capable, in law to sue and besued . . . in all state courts having competent jurisdiction,and in any circuit court of the United States,\u00ba 3 Stat. 269.By granting the Bank power to sue, not in all courts gener-ally (as in Deveaux ), but in particular federal courts, this suggested a grant of jurisdiction rather than merely of capac-ity to sue. And that suggestion was strongly con\u00aermed bythe fact that the Bank was empowered to sue in state courts\u00aahaving competent jurisdiction,\u00ba but in federal circuit courtssimpliciter. If the statute had jurisdiction in mind as to the one, it must as to the other as well. Our opinion in Osborn did not invoke the \u00aamagic words\u00ba approach adopted by theCourt today, but concluded that the charter language \u00aaad-mit[ted] of but one interpretation\u00ba and could not \u00aabe madeplainer by explanation.\u00ba 9 Wheat., at 817. In distinguishing Deveaux, Osborn noted, and apparently misunderstood as the Court today does, that case's contrastbetween the \u00aaexpress grant of jurisdiction to the federalcourts\u00ba over suits against directors and the \u00aageneral words\u00baof the and be sued\u00ba clause, \u00aawhich [did] not mentionthose courts.\u00ba 9 Wheat., at 818. All it concluded from that,however, was that Deveaux established that \u00aaa general ca- pacity in the bank to sue, without mentioning the courts ofthe Union, may not give a right to sue in those courts.\u00ba 9Wheat., at 818. There does not logically follow from thatthe rule which the Court announces today: that any grant of a general capacity to sue with mention of federal courts will 255, n. 6. Quite the opposite is true: The Court's simple statement that the grant of jurisdiction must \u00aabe expressed\u00ba is obviously a call, not toreach for the cryptograph, but to discern the plain meaning of the statu-tory language.505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 272 AMERICAN NAT.

The Court's reading of this language from Osborn as giving talismanic signi\u00aecance to any \u00aamention\u00ba of federal courts is simply inconsistent withthe fact that Osborn (like Deveaux ) did not purport to confer on the words of the clause any meaning other than that sug-gested by their natural import. This reading of Deveaux and Osborn is con\u00aermed by our later decision in Bankers Trust Co. v.Texas & Paci\u00aec R. Co., 241 U. S. 295 (1916). There we held it to be \u00aaplain\u00ba that arailroad charter provision stating that the corporation \u00aashallbe able to sue and be sue d...i na l l courts of law and equity within the United States,\u00ba 16 Stat. 574, did not confer juris-diction on any court. 241 U. S., at 303. Had our earliercases stood for the \u00aamagic words\u00ba rule adopted by the Courttoday, we could have reached that conclusion simply by not-ing that the clause at issue did not contain a speci\u00aec refer-ence to the federal courts. That is not, however, what wedid. Indeed, the absence of such speci\u00aec reference was not even mentioned in the opinion. See id., at 303\u00b1305. In- stead, as before, we sought to determine the sense of theprovision by considering the ordinary meaning of its lan-guage in context.

RED CROSS v.S. G. Scalia, J., dissenting it would be remarkable to attribute such great signi\u00aecance to a passing comment on a conceded point. But in my viewit does not say that anyway, since the footnote must be readtogether with the text as explaining the single basis of juris-diction (rather than, as the Court would have it, explainingtwo separate bases of jurisdiction in a case where even theexplanation of one is obiter ). The language quoted in the footnote is not, as the Court says, from \u00aaanother part of thesame statute,\u00ba ante, at 254, but is the continuation of the pro- vision quoted in the text, see 12 U. S.

III Finally, the Court argues that a jurisdictional reading of the Red Cross Charter is required by the canon of construc-tion that an amendment to a statute ordinarily should not beread as having no effect.

The original \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause in the Red Cross Charter did not containthe phrase \u00aaState or Federal,\u00ba and the Court argues thatits reading\u00d0which gives decisive weight to that addition\u00d0is therefore strongly to be preferred. Ibid. I do not agree. Even if it were the case that my reading of the clause ren-dered this phrase super\u00afuous, I would consider that a smallprice to pay for adhering to the competing (and more impor-tant) canon that statutory language should be construed inaccordance with its ordinary meaning. And it would seemparticularly appropriate to run the risk of surplusage here,since the amendment in question was one of a number of505us1101K 07-22-96 16:32:03 PAGES OPINPGT 275 Cite as: 505 U.

But in any event, a natural-meaning construction of the \u00aasue and be sued\u00ba clause does not render the 1947 amend-ment super\u00afuous. The addition of the words \u00aaState or Fed-eral\u00ba eliminates the possibility that the language \u00aacourts oflaw and equity within the jurisdiction of the United States\u00ba that was contained in the original charter, see ch. 23, \u00a7 2, 33Stat. 600 (emphasis added), might be read to limit the grantof capacity to sue in federal court. State courts are not within the \u00aajurisdiction\u00ba of the United States unless \u00aajuris-diction\u00ba is taken in the relatively rare sense of referring toterritory rather than power. The addition of the words\u00aaState or Federal\u00ba removes this ambiguity. The Court rejects this argument on the ground that there is \u00aano evidence of such an intent.\u00ba Ante, at 264, n. 15. The best answer to that assertion is that it is irrelevant: To sat-isfy the canon the Court has invoked, it is enough that therebe a reasonable construction of the old and amended statutesthat would explain why the amendment is not super\u00afuous.Another answer to the assertion is that it is wrong. As theCourt notes elsewhere in its opinion, ante, at 261, n. 13, one of the only comments made by a Member of Congress onthis amendment was Senator George's statement, during thehearings, that the purpose of the provision was to con\u00aermthe Red Cross' capacity to sue in state court. See Hearings on S. 591 before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations,80th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1947). 4 4The Court points out that Senator George also stated, in response to a question whether foreign courts should be covered by the amendment,that the purpose of the bill was \u00aa `to give the jurisdiction in State courtsand Federal courts, and I think we had better leave it there.' \u00ba Ante, at 261, n. 13. Rather than concluding (as seems obvious) that Senator Georgewas speaking with imprecision in using the phrase \u00aagive the jurisdiction,\u00bathe Court draws the far less likely conclusion that Senator George was\u00afatly contradicting himself in what he said only a few minutes later.

Argued March 24, 1992\u00d0Decided June 19, 1992 A few weeks after a Virginia home was burglarized, over 15 of the missing items were recovered from respondent West's home. At his trial ongrand larceny charges, he admitted to a prior felony conviction, but de-nied having stolen the items, explaining that he frequently bought andsold merchandise at different \u00afea markets. He offered no explanationfor how he had acquired any of the stolen items until cross-examination,when he gave vague, evasive, and even contradictory answers; could notremember how he acquired several major items, including a televisionset and a coffee table; and failed to produce any evidence corroboratinghis story. West was convicted. The State Supreme Court af\u00aermed theconviction and denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, both timesrejecting, inter alia, West's contention that the evidence was insuf\u00aecient to support a \u00aending of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. On federalhabeas, the District Court also rejected that contention. The Court ofAppeals reversed on the ground that the standard of Jackson v.Vir- ginia, 443 U. S. 307, 319\u00d0that evidence is suf\u00aecient to support a convic- tion as a matter of due process if, \u00aaafter viewing the evidence in thelight most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonabledoubt\u00ba\u00d0had not been met. Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 931 F. 2d 262, reversed and remanded. Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice andJustice Scalia, concluded that regardless of whether a federal habeas court should re-view state-court applications of law to fact deferentially or de novo, the trial record contains more than enough evidence to support West'sconviction. Jackson repeatedly emphasizes the deference owed the trier of fact and the sharply limited nature of constitutional suf\u00aeciency review. The case against West was strong. The jury was entitledto disbelieve his uncorroborated and confused testimony, discount hiscredibility on account of his prior felony conviction, and take his de-meanor into account. The jury was also permitted to consider what itconcluded to be perjured testimony as af\u00aermative evidence 04-22-99 17:32:46 PAGES OPINPGT 278 WRIGHT v.WEST Syllabus Justice White concluded that there was enough evidence to support West's conviction under the Jackson standard.

Justice O\u0092Connor, joined by Justice Blackmun and Justice Ste- vens, concluded that the evidence supported West's conviction and that there was no need to decide the standard of review issue to decide thiscase. Pp. 297, 305\u00b1306. Justice Kennedy concluded that the evidence was suf\u00aecient to con- vince a rational fact\u00aender of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and thatTeague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288, should not be interpreted as calling into question the settled principle that mixed questions are subject to de novo review on federal habeas corpus. Pp. 306\u00b1310. Justice Souter concluded that West sought the bene\u00aet of a \u00aanew rule,\u00ba and thus his claim was barred by Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288. The Court of Appeals misapplied Teague 's commands, since, while the Jackson rule was \u00aaold\u00ba enough to have predated the \u00aenality of West's conviction, it was not speci\u00aec enough to dictate the rule on which theconviction was held unlawful. Although the State Supreme Court wasnot entitled to disregard Jackson, it does not follow from Jackson 's rule that the insuf\u00aeciency of the evidence to support West's conviction wasapparent. Virginia has long recognized a rule that evidence of falselyexplained possession of recently stolen property is suf\u00aecient to sustaina \u00aending that the possessor took the goods, and the jury's rejectionof West's explanation implies a \u00aending that his explanation was false.Virginia's rule is reasonable and has been accepted as good law againstthe backdrop of a general state suf\u00aeciency standard no less stringentthan the Jackson rule. Thus, it is not possible to say that reasonable jurists could not have considered Virginia's rule compatible with theJackson standard. Pp. 310\u00b1316.

Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia joined. In this case, we must determine whether the Court of Ap- peals for the Fourth Circuit correctly applied our decision inJackson v.Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), in concluding that the evidence against respondent Frank West was insuf\u00aecient,as a matter of due process, to support his state-court convic-tion for grand larceny. I Between December 13 and December 26, 1978, someone broke into the Westmoreland County, Virginia, home of An-gelo Cardova and stole items valued at approximately $3,500.On January 10, 1979, police conducted a lawful search of theGloucester County, Virginia, home of West and his wife.They discovered several of the items stolen from the Car-dova home, including various electronic equipment (two tele-vision sets and a record player); articles of clothing (an imita-tion mink coat with the name \u00aaEsther\u00ba embroidered in it, asilk jacket emblazoned \u00aaKorea 1970,\u00ba and a pair of shoes);decorations (several wood carvings and a mounted lobster);and miscellaneous household objects (a mirror framed withseashells, a coffee table, a bar, a sleeping bag, and some sil-verware). These items were valued at approximately $800,and the police recovered other, unspeci\u00aeed items of Cardo-va's property with an approximate value of $300. West was charged with grand larceny. Testifying at trial on his own behalf, he admitted to a prior felony conviction,but denied having taken anything from Cardova's house.

West testi\u00aeed that he purchased one ofthe wood carvings, the jacket, mounted lobster, mirror, andbar from Elkins for about $500. West initially guessed, andthen twice positively asserted, that this sale occurred beforeJanuary 1, 1979. In addition, West claimed to have pur-chased the coat from Elkins for $5 around January 1, 1979.His testimony did not make clear whether he was describingone transaction or two, whether there were any other trans-actions between himself and Elkins, where the transactionsoccurred, and whether the transactions occurred at \u00afea mar-kets. 1West testi\u00aeed further that he had purchased one of 1The quality of West's testimony on these matters can best be appreci- ated by example: \u00aaQ Are those items that you bought at a \u00afea market?\u00aaA Well, I didn't buy these items at a \u00afea market, no sir.\u00aaQ Whose items are they?\u00aaA They are some items that I got from a Ronnie Elkins.\u00aaQ All of the items you bought from him?\u00aaA I can't say all.\u00aaQ Which ones did you buy from him?\u00aaA I can't say, because I don't have an inventory.\u00aaQ Can you tell me the ones you bought from Ronnie Elkins?\u00aaA Yes, I am sure I can.\u00aaQ Which ones?\u00aaA I would say the platter.\u00aaQ How about the sea shell mirror?\u00aaA Yes, sir, I think so.\u00aaQ Where did you buy that?\u00aaA In Newport News at a \u00afea market.\u00ba App. 21\u00b122.\u00aaQ I want to know about your business transactions with Ronnie Elkins.

Finally, West testi\u00aeed that he did not rememberhow he had acquired the second television, the coffee table,and the silverware. Under then-applicable Virginia law, grand larceny was de- \u00aened as the wrongful and nonconsensual taking of propertyworth at least $100, with the intent to deprive the owner ofit permanently. See Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2\u00b195 (1975); Skeeter v.Commonwealth, 217 Va. 722, 725, 232 S. E. 2d 756, 758 (1977). Virginia law permits an inference that a person whofails to explain, or falsely explains, his exclusive possessionof recently stolen property is the thief. See, e. g., Moehring v.Commonwealth, 223 Va. 564, 568, 290 S. 893 (1982); Best v.Commonwealth, 222 Va. 387, 389, 282 S. E. 2d 16, 17 (1981).

West petitioned for an appeal,contending (among other things) that the evidence was insuf-\u00aecient to support a \u00aending of guilt beyond a reasonabledoubt. In May 1980, the Supreme Court of Virginia refusedthe petition\u00d0a disposition indicating that the court foundthe petition without merit, see Saunders v.Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 700, 204 S.

West renewed his claim that the original trialrecord contained insuf\u00aecient evidence to support the convic-tion, and he argued in the alternative that Elkins' af\u00aedavit, which tended to corroborate West's trial testimony in certainrespects, constituted new evidence entitling him to a newtrial. The Supreme Court of Virginia again denied relief.West then \u00aeled a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in theDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, whichrejected both claims and denied relief.

S., at 319 (emphasis in original). Five considerations led the court to conclude that this standardwas not met: \u00aerst, the items were recovered no sooner thantwo weeks after they had been stolen; second, only about athird of the items stolen from Cardova (measured by value)were recovered from West; third, the items were found in West's house in plain view, and not hidden away as contra-band; fourth, West's explanation of his possession was not so\u00aainherently implausible,\u00ba even if it were disbelieved, that itcould \u00aafairly be treated as positive evidence of guilt\u00ba; and\u00aefth, there was no corroborating evidence (such as \u00aenger-prints or eyewitness testimony) beyond the fact of merepossession. See 931 F. 2d, at 268\u00b1270.

S. C. \u00a7 2254(a). Thecourt must \u00aadispose of the matter as law and justice require.\u00ba\u00a7 2243. For much of our history, we interpreted these bareguidelines and their predecessors to re\u00afect the common-lawprinciple that a prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpuscould challenge only the jurisdiction of the court that hadrendered the judgment under which he was in custody. See,e. g., In re Wood, 140 U. S. 278, 285\u00b1287 (1891) (Harlan, J.); Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 202 (1830) (Marshall, C. J.). Gradually, we began to expand the category of claimsdeemed to be jurisdictional for habeas purposes. See, e. g., Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 377 (1880) (court without jurisdiction to impose sentence under unconstitutional stat-ute); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 176 (1874) (court without jurisdiction to impose sentence not authorized by statute).Next, we began to recognize federal claims by state prison-ers if no state court had provided a full and fair opportunityto litigate those claims. See, e. g., Moore v.Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 91\u00b192 (1923); Frank v.Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 335\u00b1 336 (1915). Before 1953, however, the inverse of this rulealso remained true: Absent an alleged jurisdictional defect,\u00aahabeas corpus would not lie for a [state] prisoner . . . if hehad been given an adequate opportunity to obtain full and fair consideration of his federal claim in the state courts.\u00baFay v.Noia, 372 U.

Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915), and Moore v.Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923), served no purpose other than to de\u00aene the scope of the underlying allegedconstitutional violation. See post, at 297\u00b1299. Frank and Moore in- volved claims, rejected by the state appellate courts, that a trial had beenso dominated by a mob as to violate due process. In Frank, we denied relief not because the state appellate court had decided the federal claimcorrectly (the relevant question on direct review), and not even because the state appellate court had decided the federal claim reasonably, but only \u00aabecause Frank's federal claims had been considered by a competentand unbiased state tribunal,\u00ba Stone v.Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 476 (1976). InMoore, which reaf\u00aermed Frank expressly, see 261 U. S., at 90\u00b191, we ordered the District Court to consider the mob domination claim on themerits because the state appellate court's \u00aaperfunctory treatment\u00ba of it\u00aawas not in fact acceptable corrective process.\u00ba Noia, 372 U. S., at 458 (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also Bator, 76 Harv. L. Rev., at 488\u00b1489. Inboth cases, a claim that the habeas petitioner had been denied due processat trial was not cognizable on habeas unless the petitioner also had been denied a full and fair opportunity to raise that claim on appeal. Second, Justice O\u0092Connor states that we mischaracterize the views of Justice Powell about the history of habeas law between 1915 and 1953.See post, at 299. In fact, however, Justice Powell has often recounted exactly the same familiar history that we summarize above. In Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545 (1979), for example, he described Frank as having \u00aamodestly expanded\u00ba the \u00aascope of the writ\u00ba in order to \u00aaencompass thosecases where the defendant's federal constitutional claims had not been con-sidered in the state-court proceeding.\u00ba 443 U. S., at 580 (opinion concur-ring in judgment). Similarly, in Schneckloth v.Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218 (1973), he described Frank as having extended \u00aa[t]he scope of federal ha- beas corpus\u00ba to permit consideration of \u00aawhether the applicant had beengiven an adequate opportunity in state court to raise his constitutionalclaims.\u00ba 412 U. S., at 255\u00b1256 (concurring opinion). In neither case, norinKuhlmann, did Justice Powell even suggest that federal habeas was available before 1953 to a prisoner who had received a full and fair oppor-tunity to litigate his federal claim in state court. Third, Justice O\u0092Connor criticizes our failure to acknowledge Salinger v.Loisel, 265 U. S. 224 (1924), which she describes as the \u00aerst case ex-505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:46 PAGES OPINPGT 287 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. We rejected the principle of absolute deference in our landmark decision in Brown v.Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953). There, we held that a state-court judgment of conviction \u00aaisnotres judicata \u00ba on federal habeas with respect to federal constitutional claims, id.,at 458, even if the state court has rejected all such claims after a full and fair hearing. In-stead, we held, a district court must determine whether the state-court adjudication \u00aahas resulted in a satisfactoryconclusion.\u00ba Id.,at 463. We had no occasion to explore in detail the question whether a \u00aasatisfactory\u00ba conclusion wasone that the habeas court considered correct, as opposed to merely reasonable, because we concluded that the constitu- tional claims advanced in Brown itself would fail even if the state courts' rejection of them were reconsidered de novo. See id.,at 465\u00b1476. Nonetheless, we indicated that the fed- eral courts enjoy at least the discretion to take into consider-ation the fact that a state court has previously rejected thefederal claims asserted on habeas. See id.,at 465 (\u00aaAs the state and federal courts have the same responsibilities toprotect persons from violation of their constitutional rights,we conclude that a federal district court may decline, withouta rehearing of the facts, to award a writ of habeas corpus to astate prisoner where the legality of such detention has been plicitly to hold that \u00aa res judicata is not strictly followed on federal ha- beas.\u00ba Post, at 299. Salinger, however, involved the degree of preclu- sive effect of a habeas judgment upon subsequent habeas petitions \u00aeled by afederal prisoner. This case, of course, involves the degree of preclusive effect of a criminal conviction upon an initial habeas petition \u00aeled by a state prisoner. We cannot fault ourselves for limiting our focus to the latter context. But even assuming its relevance, Salinger hardly ad- vances the position advocated by Justice O\u0092Connor that a habeas court must exercise de novo review with respect to mixed questions of law and fact. Despite acknowledging that a prior habeas judgment is not entitledto absolute preclusive effect under the doctrine of res judicata, Salinger also indicated that the prior habeas judgment \u00aa may be considered, and even given controlling weight.\u00ba 265 U. S., at 231 (emphasis added).505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:46 PAGES OPINPGT 288 WRIGHT v.WEST Opinion of Thomas, J. determined, on the facts presented, by the highest state court with jurisdiction\u00ba).4 In an in\u00afuential separate opinion endorsed by a majority of the Court, Justice Frankfurter also rejected the principleof absolute deference to fairly litigated state-court judg-ments. He emphasized that a state-court determination offederal constitutional law is not \u00aabinding\u00ba on federal habeas,id.,at 506, regardless of whether the determination involves a pure question of law, ibid., or a \u00aaso-called mixed questio[n]\u00ba requiring the application of law to fact, id.,at 507. Nonethe- less, he stated quite explicitly that a \u00aaprior State determina-tion may guide [the] discretion [of the district court] in decid-ing upon the appropriate course to be followed in disposing ofthe application.\u00ba Id., at 500. Discussing mixed questions speci\u00aecally, he noted further that \u00aathere is no need for thefederal judge, if he could, to shut his eyes to the State consid-eration.\u00ba Id.,at 508. 5 4Justice O\u0092Connor contends that the inclusion of this passage in a section of our opinion entitled \u00aaRight to a Plenary Hearing\u00ba makes clearthat we were discussing only the resolution of factual questions. See post, at 300\u00b1301. In our introduction to that section, however, we indi- cated that both factual and legal questions were at issue. See 344 U. S.,at 460 (noting contentions \u00aathat the District Court committed error whenit took no evidence and heard no argument on the federal constitutional issues \u00ba (emphasis added)). Indeed, if only factual questions were at issue, we would have authorized a denial of the writ not whenever the state-court proceeding \u00aahas resulted in a satisfactory conclusion \u00ba (as we did), id.,at 463 (emphasis added), but only whenever the state-court proceeding has resulted in satisfactory fact\u00aending. 5Justice O\u0092Connor quotes Justice Frankfurter for the proposition that a district judge on habeas \u00aa ` must exercise his own judgment ' \u00ba with respect to mixed questions. Post, at 300 (quoting 344 U. S., at 507). Although we agree with Justice O\u0092Connor that this passage by itself suggests a de novo standard, it is not easily reconciled with Justice Frankfurter's later statement that \u00aathere is no need for the federal judge, if he could, toshut his eyes to the State consideration\u00ba of the mixed question, id.,at 508. These statements can be reconciled, of course, on the assumption that thehabeas judge must review the state-court determination for reasonable-ness. But we need not attempt to defend that conclusion in detail, for505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:46 PAGES OPINPGT 289 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. In subsequent cases, we repeatedly reaf\u00aermed Brown 's teaching that mixed constitutional questions are \u00aaopen to re-view on collateral attack,\u00ba Cuyler v.Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 342 (1980), without ever explicitly considering whether that\u00aareview\u00ba should be de novo or deferential. In some of these cases, we would have denied habeas relief even under de novo review, see, e. g., Strickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 698 (1984) (facts make it \u00aaclear\u00ba that habeas petitionerdid not receive ineffective assistance of counsel); Neil v.Big- gers, 409 U. S. 188, 201 (1972) (facts disclose \u00aano substantial likelihood\u00ba that habeas petitioner was subjected to unreliablepretrial lineup); in others, we would have awarded habeasrelief even under deferential review, see, e. g., Brewer v.Wil- liams, 430 U. S. 387, 405 (1977) (facts provide \u00aano reasonable basis\u00ba for \u00aending valid waiver of right to counsel); Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 725 (1961) (facts show \u00aaclear and con- vincing\u00ba evidence of biased jury); and in yet others, we re-manded for application of a proper legal rule without ad-dressing that standard of review question, see, e. g., Cuyler, supra, at 342, 350. Nonetheless, because these cases never quali\u00aeed our early citation of Brown for the proposition that a federal habeas court must reexamine mixed constitutional questions \u00aaindependently,\u00ba Townsend v.Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 318 (1963) (dictum), we have gradually come to treat as set-tled the rule that mixed constitutional questions are \u00aasubjectto plenary federal review\u00ba on habeas, Miller v.Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 112 (1985). 6 we conclude not that Brown v.Allen establishes deferential review for reasonableness, but only that Brown does not squarely foreclose it. 6We have no disagreement with Justice O\u0092Connor that Brown v.Allen quickly came to be cited for the proposition that a habeas court shouldreview mixed questions \u00aaindependently\u00ba; that several of our cases sinceBrown have applied a de novo standard with respect to pure and mixed legal questions; and that the de novo standard thus appeared well settled with respect to both categories by the time the Court decided Miller v. Fenton in 1985. See post, at 301\u00b1302. Despite her extended discussion of the leading cases from Brown through Miller, however, Justice O\u0092Con-505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 290 WRIGHT v.WEST Opinion of Thomas, J. Jackson itself contributed to this trend. There, we held that a conviction violates due process if supported only byevidence from which \u00aano rational trier of fact could \u00aend guiltbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u00ba 443 U. S., at 317. We statedexplicitly that a state-court judgment applying the Jackson rule in a particular case \u00aais of course entitled to deference\u00baon federal habeas. Id.,at 323; also , J., concurring in judgment) (\u00aaState judges are more familiar with the elements of state offenses than are federal judges and should be better able to evaluate suf\u00aeciencyclaims\u00ba). Notwithstanding these principles, however, wethen indicated that the habeas court itself should apply theJackson rule, see id.,at 324, rather than merely reviewing the state courts' application of it for reasonableness. Ulti-mately, though, we had no occasion to resolve our con\u00afictingstatements on the standard of review question, because weconcluded that the habeas petitioner was not entitled torelief even under our own de novo application of Jackson. See id.,at 324\u00b1326. 7 nor offers nothing to refute those of our limited observations with which she evidently disagrees\u00d0that an unadorned citation to Brown should not have been enough, at least as an original matter, to establish de novo review with respect to mixed questions; and that in none of our leadingcases was the choice between a de novo and a deferential standard out- come determinative. 7Justice O\u0092Connor asserts rejected\u00ba a standard of review\u00ba that she characterizes as \u00aavery much like theone\u00ba urged on us by petitioners. Post, at 303 (citing 443 U. S., at 323). What Jackson expressly rejected, however, was a proposal that habeas review \u00aashould be foreclosed\u00ba if the state courts provide \u00aaappellate reviewof the suf\u00aeciency of the evidence.\u00ba Ibid. That rule, of course, would per- mit nohabeas review of a state-court suf\u00aeciency determination. As we understand it, however, petitioners' proposal would permit limited reviewfor reasonableness, a standard surely consistent with our own statementthat that state-court determination \u00aais of course entitled to deference.\u00baIbid. We agree with Justice O\u0092Connor that Jackson itself applied a de novo standard. See post, at 303. Nonetheless, given our statement505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 291 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. Despite our apparent adherence to a standard of de novo habeas review with respect to mixed constitutional ques-tions, we have implicitly questioned that standard, at leastwith respect to pure legal questions, in our recent retroactiv- ity precedents. In Penry v.Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313\u00b1314 (1989), a majority of this Court endorsed the retroactivityanalysis advanced by Justice O\u0092Connor for a plurality in Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Under Teague, a ha- beas petitioner generally cannot bene\u00aet from a new rule ofcriminal procedure announced after his conviction has be-come \u00aenal on direct appeal. See id.,at , J.). Teague de\u00aened a \u00aanew\u00ba rule as one that was \u00aanot dictated by precedent existing at the time the defend- ant's conviction became \u00aenal.\u00ba Id.,at 301 (emphasis in origi- nal). In Butler v.McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990), we explained that the de\u00aenition includes all rules \u00aasusceptibleto debate among reasonable minds.\u00ba Thus, if a state courthas reasonably rejected the legal claim asserted by a habeaspetitioner under existing law, then the claim seeks the bene-\u00aet of a \u00aanew\u00ba rule under Butler, and is therefore not cogniza- ble on habeas under Teague. In other words, a federal ha- beas court \u00aamust defer to the state court's decision rejectingthe claim unless that decision is patently unreasonable.\u00baButler, supra, at 422 (Brennan, J., dissenting). 8 expressly endorsing a notion of at least limited deference, and given that theJackson petitioner would have lost under either a de novo standard or a reasonableness standard, we cannot agree that the case \u00aaexpresslyrejected\u00ba the latter. Post, at 303. 8Justice O\u0092Connor suggests that Teague and its progeny \u00aadid not es- tablish a standard of review at all.\u00ba Post, at 303\u00b1304. Instead, she con- tends, these cases merely prohibit the retroactive application of new ruleson habeas, ibid., and establish the criterion for distinguishing new rules from old ones, ibid. We have no dif\u00aeculty with describing Teague as a case about retroactivity, rather than standards of review, although we donot dispute Justice O\u0092Connor 's suggestion that the difference, at least in practice, might well be \u00aaonly `a matter of phrasing.' \u00ba Post, 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT WRIGHT v.WEST Opinion of Thomas, J. Teague was premised on the view that retroactivity ques- tions in habeas corpus proceedings must take account of thenature and function of the writ, which we described as \u00aa `acollateral remedy . . . not designed as a substitute for direct review.' \u00ba 489 U. S., at 306 (opinion of O\u0092Connor , J.) (quot- ingMackey v.United States, 401 U. S. 667, 682\u00b1683 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissentingin part)) (emphasis in Mackey ).Justice Stevens reasoned similarly in Jackson, where he stressed that habeas corpus \u00aais not intended as a substitute for appeal, nor as a devicefor reviewing the merits of guilt determinations at criminaltrials,\u00ba but only \u00aato guard against extreme malfunctions inthe state criminal justice systems.\u00ba 443 U. S., at 332, n. 5(opinion concurring in judgment); see also Greer v.Miller, 483 U. S. 756, 768\u00b1769 (1987) ( Stevens , J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, the notion that different standardsshould apply on direct and collateral review runs throughout our recent habeas jurisprudence. We have said, for exam-ple, that new rules always have retroactive application to tion omitted). We do disagree, however, with Justice O\u0092Connor 's de\u00aeni- tion of what constitutes a \u00aanew rule\u00ba for Teague purposes. A rule is new, she contends, if it \u00aacan be meaningfully distinguished from that estab-lished by binding precedent at the time [the] state court conviction became\u00aenal.\u00ba Post, at 304. This de\u00aenition leads her to suggest that a habeas court must determine whether the state courts have interpreted old prece-dents \u00aaproperly.\u00ba Post, at 305. Our precedents, however, require a dif- ferent standard. We have held that a rule is \u00aanew\u00ba for Teague purposes whenever its validity under existing precedents is subject to debate among\u00aareasonable minds,\u00ba Butler, 494 U. S., at 415, or among \u00aareasonable ju- rists,\u00ba Sawyer v.Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990). Indeed, each of our last four relevant precedents has indicated that Teague insulates on habeas review the 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990) (citing Butler ); see Stringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 237 (1992) (\u00aaThe purpose of the new rule doctrine is to validate rea-sonable interpretations of existing precedents\u00ba). Thus, Teague bars habeas relief whenever the state courts have interpreted old precedentsreasonably, not only when they have done so \u00aaproperly.\u00ba Post, at 305.505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 293 Cite as: 505 U.

We have held that the Constitution guarantees the right to counsel on a \u00aerst direct appeal, see, e. g., Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 355\u00b1358 (1963), but that it guaran- tees no right to counsel on habeas, see, e. g., Pennsylvania v.Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555 (1987). On direct review, we have announced and enforced the rule that state courts mustexclude evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amend- ment. See, e. g., Mapp v.Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 654\u00b1660 (1961). We have also held, however, that claims under Mapp are not cognizable on habeas as long as the state courts have pro-vided a full and fair opportunity to litigate them at trial oron direct review. See Stone v.Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 489\u00b1 496 (1976). These differences simply re\u00afect the fact that habeas re- view \u00aaentails signi\u00aecant costs.\u00ba Engle v.Isaac, 456 U. S. things, \u00aa `[i]t disturbs theState's signi\u00aecant interest in repose for concluded litigation,denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders,and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched byfew exercises of federal judicial authority.' \u00ba Duckworth v.

In various contexts, we have emphasizedthat these costs, as well as the counterva iling bene\u00aets, must be taken into consideration in de\u00aening the scope of the writ.See, e. g., Coleman v.Thompson, 501 U.

(successive petitions); Stone v.Powell, supra, 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 294 WRIGHT v.WEST Opinion of Thomas, J. In light of these principles, petitioners ask that we recon- sider our statement in Miller v.Fenton that mixed constitu- tional questions are \u00aasubject to plenary federal review\u00ba onhabeas, 474 U. S., at 112. By its terms, Teague itself is not directly contro lling, because West sought federal habeas re- lief under Jackson, which was decided a year before his con- viction became \u00aenal on direct review. Nonetheless, peti-tioners contend, the logic of Teague makes our statement inMiller untenable. Petitioners argue that if deferential review for reasonableness strikes an appropriate balancewith respect to purely legal claims, then it must strike anappropriate balance with respect to mixed questions as well.Moreover, they note that under the habeas statute itself, astate-court determination of a purely factual question mustbe \u00aapresumed correct,\u00ba and can be overcome only by \u00aacon-vincing evidence,\u00ba unless one of eight statutorily enumeratedexceptions is present. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d). It makes nosense, petitioners assert, for a habeas court generally to re-view factual determinations and legal determinations defer-entially, but to review applications of law to fact de novo. Finally, petitioners \u00aend the prospect of deferential reviewfor mixed questions at least implicit in our recent statementthat Teague concerns are fully implicated \u00aaby the applica- tion of an old rule in a manner that was not dictated by precedent.\u00ba Stringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 228 (1992) (em- phasis added). For these reasons, petitioners invite us toreaf\u00aerm that a habeas judge need not\u00d0and indeed maynot\u00d0\u00aashut his eyes\u00ba entirely to state-court applications oflaw to fact. Brown v.Allen, 344 U. S., at 508 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). West develops two principal counterargu-ments: \u00aerst, that Congress implicitly codi\u00aeed a de novo standard with respect to mixed constitutional questionswhen it amended the habeas statute in 1966; and second, that505us1102N 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 295 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Opinion of Thomas, J. de novo federal review is necessary to vindicate federal con- stitutional rights.9 We need not decide such far-reaching issues in this case. As in both Brown and Jackson, the claim advanced by the habeas petitioner must fail even assuming that the statecourt's rejection of it should be reconsidered de novo. Whatever the appropriate standard of review, we concludethat there was more than enough evidence to supportWest's conviction. The case against West was strong. Two to four weeks after the Cardova home had been burglarized, over 15 of theitems stolen were recovered from West's home. On directexamination at trial, West said nothing more than that hefrequently bought and sold items at different \u00afea markets.He failed to offer speci\u00aec information about how he had cometo acquire any of the stolen items, and he did not even men-tion Ronnie Elkins by name. When pressed on cross-examination about the details of his purchases, West contra-dicted himself repeatedly about where he supposedly hadbought the stolen goods, and he gave vague, seemingly eva- 9Justice O\u0092Connor criticizes our failure to highlight in text the fact that Congress has considered, but failed to enact, several bills introducedduring the last 25 years to prohibit de novo review explicitly. See post, at 305; see also Brief for Senator Biden et al. as Amici Curiae 10\u00b116 (discussing various proposals). Our task, however, is not to construe billsthat Congress has failed to enact, but to construe statutes that Congresshas enacted. The habeas corpus statute was last amended in 1966. See80 Stat. 1104\u00b11105. We have grave doubts that post-1966 legislative his-tory is of any value in construing its provisions, for we have often ob-served that \u00aa `the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basisfor inferring the intent of an earlier one.' \u00ba Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v.GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.

He said further that he could not remember how he had ac-quired such major household items as a television set and acoffee table, and he failed to offer any explanation whatso-ever about how he had acquired Cardova's record player,among other things. Moreover, he testi\u00aeed that he had ac-quired Cardova's second television set from a seller otherthan Elkins (who remained unidenti\u00aeed) in an entirely unre-lated (but roughly contemporaneous) transaction. Finally,he failed to produce any other supporting evidence, such astestimony from Elkins, whom he claimed to have known for years and done business with on a regular basis. As the trier of fact, the jury was entitled to disbelieve West's uncorroborated and confused testimony. In evaluat-ing that testimony, moreover, the jury was entitled to dis-count West's credibility on account of his prior felony con-viction, see Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 19.2\u00b1269 (1990); Sadoski v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 1069, 254 S. E. 2d 100 (1979), and to take into account West's demeanor when testifying, whichneither the Court of Appeals nor we may review. And if thejury did disbelieve West, it was further entitled to considerwhatever it concluded to be perjured testimony as af\u00aerma-tive evidence of guilt, see, e. g., Wilson v.United States, 162 U. S. 613, 620\u00b1621 (1896); United States v.Za\u00aero, 945 F. 2d 881, 888 (CA7 1991) (Posner, J.), cert. granted on othergrounds, 503 U.

S., at 319 (emphasis inoriginal); that the prosecution need not af\u00aermatively \u00aaruleout every hypothesis except that of guilt,\u00ba id.,at 326; and that a reviewing court \u00aafaced with a record of historical factsthat supports S. 277 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment it does not af\u00aermatively appear in the record\u00d0that the trier of fact resolved any such con\u00aficts in favor of the prosecution,and must defer to that resolution,\u00ba ibid. Under these stand- ards, we think it clear that the trial record contained suf\u00ae-cient evidence to support West's conviction. Having granted relief on West's Jackson claim, the Court of Appeals declined to address West's additional claim thathe was entitled to a new trial, as a matter of due process, onthe basis of newly discovered evidence. See 931 F. 2d, at271, n. 9. As that claim is not properly before us, we declineto address it here. The judgment of the Court of Appealsis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice White , concurring in the judgment. Jackson v.Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), required the fed- eral courts to deny the requested writ of habeas corpus if, under the Jackson standard, there was suf\u00aecient evidence to support West's conviction, which, as the principal opinionamply demonstrates, see ante, at 295\u00b1296 and this page, there certainly was. Justice O\u0092Connor , with whom Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens join, concurring in the judgment. I agree that the evidence suf\u00aeciently supported respond- ent's conviction. I write separately only to express dis-agreement with certain statements in Justice Thomas ' extended discussion, ante, at 285\u00b1295, of this Court's habeas corpus jurisprudence. First, Justice Thomas errs in describing the pre-1953 law of habeas corpus. Ante, at 285. While it is true that a state prisoner could not obtain the writ if he had been pro-vided a full and fair hearing in the state courts, this rulegoverned the merits of a claim under the Due ProcessClause. It was not a threshold bar to the consideration of505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 298 WRIGHT v.WEST O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment other federal claims, because, with rare exceptions, there were no other federal claims available at the time. During the period Justice Thomas discusses, the guarantees of the Bill of Rights were not yet understood to apply in state crim-inal prosecutions. The only protections the Constitutionafforded to state prisoners were those for which the textof the Constitution explicitly limited the authority of theStates, most notably the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment. And in the area of criminal procedure,the Due Process Clause was understood to guarantee nomore than a full and fair hearing in the state courts. See, e. g., Ponzi v.Fessenden, 258 U. S. 254, 260 (1922) (\u00aaOne ac- cused of crime has a right to a full and fair trial according tothe law of the government whose sovereignty he is allegedto have offended, but he has no more than that\u00ba). Thus, when the Court stated that a state prisoner who had been afforded a full and fair hearing could not obtain a writof habeas corpus, the Court was propounding a rule of consti-tutional law, not a threshold requirement of habeas corpus.This is evident from the fact that the Court did not just applythis rule on habeas, but also in cases on direct review. See,e. g., Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 107\u00b1108 (1934) (\u00aa[T]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due processto the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwartedby his absence, and to that extent only\u00ba); Twining v.New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 110\u00b1111 (1908) (\u00aaDue process requires that the court which assumes to determine the rights of par-ties shall have jurisdiction, and that there shall be notice andopportunity for hearing given the parties. Subject to thesetwo fundamental conditions ,...t h i s court has up to this time sustained all state laws, statutory or judicially declared,regulating procedure, evidence and methods of trial, and heldthem to be consistent with due process of law\u00ba) (citationsomitted). As long as a state criminal prosecution was fairlyconducted by a court of competent jurisdiction according tostate law, no constitutional question was presented, whether505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 299 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment on direct orhabeas review. Caldwell v.Texas, 137 U. S. 692, 698 (1891); Brown v.New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172, 175 (1899). The cases cited by Justice Thomas \u00d0Moore v.Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923), and Frank v.Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915)\u00d0demonstrate that the absence of a full and fair hear-ing in the state courts was itself the relevant violation of the Constitution; it was not a prerequisite to a federal court'sconsideration of some other federal claim. Both cases heldthat a trial dominated by an angry mob was inconsistentwith due process. In both, the Court recognized that theState could nevertheless afford due process if the state ap- pellate courts provided a fair opportunity to correct theerror. The state courts had provided such an opportunityinFrank; inMoore, they had not. In neither case is the \u00aafull and fair hearing\u00ba rule cited as a deferential standard ofreview applicable to habeas cases; the rule instead de\u00aenesthe constitutional claim itself, which was reviewed de novo. See Moore, supra, at 91\u00b192. Second, Justice Thomas quotes Justice Powell's opinion inKuhlmann v.Wilson, 477 U. S. 436 (1986), out of context. Ante, at 285\u00b1286. Justice Powell said only that the judg- ment of a committing court of competent jurisdiction wasaccorded \u00aaabsolute respect\u00ba on habeas in the 19th century,when the habeas inquiry was limited to the jurisdiction ofthe court. Kuhlmann, supra, at 446 (opinion of Powell, J.). Justice Powell was not expressing the erroneous view whichJustice Thomas today ascribes to him, that state court judgments were entitled to complete deference before 1953. Third, Justice Thomas errs in implying that Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), was the \u00aerst case in which the Court held that the doctrine of res judicata is not strictlyfollowed on federal habeas. Ante, at 287. In fact, the Court explicitly reached this holding for the \u00aerst time in Salinger v.Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924). Even Salinger did not break new ground: The Salinger Court observed that such had been the rule at common law, and that the Court had505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 300 WRIGHT v.WEST O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment implicitly followed it in Carter v.McClaughry, 183 U. S. 365, 378 (1902), and Ex parte Spencer, 228 U. S. 652, 658 (1913). Salinger, supra, at 230. The Court reached the same con- clusion in at least two other cases between Salinger and Brown. See Waley v.Johnston, 316 U. S. 101, 105 (1942); Darr v.Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 214 (1950). Darr and Spen- cer, like this case, involved the initial federal habeas \u00aelings of state prisoners. Fourth, Justice Thomas understates the certainty with which Brown v.Allen rejected a deferential standard of re- view of issues of law. Ante, at 287\u00b1288. The passages in which the Brown Court stated that a district court should determine whether the state adjudication had resulted in a\u00aasatisfactory conclusion,\u00ba and that the federal courts had dis-cretion to give some weight to state court determinations,ante, at 287, were passages in which the Court was discussing how federal courts should resolve questions of fact, not is- sues of law. This becomes apparent from a reading of the rel-evant section of Brown, 344 U. S., at 460\u00b1465, a section enti- tled \u00aaRight to a Plenary Hearing.\u00ba When the Court thenturned to the primary legal question presented\u00d0whether the Fourteenth Amendment permitted the restriction of juryservice to taxpayers\u00d0the Court answered that question in theaf\u00aermative without any hint of deference to the state courts.Id.,at 467\u00b1474. The proper standard of review of issues of law was also discussed in Justice Frankfurter's opinion,which a majority of the Court endorsed. After recognizingthat state court fact\u00aending need not always be repeated infederal court, Justice Frankfurter turned to the quite differ-ent question of determining the law. He wrote: \u00aaWhere theascertainment of the historical facts does not dispose of theclaim but calls for interpretation of the legal signi\u00aecance ofsuch facts, the District Judge must exercise his own judg- ment on this blend of facts and their legal values. Thus, so- called mixed questions or the application of constitutionalprinciples to the facts as found leave the duty of adjudication505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 301 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment with the federal judge.\u00ba Id., at 507 added; cita- tion omitted). Justice Frankfurter concluded: \u00aaThe Statecourt cannot have the last say when it, though on fair consid-eration and what procedurally may be deemed fairness, mayhave misconceived a federal constitutional right.\u00ba Id., at 508. Fifth, Justice Thomas incorrectly states that we have never considered the standard of review to apply to mixedquestions of law and fact raised on federal habeas. Ante, at 289. On the contrary, we did so in the very cases cited byJustice Thomas .I n Irvin v.Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 (1961), we stated quite clearly that \u00aa `mixed questions or the applica-tion of constitutional principles to the facts as found leavethe duty of adjudication with the federal judge.' It was,therefore, the duty of the Court of Appeals to independentlyevaluate [the issue of jury prejudice].\u00ba Id.,at 723 (quoting Brown v.Allen, supra, at 507 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)). We then proceeded to employ precisely the same legal analy-sis as in cases on direct appeal. 366 U. S., at 723\u00b1728. InTownsend v.Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), we again said that \u00aa[a]lthough the district judge may, where the state courthas reliably found the relevant facts, defer to the statecourt's \u00aendings of fact, he may not defer to its \u00aendings oflaw. It is the district judge's duty to apply the applicablefederal law to the state court fact \u00aendings independently.\u00baId.,at 318. InNeil v.Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), we addressed de novo the question whether the state court pretrial identi- \u00aecation procedures were unconstitutionally suggestive byusing the same standard used in cases on direct appeal: \u00aa `avery substantial likelihood of irreparable misidenti\u00aecation.' \u00baId., at 198 (quoting Simmons v.United States, 390 U. S. 377, 384 (1968)). InBrewer v.Williams, 430 U. S. 387 (1977), we reviewed de novo a state court's \u00aending that a defendant had waived his right to counsel. We held that \u00aathe question of waiver505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 302 WRIGHT v.WEST O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment was not a question of historical fact, but one which, in the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, requires `application ofconstitutional principles to the facts as found . . .' \u00ba Id.,a t 403 supra, at 507 (opinion of Frank- furter, J.)). We then employed the same legal analysis usedon direct review. 430 U. S., at 404. InCuyler v.Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), we explicitly considered the question whether the Court of Appeals hadexceeded the proper scope of review of the state court's deci-sion. Id., at 341. We concluded that because the issue pre- sented was not one of historical fact entitled to a presump-tion of correctness under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d), the Court ofAppeals was correct in reconsidering the state court's \u00aaappli-cation of legal principles to the historical facts of this case.\u00ba446 U. S., at 342. Although we held that the Court of Ap- peals had erred in stating the proper legal principle, we re-manded to have it consider the case under the same legalprinciples as in cases on direct review. Id., at 345\u00b1350. InStrickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we held that \u00aa[t]he principles governing ineffectiveness claims shouldapply in federal collateral proceedings as they do on directappeal or in motions for a new trial. . . . [N]o special stand-ards ought to claims made in ha-beas proceedings.\u00ba Id.,at 697\u00b1698. We distinguished state court determinations of mixed questions of fact and law, towhich federal courts should not defer, from state court \u00aend-ings of historical fact, to which federal courts should defer.Id.,at 698. Finally, in Miller v.Fenton, 474 U. S. 104 (1985), we recog- nized that \u00aaan unbroken line of cases, coming to this Courtboth on direct appeal and on review of applications to lowerfederal courts for a writ of habeas corpus, forecloses theCourt of Appeals' conclusion that the `voluntariness' of independent 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 303 U. S. 277 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment To this list of cases cited by Justice Thomas , one could add the following, all of which applied a standard of de novo review. Leyra v.Denno, 347 U. S. 556, 558\u00b1561 (1954); United States ex rel. Jennings v.Ragen, 358 U. S. 276, 277 (1959); Rogers v.Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 546 (1961); Gideon v.Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 339\u00b1345 (1963); Pate U. S. U. S. 218, 432 U. S. 412, U. S. U. S. 356, 360\u00b1365 (1988); Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 201\u00b1205 (1989). There have been many others. Sixth, Justice Thomas misdescribes Jackson v.Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). Ante, at 290. In Jackson, the re- spondents proposed a deferential standard of review, verymuch like the one Justice Thomas discusses today, that they thought appropriate for addressing constitutionalclaims of insuf\u00aecient evidence. 443 U. S., at 323. We ex-pressly rejected this proposal. Ibid. Instead, we adhered to the general rule of de novo review of constitutional claims on habeas. Id.,at 324. Seventh, Justice Thomas mischaracterizes Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and Penry v.Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989), as \u00aaquestion[ing] th[e] standard [of de novo re- view] with respect to pure legal questions.\u00ba Ante, at 291. Teague did not establish a \u00aadeferential\u00ba standard of review of state court determinations of federal law. It did not es-505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 304 WRIGHT v.WEST O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment tablish a standard of review at all. Instead, Teague simply requires that a state conviction on federal habeas be judgedaccording to the law in existence when the conviction be-came \u00aenal. Penry, supra, at 314; Teague, supra, at 301. In Teague, we refused to give state prisoners the retroactive bene\u00aet of new rules of law, but we did notcreate any defer- ential standard of review with regard to old rules. To determine what counts as a new rule, Teague requires courts to ask whether the rule a habeas petitioner seeks canbe meaningfully distinguished from that established by bind-ing precedent at the time his state court conviction became \u00aenal. Cf. Mackey v.United States, 401 U. S. 667, 695 (1971) (inquiry is \u00aato determine whether a particular decision hasreally announced a `new' rule at all or whether it has simplyapplied a well-established constitutional principle to governa case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law\u00ba) (Harlan, J., con- curring in judgments in part and dissenting in part) (internalquotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Even thoughwe have characterized the new rule inquiry as whether \u00aarea-sonable jurists\u00ba could disagree as to whether a result is dic-tated by precedent, see Sawyer v.Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990), the standard for determining when a case establishesa new rule is \u00aaobjective,\u00ba and the mere existence of con\u00afict-ing authority does not necessarily mean a rule is new.Stringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 237 (1992). If a proffered factual distinction between the case under consideration andpre-existing precedent does not change the force with whichthe precedent's underlying principle applies, the distinctionis not meaningful, and any deviation from precedent is notreasonable. So, while Justice Thomas says that we \u00aadefer\u00ba to state courts' determinations of federal law, the statement is mis-leading. Although in practice, it may seem only \u00aaa matterof phrasing\u00ba whether one calls the Teague inquiry a standard of review or not, \u00aaphrasing mirrors thought, [and] it is impor-505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 305 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment tant that the phrasing not obscure the true issue before a federal court.\u00ba Brown v.Allen, 344 U. S., at 501 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). As Justice Kennedy convincingly dem- onstrates, the duty of the federal court in evaluating whethera rule is \u00aanew\u00ba is not the same as deference; federal courtsmust make an independent evaluation of the precedent exist-ing at the time the state conviction became \u00aenal in order todetermine whether the case under consideration is meaning-fully distinguishable. Teague does not direct federal courts to spend less time or effort scrutinizing the existing federallaw, on the ground that they can assume the state courts interpreted it properly. Eighth, though Justice Thomas suggests otherwise, ante, at 293, de novo review is not incompatible with the maxim that federal courts should \u00aagive great weight to the consid-ered conclusions of a coequal state judiciary,\u00ba Miller v.Fen- ton, 474 U. S., at 112, just as they do to persuasive, well- reasoned authority from district or circuit courts in otherjurisdictions. A state court opinion concerning the legal im-plications of precisely the same set of facts is the closest onecan get to a \u00aacase on point,\u00ba and is especially valuable forthat reason. But this does not mean that we have held inthe past that federal courts must presume the correctness ofa state court's legal conclusions on habeas, or that a statecourt's incorrect legal determination has ever been allowedto stand because it was reasonable. We have always heldthat federal courts, even on habeas, have an independent ob-ligation to say what the law is. Finally, in his one-sentence summary of respondent's argu- ments, ante, at 294, Justice Thomas fails to mention that Congress has considered habeas corpus legislation during 27of the past 37 years, and on 13 occasions has consideredadopting a deferential standard of review along the lines sug-gested by Justice Thomas . Congress has rejected each proposal. In light of the case law and Congress' position, amove away from de novo review of mixed questions of law505us1102J 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 306 WRIGHT v.WEST Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and fact would be a substantial change in our construction of the authority conferred by the habeas corpus statute. AsJustice Thomas acknowledges, to change the standard of review would indeed be \u00aafar-reaching,\u00ba ante, at 295, and we need not decide whether to do so in order to resolve this case. Justice Kennedy , concurring in the judgment. I do not enter the debate about the reasons that took us to the point where mixed constitutional questions are subjecttode novo review in federal habeas corpus proceedings. Whatever the answer to that dif\u00aecult historical inquiry, allagree that, at least prior to the Court's adoption of the retro-activity analysis of Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), see Penry v.Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313\u00b1314 (1989), the matter was settled. It seems that the real issue dividing my col- leagues is whether the retroactivity analysis of Teague casts doubt upon the rule of Miller v.Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 112 (1985). Even petitioner State of Virginia and the UnitedStates as amicus curiae, both seeking a deferential standard with respect to mixed questions, recognize that this is howthe standard of review question arises. See Brief for Peti-tioners 11 (\u00aaThe notion that a state prisoner has a right tode novo federal collateral review of his constitutional claims . . . surely has not survived this Court's decisions in Teague \u00ba and its progeny); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12 (\u00aaPrior to the rule established by Teague [and later cases applying Teague ], this Court often treated mixed questions of law and fact as subject to independent review in federalhabeas corpus\u00ba). If vindication of the principles underlying Teague did re- quire that state-court rulings on mixed questions must begiven deference in a federal habeas proceeding, then indeedit might be said that the Teague line of cases is on a collision course with the Miller v.Fenton line. And in the proper case we would have to select one at the expense of the other.But in my view neither the purpose for which Teague was505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 307 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment adopted nor the necessary means for implementing its hold- ing creates any real con\u00afict with the requirement of de novo review of mixed questions. In my view, it would be a misreading of Teague to inter- pret it as resting on the necessity to defer to state-court de-terminations. Teague did not establish a deferential stand- ard of review of state-court decisions of federal law. Itestablished instead a principle of retroactivity. See Teague v.Lane, supra, at 310 (\u00aa[W]e now adopt Justice Harlan's view of retroactivity for cases on collateral review\u00ba). To besure, the fact that our standard for distinguishing old rulesfrom new ones turns on the reasonableness of a state court'sinterpretation of then existing precedents suggests that fed-eral courts do in one sense defer to state-court determina-tions. But we should not lose sight of the purpose of thereasonableness inquiry where a Teague issue is raised: The purpose is to determine whether application of a new rulewould upset a conviction that was obtained in accordancewith the constitutional interpretations existing at the timeof the prisoner's conviction. As we explained earlier this Term: \u00aaWhen a petitioner seeks federal habeas relief based upon a principle announced after a \u00aenal judgment,Teague and our subsequent decisions interpreting it re- quire a federal court to answer an initial question, andin some cases a second. First, it must be determinedwhether the decision relied upon announced a new rule.If the answer is yes and neither exception applies, thedecision is not available to the petitioner. If, however,the decision did not announce a new rule, it is necessaryto inquire whether granting the relief sought would cre-ate a new rule because the prior decision is applied ina novel setting, thereby extending the precedent. Theinterests in \u00aenality, predictability, and comity underly-ing our new rule jurisprudence may be undermined toan equal degree by the invocation of a rule that was not505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 308 WRIGHT v.WEST Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment dictated by precedent as by the application of an old rule in a manner that was not dictated by precedent.\u00baStringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 227\u00b1228 (1992) (citation omitted). The comity interest is not, however, in saying that since the question is close the state-court decision ought to be deemedcorrect because we are in no better position to judge. Thatwould be the real thrust of a principle based on deference.We see that principle at work in the statutory requirementthat, except in limited circumstances, the federal habeascourt must presume the correctness of state-court factual\u00aendings. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(d). See also Rushen v. Spain, 464 U. S. 114, 120 (1983) (per curiam) (noting that \u00aathe state courts were in a far better position than the fed-eral courts to answer\u00ba a factual question). Deference of thiskind may be termed a comity interest, but it is not the com-ity interest that underlies Teague. The comity interest served by Teague is in not subjecting the States to a regime in which \u00aenality is undermined by our changing a rule oncethought correct but now understood to be de\u00aecient on itsown terms. It is in recognition of this principle that we askwhether the decision in question was dictated by precedent.See, e. g., Saf\u00afe v.Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990). Teague does bear on applications of law to fact which re- sult in the announcement of a new rule. Whether the pris-oner seeks the application of an old rule in a novel setting,seeStringer, supra, at 228, depends in large part on the na- ture of the rule. If the rule in question is one which of ne-cessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence,then we can tolerate a number of speci\u00aec applications with-out saying that those applications themselves create a newrule. The rule of Jackson v.Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), is an example. By its very terms it provides a generalstandard which calls for some examination of the facts. Thestandard is whether any rational trier of fact could havefound guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after a review of all505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 309 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment the evidence, so of course there will be variations from case to case. Where the beginning point is a rule of this generalapplication, a rule designed for the speci\u00aec purpose of evalu-ating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequentcase that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule,one not dictated by precedent. Although as a general matter \u00aanew rules will not be ap- plied or announced\u00ba in habeas proceedings, Penry, 492 U. S., at 313, there is no requirement that we engage in the thresh-oldTeague inquiry in a case in which it is clear that the prisoner would not be entitled to the relief he seeks even if his case were pending on direct review. See Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990). Therefore, it is not neces- sary to the resolution of this case to consider the oddity thatreversing respondent's conviction because of the quite fact-speci\u00aec determination that there was insuf\u00aecient evidencewould have the arguable effect of undercutting the well-established general principle in Virginia and elsewhere thatthe trier of fact may infer theft from unexplained or falselydenied possession of recently stolen goods. Whether a hold-ing that there was insuf\u00aecient evidence would constitute oneof those unusual cases in which an application of Jackson would create a new rule need not be addressed. On these premises, the existence of Teague provides added justi\u00aecation for retaining de novo review, not a reason to abandon it. Teague gives substantial assurance that habeas proceedings will not use a new rule to upset a state convic-tion that conformed to rules then existing. With this safe-guard in place, recognizing the importance of \u00aenality, de novo review can be exercised within its proper sphere. For the foregoing reasons, I would not interpret Teague as calling into question the settled principle that mixed ques- tions are subject to plenary review on federal habeas corpus.And, for the reasons I have mentioned, I do not think it nec-essary to consider whether the respondent brings one ofthose unusual Jackson claims which is Teague -barred.505us1102L 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 310 WRIGHT v.WEST Souter, J., concurring in judgment I agree that the evidence in this case was suf\u00aecient to con- vince a rational fact\u00aender of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;and I concur in the judgment of the Court. Justice Souter , concurring in the judgment. While I could not disagree with the majority that suf\u00aecient evidence supported West's conviction, see, e. g., ante, at 295\u00b1 297, I do not think the Court should reach that issue. Wehave often said that when the principles \u00aerst developed inTeague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), pose a threshold ques- tion on federal habeas review, it is only after an answerfavorable to the prisoner that a court should address themerits. See, e. g., Collins v.Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 40\u00b141 (1990); 302, 313, 329 (1989); Teague, supra, at 300 (plurality opinion). This habeas case begins with a Teague question, and its answer does not favor West. I would go no further. 1 I Under cases in the line of Teague v.Lane, supra, with two narrow exceptions not here relevant, federal courts conduct-ing collateral review may not announce or apply a \u00aanew\u00ba rulefor a state prisoner's bene\u00aet, 407, 412 (1990); Teague, supra, at 310 (plurality opinion), a new rule being one that was \u00aanot `dictated by precedent ex- isting at the time the defendant's conviction became \u00aenal,' \u00baSawyer v.Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990) (quoting Teague, supra, at 301 (plurality opinion)) (emphasis in original). Put differently, the new-rule enquiry asks \u00aawhether a state courtconsidering [the prisoner's] claim at the time his convictionbecame \u00aenal would have felt compelled by existing precedentto conclude that the rule [the prisoner] seeks was requiredby Constitution.\u00ba Saf\u00afe v.Parks, 494 U.

Or, put differently yet again, if \u00aareasonable jurists [might have] disagree[d]\u00ba about the steps the law would takenext, its later development will not be grounds for relief.Sawyer v.Smith, supra, at 234; see also Butler, supra, at 415 (\u00aasusceptible to debate among reasonable minds\u00ba). The Teague line of cases re\u00afects recognition of important \u00aainterests of comity and \u00aenality.\u00ba Teague, supra, at 308 (plurality opinion). One purpose of federal collateral reviewof judgments rendered by state courts in criminal cases isto create an incentive for state courts to \u00aa ` \u00aaconduct theirproceedings in a manner consistent with recognizes that purpose by \u00aavalidat[ing] reasonable,good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made bystate courts even though they are shown to be contrary tolater decisions.\u00ba Butler, supra, at 414 (citing United States v.Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 918\u00b1919 (1984)). The crux of the analysis when Teague is invoked, then, is identi\u00aecation of the rule on which the claim for habeas reliefdepends. To survive Teague, it must be \u00aaold\u00ba enough to have predated the \u00aenality of the prisoner's conviction, andspeci\u00aec enough to dictate the rule on which the convictionmay be held to be unlawful. A rule old enough for Teague may of course be too general, and while identifying the re-quired age of the rule of relief is a simple matter of compar-ing dates, passing on its requisite speci\u00aecity calls for analyti-cal care. The proper response to a prisoner's invocation of a rule at too high a level of generality is well illustrated by our cases.InButler, supra, for example, the prisoner relied on the rule ofArizona v.Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988), which we an- nounced after Butler's conviction had become \u00aenal. We heldinRoberson that the Fifth Amendment forbids police inter- rogation about a crime after the suspect requests counsel,even if his request occurs in the course of investigating a505us1102M 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 312 WRIGHT v.WEST Souter, J., concurring in judgment different, unrelated crime. Id.,at 682. Butler argued that he could invoke Roberson 's rule because it was \u00aamerely an application of Edwards [v.Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981)],\u00ba in which we held that, if a person is in custody on suspicion ofa crime, the police must stop questioning him about thatcrime once he invokes his right to counsel, id.,at 484\u00b1485, \u00aato a slightly different set of facts.\u00ba 494 U. S., at 414. We rejected this argument, saying that it \u00aawould not have beenan illogical or even a grudging application of Edwards to decide that it did not extend to the facts of Roberson. \u00baId., at 415. Likewise, in Sawyer, supra, the petitioner sought the ben- e\u00aet of Caldwell v.Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), which had been announced after Sawyer's conviction was \u00aenal.We held in Caldwell that the Eighth Amendment prohibits resting \u00aaa death sentence on a determination made by a sen-tencer who has been led to believe that the responsibilityfor determining the appropriateness of the defendant's deathrests elsewhere.\u00ba Id.,at 328\u00b1329. Sawyer argued that he was entitled to the bene\u00aet of Caldwell 's rule as having been \u00aadictated by the principle of reliability in capital sentencing,\u00baSawyer, supra, at 236, which, he said, had been established by cases announced before his conviction became \u00aenal, Ed- dings v.Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), and Lockett v.Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), among them. We rejected the argu-ment, saying that \u00aathe [Teague] test would be meaningless if applied at this level of generality. Cf. Anderson v.Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639 (1987) (`[I]f the test of \u00aaclearly establishedlaw\u00ba were to be applied at this level of generality, . . .[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of quali\u00aeedimmunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule ofvirtually unquali\u00aeed liability simply by alleging viola-tion of extremely abstract rights').\u00ba 497 U.

In sum, our cases have recognized that \u00aa[t]he interests in \u00aenality, predictability, and comity underlying our new rulejurisprudence may be undermined to an equal degree by theinvocation of a rule that was not dictated by precedent as bythe application of an old rule in a manner that was not dic-tated by precedent.\u00ba Stringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 228 (1992). This does not mean, of course, that a habeas peti-tioner must be able to point to an old case decided on factsidentical to the facts of his own. But it does mean that,in light of authority extant when his conviction became\u00aenal, its unlawfulness must be apparent. Cf. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). II In this case, the Court of Appeals overruled the Common- wealth's Teague objection by saying that West merely claimed that the evidence had been insuf\u00aecient to supporthis conviction, so that the result he sought was dictated byJackson v.Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), a case announced before petitioner's conviction became \u00aenal for Teague pur- poses in 265\u00b1267 (CA4 1991). Havingthus surmounted Teague 's time hurdle, the court went on to say that \u00aathe evidence here consisted entirely o f...t h e... facts . . . that about one-third in value of goods stolen be-tween December 13 and December 26, 1978, were found onJanuary 10, 1979, in the exclusive possession of . . . West,coupled with [West's] own testimony explaining his posses-sion as having come about by purchases in the interval.\u00ba931 F. 2d, at 268. Applied in this context, the court held,the unadorned Jackson norm translated into the more spe- ci\u00aec J., concurring in judgment 1982), which held that the evidence of unexplained or uncon- vincingly explained possession of recently stolen goods wasnot, without more, suf\u00aecient to prove theft, but must beweighed more exactly after asking \u00aeve questions: (1) Was\u00aathe possessio n... recent, relative to the crime\u00ba? (2) Was a large majority of the stolen items found in the defendant'spossession? (3) Did the defendant attempt to conceal thestolen items? (4) Was the defendant's . . . `so implausible or demonstrablyfalse as to give rise to positive evidence in favor of thegovernment' \u00ba? and (5) Was there corroborating evidencesupporting the F. 2d, at 268 (quotingCosby, supra, at 1383, n. 19). Applying Cosby to the facts of this case, the Court of Ap- peals found that all \u00aeve factors were either neutral or advan-tageous to West: (1) Two to four weeks elapsed between thetheft and the possession described in testimony, 2a time pe- riod consistent with West's explanation that he had boughtthe goods in the interval; (2) measured by value, a mere thirdof Cardova's belongings surfaced in West's possession; (3) thestolen items found in plain view in West's home; (4)while \u00aathere was no third person testimony corroborating[West's] explanation and on cross-examination West exhib-ited confusion about the exact circumstances of some of thepurchases[,] . . . he maintained his general explanation thathe had purchased all the items at \u00afea markets, and therewas nothing inherently implausible about this explanation\u00ba;and, \u00aenally, (5) there was no evidence corroborating theftby West. 931 F. 2d, at 269\u00b1270. The Court of Appealsconcluded that \u00aathe evidence here, assessed in its entiretyand in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was notsuf\u00aecient to persuade any rational trier of fact of [West's]g u i l t.... \u00ba Id.,at 270. 2The Court of Appeals overlooked that West testi\u00aeed that he came into possession of Cardova's goods around January 1. See App. 25\u00b127. Thus,a more accurate estimate of the time lapse would be one to three weeks.505us1102M 04-22-99 17:32:47 PAGES OPINPGT 315 Cite as: 505 U. S. 277 (1992) Souter, J., concurring in judgment It is clear that the Court of Appeals misapplied the com- mands of Teague by de\u00aening the rule from which West sought to bene\u00aet at an unduly elevated level of generality.There can, of course, be no doubt that, in reviewing West'sconviction, the Supreme Court of Virginia was not entitledto disregard Jackson, which antedated the \u00aenality of West's conviction. But from Jackson 's rule, that suf\u00aeciency de- pends on whether a rational trier, viewing the evidence mostfavorably to the prosecution, could \u00aend all elements beyonda reasonable doubt, it does not follow that the insuf\u00aeciencyof the evidence to support West's conviction was apparent.Virginia courts have long recognized a rule that evidence ofunexplained or falsely explained possession of recently stolengoods is suf\u00aecient to sustain a \u00aending that the possessor tookthe goods. See, e. g., Montgomery v.Commonwealth, 221 Va. 188, 190, 269 S. E. 2d 352, 353 (1980); Henderson v.Com- monwealth, 215 Va. 2d 782, 783\u00b1784 (1975); Bazemore v.Commonwealth, 210 Va. 351, 352, 170 S. E. 2d 774, 776 (1969); Bright v.Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 248, 251, 356 S. E. 2d 443, 444 (1987). In this case, we areconcerned only with the Virginia rule's second prong. Westtook the stand and gave an explanation that the jury re-jected, thereby implying a \u00aending that the explanation wasfalse. 3Thus, the portion of the state rule under attack here is that falsely explained recent possession suf\u00aeces to identifythe possessor as the thief. The rule has the virtue of muchcommon sense. It is utterly reasonable to conclude that apossessor of recently stolen goods who lies about where hegot them is the thief who took them, and it should come asno surprise that the rule had been accepted as good lawagainst the backdrop of a general state suf\u00aeciency standardno less stringent than that of Jackson. See, e. g., Bishop v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S. E. 2d 390, 393 (1984); 3The jury's \u00aending must of course be accepted under the Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), requirement to judge suf\u00aeciency by viewing the evidence \u00aain the light most favorable to the prosecution.\u00ba Id.,at 319.505us1102M 17:32:47 PAGES concurring in judgment Inge v.Commonwealth, 217 Va. 360, 366, 228 S. E. 2d 563, 568 (1976). It is simply insupportable, then, to say that rea-sonable jurists could not have considered this rule compati-ble with the Jackson standard. There can be no doubt, therefore, that in the federal courts West sought the bene\u00aetof a \u00aanew rule,\u00ba and that his claim was barred by Teague. On this ground, I respectfully concur in the judgment of the Court.505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 317 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus UNITED STATES v.SALERNO et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit No. 91\u00b1872. Argued April 20, 1992\u00d0Decided June 19, 1992 The respondents were indicted on a variety of federal charges, including fraud and racketeering in connection with the allocation of constructioncontracts among a so-called \u00aaClub\u00ba of companies in exchange for a shareof the proceeds. Witnesses DeMatteis and Bruno, owners of the CedarPark Construction Corporation, testi\u00aeed before the grand jury under agrant of immunity that neither they nor Cedar Park had participated inthe Club. At trial, however, the United States used other evidence toshow that Cedar Park was a Club member. The respondents subpoe-naed DeMatteis and Bruno, but they invoked their Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The DistrictCourt denied the respondents' request to admit the transcripts of De-Matteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony pursuant to Federal Rule ofEvidence 804(b)(1)\u00d0which permits admission of an unavailable declar-ant's testimony from a former hearing if the party against whom it isnow offered had a \u00aasimilar motive to develop the testimony by direct,cross, or redirect examination\u00ba\u00d0reasoning that a prosecutor's motive inquestioning a witness before the grand jury is different from his motivein conducting the trial. The respondents were convicted, but the Courtof Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had erred in exclud-ing the grand jury testimony. It ruled that, to maintain \u00aaadversarialfairness,\u00ba Rule 804(b)(1)'s similar motive element should evaporatewhen the Government obtains immunized testimony in a grand juryproceeding from a witness who refuses to testify at trial. Held: 1. Former testimony may not be introduced under Rule 804(b)(1) without a showing of \u00aasimilar motive.\u00ba Nothing in Rule 804(b)(1) sug-gests that a court may admit former testimony absent satisfaction ofeach of the Rule's elements. The respondents err in arguing that theRule contains an implicit limitation permitting the \u00aasimilar motive\u00ba re-quirement to be waived in the interest of adversarial fairness. Alsorejected is the respondents' argument that the United States forfeitedits right to object to the testimony's admission when it introduced con-tradictory evidence about Cedar Park. Here, the United States neverrevealed what DeMatteis and Bruno said to the grand jury, but, rather, attempted to show Cedar Park's involvement using other evidence.

S. 317 (1992) Opinion of the Court Genovese Family of La Cosa Nostra (Family) in New York City. In 1987, a federal grand jury in the Southern Districtof New York indicted the respondents and four others on thebasis of these activities. The indictment charged the re-spondents with a variety of federal offenses, including 41acts constituting a \u00aapattern of illegal activity\u00ba in violationof the Racketeer In\u00afuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act(RICO), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 1962(b). Sixteen of the alleged acts involved fraud in the New York construction industry in the 1980's. According to the indict-ment and evidence later admitted at trial, the Family used its in\u00afuence over labor unions and its control over the supplyof concrete to rig bidding on large construction projects inManhattan. The Family purportedly allocated contracts forthese projects among a so-called \u00aaClub\u00ba of six concrete com-panies in exchange for a share of the proceeds. Much of the case concerned the affairs of the Cedar Park Concrete Construction Corporation (Cedar Park). Two ofthe owners of this \u00aerm, Frederick DeMatteis and PasqualeBruno, testi\u00aeed before the grand jury under a grant of immu-nity. In response to questions by the United States, theyrepeatedly stated that neither they nor Cedar Park had par-ticipated in the Club. At trial, however, the United Statesattempted to show that Cedar Park, in fact, had belonged tothe Club by ca lling two contractors who had taken part in the scheme and by presenting intercepted conversationsamong the respondents. The United States also introduceddocuments indicating that the Family had an ownership in-terest in Cedar Park. To counter the United States' evidence, the respondents subpoenaed DeMatteis and Bruno as witnesses in the hopethat they would provide the same exculpatory testimonythat they had presented to the grand jury. When both wit-nesses invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege againstself-incrimination and refused to testify, the respondentsasked the District Court to admit the transcripts of their505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 320 UNITED STATES v.SALERNO Opinion of the Court grand jury testimony. Although this testimony constituted hearsay, see Rule 801(c), the respondents argued that it fellwithin the hearsay exception in Rule 804(b)(1) for formertestimony of unavailable witnesses. The District Court refused to admit the grand jury testi- mony. It observed that Rule 804(b)(1) permits admission offormer testimony against a party at trial only when thatparty had a \u00aasimilar motive to develop the testimony by di-rect, cross, or redirect examination.\u00ba The District Courtheld that the United States did not have this motive, statingthat the \u00aamotive of a prosecutor in questioning a witnessbefore the grand jury in the investigatory stages of a case isfar different from the motive of a prosecutor in conductingthe trial.\u00ba App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.

Rule 804(b)(1), however, es-tablishes an exception to the hearsay rule for former testi-mony. This exception provides: \u00aaThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: \u00aa(1) Former Testimony.\u00d0Testimony given as a wit- ness at another hearing . . . if the party against whomthe testimony is now offered . . . had an opportunity andsimilar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross,or redirect examination.\u00ba We must decide whether the Court of Appeals properly in- terpreted Rule 804(b)(1) in this case. The parties agree that DeMatteis and Bruno were \u00aaun- available\u00ba to the defense as witnesses, provided that theyproperly invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and re-fused to testify. See Rule 804(a)(1). They also agree thatDeMatteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony given as . . . witness[es] at another hearing.\u00baThey however, about whether the \u00aasimilar motive\u00barequirement in the \u00aenal clause of Rule 804(b)(1) should haveprevented admission of the testimony in this case. A Nothing in the language of Rule 804(b)(1) suggests that a court may admit former testimony absent satisfaction of eachof the Rule's elements. The United States thus asserts that,unless it had a \u00aasimilar motive,\u00ba we must conclude that theDistrict Court properly excluded DeMatteis' and Bruno'stestimony as hearsay. The respondents, in contrast, urge usnot to read Rule 804(b)(1) in a \u00aaslavishly literal fashion.\u00baBrief for Respondents 31. They contend that \u00aaadversarialfairness\u00ba prevents the United States from relying on thesimilar motive requirement in this case. We agree with theUnited States.505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 322 UNITED STATES v.SALERNO Opinion of the Court When Congress enacted the prohibition against admission of hearsay in Rule 802, it placed 24 exceptions in Rule 803and 5 additional exceptions in Rule 804. Congress thus pre-sumably made a careful judgment as to what hearsay maycome into evidence and what may not. To respect its deter-mination, we must enforce the words that it enacted. Therespondents, as a result, had no right to introduce DeMatteis'and Bruno's former testimony under Rule 804(b)(1) withoutshowing a \u00aasimilar motive.\u00ba This Court cannot alter eviden-tiary rules merely because litigants might prefer differentrules in a particular class of cases. See Green v.Bock Laun- dry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 524 (1989). The respondents' argument for a different result takes several forms. They \u00aerst assert that adversarial fairnessrequires us to infer that Rule 804(b)(1) contains implicit limi-tations. They observe, for example, that the Advisory Com-mittee Note to Rule 804 makes clear that the former testi-mony exception applies only to statements made under oathor af\u00aermation, even though the Rule does not state thisrestriction explicitly. See Advisory Committee's Notes onFed. Rule Evid. 804, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 788, subd. (b), except.(1). The respondents maintain that we likewise may holdthat Rule 804(b)(1) does not require a showing of similarmotive in all instances. The respondents' example does not persuade us to change our reading of Rule 804(b)(1). If the Rule applies only tosworn statements, it does so not because adversarial fairnessimplies a limitation, but simply because the word \u00aatesti-mony\u00ba refers only to statements made under oath or af\u00aer-mation. See Black's Law Dictionary 1476 (6th ed. 1990).We see no way to interpret the text of Rule 804(b)(1) to meanthat defendants sometimes do not have to show \u00aasimilarmotive.\u00ba The respondents also assert that courts often depart from the Rules of Evidence to prevent litigants from presentingonly part of the truth. For example, citing United States v.505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 323 Cite as: 505 U. S. 317 (1992) Opinion of the Court Miller, 600 F. 2d 498 (CA5 1979), the respondents maintain that, although parties may enjoy various testimonial privi-leges, they can forfeit these privileges by \u00aaopening the door\u00bato certain subjects. In the respondents' view, the UnitedStates is attempting to use the hearsay rule like a privilegeto keep DeMatteis' and Bruno's grand jury testimony awayfrom the jury. They contend, however, that adversarial fair-ness requires us to conclude that the United States forfeitedits right to object to admission of the testimony when it in-troduced contradictory evidence about Cedar Park. This argument also fails. Even assuming that we should treat the hearsay rule like the rules governing testimonialprivileges, we would not conclude that a forfeiture occurredhere. Parties may forfeit a privilege by exposing privilegedevidence, but do not forfeit one merely by taking a positionthat the evidence might contradict. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evi-dence 2327, p. pp. 2\u00b1103, 2\u00b1104, 2\u00b1120(1991). In Miller, for example, the court held that a litigant, \u00aaafter giving the jury his version of a privileged communica-tion, [could not] prevent the cross-examiner from ut ilizing the communication itself to get at the truth.\u00ba 600 F. 2d, at 501 (emphasis added). In this case, by contrast, the UnitedStates never presented to the jury any version of what De-Matteis and Bruno had said in the grand jury proceedings.Instead, it attempted to show Cedar Park's participation inthe Club solely through other evidence available to the re-spondents. The United States never exposed the jury toanything analogous to a \u00aaprivileged communication.\u00ba Therespondents' argument, accordingly, fails on its own terms. The respondents \u00aenally argue that adversarial fairness may prohibit suppression of exculpatory evidence producedin grand jury proceedings. They note that, when this Courtrequired disclosure of a grand jury transcript in Dennis v. United States, 384 U. S. 855 (1966), it stated that \u00aait is rarely justi\u00aeable for the prosecution to have exclusive access\u00ba to505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 324 UNITED STATES v.SALERNO Opinion of the Court relevant facts. Id., at 873. They allege that the United States nevertheless uses the following tactics to develop evidence in a one-sided manner: If a witness inculpates adefendant during the grand jury proceedings, the UnitedStates immunizes him and calls him at trial; however, if thewitness exculpates the defendant, as Bruno and DeMatteiseach did here, the United States refuses to immunize himand attempts to exclude the testimony as hearsay.* The re-spondents assert that dispensing with the \u00aasimilar motive\u00barequirement would limit these tactics. We again fail to see how we may create an exception to Rule 804(b)(1). The Dennis case, unlike this one, did not involve a question about the admissibility of evidence.Rather, it concerned only the need to disclose a transcript tothe defendants. See 384 U. S., at 873. Moreover, in Den- nis, we did not hold that adversarial fairness required the United States to make the grand jury transcript available.Instead, we ordered disclosure under the speci\u00aec languageof Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). See 384 U. S.,at 869\u00b1870, 872. In this case, the language of Rule 804(b)(1)does not support the respondents. Indeed, the respondentsspeci\u00aecally ask us to ignore it. Neither Dennis nor any- thing else that the respondents have cited provides us withthis authority. B The question remains whether the United States had a \u00aasimilar motive\u00ba in this case. The United States assertsthat the District Court speci\u00aecally found that it did not andthat we should not review its factual determinations. Italso argues that a prosecutor generally will not have thesame motive to develop testimony in grand jury proceedingsas he does at trial. A prosecutor, it explains, must maintain *The respondents also suggest that, in the event that a witness chooses to testify at trial without immunity, the United States can impeach himwith his grand jury testimony.

It further states that aprosecutor may not know, prior to indictment, which issueswill have importance at trial and accordingly may fail to de-velop grand jury testimony effectively. The respondents disagree with both of the United States' arguments. They characterize the District Court's rulingas one of law, rather than fact, because the District Courtessentially ruled that a prosecutor's motives at trial alwaysdiffer from his motives in grand jury proceedings. The re-spondents contend further that the grand jury transcripts inthis case actually show that the United States thoroughlyattempted to impeach DeMatteis and Bruno. They add that, despite the United States' stated concern about maintainingsecrecy, the United States revealed to DeMatteis and Brunothe identity of the major witnesses who testi\u00aeed againstthem at trial. The Court of Appeals, as noted, erroneously concluded that the respondents did not have to demonstrate a similarmotive in this case to make use of Rule 804(b)(1). It there-fore declined to consider fully the arguments now presentedby the parties about whether the United States had sucha motive. Rather than to address this issue here in the\u00aerst instance, we think it prudent to remand the case forfurther consideration. Cf. Denton v.Hernandez, 504 U. S. 25, 32\u00b135 (1992).

I join the Court's opinion with the understanding that it does not pass upon the weighty concerns, expressed by Jus- tice Stevens , underlying the interpretation of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1)'s similar-motive requirement.The District Court appeared to hold a sam a t t e ro fl a w that \u00aathe motive of a prosecutor in questioning a witness before505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 326 UNITED STATES v.SALERNO Stevens, J., dissenting the grand jury in the investigatory stages of a case is far different from the motive of a prosecutor in conducting thetrial.\u00ba App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. Because \u00aasimilar mo-tive\u00ba does not mean \u00aaidentical motive,\u00ba the similar-motiveinquiry, in my view, is inherently a factual inquiry, depend- ing in part on the similarity of the underlying issues and onthe context of the grand jury questioning. It cannot be thatthe prosecution either always ornever has a similar motive for questioning a particular witness with respect to a par-ticular issue before the grand jury as at trial. Moreover,like other inquiries involving the admission of evidence, thesimilar-motive inquiry appropriately re\u00afects narrow con-cerns of ensuring the reliability of evidence admitted attrial\u00d0not broad policy concerns favoring either the Govern- ment in the conduct of grand jury proceedings or the defend-ant in overcoming the refusal of other witnesses to testify.Because this case involves factual issues unusual in complex-ity and in number and because neither the District Court northe Court of Appeals apparently engaged in the type of fac-tual inquiry appropriate for resolution of the similar-motiveinquiry, I join the majority in remanding the case for fur-ther consideration. Justice Stevens , dissenting. Because I believe that the Government clearly had an \u00aaop- portunity and similar motive\u00ba to develop by direct or cross-examination the grand jury testimony of Pasquale Bruno andFrederick DeMatteis, I would af\u00aerm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals on the ground that the transcript of theirgrand jury testimony was admissible under the plain lan-guage of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1). As the Courtexplains, ante, at 319, the grand jury testimony of Bruno and DeMatteis was totally inconsistent with the Government'stheory of the alleged RICO conspiracy to rig bids on largeconstruction projects in Manhattan. Bruno and DeMatteiswere principals in Cedar Park Construction Corporation505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 327 Cite as: 505 U.

Asthe Court of Appeals explained, Cedar Park was \u00aaone of thelargest contractors in the metropolitan New York City con-crete industry,\u00ba and it is arguable that without Cedar Park'sparticipation, \u00aathere could be no concrete contrac-tors.\u00ba 2d 797, 808 (CA2 1991).

It is therefore clear that before the grand jury the Govern- ment had precisely the same interest in establishing thatBruno's and DeMatteis' testimony was false as it had at trial.Thus, when the prosecutors doubted Bruno's and DeMatteis'veracity before the grand jury\u00d0as they most assuredly did\u00d0they unquestionably had an \u00aaopportunity and similar motiveto develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect exami-nation\u00ba within the meaning of Rule 804(b)(1). 1 The Government disagrees, asserting that it \u00aatypically does not have the same motive to cross-examine hostile wit-nesses in the grand jury that it has to cross-examine themat trial.\u00ba Brief for United States 11. the Gov- 1Rule 804(b)(1) provides: \u00aaHearsay exceptions.\u00d0The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: \u00aa(1) Former Testimony.\u00d0Testimony given as a witness at another hear- ing of the same or a different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in com-pliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if theparty against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action orproceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar mo-tive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u00ba505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 328 UNITED STATES v.SALERNO Stevens, J., dissenting ernment maintains, because (1) cross-examining the witness might indirectly undermine the secrecy of the grand juryproceedings, 2(2) the Government might decide to discredit the witness through means other than cross-examination,and (3) the issues before the grand jury are typically quitedifferent from those at trial. See id.,at 11\u00b114; Reply Brief for United States 9\u00b112. In my view, the \u00aerst two reasons\u00d0even assuming that they are true\u00d0do not justify holdingthat the Government lacks a \u00aasimilar motive\u00ba in the two pro-ceedings. And although the third reason could justify theconclusion that the Government's motives are not \u00aasimilar,\u00bait is not present on the facts of this case. Even if one does not completely agree with Wigmore's assertion that cross-examination is \u00aabeyond any doubt thegreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery oftruth,\u00ba 3one must admit that in the Anglo-American legal system cross-examination is the principal means of under- mining the credibility of a witness whose testimony is falseor inaccurate. 4For that reason, a party has a motive to 2\u00aaIf the government exposes the extent of its knowledge to an individ- ual who, by his willing ness to commit perjury, has shown himself to be allied with the investigation's targets, the effect may be to provide in-formation to the targets that can be used to threaten witnesses, destroyevidence, fabricate a defense, or otherwise obstruct the investigation.\u00baBrief for United States 12. 35 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1367, p. 32 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1974). 4Indeed, the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine the absent declar- ant has been the principal justi\u00aecation for the Anglo-American traditionof excluding hearsay statements. See, e. g., E. Cleary, McCormick on Evi- dence \u00a7 \u00a7 1367, at 32. This concernis diminished, however, when the party against whom the hearsay state-ment is offered had an opportunity to cross-examine the absent declarantat the time the statement was made. Accordingly, the common law devel-oped an exception to the hearsay rule that permitted the introduction ofprior testimony if the opponent had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. See, e. g., id., \u00a7 1386, at 90. Rule 804(b)(1) codi- \u00aeed, with a few changes, that common-law rule. See Advisory Com-mittee's Notes on Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(1), 28 U. S. C.

Of course, the party might decide\u00d0for tactical reasons or otherwise\u00d0not to engage in a rigorous cross-examination,or even in any cross-examination at all. 5In such a case, however, I do not believe that it is accurate to say that theparty lacked a similar motive to cross-examine the witness;instead, it is more accurate to say that the party had a simi-lar motive to cross-examine the witness ( i. e., to undermine the false or misleading testimony) but chose not to act onthat motive. Although the Rules of Evidence allow a partyto make that choice about whether to engage in cross-examination, they also provide that she must accept the con-sequences of that decision\u00d0including the possibility that thetestimony might be introduced against her in a subsequentproceeding. 6 Thus neither the fact that the prosecutors might decline to cross-examine a grand jury witness whom they fear willtalk to the target of the investigation nor the fact that they 5For example, the party might not want to run the risk of appearing to harass or upset a vulnerable witness\u00d0such as a young child or the victimof a terrible crime\u00d0with rigorous cross-examination if there are other,less confrontational means of undermining the suspect testimony. 6As the Advisory Committee explained, the question whether prior tes- timony should be admitted is, in essence, the question \u00aawhether fairnessallows imposing, upon the party against whom now offered, the handlingof a witness on the earlier occasion.\u00ba Id.,at 788. When, as in this case, the testimony is offered against the party by whom it was previously of-fered, the party obviously did not have an opportunity to develop the testi-mony through cross -examination. But, the Advisory Committee recog- nized, the opportunity to engage in \u00aadirect and redirect examination ofone's own witness [is] the equivalent of cross-examining an opponent'switness.\u00ba Id.,at 789. In either case, as long as the party had a similar motive to develop the testimony in the prior proceeding, there is no unfair-ness in requiring the party against whom the testimony is now offered toaccept her prior decision to develop or not develop the testimony fully.Ibid.505us1103N 07-12-96 20:08:57 PAGES OPINPGT 330 UNITED STATES v.SALERNO Stevens, J., dissenting might choose to undermine the witness' credibility other than through rigorous cross-examination alters the fact thatthey had an opportunity and similar motive to challenge theallegedly false testimony through questioning before thegrand jury. Although those might be reasons for decliningto take advantage of the opportunity to cross-examine a wit-ness, neither undermines the principal motive for engagingin cross-examination, i. e., to shake the witness' allegedly false or misleading testimony. Indeed, other courts havefound the \u00aaopportunity and similar motive\u00ba requirement ofRule 804(b)(1) satis\u00aeed\u00d0and hence the prior testimony ad-missible in a subsequent trial\u00d0in many similar situations. 7 That leaves the Government's third reason, its contention that it lacks a similar motive to question grand jury wit- 7See, e. g., United States v.Miller, 284 U.

If that weretrue in a particular case, I would agree that the Governmentlacked a similar motive for developing the witness' grandjury testimony. Because the scope of questioning is neces-sarily limited by the scope of the legal and factual issues ina given proceeding, a party has little motive, and indeed maynot be permitted, to ask questions about other issues. Thusif those other issues become important in a subsequent pro-ceeding, the testimony from the prior proceeding may prop-erly be excluded on the ground that the party against whomit is offered lacked a similar motive for developing the testi-mony at the prior proceeding. 8 That did not occur in this case, however. After reviewing the sealed transcripts of Bruno's and DeMatteis' grand jurytestimony, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00aa[v]ery gen-erally stated, their grand jury testimony denied any aware-ness of, let alone participation in,\u00ba the \u00aaClub\u00ba of concretecontractors, the existence of which was crucial to the RICO counts dealing with fraud in the construction industry. 937 8As Wigmore explained, the common law required identity of issues as a means of ensuring that the cross-examination in the two proceedingswould have been directed at the same material points. 5 Wigmore, \u00a7 1386,at 90. Rule 804(b)(1) slightly modi\u00aeed the prior testimony exception tothe hearsay rule by substituting the \u00aaopportunity and similar motive\u00ba re-quirement for the identity-of-issues requirement. The drafters of theRule reasoned that \u00aa[s]ince identity of issues is signi\u00aecant only in that itbears on motive and interest in developing fully the testimony of the wit-ness, expressing the matter in the latter terms is preferable.\u00ba AdvisoryCommittee's Notes on Rule 804(b)(1), at 789. Nevertheless, for the rea-sons discussed in the text, \u00aa[i]n determining whether a similar motive todevelop the testimony existed at the time of the elicitation of the formertestimony the courts will search for some substantial identity of issues.\u00ba 11 J. Moore & H. Bendix, Moore's Federal Practice Stevens, J., dissenting F. 2d, at 808.9Moreover, the transcripts reveal that the prosecutors did challenge some of the witnesses' denials ofknowledge of criminal activity by questioning which includedprobing the basis of their statements and confronting themwith contrary statements from other people. I am therefore satis\u00aeed that the Government had an \u00aaop- portunity and similar motive\u00ba to develop the grand jurytestimony of witnesses Bruno and DeMatteis; consequently,the transcript of that testimony was admissible against theGovernment at respondents' trial under Rule 804(b)(1). Forthat reason, I would af\u00aerm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals. 9\u00aaIndeed,\u00ba the Court of Appeals explained, \u00aathe central importance of the `club's' existence is probably why the government felt obligated toidentify Bruno and DeMatteis as sources of exculpatory testimony underBrady v.Maryland [, 373 at 808.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus SAWYER v.WHITLEY, WARDEN certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit No. 91\u00b16382. Argued February 25, 1992\u00d0Decided June 22, 1992 A Louisiana jury convicted petitioner Sawyer and sentenced him to death for a murder in which the victim was beaten, scalded with boiling water,and set a\u00aere. His conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal, andhis petitions for state postconviction relief, as well as his \u00aerst petitionfor federal habeas relief, were denied. In a second federal habeas peti-tion, the District Court barred as abusive or successive Sawyer's claims,inter alia, that the police failed to produce exculpatory evidence\u00d0evi- dence challenging a prosecution witness' credibility and a child witness'statements that Sawyer had tried to prevent an accomplice from setting\u00aere to the victim\u00d0in violation of his due process rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83; and that his trial counsel's failure to introduce mental health records as mitigating evidence in his trial's sentencingphase constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Ap-peals af\u00aermed, holding that Sawyer had not shown cause for failure toraise his claims in his earlier petition, and that it could not otherwisereach the claims' merits because he had not shown that he was \u00aaactuallyinnocent\u00ba of the death penalty under Louisiana law. Held: 1. To show \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba one must show by clear and convincing evidence that but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror wouldhave found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the appli-cable state law. Pp. 338\u00b1347. (a) Generally, a habeas petitioner must show cause and prejudice before a court will reach the merits of a successive, abusive, or defaulted claim. Even if he cannot meet this standard, a court may hear themerits of such claims if failure to hear them would result in a miscar-riage of justice. See, e. g., Kuhlmann v.Wilson, 477 U. S. 436. The miscarriage of justice exception applies where a petitioner is \u00aaactuallyinnocent\u00ba of the crime of which he was convicted or the penalty whichwas imposed. While it is not easy to de\u00aene what is meant by \u00aaactually innocent\u00ba of the death penalty, the exception is very narrow and mustbe determined by relatively objective standards. Pp. 338\u00b1341. (b) In order to avoid arbitrary and capricious impositions of the death sentence, States have adopted narrowing factors to limit the class of offenders upon which the death penalty may be imposed, as evidenced505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 334 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Syllabus by Louisiana's de\u00aenition of capital murder as something more than in- tentional killing and its requirement that before a jury may recommend death, it must determine that at least one of a list of statutory aggravat-ing factors exists. Once eligibility for the death penalty is established,however, the emphasis shifts from narrowing the class of eligible de-fendants by objective factors to individualized consideration of a partic-ular defendant by the introduction of mitigating evidence. Within thisframework, the Court of Appeals applied the proper standard to deter-mine \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba when it required Sawyer to base his showingthat no reasonable juror would have found him eligible for the deathpenalty under Louisiana law on the elements of the crime itself and theexistence of aggravating circumstances, but not the existence of addi-tional mitigating evidence that was not introduced as a result of aclaimed constitutional error. This standard hones in on the objectivefactors that must be shown to exist before a defendant is eligible tohave the death penalty imposed. The adoption of a stricter de\u00aenition,which would limit any showing to the elements of the crime, is rejected,since, by stating in Smith v.Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537, that actual innocence could mean innocent of the death penalty, this Court sug-gested a more expansive meaning than simply innocence of the capitaloffense itself. Also rejected is a more lenient de\u00aenition, which wouldallow the showing to extend beyond the elements of the crime and theaggravating factors, to include mitigating evidence which bears, not onthe defendant's eligibility to receive the death penalty, but only on theultimate discretionary decision between that penalty and life imprison-ment. Including mitigating factors would make actual innocence meanlittle more than what is already required to show prejudice for purposesof securing habeas relief and would broaden the inquiry beyond what isa narrow exception to the principle of \u00aenality. Pp. 341\u00b1347. 2. Sawyer has failed to show that he is actually innocent of the death penalty to which he has been sentenced. The psychological evidenceallegedly kept from the jury does not relate to his guilt or innocence ofthe crime or to the aggravating factors found by the jury\u00d0that the murder was committed in the course of an aggravated arson, and thatit was especially cruel, atrocious, or heinous\u00d0which made him eligiblefor the death penalty. Nor can it be said that had this evidence beenbefore the jury a reasonable juror would not have found both of theaggravating factors. The evidence allegedly kept from the jury due toan alleged Brady violation also fails to show actual innocence. Latter- day impeachment evidence seldom, if ever, makes a clear and convincingshowing that no reasonable juror would have believed the heart of thewitness' account. While the st atement that Sawyer did not set \u00aere to the victim goes to the jury's \u00aending of aggravated arson and, thus, to505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 335 Cite as: 505 U.

The state trial court summarily denied this petitionas repetitive and without merit, and the Louisiana SupremeCourt denied discretionary review. See 945 F. 2d, at 815. The present petition before this Court arises out of Saw- yer's second petition for federal habeas relief. After grant-ing a stay and holding an evidentiary hearing, the DistrictCourt denied one of Sawyer's claims on the merits and heldthat the others were barred as either abusive or successive.772 F. Supp. 297 (ED La. 1991). The Court of Appealsgranted a certi\u00aecate of probable cause on the issue whetherpetitioner had shown that he is actually \u00aainnocent of thedeath penalty\u00ba such that a court should reach the merits ofthe claims contained in this successive petition. 945 F. 2d,at 814. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner had failed to show that he was actually innocent of the death penaltybecause the evidence he argued had been unconstitutionallykept from the jury failed to show that Sawyer was ineligiblefor the death penalty under Louisiana law.

Aswe explained in Kuhlmann v.Wilson, supra, the exception developed from the language of the federal habeas statute,which, prior to 1966, allowed successive claims to be deniedwithout a hearing if the judge were \u00aasatis\u00aeed that the ends of justice will not be served by such inquiry. \u00baId., at 448. We held that despite the removal of this statutory languagefrom 28 U. S.

Murray v.Carrier, supra. 6 InSmith v.Murray, 477 U. S. 527 (1986), we found no mis- carriage of justice in the failure to examine the merits ofprocedurally defaulted claims in the capital sentencing con-text. We emphasized that the miscarriage of justice excep-tion is concerned with actual as compared to legal innocence, 5Our standard for determining actual innocence was articulated in Kuhlmann as: \u00aa[T]he prisoner must `show a fair probability that, in light of all the evidence, including that alleged to have been illegally admitted(but with due regard to any unreliability of it) and evidence tenablyclaimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become available onlyafter the trial, the trier of the facts would have entertained a reasonabledoubt of his guilt.' \u00ba 477 U.

We de- cided that the habeas petitioner in that case had failed toshow actual innocence of the death penalty because the \u00aaal-leged constitutional error neither precluded the developmentof true facts nor resulted in the admission of false ones.\u00baId.,at 538. In subsequent cases, we have emphasized the narrow scope of the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception.InDugger v.Adams, 489 U. S. 401 (1989), we rejected the petitioner's claim that his procedural default should be ex-cused because he had shown that he was actually innocent.Without endeavoring to de\u00aene what it meant to be actuallyinnocent of the death penalty, we stated that \u00aa[d]emonstrat-ing that an error is by its nature the kind of error that mighthave affected the accuracy of a death sentence is far fromdemonstrating that an individual defendant probably is `actu-ally innocent' of the sentence he or she received.\u00ba Id., at 412, n. 6. Just last Term in McCleskey v.Zant, supra, at 502, we held that the \u00aanarrow exception\u00ba for miscarriage ofjustice was of no avail to the petitioner because the constitu-tional violation, if it occurred, \u00aaresulted in the admission attrial of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect thereliability of the guilt determination.\u00ba The present case requires us to further amplify the mean- ing of \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba in the setting of capital punishment.A prototypical example of \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba in a colloquialsense is the case where the State has convicted the wrongperson of the crime. Such claims are of course regularlymade on motions for new trial after conviction in both stateand federal courts, and quite regularly denied because theevidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the rigor-ous standards for granting such motions. But in rare in-stances it may turn out later, for example, that anotherperson has credibly confessed to the crime, and it is evident505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 341 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Opinion of the Court that the law has made a mistake. In the context of a non- capital case, the concept of \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba is easy tograsp. It is more dif\u00aecult to develop an analogous framework when dealing with a defendant who has been sentenced todeath. The phrase \u00aainnocent of death\u00ba is not a naturalusage of those words, but we must strive to construct ananalog to the simpler situation represented by the case of anoncapital defendant. In de\u00aening this analog, we bear inmind that the exception for \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba is a very nar-row exception, and that to make it workable it must be sub-ject to determination by relatively objective standards. Inthe every day context of capital penalty proceedings, a fed-eral district judge typically will be presented with a succes-sive or abusive habeas petition a few days before, or even onthe day of, a scheduled execution, and will have only a lim-ited time to determine whether a petitioner has shown thathis case falls within the \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba exception if sucha claim is made. 7 Since our decision in Furman v.Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has requiredthose States imposing capital punishment to adopt proce-dural safeguards protecting against arbitrary and capriciousimpositions of the death sentence. See, e. g., Gregg v.Geor- gia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976); Prof\u00aett v.Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976); Jurek v.Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976). In response, the States have adopted various narrowing factors that limit the 7While we recognize this as a fact on the basis of our own experience with applications for stays of execution in capital cases, we regard it as aregrettable fact. We of course do not in the least condone, but insteadcondemn, any efforts on the part of habeas petitioners to delay their \u00aelingsuntil the last minute with a view to obtaining a stay because the districtcourt will lack time to give them the necessary consideration before the scheduled execution. A court may resolve against such a petitionerdoubts and uncertainties as to the suf\u00aeciency of his submission. SeeGomez v.United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.

For example, the Louisiana stat-ute under which petitioner was convicted de\u00aenes \u00aerst-degree murder, a capital offense, as something more than intentionalkilling. 8In addition, after a defendant is found guilty in Louisiana of capital murder, the jury must also \u00aend at thesentencing phase beyond a reasonable doubt at least one ofa list of statutory aggravating factors before it may recom-mend that the death penalty be imposed. 9 But once eligibility for the death penalty has been estab- lished to the satisfaction of the jury, its deliberations assumea different tenor. In a series of cases beginning with Lock- ettv.Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978), we have held that the 8Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14:30 (West 1986 and Supp. 1992) de\u00aenes \u00aerst-degree murder: \u00aaFirst degree murder is the killing of a human being: \u00aa(1) When the offender has speci\u00aec intent to kill or to in\u00afict great bodily harm and is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration ofaggravated kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated escape,aggravated arson, aggravated rape, forcible rape, aggravated burglary,armed robbery, \u00aerst degree robbery or simple robbery; \u00aa(2) When the offender has a speci\u00aec intent to kill or to in\u00afict great bodily harm upon a \u00aereman or peace of\u00aecer engaged in the performanceof his lawful duties; \u00aa(3) When the offender has a speci\u00aec intent to kill or to in\u00afict great bodily harm upon more than one person; or \u00aa(4) When the offender has speci\u00aec intent to kill or in\u00afict great bodily harm and has offered, has been offered, has given, or has received any-thing of value for the killing. ..... \u00aaWhoever commits the crime of \u00aerst degree murder shall be punished by death or life imprisonment at hard labor without bene\u00aet of parole, pro-bation, or suspension of sentence in accordance with the determination ofthe jury.\u00ba 9At the time of petitioner's trial La. Proc.

S. 333 (1992) Opinion of the Court defendant must be permitted to introduce a wide variety of mitigating evidence pertaining to his character and back-ground. The emphasis shifts from narrowing the class ofeligible defendants by objective factors to individualizedconsideration of a particular defendant. Consideration ofaggravating factors together with mitigating factors, in vari-ous combinations and methods dependent upon state law, re-sults in the jury's or judge's ultimate decision as to whatpenalty shall be imposed. Considering Louisiana law as an example, then, there are three possible ways in which \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba might bede\u00aened. The strictest de\u00aenition would be to limit any show-ing to the elements of the crime which the State has made acapital offense. The showing would have to negate an es-sential element of that offense. The Solicitor General, \u00aeling asamicus curiae in support of respondent, urges the Court to adopt this standard. We reject this submission as toonarrow, because it is contrary to the statement in Smith that the concept of \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba could be applied to mean\u00aainnocent\u00ba of the death penalty. 477 U. S., at 537. Thisstatement suggested a more expansive meaning to the termof \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba in a capital case than simply innocenceof the capital offense itself. The most lenient of the three possibilities would be to allow the showing of \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba to extend not onlyto the elements of the crime, but also to the existence ofaggravating factors, and to mitigating evidence that bore noton the defendant's eligibility to receive the death penalty,but only on the ultimate discretionary decision between thedeath penalty and life imprisonment. This, in effect, is whatpetitioner urges upon us. He contends that actual innocenceof the death penalty exists where \u00aathere is a `fair probability'that the admission of false evidence, or the preclusion of truemitigating evidence, [caused by a constitutional error] re-sulted in a of Brief for (cita-505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 344 SAWYER of the Court tion and footnote omitted).10Although petitioner describes his standard as narrower than that adopted by the Eighthand Ninth Circuits, 11in reality it is only more closely related to the facts of his case in which he alleges that constitutionalerror kept true mitigating evidence from the jury. The cru-cial consideration, according to petitioner, is whether due toconstitutional error the sentencer was presented with \u00aa `afactually inaccurate sentencing pro\u00aele ' \u00ba of the petitioner. Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 21, quoting Johnson v.Singletary, 938 F. 2d 1166, 1200 (CA11 1991) (en banc) (Anderson, J.,dissenting). Insofar as petitioner's standard would include not merely the elements of the crime itself, but the existence of aggra-vating circumstances, it broadens the extent of the inquirybut not the type of inquiry. Both the elements of the crimeand statutory aggravating circumstances in Louisiana are 10Petitioner's standard derives from language in Smith v.Murray, 477 U. S. 527 (1986). Petitioner maintains that Smith holds that if one can show that the error precludes the development of true mitigating evi-dence, actual innocence has been shown. Brief for Petitioner 21. By em-phasizing that in Smith the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception had not been met because, inter alia, the constitutional error did not lead the jury to consider any false evidence, we did not hold its converse, thatan error which leads to the consideration of \u00aafalse\u00ba mitigating evidenceamounts to a miscarriage of justice. 11InDeutscher v.Whitley, 946 F. 2d 1443 (1991), the Ninth Circuit phrased its test as follows: \u00aaTo establish a fundamental miscarriage ofjustice at sentencing, a defendant must establish that constitutional errorsubstantially undermined the accuracy of the capital sentencing determi-nation. This requires a showing that constitutional error infected thesentencing process to such a degree that it is more probable than not that,but for constitutional error, the sentence of death would not have beenimposed.\u00ba Id.,at 1446 (citations omitted). The Eighth Circuit has adopted a similar test: \u00aa `In the penalty-phase context, this exception will be available if the federal constitutional error alleged probably resulted in a verdict of death against one whom the jurywould otherwise have sentenced to life imprisonment.' \u00ba Stokes v.Arm- ontrout, 893 F. 2d 152, 156 F. 2d 530, 545 (1989).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 345 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Opinion of the Court used to narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. And proof or disproof of aggravating circum-stances, like proof of the elements of the crime, is con\u00aenedby the statutory de\u00aenitions to a relatively obvious class ofrelevant evidence. Sensible meaning is given to the term\u00aainnocent of the death penalty\u00ba by allowing a showing inaddition to innocence of the capital crime itself a showingthat there was no aggravating circumstance or that someother condition of eligibility had not been met. 12 But we reject petitioner's submission that the showing should extend beyond these elements of the capital sentenceto the existence of additional mitigating evidence. In the\u00aerst place, such an extension would mean that \u00aaactual inno-cence\u00ba amounts to little more than what is already requiredto show \u00aaprejudice,\u00ba a necessary showing for habeas relieffor many constitutional errors. See, e. g., United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985); Strickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984). If federal habeas review of capitalsentences is to be at all rational, petitioner must show some-thing more in order for a court to reach the merits of hisclaims on a successive habeas petition than he would havehad to show to obtain relief on his \u00aerst habeas petition. 13 But, more importantly, petitioner's standard would so broaden the inquiry as to make it anything but a \u00aanarrow\u00baexception to the principle of \u00aenality that we have previouslydescribed it to be. A federal district judge confronted with 12Louisiana narrows the class of those eligible for the death penalty by limiting the type of offense for which it may be imposed, and by requiringa \u00aending of at least one aggravating circumstance. See supra, at 342. Statutory provisions for restricting eligibility may, of course, vary fromState to State. 13If a showing of actual innocence were reduced to actual prejudice, it would allow the evasion of the cause and prejudice standard which wehave held also acts as an \u00aaexception\u00ba to a defaulted, abusive, or successiveclaim. In practical terms a petitioner would no longer have to showcause, contrary to our prior cases. McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 494\u00b1 495 (1991); Carrier, 477 U. S., at 493.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 346 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Opinion of the Court a claim of actual innocence may with relative ease determine whether a submission, for example, that a k illing was not intentional, consists of credible, noncumulative, and admissi-ble evidence negating the element of intent. But it is a farmore dif\u00aecult task to assess how jurors would have reactedto additional showings of mitigating factors, particularly con-sidering the breadth of those factors that a jury under ourdecisions must be allowed to consider. 14 The Court of Appeals in this case took the middle ground among these three possibilities for de\u00aening \u00aaactual inno-cence\u00ba of the death penalty, and adopted this test: \u00aa[W]e must require the petitioner to show, based on the evidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair proba-bility that a rational trier of fact would have entertaineda reasonable doubt as to the existence of those factswhich are prerequisites under state or federal law forthe imposition of the death penalty.\u00ba 945 F. 2d, at 820(footnotes omitted). 14The \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard suggested by Justice Stevens ' opinion concurring in the judgment suffers from this weakness and othersas well. The term \u00aaclearly erroneous\u00ba derives from Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 52(a), which provides that \u00aa\u00aendings of fact [in actions triedwithout a jury] shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\u00ba Justice Stevens wrenches the term out of this context\u00d0where it applies to writ- ten factual \u00aendings made by a trial judge\u00d0and would apply it to the impo-sition of the death sentence by a jury or judge. Not only is the latterdetermination different both quantitatively and qualitatively from a \u00aend-ing of fact in a bench trial, but Justice Stevens would not even bring with the term its established meaning in reviewing fact\u00aendings in benchtrials. We held in United States v.United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948), and reaf\u00aermed in Anderson v.Bessemer City, 470 U. S. \u00aending is \u00aaclearly erroneous\u00ba when althoughthere is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidenceis left with the de\u00aenite and \u00aerm conviction that a mistake has been com-mitted.' \u00ba But Justice Stevens would apparently equate it with the standard traditionally used for review of jury verdicts\u00d0that no reasonablesentencer could have imposed the death penalty.

The Eleventh Circuit has adopted a similar \u00aaeligibil-ity\u00ba test for determining actual innocence. Johnson v.Sin- gletary, 938 F. 2d 1166 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91\u00b16576. 15 We agree with the Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Elev- enth Circuits that the \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba requirement mustfocus on those elements that render a defendant eligible forthe death penalty, and not on additional mitigating evidencethat was prevented from being introduced as a result of aclaimed constitutional error. In the present petition, Sawyer advances two claims, aris- ing from two distinct groups of evidentiary facts that werenot considered by the jury that convicted and sentencedSawyer. The \u00aerst group of evidence relates to petitioner'srole in the offense and consists of af\u00aedavits attacking thecredibility of Cynthia Shano and an af\u00aedavit claiming thatone of Shano's sons told a police of\u00aecer that Sawyer was notresponsible for pouring lighter \u00afuid on Arwood and lightingit, and that in fact Sawyer tried to prevent Charles Lanefrom lighting Arwood on \u00aere. Sawyer claims that the policefailed to produce this exculpatory evidence in violation of hisdue process rights under Brady v.Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The second group consists of medical records fromSawyer's stays as a teenager in two different mental health 15The Eleventh Circuit articulated the following test: \u00aaThus, a petitioner may make a colorable showing that he is actually inno- cent of the death penalty by presenting evidence that an alleged constitu-tional error implicates allof the aggravating factors found to be present by the sentencing body. That is, but for the alleged constitutional error,the sentencing body could not have found any aggravating factors and thus the petitioner was ineligible for the death penalty. In other words,the petitioner must show that absent the alleged constitutional error, thejury would have lacked the discretion to impose the death penalty; that is,that he is ineligible for the death penalty.\u00ba Johnson v.Singletary, 938 F. 2d, at 1183 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT 348 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Opinion of the Court institutions. Sawyer alleges ineffective assistance of coun- sel in trial counsel's failure to introduce these records in thesentencing phase of his trial. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner's failure to as- sert his Brady claim in his \u00aerst petition constituted an abuse of the writ, and that he had not shown cause for fa iling to raise the claim earlier under McCleskey. 945 F. 2d, at 824. The ineffective-assistance claim was held by the Court of Ap-peals to be a successive claim because it was rejected on themerits in Sawyer's \u00aerst petition, and petitioner failed toshow cause for not bringing all the evidence in support ofthis claim earlier.

Under Louisiana law, petitioner is eligible for the death penalty because he was convicted of \u00aerst-degree murder\u00d0that is, an intentional k illing while in the process of commit- ting an aggravated arson\u00d0and because at the sentencingphase the jury found two valid aggravating circumstances:that the murder was committed in the course of an aggra-vated arson, and that the murder was especially cruel, atro-cious, and heinous. The psychological evidence petitioneralleges was kept from the jury due to the ineffective assist-ance of counsel does not relate to petitioner's guilt or inno-cence of the crime. 16Neither does it relate to either of the aggravating factors found by the jury that made petitionereligible for the death penalty. Even if this evidence hadbeen before the jury, it cannot be said that a reasonable jurorwould not have found both of the aggravating factors that 16Petitioner does not allege that his mental condition was such that he could not form criminal intent under Louisiana law.

We are convinced that the evidence allegedly kept from the jury due to an alleged Brady violation also fails to show that the petitioner is actually innocent of the death penaltyto which he has been sentenced. Much of the evidence goesto the credibility of Shano, suggesting, e. g., that contrary to her testimony at trial she knew Charles Lane prior to theday of the murder; that she was drinking the day before themurder; and that she testi\u00aeed under a grant of immunityfrom the prosecutor. 2 App. 589\u00b1608. This sort of latter-day evidence brought forward to impeach a prosecution wit-ness will seldom, if ever, make a clear and convincing show-ing that no reasonable juror would have believed the heartof Shano's account of petitioner's actions. The \u00aenal bit of evidence petitioner alleges was unconstitu- tionally kept from the jury due to a Brady violation was a statement made by Shano's then 4-year-old son, Wayne, to apolice of\u00aecer the day after the murder. Petitioner has sub-mitted an af\u00aedavit from one Diane Thibodeaux stating thatshe was present when Wayne told a police detective whoasked who had lit Arwood on \u00aere that \u00aaDaddy help that the \u00aaother man\u00ba had pushed Saw-yer back into a chair. 2 App. 587. The af\u00aedavit also statesthat Wayne showed the of\u00aecer where to \u00aend a cigarettelighter and a can of lighter \u00afuid in the trash. Ibid. Be- cause this evidence goes to the jury's \u00aending of aggravatedarson, it goes both to petitioner's guilt or innocence of thecrime of \u00aerst-degree murder and the aggravating circum-stance of a murder committed in the course of an aggravatedarson. However, we conclude that this af\u00aedavit, in view of 17In the same category are the af\u00aedavits from petitioner's family mem- bers attesting to the deprivation and abuse by as achild. 2 App. 571\u00b1584.505US2104I SAWYER v.WHITLEY Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment all the other evidence in the record, does not show that no rational juror would \u00aend that petitioner committed both ofthe aggravating circumstances found by the jury. The mur-der was especially cruel, atrocious, and heinous based on theundisputed evidence of torture before the jury quite apartfrom the arson ( e. g., beating, scalding with bo iling water). As for the \u00aending of aggravated arson, we agree with theCourt of Appeals that, even crediting the information in thehearsay af\u00aedavit, 18it cannot be said that no reasonable juror would have found, in light of all the evidence, that petitionerwas guilty of the aggravated arson for his participationunder the Louisiana law of principals. 19 We therefore hold that petitioner has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutionalerror at his sentencing hearing, no reasonable juror wouldhave found him eligible for the death penalty under Louisi-ana law. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore Af\u00aermed. Justice Blackmun , concurring in the judgment. I cannot agree with the majority that a federal court is absolutely barred from reviewing a capital defendant's abu- 18Wayne Shano apparently has no clear memory of the crime today. Id., at 602\u00b1603. This fact, together with his tender years at the time of theoccurrence, suggests that Wayne himself would not corroborate the af\u00ae-davit of Diane Thibodeaux, thus suggesting an independent basis for refus-ing to \u00aend that the af\u00aedavit showed anything by clear and convincingevidence. 19Louisiana Rev.

For the reasons stated byJustice Stevens in his separate opinion, post, p. 360, which I join, I believe that the Court today adopts an undulycramped view of \u00aaactual innocence.\u00ba I write separately notto discuss the speci\u00aecs of the Court's standard, but insteadto reemphasize my opposition to an implicit premise underly-ing the Court's decision: that the only \u00aafundamental miscar-riage of justice\u00ba in a capital proceeding that warrants redressis one where the petitioner can make out a claim of \u00aaactualinnocence.\u00ba I also write separately to express my ever-growing skepticism that, with each new decision from thisCourt constricting the ability of the federal courts to remedyconstitutional errors, the death penalty really can be im-posed fairly and in accordance with the requirements of theEighth Amendment. I The Court repeatedly has recognized that principles of fundamental fairness underlie the writ of habeas corpus.See Engle v.Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126 (1982); Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 17\u00b118 (1963). Even as the Court has erected unprecedented and unwarranted barriers to thefederal judiciary's review of the merits of claims that stateprisoners failed properly to present to the state courts, orfailed to raise in their \u00aerst federal habeas petitions, or pre-viously presented to the federal courts for resolution, it con-sistently has acknowledged that exceptions to these rules ofunreviewability must exist to prevent violations of funda-mental fairness. See Engle, 456 U. S., at 135 (principles of \u00aenality and comity \u00aamust yield to the imperative of correct-ing a fundamentally unjust incarceration\u00ba). Thus, the Courthas held, federal courts may review procedurally defaulted,abusive, or successive claims absent a showing of cause and505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 352 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment prejudice if the failure to do so would thwart the \u00aaends of justice,\u00ba see Kuhlmann v.Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 455 (1986) (plurality opinion), or work a \u00aafundamental miscarriage ofjustice,\u00ba see Murray v.Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 495\u00b1496 (1986); v.Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537\u00b1538 (1986); Dug- gerv.Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 412, n. 6 (1989); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 493\u00b1494 (1991). By the traditional understanding of habeas corpus, a \u00aafun- damental miscarriage of justice\u00ba occurs whenever a convic-tion or sentence is secured in violation of a federal constitu-tional right. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(a) (federal courts \u00aashall entertain\u00ba habeas petitions from state prisoners who allegethat they are \u00aain custody in violation of the Constitutionor laws or treaties of the United States\u00ba); Smith, 477 U. S., at 543\u00b1544 ( Stevens, J. , dissenting). Justice Holmes ex- plained that the concern of a federal court in reviewing thevalidity of a conviction and death sentence on a writ ofhabeas corpus is \u00aasolely the question whether [the petition-er's] constitutional rights have been preserved.\u00ba Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 88 (1923). In a trio of 1986 decisions, however, the Court ignored these traditional teachings and, out of a purported concernfor state sovereignty, for the preservation of state resources,and for the \u00aenality of state-court judgments, shifted the fo-cus of federal habeas review of procedurally defaulted, suc-cessive, or abusive claims away from the preservation of con-stitutional rights to a fact-based inquiry into the petitioner'sinnocence or guilt. See Wilson, 477 U. S., at 454 (plurality opinion) (\u00aa[T]he `ends of justice' require federal courts to en-tertain [successive] petitions only where the prisoner supple-ments his constitutional claim with a colorable showing offactual innocence\u00ba); Carrier, 477 U. S., at 496 (\u00aa[I]n an ex- traordinary case, where a constitutional violation has prob-ably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually inno-cent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in theabsence of a showing of cause for the procedural default\u00ba);505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 353 Cite as: 505 U.

S., at 493 (applying Carrier standard in \u00aaabuse of the writ\u00ba context). The Court itself has acknowledged that \u00aathe concept of `actual,' as distinct from `legal,' innocence does not translateeasily into the context of an alleged error at the sentencingphase of a trial on a capital offense.\u00ba Smith, 477 U. S., at 537. Undaunted by its own illogic, however, the Courtadopted just such an approach in Smith. There, the Court was confronted with a claim that the introduction at sentenc- ing of inculpatory statements made by Smith to a court-appointed psychiatrist violated the Fifth Amendment be-cause Smith had not been informed that his statementsmight be used against him or that he had the right to remainsilent and to have counsel present. Although the Court as-sumed the validity of Smith's Fifth Amendment claim 1and recognized the potential impact of the statement on the jury,which found the aggravating circumstance of \u00aafuture danger-ousness\u00ba satis\u00aeed, see id.,at 538, it nonetheless concluded, remarkably and summarily, that admission of the statementdid not \u00aapervert the jury's deliberations concerning the ulti-mate question whether in fact petitioner constituted a con- tinuing threat to society,\u00ba ibid. (emphasis in original). Be- cause Michael Smith could not demonstrate cause for hisprocedural default, and because, in the Court's view, he hadnot made a substantial showing that the alleged constitu-tional violation \u00aaundermined the accuracy of the guilt or sen-tencing determination,\u00ba id., at 539, his Fifth Amendment claim went unaddressed and he was executed on July 31,1986. 1Justice Stevens explained in his dissenting opinion in Smith, 477 U. S., at 551\u00b1553, that the introduction of the inculpatory statement clearlyviolated Smith's rights as in judgment InDugger v.Adams, the Court continued to equate the notion of a \u00aafundamental miscarriage of justice\u00ba in a capitaltrial with the petitioner's ability to show that he or she\u00aaprobably is `actually innocent' of the sentence he or she re-ceived,\u00ba 489 U. S., at 412, n. 6, but appeared to narrow theinquiry even further. Adams' claim, that the trial judgerepeatedly had misinformed the jurors, in violation of theEighth Amendment and Caldwell v.Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), that their sentencing vote was strictly advisoryin nature (when in fact Florida law permitted the judge tooverturn the jury's sentencing decision only upon a clear and convincing showing that its choice was erroneous), surelysatis\u00aeed the standard articulated in Smith: whether peti- tioner can make out a \u00aasubstantial claim that the allegederror undermined the accuracy of the guilt or sentencing de-termination.\u00ba 477 U. S., at 539. In a cryptic discussion rel-egated to a footnote at the end of its opinion, the Court inAdams rejected this obvious application of the Smith stand- ard, apparently for no other reason than its belief thatAdams' ability to demonstrate a \u00aafundamental miscarriage ofjustice\u00ba in this case somehow would convert an \u00aaextraordi-nary\u00ba exception into an \u00aaordinary\u00ba one. See 489 U. S., at412, n. 6. In rejecting the Smith standard, the Court did not even bother to substitute another in its place. See 489U. S., at 412, n. 6 (\u00aaWe do not undertake here to de\u00aene whatit means to be `actually innocent' of a death TheCourt refused to address Aubrey Adams' claim of constitu-tional error, and he was executed on May 4, 1989.

Although the District Court granted relief to McCleskey onhis claim that state authorities deliberately had elicitedinculpatory admissions from him in violation of his Sixth505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 355 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 201 (1964), and excused his failure to present theclaim in his \u00aerst federal habeas petition because the Statehad withheld documents and information establishing thatclaim, see 499 U. S., at 475\u00b1476, the Court concluded thatMcCleskey lacked cause for fa iling to raise the claim earlier, id.,at 502. More important for our purposes, the Court con- cluded that the \u00aanarrow exception\u00ba by which federal courtsmay \u00aaexercise [their] equitable discretion correct a miscar-riage \u00aano avail\u00ba to McCleskey: The \u00aa Mas- siah violation, if it be one, resulted in the admission at trial of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect the re-liability of the guilt determination.\u00ba Ibid. The Court re- fused to address Warren McCleskey's claim of constitutionalerror, and he was executed on September 24, 1991. The Court today takes for granted that the foregoing deci- sions correctly limited the concept of a \u00aafundamental of justice\u00ba to \u00aaactual innocence,\u00ba even as it the \u00aanatural usage of those words\u00ba and resortingto \u00aaanalog[s],\u00ba see ante, at 341, to make sense of \u00aaactual inno- cence\u00ba in the capital context. I continue to believe, how-ever, that the Court's \u00aaexaltation of accuracy as the onlycharacteristic of `fundamental fairness' is deeply \u00afawed.\u00baSmith, 477 U. S., at 545 ( Stevens, J. , dissenting). As an initial matter, the Court's focus on factual innocence is inconsistent with Congress' grant of habeas corpus juris-diction, pursuant to which federal courts are instructed toentertain petitions from state prisoners who allege that theyare held \u00aain custody in violation of the Constitution or lawsor treaties of the United States.\u00ba 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254(a). Thejurisdictional grant contains no support for the Court's deci-sion to narrow the reviewing authority and obligation of thefederal courts to claims of factual innocence. See also 28U. S. C. \u00a7 2243 (\u00aaThe court shall . dispose of the matter aslaw and justice require\u00ba). In addition, the actual innocencestandard requires a reviewing federal court, unnaturally, to505US2104I concurring in judgment \u00aafunction in much the same capacity as the state trier of fact\u00ba; that is, to \u00aamake a rough decision on the question ofguilt or innocence.\u00ba Wilson, 477 U. S., at 471, n. 7 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Most important, however, the focus on innocence assumes, erroneously, that the only value worth protecting throughfederal habeas review is the accuracy and reliability of theguilt determination. But \u00aa[o]ur criminal justice system, andour Constitution, protect other values in addition to the re-liability of the guilt or innocence determination, and the stat-utory duty to serve `law and justice' should similarly re\u00afectthose values.\u00ba Smith, 477 U. S., at 545 ( Stevens, J. , dis- senting). The accusatorial system of justice adopted by theFounders affords a defendant certain process-based protec-tions that do not have accuracy of truth \u00aending as their pri- mary goal. These protections\u00d0including the Fifth Amend-ment right against compelled self-incrimination, the EighthAmendment right against the imposition of an arbitrary andcapricious sentence, the Fourteenth Amendment right to betried by an impartial judge, and the Fourteenth Amendmentright not to be indicted by a grand jury or tried by a petitjury from which members of the defendant's race have beensystematically excluded\u00d0are debased, and indeed, renderedlargely irrelevant, in a system that values the accuracy ofthe guilt determination above individual rights. Nowhere is this single-minded focus on actual innocence more misguided than in a case where a defendant alleges aconstitutional error in the sentencing phase of a capital trial.The Court's ongoing struggle to give meaning to \u00aainnocenceof death\u00ba simply re\u00afects the inappropriateness of the inquiry.See Smith, 477 U. S., at 537; Adams, 489 U. S., at 412, n. 6; ante, at 340. \u00aaGuilt or innocence is irrelevant in that con- text; rather, there is only a decision made by representativesof the community whether the prisoner shall live or die.\u00baWilson, 477 U. S., at 471\u00b1472, n. 7 (Brennan, J., dissenting).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 357 Cite as: 505 U.

Only by returning to the federal courts' central and tradi- tional function on habeas review, evaluating claims of consti-tutional error, can the Court ensure that the ends of justiceare served and that fundamental miscarriages of justice donot go unremedied. The Court would do well to heed Jus-tice Black's admonition: \u00aa[I]t is never too late for courts inhabeas corpus proceedings to look straight through proce-dural screens in order to prevent forfeiture of life or libertyin \u00afagrant de\u00aeance of the Constitution.\u00ba Brown v.Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 554 (1953) (dissenting opinion). 2 II A When I was on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, I once observed, in the course of reviewing adeath sentence on a writ of habeas corpus, that the decisionalprocess in a capital case is \u00aaparticularly excruciating\u00ba forsomeone \u00aawho is not personally convinced of the rightnessof capital punishment and who questions it as an effectivedeterrent.\u00ba Maxwell v.Bishop, 398 F. 2d 138, 153\u00b1154 (1968), vacated, 398 U. S. 262 (1970). At the same time, how-ever, I stated my then belief that \u00aathe advisability of capitalpunishment is a policy matter ordinarily to be resolved bythe legislature.\u00ba Id.,at 154. Four years later, as a Member of this Court, I echoed those sentiments in my separate dis-senting opinion in Furman v.Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 405 (1972). Although I reiterated my personal distaste for the 2Notwithstanding my view that the Court has erred in narrowing the concept of a \u00aafundamental miscarriage of justice\u00ba to cases of \u00aaactual inno-cence,\u00ba I have attempted faithfully to apply the \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba stand-ard in prior cases. See, e. g., Dugger v.Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 424, n. 15 (1989) (dissenting opinion). I therefore join Justice Stevens ' analysis of the \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba standard and his application of that standard tothe facts of this case. See post, p. 360.505US2104I PAGES OPINPGT 358 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment death penalty and my doubt that it performs any meaningful deterrent function, see id.,at 405\u00b1406, I declined to join my Brethren in declaring the state statutes at issue in thosecases unconstitutional. See id.,at 411 (\u00aaWe should not allow our personal preferences as to the wisdom of legislative andcongressional action, or our distaste for such action, to guideour judicial decision\u00ba). My ability in Maxwell, Furman, and the many other capi- tal cases I have reviewed during my tenure on the federalbench to enforce, notwithstanding my own deep moral res-ervations, a legislature's considered judgment that capitalpunishment is an appropriate sanction, has always rested onan understanding that certain procedural safeguards, chiefamong them the Federal Judiciary's power to reach and cor-rect claims of constitutional error on federal habeas review,would ensure that death sentences are fairly imposed.Today, more than 20 years later, I wonder what is left of thatpremise underlying my acceptance of the death penalty. B Only last Term I had occasion to lament the Court's contin- uing \u00aacrusade to erect petty procedural barriers in the pathof any state prisoner seeking review of his federal constitu-tional claims\u00ba and its transformation of \u00aathe duty to protectfederal rights into a self-fashioned abdication.\u00ba Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759, 761 (1991) (dissenting opinion). This Term has witnessed the continued narrowing of the av-enues of relief available to federal habeas petitioners seekingredress of their constitutional claims. See, e. g., Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992) (overruling in part Town- send v.Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963)). It has witnessed, as well, the execution of two victims of the \u00aanew habeas,\u00ba WarrenMcCleskey and Roger Keith Coleman. Warren McCleskey's case seemed the archetypal \u00aafunda- mental miscarriage of justice\u00ba that the federal courts arecharged with remedying. As noted McCleskey dem-505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 359 333 (1992) Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment onstrated that state of\u00aecials deliberately had elicited inculpa- tory admissions from him in violation of his Sixth Amend-ment rights and had withheld information he needed topresent his claim for relief. In addition, McCleskey arguedconvincingly in his \u00aenal hours that he could not even obtainan impartial clemency hearing because of threats by stateof\u00aecials against the pardons and parole board. That theCourt permitted McCleskey to be executed without everhearing the merits of his claims starkly reveals the Court'sskewed value system, in which \u00aenality of judgments, conser-vation of state resources, and expediency of executions seem to receive greater solicitude than justice and human life.See McCleskey v.Bowers, 501 U. S. 1281 (1991) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of stay of execution). The execution of Roger Keith Coleman is no less an affront to principles of fundamental fairness. Last Term, the Courtrefused to review the merits of Coleman's claims by effec-tively overruling, at Coleman's expense, precedents holdingthat state-court decisions are presumed to be based on themerits (and therefore, are subject to federal habeas review)unless they explicitly reveal that they were based on stateprocedural grounds. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 762\u00b1764 (dissenting opinion). Moreover, the Court's refusal lastmonth to grant a temporary stay of execution so that thelower courts could conduct a hearing into Coleman's well-supported claim that he was innocent of the underlying of-fense demonstrates the resounding hollowness of the Court'sprofessed commitment to employ the \u00aafundamental miscar-riage of justice exception\u00ba as a \u00aasafeguard against compe lling an innocent man to suffer an unconstitutional loss of lib-erty.\u00ba McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S., at 495 (internal quota- tion marks omitted). See Coleman v.Thompson, 504 U. S. 188, 189 (1992) (opinion dissenting from denial of stay ofexecution). As I review the state of this Court's capital jurisprudence, I thus am left to wonder how the ever-shrinking authority of505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 360 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment the federal courts to reach and redress constitutional errors affects the legitimacy of the death penalty itself. SinceGregg v.Georgia, the Court has upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty where suf\u00aecient procedural safeguardsexist to ensure that the State's administration of the penaltyis neither arbitrary nor capricious. See 428 U. S. 153, 189,195 (1976) (joint opinion); Lockett v.Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 601 (1978). At the time those decisions issued, federal courtspossessed much broader authority than they do today to ad-dress claims of constitutional error on habeas review and,therefore, to examine the adequacy of a State's capitalscheme and the fairness and reliability of its decision toimpose the death penalty in a particular case. The morethe Court constrains the federal courts' power to reach theconstitutional claims of those sentenced to death, the morethe Court undermines the very legitimacy of capital punish-ment itself. Justice Stevens , with whom Justice Blackmun and Justice O\u0092Connor join, concurring in the judgment. Only 10 years ago, the Court reemphasized that \u00aa[t]he writ of habeas corpus indisputably holds an honored position inour jurisprudence. Tracing its roots deep into English com-mon law, it claims a place in Art. I of our Constitution.Today, as in prior centuries, the writ is a bulwark againstconvictions that violate `fundamental fairness.' Wainwright v.Sykes, concurring).\u00ba Engle v.Isaac, 456 U. S. 126 (1982). It is this centrality of \u00aafundamental fairness\u00ba that has led the Court to hold thathabeas review of a defaulted, successive, or abusive claim isavailable, even absent a showing of cause, if failure to con-sider the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage ofjustice. See Sanders v.United States, 373 U. S. 1, Engle, 456 U. S., at 135. InMurray v.Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 495, 496 (1986), the Court ruled that the concept of \u00aafundamental miscarriage ofjustice\u00ba applies to those cases in which the defendant was505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 361 Cite as: 505 U. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment \u00aaprobabl y...a c t u a l l yi nnocent.\u00ba The Court held that \u00aain an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation hasprobably resulted in the conviction of one who is actuallyinnocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even inthe absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.\u00baId.,at 496. Having equated the \u00aaends of justice\u00ba with \u00aaac- tual innocence,\u00ba the Court is now confronted with the taskof giving meaning to \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba in the context of acapital sentencing proceeding\u00d0hence the phrase \u00aainnocenceof death.\u00ba While the conviction of an innocent person may be the ar- chetypal case of a manifest miscarriage of justice, it is notthe only case. There is no reason why \u00aaactual innocence\u00bamust be both an animating and the limiting principle of the work of federal courts in furthering the \u00aaends of justice.\u00baAs Judge Friendly emphasized, there are contexts in which,irrespective of guilt or innocence, constitutional errors vio-late fundamental fairness. Friendly, Is Innocence Irrele-vant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi.L. Rev. 142, 151\u00b1154 (1970). Fundamental fairness is morethan accuracy at trial; justice is more than guilt or innocence. Nowhere is this more true than in capital sentencing pro- ceedings. Because the death penalty is qualitatively andmorally different from any other penalty, \u00aa[i]t is of vital im-portance to the defendant and to the community that anydecision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be,the consequence of scrupulously fair procedures.\u00ba Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 545\u00b1546 (1986) ( Stevens, J. , dissent- ing). Accordingly, the ends of justice dictate that \u00aa[w]hena condemned prisoner raises a substantial, colorable EighthAmendment violation, there is a special obligatio n...t o consider whether the prisoner's claim would render his sen-tencing proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u00ba Id.,at 546. Thus the Court's \u00aerst and most basic error today is that it asks the wrong question. Charged with averting manifestmiscarriages of justice, the Court instead narrowly recasts505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 362 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment its duty as redressing cases of \u00aaactual innocence.\u00ba This error aside, under a proper interpretation of the Carrier analysis, the Court's de\u00aenition of \u00aainnocence of death\u00ba isplainly wrong because it disregards well-settled law\u00d0boththe law of habeas corpus and the law of capital punishment. I The Court today holds that, absent a showing of cause, a federal court may not review a capital defendant's defaulted,successive, or abusive claims unless the defendant \u00aashow[s] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror wouldhave found [him] eligible for the death penalty.\u00ba Ante, at 336. This de\u00aenition of \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba deviates from our established jurisprudence in two ways. First, the\u00aaclear and convincing evidence\u00ba standard departs from a lineof decisions de\u00aening the \u00aaactual innocence\u00ba exception to thecause-and-prejudice requirement. Second, and more funda-mentally, the Court's focus on eligibility for the death pen- alty con\u00aficts with the very structure of the constitutionallaw of capital punishment. As noted above, in Murray v.Carrier, the Court held that in those cases in which \u00aaa constitutional violation has prob- ably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually inno- cent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in theabsence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.\u00ba477 U. S., at 496 (emphasis added). The Court has sincefrequently con\u00aermed this standard. See, e. g., Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 748 (1991); Dugger v.Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 412, n. 6 (1989); Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 313 (1989). In subsequent decisions, both those involving \u00aainno-cence of the offense\u00ba and those involving \u00aainnocence of thedeath sentence,\u00ba the Court has employed the same standardof proof. For example, in Smith v.Murray, 477 U. S. 527505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 363 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment (1986), the Court repeated the Carrier standard and applied it in a capital sentencing proceeding. The Court ruled thatSmith's claim did not present \u00aathe risk of a manifest miscar-riage of justice\u00ba as it was \u00aadevoid of any substantial claimthat the alleged error undermined the accuracy of the guiltor sentencing determination.\u00ba 477 U. S., at 538\u00b1539. Simi-larly, in Dugger v.Adams, a case involving \u00aainnocence of the death sentence,\u00ba the Court stated the contro lling st andard as whether an \u00aaindividual defendant probably is `actually innocent' of the sentence he or she received.\u00ba 489 U. S., at412, n. 6 (emphasis added). In sum, in construing both \u00aain- nocence of the offense\u00ba and \u00aainnocence of the death sen-tence,\u00ba we have consistently required a defendant to showthat the alleged constitutional error has more likely than not created a fundamental miscarriage of justice. As we noted in another context, \u00aa[t]his outcome- determinative standard has several strengths. It de\u00aenesthe relevant inquiry in a way familiar to courts, though theinquiry, as is inevitable, is anything but precise. The stand-ard also re\u00afects the profound importance of \u00aenality in crimi-nal proceedings. Moreover, it comports with the widelyused standard for assessing motions for new trial based onnewly discovered evidence.\u00ba Strickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 693\u00b1694 (1984). Equally signi\u00aecant, this \u00aaprobably resulted\u00ba standard is well calibrated to the manifest miscarriage of justice excep-tion. Not only does the standard respect the competingdemands of \u00aenality and fundamental fairness, it also \u00aetssquarely within our habeas jurisprudence. In general, afederal court may entertain a defaulted, successive, or abu-sive claim if a prisoner demonstrates cause and prejudice.See generally McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 493\u00b1495 (1991). To show \u00aaprejudice,\u00ba a defendant must demonstrate\u00aaa reasonable probability that, but for [the alleged] erro[r],the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u00baStrickland, 466 U. S., at 694; see also United States v.Bag-505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 364 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment ley, 473 U. S. 667, 682, 685 (1985). The \u00aamiscarriage of jus- tice\u00ba exception to this general rule requires a more substan-tial showing: The defendant must not simply demonstrate areasonable probability of a different result, he must show that the alleged error more likely than not created a mani- fest miscarriage of justice. This regime makes logical sense.If a defendant cannot show cause and can only show a \u00aarea-sonable probability\u00ba of a different outcome, a federal courtshould not hear his defaulted, successive, or abusive claim.Only in the \u00aaexceptional case\u00ba in which a defendant can showthat the alleged constitutional error \u00aaprobably resulted\u00ba in the conviction (or sentencing) of one innocent of the offense(or the death sentence) should the court hear the defend-ant's claim. The Court today repudiates this established standard of proof and replaces it with a requirement that a defendant\u00aashow by clear and convincing evidence t h a t...n o reason- able juror would have found [him] eligible for the death pen-alty.\u00ba Ante, at 336 (emphasis supplied). I see no reason to reject the established and well-functioning \u00aaprobably re-sulted\u00ba standard and impose such a severe burden on thecapital defendant. Although we have frequently recognizedthe State's strong interest in \u00aenality, we have never sug-gested that that interest is suf\u00aecient to outweigh the individ-ual's claim to innocence. To the contrary, the \u00aaactual inno-cence\u00ba exception itself manifests our recognition that thecriminal justice system occasionally errs and that, when itdoes, \u00aenality must yield to justice. \u00aaThe function of a standard of proo f...i st o` i nstruct the fact\u00aender concerning the degree of con\u00aedence our societythinks he should have in the correctness of factual con-clusions for a particular type of adjudication.'. . . The stand-ard serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigantsand to indicate the relative importance attached to the ul-timate decision.\u00ba Addington v.Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979) (citation omitted). Neither of these considerations505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 365 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment supports the heightened standard of proof the Court im- poses today. First, there is no basis for requiring a federal court to be virtually certain that the defendant is actually ineligible forthe death penalty before merely entertaining his claim. We have required a showing by clear and convincing evidence inseveral contexts: For example, the medical facts underlyinga civil commitment must be established by this standard,Addington v.Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979), as must \u00aaactual malice\u00ba in a libel suit brought by a public of\u00aecial. New York Times Co. v.Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279\u00b1280 (1964); see also Anderson v.Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242 (1986). And we have required a related showing in cases involving depor-tation, Woodby v.INS, 385 U. S. 276, 285\u00b1286 (1966), and de- naturalization, Schneiderman v.United States, 320 U. S. 118, 125 (1943). In each of these contexts, the interests of thenonmoving party were truly substantial: personal libertyinAddington, freedom of expression in New York Times, residence in Woodby, and citizenship in Schneiderman. In my opinion, the State's interest in \u00aenality in a capital prose-cution is not nearly as great as any of these interests. In-deed, it is important to remember that \u00aainnocence of thedeath sentence\u00ba is not a standard for staying or vacatinga death sentence, but merely a standard for determiningwhether or not a court should reach the merits of a defaultedclaim. The State's interest in \u00aa\u00aenality\u00ba in this contextcertainly does not warrant a \u00aaclear and convincing\u00ba eviden-tiary standard. Nor is there any justi\u00aecation for allocating the risk of error to fall so severely upon the capital defendant or attachinggreater importance to the initial sentence than to the issueof whether that sentence is appropriate. The States them-selves have declined to attach such weight to capital sen-tences: Most States provide plain-error review for defaultedclaims in capital cases. See Smith v.Murray, 477 U. S., at 548\u00b1550, n. 20 (collecting authorities). In this regard, the505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 366 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, in judgment Court's requirement that \u00aainnocence of death\u00ba must be dem- \u00aaclear and evidence\u00ba fails to respectthe uniqueness of death penalty decisions: Nowhere is theneed for accuracy greater than when the State exercises itsultimate authority and takes the life of one of its citizens. Indeed, the Court's ruling creates a perverse double stand- ard. While a defendant raising defaulted claims in a non-capital case must show that constitutional error \u00aaprobablyresulted\u00ba in a miscarriage of justice, a capital defendant mustpresent \u00aaclear and convincing evidence\u00ba that no reasonablejuror would \u00aend him eligible for the death penalty. It isheartlessly perverse to impose a more stringent standard ofproof to avoid a miscarriage of justice in a capital case thanin a noncapital case. In sum, I see no reason to depart from settled law, which clearly requires a defendant pressing a defaulted, successive,or abusive claim to show that a failure to hear his claim will\u00aaprobably result\u00ba in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.In my opinion, a corresponding standard governs a de-faulted, successive, or abusive challenge to a capital sen-tence: The defendant must show that he is probably\u00d0thatis, more likely than not\u00d0\u00aainnocent of the death sentence.\u00ba II The Court recognizes that the proper de\u00aenition of \u00aainno- cence of the death sentence\u00ba must involve a reweighing ofthe evidence and must focus on the sentencer's likely evalua-tion of that evidence. Thus, the Court directs federal courtsto look to whether a \u00aareasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty.\u00ba Ante, at 336 (em- phasis added). Nevertheless, the Court inexplicably limitsthis inquiry in two ways. First, the Court holds that courtsshould consider only evidence concerning aggravating fac- tors. As demonstrated below, this limitation is wholly with-out foundation and neglects the central role of mitigat-ing evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. Second, the505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 367 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Court requires a petitioner to refute his eligibility for the death penalty. This narrow de\u00aenition of \u00aainnocence of thedeath sentence\u00ba fails to recognize that, in rare cases, eventhough a defendant is eligible for the death penalty, such asentence may nonetheless constitute a fundamental miscar-riage of justice. It is well established that, \u00aain capital cases, the sentencer may not refuse to consider or be precluded from consideringany relevant mitigating evidence.\u00ba Hitchcock v.Dugger, 481 U. S. 393, 394 (1987) (internal quotation marks and cita-tions omitted). Yet in ascribing a narrow, eligibility-basedmeaning to \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba the Court ne-glects this rudimentary principle. As the Court recognizes, a single general directive ani- mates and informs our capital-punishment jurisprudence: \u00aa[T]he death penalty [may not] be imposed that creat[e] a substantial risk that [the deathpenalty] would be in\u00aficted in an arbitrary and capriciousmanner.\u00ba Gregg v.Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (opin- ion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ. ). As applied and developed over the years, this constitutional requirement hasyielded two central principles. First, a sentencing schememust \u00aagenuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for thedeath penalty.\u00ba Zant v.Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983). Second, the sentencer must \u00aanot be precluded from consider-ing, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's char- acter or record and any of the circumstances of the offensethat the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less thandeath.\u00ba Lockett v.Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (emphasis in original). Although these princi-ples\u00d0one narrowing the relevant class, the other broadeningthe scope of considered evidence\u00d0seemingly point in oppo-site directions, in fact both serve the same end: ensuringthat a capital sentence is the product of individualized andreasoned moral decisionmaking.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 368 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Against this backdrop of well-settled law, the Court's rul- ing is a startling anomaly. The Court holds that \u00aainnocenceof the death sentence\u00ba concerns only \u00aathose elements thatrender a defendant eligible for the death penalty, and not . . . additional mitigating evidence that [constitutional error precluded] from being introduced.\u00ba Ante, at 347 (emphasis added). Stated bluntly, the Court today respects only oneof the two bedrock principles of capital-punishment juris-prudence. As such, the Court's impoverished vision of capi-tal sentencing is at odds with both the doctrine and thetheory developed in our many decisions concerning capitalpunishment. First, the Court implicitly repudiates the requirement that the sentencer be allowed to consider all relevant mitigatingevidence, a constitutive element of our Eighth Amendmentjurisprudence. We have reiterated and applied this princi-ple in more than a dozen cases over the last 14 years. Forexample, in Eddings v.Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), we overturned a capital sentence because the sentencer refusedto consider certain mitigating evidence. Similarly, in Skip- per v.South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), we ruled that a State cannot preclude consideration of evidence of postincar-ceration, pretrial good behavior. And in Penry v.Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989), we held that death penaltyscheme impermissibly restricted the jury's consideration ofthe defendant's mental retardation as mitigating evidence. 1 Moreover, the Court's holding also clashes with the theory underlying our capital-punishment jurisprudence. The non-arbitrariness\u00d0and therefore the constitutionality\u00d0of thedeath penalty rests on individualized sentencing determi- nations. See generally California v.Brown, 479 U. S. 538, 544\u00b1546 (1987) U. S. 433 (1990); Franklin v.Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164 (1988); Mills v.Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988); Hitchcock v.Dugger, 481 U. S. 393 (1987); Bell (1978).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 369 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment ference between the guided-discretion regime upheld in Gregg v.Georgia and the mandatory death-sentence regime invalidated in Roberts v.Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976). The Roberts scheme was constitutionally in\u00aerm because it left no room for individualized moral judgments, because itfailed to provide the sentencer with a \u00aameaningful opportu-nity [to] conside[r the] mitigating factors presented by thecircumstances of the particular crime or by the attributesof the individual offender.\u00ba Id., at 333\u00b1334 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ. ). The Court's de\u00aenition of \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba is like the statutoryscheme in Roberts: It focuses solely on whether the defend- ant is in a class eligible for the death penalty and disregardsthe equally important question whether \u00aa `death (quoting Woodson v.North Car- olina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976)). 2 The Court's de\u00aenition of \u00aainnocent of the death sentence\u00ba is \u00afawed in a second, related way. The Court's analysis notonly neglects errors that preclude a sentencer's consider-ation of mitigating factors; it also focuses too narrowly oneligibility. The Court requires a defendant to call into question allof the aggravating factors found by the sen- tencer and thereby show himself ineligible for the deathpenalty. 2The Court rejects the argument that federal courts should also con- sider mitigating evidence because consideration of such evidence involves the \u00aafar more dif\u00aecult task [of] assess[ing] how jurors would have reactedto additional showings.\u00ba Ante, at 346. I see no such difference between consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances; both requirethe federal courts to reconsider and anticipate a sentencer's decision: Bythe Court's own standard federal courts must determine whether a \u00aarea-sonable juror would have found\u00ba certain facts. Thus, the Court's reasonfor barring federal courts from considering mitigating circumstances ap-plies equally to the standard that itendorses. Its exclusion of mitigating evidence from consideration is therefore wholly arbitrary.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 370 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Contrary to the Court's suggestion, however, there may be cases in which, although the defendant remains eligiblefor the death penalty, imposition of a death sentence wouldconstitute a manifest miscarriage of justice. If, for example,the sentencer, in assigning a sentence of death, relied heavilyon a \u00aending that the defendant severely tortured the victim,but later it is discovered that another person was responsiblefor the torture, the elimination of the aggravating cir-cumstance will, in some cases, indicate that the death sen-tence was a miscarriage of justice. By imposing an \u00aaall-or-nothing\u00ba eligibility test, the Court's de\u00aenition of \u00aainnocentof the death sentence\u00ba fails to acknowledge this importantpossibility. In sum, the Court's \u00aainnocent of the death sentence\u00ba stand- ard is \u00afawed both in its failure to consider constitutional er-rors implicating mitigating factors and in its unduly harshrequirement that a defendant's eligibility for the death pen-alty be disproved. III In my opinion, the \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba standard must take into account several factors. First, sucha standard must re\u00afect both of the basic principles of our capital-punishment jurisprudence. The standard must rec-ognize both the need to de\u00aene narrowly the class of \u00aadeath-eligible\u00ba defendants and the need to de\u00aene broadly the scopeof mitigating evidence permitted the capital sentencer. Sec- ond, the \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba standard shouldalso recognize the distinctive character of the capital sen-tencing decision. While the question of innocence or guiltof the offense is essentially a question of fact, the choice be-tween life imprisonment and capital punishment is both aquestion of underlying fact and a matter of reasoned moraljudgment. Thus, there may be some situations in which, al-though the defendant remains technically \u00aaeligible\u00ba for thedeath sentence, nonetheless, in light of all of the evidence,505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 371 Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment that sentence constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice. Finally, the \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba standard mustalso respect the \u00aaprofound importance of \u00aenality in criminalproceedings,\u00ba Strickland v.Washington, 466 U. S., at 693\u00b1 694, and the \u00aaheavy burden\u00ba that successive habeas petitions place \u00aaon scarce federal judicial resources.\u00ba McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 491. These requirements are best met by a standard that pro- vides that a defendant is \u00aainnocent of the death sentence\u00baonly if his capital sentence is clearly erroneous. This stand- ard encompasses several types of error. A death sentenceis clearly erroneous if, taking into account all of the availableevidence, the sentencer lacked the legal authority to imposesuch a sentence because, under state law, the defendant wasnot eligible for the death penalty. Similarly, in the case ofa \u00aajury override,\u00ba a death sentence is clearly erroneous if,taking into account all of the evidence, the evidentiary pre-requisites for that override (as established by state law)were not met. See, e. g., Johnson v.Singletary, 938 F. 2d 1166, 1194\u00b11195 (CA11 1991) (Tjo\u00afat, C. J., concurring in partand dissenting in part) (concluding that the sentencing\u00aajudge, as a matter of law, could not have sentenced the peti-tioner to death\u00ba because there was insuf\u00aecient evidence tomeet the jury-override standard established in Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975)). A death sentence is also clearly erroneous under a \u00aabalancing\u00ba regime if, in viewof all of the evidence, mitigating circumstances so far out-weighed aggravating circumstances that no reasonable sen-tencer would have imposed the death penalty. Cf. Jackson v.Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 316\u00b1318 (1979). Such a case might arise if constitutional error either precluded the defendantfrom demonstrating that aggravating circumstances did notobtain or precluded the sentencer's consideration of impor-tant mitigating evidence.505US2104I 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 372 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Unlike the standard suggested by the Court, this standard acknowledges both the \u00aaaggravation\u00ba and \u00aamitigation\u00ba as-pects of capital-punishment law. It recognizes that, in theextraordinary case, constitutional error may have precludedconsideration of mitigating circumstances so substantial asto warrant a court's review of a defaulted, successive, or abu-sive claim. It also recognizes that, again in the extraor-dinary case, constitutional error may have inaccurately dem-onstrated aggravating circumstances so substantial as towarrant review of a defendant's claims. Moreover, the \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard is duly protec- tive of the State's legitimate interests in \u00aenality and respect-ful of the systemic and institutional costs of successive ha-beas litigation. The standard is stringent: If the sentence\u00aais plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u00ba itis not clearly erroneous \u00aaeven though [the court is] convincedthat had it been sitting as the [sentencer], it would haveweighed the evidence differently.\u00ba Anderson v.Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574 (1985). At the same time, \u00aaclearly- erroneous\u00ba review allows a federal court to entertain a de-faulted claim in the rare case in which the \u00aacourt on theentire evidence is left with the de\u00aenite and \u00aerm convictionthat a mistake has been committed.\u00ba United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948). Finally, the \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard is workable. As was true of the cause-and-prejudice standard adopted in Mc- Cleskey v.Zant, the clear-error standard is \u00aa[w]ell-de\u00aened in the case law [and] familiar to federal courts ....T h es t andard is an objective one, and can be applied in a manner that com-ports with the threshold nature of the abuse of the writ in-quiry.\u00ba 499 U. S., at 496. Federal courts have long appliedthe \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard pursuant to Rule 52 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and have done so \u00aaincivil contempt actions, condemnation proceedings, copyrightappeals, [and] forfeiture actions for illegal activity.\u00ba 1S. Childress & M. Davis, Standards of 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 373 505 U. S. 333 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment (1986) (citing cases).3This workability supports the applica- tion of the \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard to the \u00aainnocence ofthe death sentence\u00ba inquiry. In my opinion, then, the \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard is the core of the \u00aainnocence of the death sentence\u00ba exception.Just as a defendant who presses a defaulted, successive, orabusive claim and who cannot show cause must demonstratethat it is more likely than not that he is actually innocent ofthe offense, so a capital defendant who presses such a claimand cannot show cause must demonstrate that it is morelikely than not that his death sentence was clearly erroneous.Absent such a showing, a federal court may not reach themerits of the defendant's defaulted, successive, or abusiveclaim. IV It remains to apply this standard to the case at hand. As the majority indicates, Sawyer alleges two constitutionalerrors. First, he contends that the State withheld certainexculpatory evidence, in violation of Sawyer's due processrights as recognized in Brady v.Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). Second, Sawyer argues that his trial counsel's fail-ure to uncover and present records from Sawyer's earliertreatments in psychiatric institutions deprived him of ef-fective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the SixthAmendment. As Sawyer failed to assert his Brady claim in an earlier habeas petition and as he cannot show cause for that failure,the court may only reach the merits of that \u00aaabusive\u00ba claimif Sawyer demonstrates that he is probably actually innocentof the offense or that it is more likely than not that his deathsentence was clearly erroneous. As Sawyer's ineffective-assistance claim was considered and rejected in an earlier 3Courts have also reviewed nonguilt \u00aendings of fact made in criminal cases pursuant to Rule 23(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedureunder this standard. See 2 S. Childress & M. Davis, Standards of Review\u00a7 10.3, pp. 73\u00b176 (citing cases).505US2104I 374 SAWYER v.WHITLEY Stevens, J., concurring in judgment habeas proceeding, the court may only review that \u00aasucces- sive\u00ba claim upon a similar showing. Upon a review of therecord in its entirety, I conclude that Sawyer has failed tomake such a showing. Sawyer points to two pieces of exculpatory evidence al- legedly withheld by the State. First, he offers the af\u00aedavitof a woman (Diane Thibodeaux) who, on occasion, took careof the small child who witnessed the crime. That accountappears to con\u00afict with contemporaneous police reports.While police records indicate that the child implicated Saw-yer in the cruel burning of the victim, Thibodeaux avers that the child stated to her that Sawyer's codefendant, CharlesLane, set the victim a\u00aere. Second, he offers other af\u00aedavitscasting doubt on the credibility of Cindy Shano, the State'sprincipal witness. Sawyer emphasizes that Shano testi\u00aeedunder a grant of immunity and highlights inaccuracies in hertrial testimony. Finally, as part of his Sixth Amendmentclaim, Sawyer also offers medical records documenting braindamage and retarded mental development. Viewed as a whole, the record does not demonstrate that failure to reach the merits of Sawyer's claims would consti-tute a fundamental miscarriage of justice. First, in view ofthe other evidence in the record, the Thibodeaux af\u00aedavitand questions concerning Shano's testimony do At most, Thibodeaux's hearsaystatements cast slight doubt on the facts underlying theburning of the victim. Similarly, although the challenges toShano's testimony raise questions, these af\u00aedavits do notdemonstrate that Sawyer probably did not commit \u00aerst-degree murder. Thus, Sawyer has not met the standard\u00aaactual innocence\u00ba exception. Second, the af\u00aedavits and the new medical records do not convince me that Sawyer's death sentence is clearly errone-ous. The jury found two statutory aggravating factors\u00d0that the murder was committed in the course of an aggra-505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 375 Cite as: 505 U.

As suggested above, the Thibodeaux af\u00aedavit doesnot show that it is \u00aamore likely than not\u00ba that Sawyer didnot commit aggravated arson. Moreover, Sawyer offers noevidence to undermine the jury's \u00aending that the murder wasespecially heinous, atrocious, and cruel. In addition, assum-ing that the new medical evidence would support a \u00aendingof a statutory mitigating factor (diminished capacity due tomental disease or defect), 4I cannot say that it would be clear error for a sentencer faced with the two unrefuted aggravat-ing circumstances and that single mitigating circumstance tosentence Sawyer to death. In sum, in my opinion Sawyer has failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that his death sentence wasclearly erroneous. Accordingly, I conclude that the courtbelow was correct in declining to reach the merits of Saw-yer's successive and abusive claims. V The Court rejects an \u00aainnocence of death\u00ba standard that recognizes constitutional errors affecting mitigating evi- dence because such a standard \u00aawould so broaden the inquiryas to make it anything but a `narrow' exception to the prin-ciple of \u00aenality.\u00ba Ante, at 345. As the foregoing analysis indicates, however, the Court's concerns are unfounded.Indeed, even when federal courts have applied a lessrestrictive standard than the standard I propose, thosecourts have rarely found \u00aainnocence of death\u00ba and reachedthe merits of a defaulted, successive, or abusive claim. SeeDeutscher v.Whitley, 946 F. 2d (West 1984) \u00aamit- igating circumstances\u00ba to include the fact that \u00aathe capacity of the of-fender to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his con-duct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental diseaseor defect\u00ba at the time of the offense).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:17 PAGES OPINPGT 376 SAWYER F. 2d 156 (CA8 Smith v.Armon- trout, 888 F. 2d 530, 545 (CA8 1989). Similarly, I do not share the Court's concern that a stand- ard broader than the eligibility standard creates \u00aaa far moredif\u00aecult task\u00ba for federal courts. Ante, at 346. As noted above, both the \u00aaprobably resulted\u00ba standard and the\u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard have long been applied by fed-eral courts in a variety of contexts. Moreover, to the extentthat the \u00aaclearly-erroneous\u00ba standard is more dif\u00aecult toapply than the Court's \u00aaeligibility\u00ba test, I believe that thatcost is far outweighed by the importance of making just deci-sions in the few cases that \u00aet within this narrow exception.To my mind, any added administrative burden is surely justi-\u00aeed by the overriding interest in minimizing the risk of errorin implementing the sovereign's decision to take the life ofone of its citizens. As we observed in Gardner v.Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 360 (1977), \u00aaif the disputed matter is of criticalimportance, the time invested in ascertaining the truthwould surely be well spent if it makes the difference betweenlife and death.\u00ba505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT 377 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus R. A. V. v.CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA certiorari to the supreme court of minnesota No. 90\u00b17675. Argued December 4, 1991\u00d0Decided June 22, 1992 After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner R. A. V . was charged under, inter alia, the St. Paul, Minnesota, Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of a symbol which oneknows or has reason to know \u00aaarouses anger, alarm or resentment inothers on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.\u00ba The trialcourt dismissed this charge on the ground that the ordinance was sub- stantially overbroad and impermissibly content based, but the State Su-preme Court reversed. It rejected the overbreadth claim because thephrase \u00aaarouses anger, alarm or resentment in others\u00ba had been con-strued in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to \u00aa\u00aeghtingwords\u00ba within the meaning of this Court's decision in Chaplinsky v.New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572, a category of expression unprotected by the First Amendment. The court also concluded that the ordinancewas not impermissibly content based because it was narrowly tailored toserve a compelling governmental interest in protecting the communityagainst bias-motivated threats to public safety and order. Held: The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment. Pp. 381\u00b1396. (a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting \u00aa\u00aeghting words.\u00baHowever, R. A. V .'s request that the scope of the Chaplinsky formula- tion be modi\u00aeed, thereby invalidating the ordinance as substantiallyoverbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance unconstitutionallyprohibits speech on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses.P. 381. (b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation, and \u00aeghting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely invis- ible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate them basedon hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable message they con-tain. Thus the regulation of \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba may not be based on non-proscribable content. It may, however, be underinclusive, addressingsome offensive instances and leaving other, equally offensive, ones alone,so long as the selective proscription is not based on content, or there isno realistic possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot.

PAUL Syllabus (c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special prohibitionson those speakers who express views on the disfavored subjects of \u00aarace,color, creed, religion or gender.\u00ba At the same time, it permits displayscontaining abusive invective if they are not addressed to those topics.Moreover, in its practical operation the ordinance goes beyond merecontent, to actual viewpoint, discrimination. Displays containing\u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seem-ingly be useable ad libitum by those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's de-sire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone the\u00aagroup hatred\u00ba of bias-motivated speech does not justify selectively si-lencing speech on the basis of its content. Pp. 391\u00b1393. (d) The content-based discrimination re\u00afected in the ordinance does not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of speech atissue is proscribable, it is not aimed only at the \u00aasecondary effects\u00ba ofspeech within the meaning of Renton v.Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not threatencensorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content discriminationis not justi\u00aeed on the ground that the ordinance is narrowly tailored toserve a compelling state interest in ensuring the basic human rights ofgroups historically discriminated against, since an ordinance not limitedto the favored topics would have precisely the same bene\u00aecial effect.Pp. 393\u00b1396. 464 N.

PAUL Opinion of the Court ished under any of a number of laws,1one of the two provi- sions under which respondent city of St. Paul chose to chargepetitioner (then a juvenile) was the St. Paul Bias-MotivatedCrime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn., Legis.

Thatcourt rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim because, asconstrued in prior Minnesota cases, see, e. g., In re Welfare of S. L. J., 263 N. W. 2d 412 (Minn. 1978), the modifying phrase \u00aaarouses anger, alarm or resentment in others\u00ba lim-ited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to\u00aa\u00aeghting words,\u00ba i. e., \u00aaconduct that itself in\u00aficts injury or tends to incite immediate violence . . . ,\u00ba In re Welfare of R.

We granted certiorari, 501 U. S. 1204 (1991). I In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v.Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328, 339 (1986); New York v.Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 769, n. 24 (1982); Terminiello v.Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949). Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme Court's au-thoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only thoseexpressions that constitute \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba within themeaning 510\u00b1511. Peti- tioner and his amici urge us to modify the scope of the Chaplinsky formulation, thereby invalidating the ordinance as \u00aasubstantially overbroad,\u00ba Broadrick v.Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 610 (1973). We \u00aend it unnecessary to considerthis issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expression reached by the ordinance is proscribable under the \u00aa\u00aeghtingwords\u00ba doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinanceis facially unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise per-mitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speechaddresses. 3 3Contrary to Justice White 's suggestion, post, at 397\u00b1398, n. 1, peti- tioner's claim is \u00aafairly included\u00ba within the questions presented in thepetition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a).

Content-based regu-lations are presumptively invalid. Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y . State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.

From 1791 to the present, however, our society, like other free but ci vilized societies, has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a just a technical \u00aaoverbreadth\u00ba claim\u00d0 i. e., a claim that the ordinance vio- lated the rights of too many third parties\u00d0but included the contentionthat the ordinance was \u00aaoverbroad\u00ba in the sense of restricting more speechthan the Constitution permits, even in its application to him, because it iscontent based. An important component of petitioner's argument is, andhas been all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only\u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba cannot cure this fundamental defect. Id.,at 12, 14, 15\u00b1 16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner argued that a narrowing con-struction was ineffective because (1) its boundaries were vague, Brief forPetitioner 26, and because (2) denominating particular expression a \u00aa\u00aeght-ing word\u00ba because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audi-ence is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner5;id.,at 13 (\u00aa[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory and vague as `narrowly construed' \u00ba) (emphasis added). At oral argument,counsel point: \u00aaIt of mypositions, [punishing only some \u00aeghting words and not others],even though it is a subcategory, technically, of unprotected conduct, [theordinance] still is picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and makingthat clear through the State.\u00ba Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.

We have sometimes said that these categories of expres- sion are \u00aanot within the area of or the \u00aaprotection of the First Amendment does not extend\u00ba to them, Bose Corp. v.Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.

Thus, the government may proscribelibel; but it may not make the further content discriminationof proscribing only libel critical of the government. We re- cently acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U.

Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the First Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regula-tion of particular instances of such proscribable expression,so that the government \u00aamay regulate [them] freely,\u00ba post, at 400 ( White, J., concurring in judgment). That would mean that a city council could enact an ordinance prohibitingonly those legally obscene works that contain criticism of thecity government or, indeed, that do not include endorsementof the city government. Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment protection is at odds withcommon sense and with our jurisprudence as well. 4It is 4Justice White concedes that a city council cannot prohibit only those legally obscene works that contain criticism of the city government, post, at 406, but asserts that to be the consequence, not of the First Amend-ment, but of the Equal Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimina-tion would not, he asserts, \u00aabe rationally related to a legitimate govern-ment interest.\u00ba Ibid. But of course the only reason that government interest is not a \u00aalegitimate\u00ba one is that it violates the First Amendment.This Court itself has occasionally fused the First Amendment into theEqual Protection Clause in this fashion, but at least with the acknowledg-ment (which Justice White cannot afford to make) that the First Amend- ment underlies its analysis. See Police Dept. of Chicago v.Mosley, 408 U.

The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable on the basis of one feature ( e. g., obscenity) but not on the basis of another ( e. g., opposition to the city gov- ernment) is commonplace and has found application in manycontexts. We have long held, for example, that nonverbalexpressive activity can be banned because of the action itentails, but not because of the ideas it expresses\u00d0so thatburning a \u00afag in violation of an ordinance against outdoor\u00aeres could be punishable, whereas burning a \u00afag in violationof an ordinance against dishonoring the \u00afag is not.

S. 781, 791 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clark v.Community for Creative Non- Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 298 (1984) (noting that the O'Brien test differs little from the standard applied to time, place, ormanner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribeparticular speech on the basis of a noncontent element ( e. g., noise) does not entail the power to proscribe the same speechon the basis of a content element; so also, the power to pro-scribe it on the basis of one content element ( e. g., obscenity) does not entail the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements. In other words, the exclusion of \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for pur-poses of that Amendment, the unprotected features of thewords are, despite their verbal character, essentially a \u00aanon-speech\u00ba element of communication. Fighting words arethus analogous to a noisy sound truck: Each is, as JusticeFrankfurter recognized, a \u00aamode of speech,\u00ba Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 282 (1951) (opinion concurring in result); both can be used to convey an idea; but neither has,in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment. As withthe sound truck, however, so also with \u00aeghting words: Thegovernment may not regulate use based on hostility\u00d0orfavoritism\u00d0towards the underlying message expressed.Compare Frisby v.Schultz, 487 U. S. 474 (1988) (upholding, against facial challenge, a content-neutral ban on targetedresidential picketing), with Carey v.Brown, 447 U.

That easy target is of the con- currences' own invention. In our view, the First Amend-ment imposes not an \u00aaunderinclusiveness\u00ba limitation but a \u00aacontent discrimination\u00ba limitation upon a State's prohibitionof proscribable speech. There is no problem whatever, forexample, with a State's prohibiting obscenity (and otherforms of proscribable expression) only in certain media ormarkets, for although that prohibition would be \u00aaunderinclu-sive,\u00ba it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See,e. g., Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 124\u00b1126 (upholding 47 U. S. C. \u00a7 223(b)(1), which prohibits obscene telephone communications). Even the prohibition against content discrimination that we assert the First Amendment requires is not absolute. Itapplies differently in the context of proscribable speech thanin the area of fully protected speech. The rationale of thegeneral prohibition, after all, is that content discrimination\u00aaraises the specter that the Government may effectivelydrive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace,\u00baSimon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 116; Leathers v.Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 448 (1991); FCC v.League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 383\u00b1384 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co., 447 U.

It is of course contrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence to consider the law on this pointconclusively resolved by broad language in cases where the issue was notpresented or even envisioned.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:57 PAGES OPINPGT 388 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Opinion of the Court at 95\u00b198. But content discrimination among various in- stances of a class of proscribable speech often does not posethis threat. When the basis for the content discrimination consists en- tirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issueis proscribable, no signi\u00aecant danger of idea or viewpointdiscrimination exists. Such a reason, having been adjudgedneutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class ofspeech from First Amendment protection, is also neutralenough to form the basis of distinction within the class. Toillustrate: A State might choose to prohibit only that obscen- ity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience \u00d0 i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sex- ual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only thatobscenity which includes offensive political messages. See Kucharek v.Hanaway, 902 F. 2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1041 (1991). And the Federal Governmentcan criminalize only those threats of violence that are di-rected against the President, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 871\u00d0since thereasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amend-ment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, fromthe disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibilitythat the threatened violence will occur) have special forcewhen applied to the person of the President. See Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 707 (1969) (upholding the facial validity of \u00a7 871 because of the \u00aaoverwhelmin[g] interest inprotecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowinghim to perform his duties without interference from threatsof physical violence\u00ba). But the Federal Government maynot criminalize only those threats against the President thatmention his policy on aid to inner cities. And to take a \u00aenalexample (one mentioned by Justice Stevens ,post, at 421\u00b1 422), a State may choose to regulate price advertising in oneindustry but not in others, because the risk of fraud (one ofthe characteristics of commercial speech that justi\u00aees de-priving it of full First Amendment protection, see Virginia505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 389 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Opinion of the Court State Bd. of Pharmacy v.Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771\u00b1772 (1976)) is in its view greater there. Cf. Morales v.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising);Ohralik v.Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978) (state regulation of lawyer advertising). But a State may not pro-hibit only that commercial advertising that depicts men in ademeaning fashion. See, e. g., Los Angeles Times, Aug. 8, 1989, section 4, p. 6, col. 1. Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even a content-de\u00aened subclass of proscribable speech is that the subclass happens to be associated with particular\u00aasecondary effects\u00ba of the speech, so that the regulation is\u00aajusti\u00aeed without reference to the content of the . . . speech,\u00ba Renton v.Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48 (1986) (quoting, with emphasis, Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 771); see also Young v.American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 71, n. 34 (1976) (plurality opinion); id., at 80\u00b182 (Powell, J., concurring); Barnes, 501 U. S., at 586 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for ex- ample, permit all obscene live performances except those in-volving minors. Moreover, since words can in some circum-stances violate laws directed not against speech but againstconduct (a law against treason, for example, is violated bytelling the enemy the Nation's defense secrets), a particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable class of speechcan be swept up incidentally within the reach of a statutedirected at conduct rather than speech. See id.,at 571 (plu- rality opinion); id., judgment); FTC v.Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 425\u00b1 432 (1990); O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 376\u00b1377. Thus, for exam- ple, sexually derogatory \u00aa\u00aeghting words,\u00ba among otherwords, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibi-tion against sexual discrimination in employment practices,42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e\u00b12; 390 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Opinion of the Court U. S. C. \u00a7 242; 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982. Where the govern- ment does not target conduct on the basis of its expressivecontent, acts are not shielded from regulation merely be-cause they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy. These bases for distinction refute the proposition that the selectivity of the restriction is \u00aaeven arguably `conditionedupon the sovereign's agreement with what a speaker mayintend to say.' \u00ba Metromedia, Inc. v.San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 555 (1981) ( Stevens, J. , dissenting in part) (citation omitted). There may be other such bases as well. Indeed,to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribablespeech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identifyany particular \u00aaneutral\u00ba basis, so long as the nature of thecontent discrimination is such that there is no realistic possi-bility that of\u00aecial suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannotthink of any First Amendment interest that would stand inthe way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motionpictures with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation,the regulation of \u00aa\u00aeghting words,\u00ba like the regulation ofnoisy speech, may address some offensive instances andleave other, equally offensive, instances alone. See Posadas de Puerto Rico, 478 U. S., at 342\u00b1343. 6 6Justice Stevens cites a string of opinions as supporting his assertion that \u00aaselective regulation of speech based on content\u00ba is not presumptivelyinvalid. Post, at 421\u00b1422. Analysis reveals, however, that they do not support it. To begin with, three of them did not command a majority ofthe Court, Young v.American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.

In any event, all that their contents establish is what we readily concede: that presumptive invaliditydoes not mean invariable invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions asreasonable and viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpub-lic forums, see Lehman, supra, at 301\u00b1304; see also Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985), or with respect to certain speech by government employees, see Broadrick v.Oklahoma,505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 391 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Opinion of the Court II Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude that, even as narrowly construed by the MinnesotaSupreme Court, the ordinance is facially unconstitutional.Although the phrase in the ordinance, \u00aaarouses anger, alarmor resentment in others,\u00ba has been limited by the MinnesotaSupreme Court's construction to reach only those symbolsor displays that amount to \u00aa\u00aeghting words,\u00ba the remaining,unmodi\u00aeed terms make clear that the ordinance applies onlyto \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba that insult, or provoke violence, \u00aaon thebasis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.\u00ba Displays con-taining abusive invective, no matter how vicious or severe,are permissible unless they are addressed to one of the speci-\u00aeed disfavored topics. Those who wish to use \u00aa\u00aeghtingwords\u00ba in connection with other ideas\u00d0to express hostil-ity, for example, on the basis of political af\u00aeliation, unionmembership, or homosexuality\u00d0are not covered. The FirstAmendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special pro-hibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavoredsubjects. See Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 116; Arkan- sas Writers' Project, Inc. v.Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 229\u00b1 230 (1987). In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even beyond mere content discrimination, to actual view-point discrimination. Displays containing some words\u00d0odious racial epithets, for example\u00d0would be prohibited toproponents of all views. But \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba that do notthemselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender\u00d0aspersions upon a person's mother, for example\u00d0wouldseemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but could not be used by those speakers' opponents. Onecould hold up a sign saying, for example, that all \u00aaanti- 413 U. S. 601 (1973); see also Civil R. A. . v.ST. PAUL Opinion of the Court Catholic bigots\u00ba are misbegotten; but not that all \u00aapapists\u00ba are, for that would insult and provoke violence \u00aaon the basisof religion.\u00ba St. Paul has no such authority to license oneside of a debate to \u00aeght freestyle, while requiring the otherto follow Marquis of Queensberry rules. What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohi- bition of \u00aeghting words that are directed at certain personsor groups (which would be facially valid if it met the re- quirements of the Equal Protection Clause); but rather, aprohibition of \u00aeghting words that contain (as the MinnesotaSupreme Court repeatedly emphasized) messages of \u00aabias- motivated\u00ba hatred and in particular, as applied to this case,messages \u00aabased on virulent notions of racial supremacy.\u00ba464 N. W. 2d, at 508, 511. One must wholeheartedly agreewith the Minnesota Supreme Court that \u00aa[i]t is the responsi-bility, even the obligation, of diverse communities to confrontsuch notions in whatever form they appear,\u00ba id.,at 508, but the manner of that confrontation cannot consist of selectivelimitations upon speech. St. Paul's brief asserts that a gen-eral \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba law would not meet the city's needsbecause only a content-speci\u00aec measure can communicateto minority groups that the \u00aagroup hatred\u00ba aspect of suchspeech \u00aais not condoned by the majority.\u00ba Brief for Re-spondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that ma-jority preferences must be expressed in some fashion otherthan silencing speech on the basis of its content. Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at ex-pression of group hatred, Justice Stevens suggests that this \u00aafundamentally misreads\u00ba the ordinance. Post, at 433. It is directed, he claims, not to speech of a particular content,but to particular \u00aainjur[ies]\u00ba that are \u00aaqualitatively differ-ent\u00ba from other injuries.

What makes the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., producedby violation of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear,sense of dishonor, etc., produced by other \u00aeghting words is505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 393 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Opinion of the Court nothing other than the fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea, conveyed by a distinctive message. The First Amend-ment cannot be evaded that easily. It is obvious that thesymbols which will arouse \u00aaanger, alarm or resentment inothers on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender\u00baare those symbols that communicate a message of hostilitybased on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes inits brief that the ordinance applies only to \u00aaracial, religious,or gender-speci\u00aec symbols\u00ba such as \u00aaa other instrumentality of like import.\u00ba Brieffor Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the Juvenile Court that \u00aa[t]he burning of a cross does express a messageand it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate.\u00ba Memorandum fromthe Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A.Flinn, Jr., dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R. A. V., No. 89\u00b1D\u00b11231 (Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted inApp. to Brief for Petitioner C\u00b11. The content-based discrimination re\u00afected in the St. Paul ordinance comes within neither any of the speci\u00aec exceptionsto the First Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier nora more general exception for content discrimination thatdoes not threaten censorship of ideas. It assuredly does notfall within the exception for content discrimination based onthe very reasons why the particular class of speech at issue(here, \u00aeghting words) is proscribable. As explained earlier,seesupra, at 386, the reason why \u00aeghting words are categor- ically excluded from the protection of the First Amendmentis not that their content communicates any particular idea,but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled outan especially offensive mode of expression\u00d0it has not, forexample, selected for prohibition only those \u00aeghting wordsthat communicate ideas in a threatening (as opposed to amerely obnoxious) manner. Rather, it has proscribed \u00aeght-505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 394 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Opinion of the Court ing words of whatever manner that communicate messages of racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity of thissort creates the possibility that the city is seeking to handi-cap the expression of particular ideas. That possibilitywould alone be enough to render the ordinance presump-tively invalid, but St. Paul's comments and concessions inthis case elevate the possibility to a certainty. St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within another of the speci\u00aec exceptions we mentioned, the one that allowscontent discrimination aimed only at the \u00aasecondary effects\u00baof the speech, see Renton v.Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41 (1986). According to St. Paul, the ordinance is in-tended, \u00aanot to impact on [sic] the right of free expression of the accused,\u00ba but rather to \u00aaprotect against the victim-ization of a person or persons who are particularly vulner-able because of their membership in a group that historicallyhas been discriminated against.\u00ba Brief for Respondent 28.Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes,rather than merely regulates, a speci\u00aeed category of speechcan ever be considered to be directed only to the secondaryeffects of such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinanceis not directed to secondary effects within the meaning ofRenton. As we said in Boos v.Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1988), \u00aaListeners' reactions to speech are not the type of `secondaryeffects' we referred to in Renton. \u00baId.,at 321. \u00aaThe emo- tive impact of speech on its audience is not a `secondary ef-fect.' \u00ba Ibid. See also id.,at 334 (opinion of Brennan, J.). 7 7St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance merely regulates that subclass of \u00aeghting words which is most likely to provoke a violentresponse. But even if one assumes (as appears unlikely) that the catego-ries selected may be so described, that would not justify selective regula-tion under a \u00aasecondary effects\u00ba theory. The only reason why such ex-pressive conduct would be especially correlated with violence is that itconveys a particularly odious message; because the \u00aachain of causation\u00bathus necessarily \u00aarun[s] through the persuasive effect of the expressive component\u00ba of the conduct, Barnes v.Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 586 (1991) ( Souter, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that the St. Paul505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 395 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Opinion of the Court It hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fall within some more general exception permitting allselectiv- ity that for any reason is beyond the suspicion of of\u00aecial sup-pression of ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this verycase afford ample basis for, if not full con\u00aermation of, thatsuspicion. Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota Supreme Court that, even if the ordinanceregulates expression based on hostility towards its protectedideological content, this discrimination is nonetheless justi-\u00aeed because it is narrowly tailored to serve compe lling state interests. Speci\u00aecally, they assert that the ordinance helpsto ensure the basic human rights of members of groups thathave historically been subjected to discrimination, includingthe right of such group members to live in peace where theywish. We do not doubt that these interests are compe lling, and that the ordinance can be said to promote them. Butthe \u00aadanger of censorship\u00ba presented by a facially content-based statute, Leathers v.Medlock, 499 U. S., at 448, requires that that weapon be employed only where it is \u00aa necessary to serve the asserted [compe lling] i nterest,\u00ba Burson v.Free- man, 504 U. S. 191, 199 (1992) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added); Perry Ed. Assn. v.Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral alternatives thus \u00aaundercut[s] signi\u00aecantly\u00ba any de-fense of such a statute, Boos v.Barry, supra, at 329, casting considerable doubt on the government's protestations that\u00aathe asserted justi\u00aecation is in fact an accurate descriptionof the purpose and effect of the law,\u00ba Burson, supra, at 213 (Kennedy, J., concurring). See Boos, at 324\u00b1329; cf.Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v.Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 586\u00b1587 (1983). The dispositive question in this case, therefore, is whether content discrimi-nation is reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's compel- ordinance regulates on the basis of the \u00aaprimary\u00ba effect of the speech\u00d0 i. e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 396 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Opinion of the Court ling interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited to the favored topics, for example, would have preciselythe same bene\u00aecial effect. In fact the only interest distinc-tively served by the content limitation is that of displayingthe city council's special hostility towards the particularbiases thus singled out. 8That is precisely what the First Amendment forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitledto express that hostility\u00d0but not through the means ofimposing unique limitations upon speakers who (howeverbenightedly) disagree. *** Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paulhas suf\u00aecient means at its disposal to prevent such behaviorwithout adding the First Amendment to the \u00aere. The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is re- versed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 8A plurality of the Court reached a different conclusion with regard to the Tennessee antielectioneering statute considered earlier this Term inBurson v.Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992). In light of the \u00aalogical connec- tion\u00ba between electioneering and the State's compelling interest in pre-venting voter intimidation and election fraud\u00d0an inherent connectionborne out by \u00aalong history\u00ba and a and time-tested consen-sus,\u00ba id.,at 206, 208, n. 10, 211\u00d0the plurality concluded that it was faced with one of those \u00aarare case[s]\u00ba in which the use of a facially content-basedrestriction was justi\u00aeed by interests unrelated to the suppression of ideas,id.,at 211; see also id.,at 213 ( Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice White and Justice Stevens are therefore quite mistaken when they seek to convert the Burson plurality's passing comment that \u00aa[t]he First Amend- ment does not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist,\u00baid.,at 207, into endorsement of the revolutionary proposition that the sup- pression of particular ideas can be justi\u00aeed when only those ideas havebeen a source of trouble in the past.

I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minne- sota Supreme Court should be reversed. However, ouragreement ends there.

Contrary to the impression the majority attempts to create through its selective quotation of petitioner's briefs, see ante, at 381\u00b1382, n. 3, peti- tioner did not present to this Court or the Minnesota Supreme Court any-thing approximating the novel theory the majority adopts today. Mostcertainly petitioner did not \u00aareiterat[e]\u00ba such a claim at argument; he re-sponded to a question from the bench, Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.

PAUL White, J., concurring in judgment Court holds the ordinance facially unconstitutional on a ground that was never presented to the Minnesota SupremeCourt, a ground that has not been briefed by the partiesbefore this Court, a ground that requires serious departuresfrom the teaching of prior cases and is inconsistent with theplurality opinion in Burson v.Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992), which was joined by two of the \u00aeve Justices in the majorityin the present case. This Court ordinarily is not so eager to abandon its prece- dents. Twice within the past month, the Court has declinedto overturn longstanding but controversial decisions on ques- tions of constitutional law. See Allied-Signal, Inc. v.Direc- tor, Division of Taxation, 504 U. S. 768 (1992); Quill Corp. v.North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298 (1992). In each case, we had the bene\u00aet of full brie\u00aeng on the critical issue, so that theparties and amici had the opportunity to apprise us of the impact of a change in the law. And in each case, the Courtdeclined to abandon its precedents, invoking the principleofstare decisis. Allied-Signal, Inc., supra, at 783\u00b1786; Quill Corp., supra, at 317\u00b1318. But in the present case, the majority casts aside long- established First Amendment doctrine without the bene\u00aetof brie\u00aeng and adopts an untried theory. This is hardly ajudicious way of proceeding, and the Court's reasoning inreaching its result is transparently wrong. of its own theories when they have not been pressed or passed upon by a state court of last resort. See, e. g., Illinois v.Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 217\u00b1224 (1983). Given this threshold issue, it is my view that the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide the case on the majority rationale. Cf. Arkansas Electric Coop- erative Corp. v.Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375, 382, n. 6 (1983). Certainly the preliminary jurisdictional and prudential concernsare suf\u00aeciently weighty that we would never have granted certiorari hadpetitioner sought review of a question based on the majority's decisionaltheory.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 399 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) White, J., concurring in judgment I A This Court's decisions have plainly stated that expression falling within certain li mited categories so lacks the values the First Amendment was designed to protect that the Con-stitution affords no protection to that expression. Chaplin- sky v.New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942), made the point in the clearest possible terms: \u00aaThere are certain well-de\u00aened and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment ofwhich have never been thought to raise any Constitu-tional problem. . . . It has been well observed that suchutterances are no essential part of any exposition ofideas, and are of such slight social value as a step totruth that any bene\u00aet that may be derived from them isclearly outweighed by the social interest in order andmorality.\u00ba Id.,at 571\u00b1572. See also Bose Corp. v.Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 504 (1984) (citing Chaplinsky ). Thus, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 383\u00b1384, this Court has long held certain discrete categories of expressionto be proscribable on the basis of their content. For in-stance, the Court has held that the individual who falselyshouts \u00aa\u00aere\u00ba in a crowded theater may not claim the protec-tion of the First Amendment. Schenck v.United States, 249 U. S. 47, 52 (1919). The Court has concluded that neitherchild pornography nor obscenity is protected by the FirstAmendment. New York v.Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 764 (1982); Miller v.California, 413 U. S. 15, 20 (1973); Roth v.United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484\u00b1485 (1957). And the Court has observed that, \u00aa[l]eaving aside the special considerationswhen public of\u00aecials [and public \u00aegures] are the target, alibelous publication is not protected by the Constitution.\u00baFerber, supra, at 763 (citations omitted).505US2105I A. V . v.ST. PAUL White, J., concurring in judgment All of these categories are content based. But the Court has held that the First Amendment does not apply to thembecause their expressive content is worthless or of de mini- mis value to society. Chaplinsky, supra, at 571\u00b1572. We have not departed from this principle, emphasizing repeat-edly that, \u00aawithin the con\u00aenes of [these] given classi\u00aeca-tion[s], the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighsthe expressive interests, if any, at stake, that no process U. S. 809, 819 (1975). This categorical approach has provided a principled and narrowlyfocused means for distinguishing between expression thatthe government may regulate freely and that which it mayregulate on the basis of content only upon a showing of com-pelling need. 2 Today, however, the Court announces that earlier Courts did not mean their repeated statements that certain catego-ries of expression are \u00aanot within the area of constitutionallyprotected speech.\u00ba Roth, supra, at 483. See ante, at 383, citing Beauharnais v.Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 266 571\u00b1572; Bose Corp., Communications of Cal., Inc. v.FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 124 (1989). The present Court submits that such clearstatements \u00aamust be taken in context\u00ba and are not \u00aaliterallytrue.\u00ba Ante, at 383. To the contrary, those statements meant precisely what they said: The categorical approach is a \u00aermly entrenchedpart of our First Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, theCourt in Roth reviewed the guarantees of freedom of expres- sion in effect at the time of the rati\u00aecation of the Constitu-tion and concluded, \u00aaIn light of this history, it is apparentthat the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was 2\u00aaIn each of these areas, the limits of the unprotected category, as well as the unprotected character of particular communications, have been de-termined by the judicial evaluation of special facts that have been deemedto have constitutional signi\u00aecance.\u00ba Bose Corp. v.Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.

S., at 482\u00b1483. In its decision today, the Court points to \u00aa[n]othin g...i n this Court's precedents warrant[ing] disregard of this long-standing tradition.\u00ba Burson, 504 U. S., 216 concurring in judgment); Allied-Signal, Inc., supra, at 783. Nevertheless, the majority holds that the First Amendmentprotects those narrow categories of expression long held tobe undeserving of First Amendment protection\u00d0at least tothe extent that lawmakers may not regulate some \u00aeghtingwords more strictly than others because of their content.The Court announces that such content-based distinctions vi-olate the First Amendment because \u00aa[t]he government maynot regulate use based on hostility\u00d0or favoritism\u00d0towardsthe underlying message expressed.\u00ba Ante, at 386. Should the government want to criminalize certain \u00aeghting words,the Court now requires it to criminalize all \u00aeghting words. To borrow a phrase: \u00aaSuch a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at- all approach to First Amendment protection is at odds withcommon sense and with our jurisprudence as well.\u00ba Ante, at 384. It is inconsistent to hold that the government mayproscribe an entire category of speech because the contentof that speech is evil, Ferber, supra, at 763\u00b1764; but that the government may not treat a subset of that category differ-ently without violating the First Amendment; the contentof the subset is by de\u00aenition worthless and undeserving ofconstitutional protection. The majority's observation that \u00aeghting words are \u00aaquite expressive indeed,\u00ba ante, at 385, is no answer. Fighting words are not a means of exchanging views, rallying sup-porters, or registering a protest; they are directed againstindividuals to provoke violence or to in\u00afict injury. Chaplin- sky, 315 U. S., at 572. Therefore, a ban on all \u00aeghting words or on a subset of the \u00aeghting words category would restrictonly the social evil of hate speech, without creating the dan-ger of driving viewpoints from the marketplace.

PAUL White, J., concurring in judgment Therefore, the Court's insistence on inventing its brand of First Amendment underinclusiveness puzzles me.3The overbreadth doctrine has the redeeming virtue of attemptingto avoid the ch illing of protected expression, Broadrick 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973); Osborne v.Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 112, n. 8 (1990); Brockett v.Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. supra, at 772, but the Court's new \u00aaunderbreadth\u00ba creation serves no desirablefunction. Instead, it permits, indeed invites, the continua-tion of expressive conduct that in this case is evil and worth-less in First Amendment terms, see Ferber, supra, at 763\u00b1 764; Chaplinsky, supra, at 571\u00b1572, until the city of St. Paul cures the underbreadth by adding to its ordinance a catchallphrase such as \u00aaand all other \u00aeghting words that may consti-tutionally be subject to this ordinance.\u00ba Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment ju- risprudence is surely a negative one, since it necessarily sig-nals that expressions of violence, such as the message of in-timidation and racial hatred conveyed by burning a cross onsomeone's lawn, are of suf\u00aecient value to outweigh the socialinterest in order and morality that has traditionally placedsuch \u00aeghting words outside the First Amendment. 4Indeed, by characterizing \u00aeghting words as a form of \u00aadebate,\u00ba ante, at 392, the majority legitimates hate speech as a form ofpublic discussion. 3The assortment of exceptions the Court attaches to its rule belies the majority's claim, see ante, at 387, that its new theory is truly con- cerned with content discrimination. See Part I\u00b1C, infra (discussing the exceptions). 4This does not suggest, of course, that cross burning is always unpro- tected. Burning a cross at a political rally would almost certainly be pro-tected expression. Cf. Brandenburg v.Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 445 (1969). But in such a context, the cross burning could not be characterized as a\u00aadirect personal insult or an invitation to exchange \u00aesticuffs,\u00ba Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 409 (1989), to which the \u00aeghting words doctrine, see Part II, infra, applies.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 403 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) White, J., concurring in judgment Furthermore, the Court obscures the line between speech that could be regulated freely on the basis of content ( i. e., the narrow categories of expression fa lling outside the First Amendment) and that which could be regulated on the basisof content only upon a showing of a compe lling state i nterest (i. e., all remaining expression). By placing \u00aeghting words, which the Court has long held to be valueless, on at leastequal constitutional footing with political discourse and otherforms of speech that we have deemed to have the greatestsocial value, the majority devalues the latter category. SeeBurson v.Freeman, supra, at 196; Euv.San Francisco Cty. Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 222\u00b1223 (1989). B In a second break with precedent, the Court refuses to sustain the ordinance even though it would survive underthe strict scrutiny applicable to other protected expression.Assuming, arguendo, that the St. Paul ordinance is a content- based regulation of protected expression, it neverthelesswould pass First Amendment review under settled law upona showing that the regulation \u00aa `is necessary to serve a com-pelling state i nterest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.' \u00ba Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y . State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 118 (1991) (quoting Arkan- sas Writers' Project, Inc. v.Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 231 (1987)).

The Court expressly concedes that this interest is compe lling and is promoted by the ordinance. Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court treats strict scrutiny analysis as irrelevant to the constitutionality ofthe legislation: \u00aaThe dispositive questio n...i s whether necessary to achieve St. Paul'scompe lling i nterests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 404 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL White, J., concurring in judgment limited to the favored topics, for example, would have precisely the same bene\u00aecial effect.\u00ba Ante, at 395\u00b1396. Under the majority's view, a narrowly drawn, content-based ordinance could never pass constitutional muster if the ob-ject of that legislation could be accomplished by banninga wider category of speech. This appears to be a generalrenunciation of strict scrutiny review, a fundamental tool ofFirst Amendment analysis. 5 This abandonment of the doctrine is inexplicable in light of our decision in Burson v.Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992), which was handed down just a month ago.6InBurson, seven of the eight participating Members of the Court agreedthat the strict scrutiny standard applied in a case involvinga First Amendment challenge to a content-based statute.See id.,at opinion); id.,at 217 , 5The majority relies on Boos v.Barry, 485 U. S. 312 (1988), in arguing that the availability of content-neutral alternatives \u00aa `undercut[s] signi\u00ae-cantly' \u00ba a claim that content-based legislation is ` necessary to serve the asserted [compelling] interest.' \u00ba Ante, at 395 (quoting Boos, supra, at 329, and Burson v.Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 199 (1992) (plurality opinion)). Boos does not support the majority's analysis. In Boos, Congress already had decided that the challenged legislation was not necessary, and theCourt pointedly deferred to this choice. 485 U. S., at 329. St. Paul law-makers have made no such legislative choice. Moreover, in Boos, the Court held that the challenged statute was not narrowly tailored because a less restrictive alternative was available.Ibid. But the Court's analysis today turns Boos inside-out by substitut- ing the majority's policy judgment that a more restrictive alternative could adequately serve the compelling need identi\u00aeed by St. Paul lawmak-ers. The result would be: (a) a statute that was not tailored to \u00aet theneed identi\u00aeed by the government; and (b) a greater restriction on \u00aeghtingwords, even though the Court clearly believes that \u00aeghting words haveprotected expressive content. Ante, at 384\u00b1385. 6Earlier this Term, seven of the eight participating Members of the Court agreed that strict scrutiny analysis applied in Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y . State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105 (1991), in which we struck down New York's \u00aaSon of Sam\u00ba law, which required \u00aathatan accused or convicted criminal's income from works describing his crimebe deposited in an escrow account.\u00ba Id.,at 108.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 405 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) White, J., concurring in judgment dissenting).7The statute at issue prohibited the solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of campaign materialswithin 100 feet of the entrance to a po lling place. The plu- rality concluded that the legislation survived strict scrutinybecause the State had asserted a compe lling i nterest in regu- lating electioneering near po lling places and because the statute at issue was narrowly tailored to accomplish thatgoal. Id.,at 208\u00b1210. Signi\u00aecantly, the statute in Burson did not proscribe all speech near po lling places; it restricted only political speech. Id., at 197. The Burson plurality, which included The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy , concluded that the distinction between types of speech required application ofstrict scrutiny, but it squarely rejected the proposition thatthe legislation failed First Amendment review because itcould have been drafted in broader, content-neutral terms: \u00aaStates adopt laws to address the problems that con- front them. The First Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist. \u00baId., at 207 (emphasis added). This reasoning is in direct con\u00afict with the majority's analy- sis in the present case, which leaves two options to lawmak-ers attempting to regulate expressions of violence: (1) enacta sweeping prohibition on an entire class of speech (therebyrequiring \u00aaregulat[ion] for problems that do not exist\u00ba); or(2) not legislate at all. Had the analysis adopted by the majority in the present case been applied in Burson, the challenged election law would have failed constitutional review, for its content-baseddistinction between political and nonpolitical speech couldnot have been characterized as \u00aareasonably necessary,\u00ba ante, 7The Burson dissenters did not complain that the plurality erred in applying strict scrutiny; they objected that the plurality was not suf\u00ae-ciently rigorous in its review. 504 U.

Themajority appears to believe that its doctrinal revisionism isnecessary to prevent our elected lawmakers from prohibitinglibel against members of one political party but not anotherand from enacting similarly preposterous laws. Ante, at 384. The majority is misguided. Although the First Amendment does not apply to catego- ries of unprotected speech, such as \u00aeghting words, the EqualProtection Clause requires that the regulation of unpro-tected speech be rationally related to a legitimate govern-ment interest. A defamation statute that drew distinctionson the basis of political af\u00aeliation or \u00aaan ordinance prohibit-ing only those legally obscene works that contain criticism of the city government,\u00ba ibid., would unquestionably fail rational-basis review. 9 8Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment in Burson, reasoning that the statute, \u00aathough content based, is constitutional [as] a reasonable,viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic forum.\u00ba Id., at 214. How- ever, nothing in his reasoning in the present case suggests that a content-based ban on \u00aeghting words would be constitutional were that ban limitedto nonpublic fora. Taken together, the two opinions suggest that, in somesettings, political speech, to which \u00aathe First Amendment `has its fullestand most urgent application,' \u00ba is entitled to less constitutional protectionthan \u00aeghting words. Eu v.San Francisco Cty. Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v.Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971)). 9The majority is mistaken in stating that a ban on obscene works critical of government would fail equal protection review only because the banwould violate the First Amendment. Ante, at 384\u00b1385, n. 4. While deci- sions such as Police Dept. of Chicago v.Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972), recog- nize that First Amendment principles may be relevant to an equal protec-tion claim challenging distinctions that impact on protected expression,id.,at 95\u00b199, there is no basis for linking First and Fourteenth Amend- ment analysis in a case involving unprotected expression. Certainly, one505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 407 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) White, J., concurring in judgment Turning to the St. Paul ordinance and assuming, arguendo, as the majority does, that the ordinance is not constitution-ally overbroad (but see Part II, infra ), there is no question that it would pass equal protection review. The ordinanceproscribes a subset of \u00aa\u00aeghting words,\u00ba those that injure \u00aaonthe basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.\u00ba Thisselective regulation re\u00afects the city's judgment that harmsbased on race, color, creed, religion, or gender are morepressing public concerns than the harms caused by other\u00aeghting words. In light of our Nation's long and painfulexperience with discrimination, this determination is plainlyreasonable. Indeed, as the majority concedes, the interestis compe lling. Ante, at 395. C The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can beviewed either as an attempt to con\u00aene the effects of its deci-sion to the facts of this case, see post, at 415 ( Blackmun, J. , concurring in judgment), or as an effort to anticipate someof the questions that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law. For instance, if the majority were to give general applica- tion to the rule on which it decides this case, today's decisionwould call into question the constitutionality of the statutemaking it illegal to threaten the life of the President. 18U. S. C. \u00a7 871. See Watts v.United States, 394 U. S. 705 (1969) (per curiam). Surely, this statute, by singling out certain threats, incorporates a content-based distinction; itindicates that the Government especially disfavors threatsagainst the President as opposed to threats against all oth- need not resort to First Amendment principles to conclude that the sort of improbable legislation the majority hypothesizes is based on senselessdistinctions.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 408 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL White, J., concurring in judgment ers.10See ante, at 391. But because the Government could prohibit all threats and not just those directed against thePresident, under the Court's theory, the compe lling reasons justifying the enactment of special legislation to safeguardthe President would be irrelevant, and the statute would failFirst Amendment review. To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the follow- ing exception onto its newly announced First Amendmentrule: Content-based distinctions may be drawn within anunprotected category of speech if the basis for the distinc-tions is \u00aathe very reason the entire class of speech at issueis proscribable.\u00ba Ante, at 388. Thus, the argument goes, the statute making it illegal to threaten the life of the Presi-dent is constitutional, \u00aasince the reasons why threats of vio-lence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individu-als from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fearengenders, and from the possibility that the threatened vio-lence will occur) have special force when applied to the per-son of the President.\u00ba Ibid. The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since \u00aathe reasonswhy [\u00aeghting words] are outside the First Amendment . . .have special force when applied to [groups that have histori-cally been subjected to discrimination].\u00ba To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that \u00aeghting words are simply a mode of communication,rather than a content-based category, and that the St. Paulordinance has not singled out a particularly objectionablemode of communication. Ante, at 386, 393. Again, the ma- jority confuses the issue. A prohibition on \u00aeghting words isnot a time, place, or manner restriction; it is a ban on a classof speech that conveys an overriding message of personalinjury and imminent violence, Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572, a message that is at its ugliest when directed against groups 10Indeed, such a law is content based in and of itself because it distin- guishes between threatening and nonthreatening speech.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 409 Cite as: 505 U.

As its second exception, the Court posits that certain content-based regulations will survive under the new regimeif the regulated subclass \u00aahappens to be associated speech . . . ,\u00ba ante, at 389, which the majority treats as encompassing instances inwhich \u00aawords ca n...v i olate laws directed not against conduct . . . ,\u00ba ibid. 11Again, there is a simple explanation for the Court's eagerness to craft an exceptionto its new First Amendment rule: Under the general rulethe Court applies in this case, Title VII hostile work environ-ment claims would suddenly be unconstitutional. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful to discriminate \u00aabecause of [an] individual's race, color, reli-gion, sex, or national origin,\u00ba 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000e\u00b12(a)(1), andthe regulations covering hostile workplace claims forbid\u00aasexual harassment,\u00ba which includes \u00aa[u]nwelcome sexual ad-vances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physi-cal conduct of a sexual nature\u00ba that create \u00aaan intimidat-ing, hostile, or offensive working environment,\u00ba 29 CFR\u00a7 1604.11(a) (1991). The regulation does not prohibit work-place harassment generally; it focuses on what the majoritywould characterize as the \u00aadisfavored topi[c]\u00ba of sexual ha-rassment. Ante, at 391. In this way, Title VII is similar to the St. Paul ordinance that the majority condemns becauseit \u00aaimpose[s] special prohibitions on those speakers whoexpress views on disfavored subjects.\u00ba Ibid. Under the broad principle the Court uses to decide the present case, 11The consequences of the majority's con\u00afation of the rarely used sec- ondary effects standard and the O'Brien test for conduct incorporating \u00aaspeech\u00ba and \u00aanonspeech\u00ba elements, see generally United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376\u00b1377 (1968), present another question that I fear will haunt us and the lower courts in the aftermath of the majority's opinion.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 410 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL White, J., concurring in judgment hostile work environment claims based on sexual harassment should fail First Amendment review; because a general banon harassment in the workplace would cover the problem ofsexual harassment, any attempt to proscribe the subcategoryof sexually harassing expression would violate the FirstAmendment. Hence, the majority's second exception, which the Court indicates would insulate a Title VII hostile work environ-ment claim from an underinclusiveness challenge because\u00aasexually derogatory `\u00aeghting words '...m a y produce a vio- lation of Title VII's general prohibition against sexual dis-crimination in employment practices.\u00ba Ante, at 389. But application of this exception to a hostile work environmentclaim does not hold up under close examination. First, the hostile work environment regulation is not keyed to the presence or absence of an economic quid pro quo, Meritor Savings Bank, F. S. B. v.Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 65 (1986), but to the impact of the speech on the victimizedworker. Consequently, the regulation would no more fallwithin a secondary effects exception than does the St. Paulordinance.

Second, the majority's focus on the statute's general prohibition on discrimination glossesover the language of the speci\u00aec regulation governing hostile working environment, which reaches beyond any \u00aainciden-tal\u00ba effect on speech. United States v.O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376 (1968). If the relationship between the broaderstatute and speci\u00aec regulation is suf\u00aecent to bring the TitleVII regulation within O'Brien, then all St. Paul need do to bring its ordinance within this exception is to add some pref-atory language concerning discrimination generally. As to the third exception to the Court's theory for deciding this case, the majority concocts a catchall exclusion to pro-tect against unforeseen problems, a concern that is height-ened here given the lack of brie\u00aeng on the majority's deci-sional theory. This \u00aenal exception would apply in cases inwhich \u00aathere is no realistic possibility that of\u00aecial suppres-sion of ideas is afoot.\u00ba Ante, at 390.

Ante, at 395. As I see it, the Court's theory does not work and will do nothing more than confuse the law. Its selection of this caseto rewrite First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable,because the whole problem could have been avoided by de-ciding this case under settled First Amendment principles. II Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agree with its conclusion: The St. Paul ordinance is unconstitu-tional. However, I would decide the case on overbreadthgrounds. We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doc- trine is an exception to the established principle that \u00aaa per-son to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied willnot be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that itmay conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, inother situations not before the S., at Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S., at 503\u00b1504. A defendant being prosecuted forspeech or expressive conduct may challenge the law on itsface if it reaches protected expression, even when that per-son's activities are not protected by the First Amendment.This is because \u00aathe possible harm to society in permittingsome unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighedby the possibility that protected speech of others maybe muted.\u00ba Broadrick, supra, at 612; Osborne v.Ohio, 495 U. S., at 112, n. 8; New York v.Ferber, 458 U. S., at 768\u00b1769; Schaumburg v.Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 634 (1980); Gooding v.Wilson, 405 U. S. 518, 521 (1972). However, we have consistently held that, because over- breadth analysis is \u00aastrong medicine,\u00ba it may be invoked tostrike an entire statute only when the overbreadth of thestatute is not only \u00aareal, but substantial as well, judged inrelation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,\u00ba Broad-505US2105I OPINPGT A.

S. 569, 574 (1987). \u00aaWhen a federal court is dealing witha federal statute challenged as overbroad, it should . . . con-strue the statute to avoid constitutional problems, if the stat-ute is subject to a limiting construction.\u00ba Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769, n. 24. Of course, \u00aa[a] state court is also free to dealwith a state statute in the same way.\u00ba Ibid. See, e. g., Osborne, 495 U. S., at 113\u00b1114. Petitioner contends that the St. Paul ordinance is not sus- ceptible to a narrowing construction and that the ordinancetherefore should be considered as written, and not as con-strued by the Minnesota Supreme Court. Petitioner iswrong. Where a state court has interpreted a provision ofstate law, we cannot ignore that interpretation, even if it isnot one that we would have reached if we were construing the statute in the \u00aerst instance. Ibid.; Kolender v.Lawson, U. S. 352, 355 (1983); Hoffman Estates v.Flipside, Hoff- man Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 494, n. 5 (1982). 12 Of course, the mere presence of a state court interpreta- tion does not insulate a statute from overbreadth review.We have stricken legislation when the construction suppliedby the state court failed to cure the overbreadth problem. 12Petitioner can derive no support from our statement in Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 397 (1988), that \u00aathe stat- ute must be `readily susceptible' to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.\u00ba In American Booksellers, no state court had construed the language in dispute. In that instance, we certi\u00aeed a question to the state court so that it wouldhave an opportunity to provide a narrowing interpretation. Ibid. In Erznoznik v.Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 216 (1975), the other case upon which petitioner principally relies, we observed not only that the ordi-nance at issue was not \u00aaby its plain term s... easily susceptible of a narrowing construction,\u00ba but that the state courts had made no effort torestrict the scope of the statute when it was challenged on overbreadthgrounds.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 413 Cite as: 505 U.

But in such cases, we have looked to the statute as construed in determining whetherit contravened the First Amendment. Here, the Minne-sota Supreme Court has provided an authoritative con-struction of the St. Paul antibias ordinance. Considerationof petitioner's overbreadth claim must be based on thatinterpretation. I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Although the ordinance as construed reaches catego-ries of speech that are constitutionally unprotected, it also criminalizes a substantial amount of expression that\u00d0how-ever repugnant\u00d0is shielded by the First Amendment. In attempting to narrow the scope of the St. Paul antibias ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon two ofthe categories of speech and expressive conduct that fall out-side the First Amendment's protective sphere: words thatincite 444, 449 (1969), and \u00aa\u00aeghting\u00ba words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S., at 571\u00b1572. The Minnesota Supreme Court erred in its application of the Chaplinsky \u00aeghting words test and consequently interpreted the St.Paul ordinance in a fashion that rendered the ordinancefacially overbroad. In construing the St. Paul ordinance, the Minnesota Su- preme Court drew upon the de\u00aenition of \u00aeghting words very utter- ance in\u00afict injury tend to incite an immediate breach ofthe peace.\u00ba Id.,at 572. However, the Minnesota court was far from clear in identifying the \u00aainjur[ies]\u00ba in\u00aficted by theexpression that St. Paul sought to regulate. Indeed, theMinnesota court emphasized (tracking the language of theordinance) that \u00aathe ordinance censors only those displaysthat one knows or should know will create anger, alarm orresentment based on racial, ethnic, gender or religious bias.\u00baIn re Welfare of R.

The mere fact that ex-pressive activity causes hurt feelings, offense, or resentmentdoes not render the expression unprotected. See United States v.Eichman, 496 U. S. 310, 319 (1990); Texas v.John- son, 491 U. S. 397, 409, 414 (1989); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 55\u00b156 (1988); FCC v.Paci\u00aeca Founda- tion, 438 U.

S. 1 (1949). In the First Amendment context, \u00aa[c]riminal statutes must be scrutinized with particular care; those that make unlawfula substantial amount of constitutionally protected conductmay be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimateapplication.\u00ba Houston v.Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 459 (1987) (cita- tion omitted). The St. Paul antibias ordinance is such a law.Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is unprotected,it also makes criminal expressive conduct that causes onlyhurt feelings, offense, or resentment, and is protected by theFirst Amendment. Cf. Lewis, supra, at 132. 13The ordi- nance is therefore fatally overbroad and invalid on its face. 13Although the First Amendment protects offensive speech, Johnson v. Texas, 491 U. S., at 414, it does not require us to be subjected to such expression at all times, in all settings. We have held that such expressionmay be proscribed when it intrudes upon a \u00aacaptive audience.\u00ba Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 484\u00b1485 (1988); FCC v.Paci\u00aeca Foundation, 438 U.

S. 57, 65 (1986). However, be- cause of the manner in which the Minnesota Supreme Court construed theSt. Paul ordinance, those issues are not before us in this case.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 415 Cite as: 505 U.

Its decision is an arid, doctrinaire in-terpretation, driven by the frequently irresistible impulse ofjudges to tinker with the First Amendment. The decisionis mischievous at best and will surely confuse the lowercourts. I join the judgment, but not the folly of the opinion. Justice Blackmun , concurring in the judgment. I regret what the Court has done in this case. The major- ity opinion signals one of two possibilities: It will serve asprecedent for future cases, or it will not. Either result isdisheartening. In the \u00aerst instance, by deciding that a State cannot regu- late speech that causes great harm unless it also regulatesspeech that does not (setting law and logic on their heads),the Court seems to abandon the categorical approach, andinevitably to relax the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As Justice White points out, this weakens the traditional protections of speech. If all expressive activ-ity must be accorded the same protection, that protectionwill be scant. The simple reality is that the Court willnever provide child pornography or cigarette advertising thelevel of protection customarily granted political speech. Ifwe are forbidden to categorize, as the Court has done here,we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad thatin its effort to reach a satisfying result in this case, the Courtis willing to weaken First Amendment protections. In the second instance is the possibility that this case will not signi\u00aecantly alter First Amendment jurisprudence but,instead, will be regarded as an aberration\u00d0a case where theCourt manipulated doctrine to strike down an ordinancewhose premise it opposed, namely, that racial threats andverbal assaults are of greater harm than other \u00aeghtingwords. I fear that the Court has been distracted from its505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 416 R. A. V . v.ST.

If this is the meaning of today'sopinion, it is perhaps even more regrettable. I see no First Amendment values that are compromised by a law that prohibits hoodlums from driving minorities outof their homes by burning crosses on their lawns, but I seegreat harm in preventing the people of Saint Paul fromspeci\u00aecally punishing the race-based \u00aeghting words that soprejudice their community. I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with Justice White that this particular ordinance reaches be- yond \u00aeghting words to speech protected by the FirstAmendment. Justice Stevens , with whom Justice White and Jus- tice Blackmun join as to Part I, concurring in the judgment. Conduct that creates special risks or causes special harms may be prohibited by special rules. Lighting a \u00aere near anammunition dump or a gasoline storage tank is especiallydangerous; such behavior may be punished more severelythan burning trash in a vacant lot. Threatening someonebecause of her race or religious beliefs may cause particu-larly severe trauma or touch off a riot, and threatening ahigh public of\u00aecial may cause substantial social disruption;such threats may be punished more severely than threatsagainst someone based on, say, his support of a particularathletic team. There are legitimate, reasonable, and neutraljusti\u00aecations for such special rules. This case involves the constitutionality of one such ordi- nance. Because the regulated conduct has some communi-cative content\u00d0a message of racial, religious, or genderhostility\u00d0the ordinance raises two quite different FirstAmendment questions. Is the ordinance \u00aaoverbroad\u00ba be-505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 417 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment cause it prohibits too much speech? If not, is it \u00aaunder- broad\u00ba because it does not prohibit enough speech? In answering these questions, my colleagues today wrestle with two broad principles: \u00aerst, that certain \u00aacategoriesof expression [including at 400 ( White, J. , regulations [of expression] are presump-tively invalid,\u00ba ante, at 382 (majority opinion). Although in past opinions the Court has repeated both of these maxims,it has\u00d0quite rightly\u00d0adhered to neither with the absolut-ism suggested by my colleagues. Thus, while I agree thatthe St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad for thereasons stated in Part II of Justice White 's opinion, I write separately to suggest how the allure of absolute principleshas skewed the analysis of both the majority and Justice White\u0092 s opinions. I Fifty years ago, the Court articulated a categorical ap- proach to First Amendment jurisprudence. \u00aaThere are certain well-de\u00aened and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment ofwhich have never been thought to raise any Constitu- tional problem. . . . It has been well observed that suchutterances are no essential part of any exposition ofideas, and are of such slight social value as a step totruth that any bene\u00aet that may be derived from them isclearly outweighed by the social interest in order andmorality.\u00ba Chaplinsky v.New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571\u00b1572 (1942). We have, as Justice White observes, often described such categories of expression as \u00aanot within the area of constitu-tionally protected speech.\u00ba Roth v.United States, 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957).505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 418 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment The Court today revises this categorical approach. It is not, the Court rules, that certain \u00aacategories\u00ba of expressionare \u00aaunprotected,\u00ba but rather that certain \u00aaelements\u00ba of ex-pression are wholly \u00aaproscribable.\u00ba To the Court, an ex-pressive act, like a chemical compound, consists of more thanone element. Although the act may be regulated because itcontains a proscribable element, it may not be regulated onthe basis of another (nonproscribable) element it also con-tains. Thus, obscene antigovernment speech may be regu-lated because it is obscene, but not because it is antigovern-ment. Ante, at 384. It is this revision of the categorical approach that allows the Court to assume that the St. Paulordinance proscribes only \u00aeghting words, while at the same time concluding that the ordinance is invalid because it im-poses a content-based regulation on expressive activity. As an initial matter, the Court's revision of the categorical approach seems to me something of an adventure in a doc-trinal wonderland, for the concept of \u00aaobscene antigovern-ment\u00ba speech is fantastical. The category of the obscene isvery narrow; to be obscene, expression must be found by thetrier of fact to \u00aaappea[l] to the prurient interest ,... depic[t] or describ[e], in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct,[and], taken as a whole, lac[k] serious literary, artistic, po- litical, or scienti\u00aec value. \u00baMiller v.California, 413 U. S. 15, 24 (1973) (emphasis added). \u00aaObscene antigovernment\u00baspeech, then, is a contradiction in terms: If expression is anti-government, it does not . . political . . . value\u00baand cannot be obscene. The Court attempts to bolster its argument by likening its novel analysis to that applied to restrictions on the time,place, or manner of expression or on expressive conduct. Itis true that loud speech in favor of the Republican Party canbe regulated because it is loud, but not because it is pro-Republican; and it is true that the public burning of theAmerican \u00afag can be regulated because it involves publicburning and not because it involves the \u00afag. But these anal-505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 419 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment ogies are inapposite. In each of these examples, the two elements ( e. g., loudness and pro-Republican orientation) can coexist; in the case of \u00aaobscene antigovernment\u00ba speech,however, the presence of one element (\u00aaobscenity\u00ba) by de\u00ae-nition means the absence of the other. To my mind, it isunwise and unsound to craft a new doctrine based on suchhighly speculative hypotheticals. I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of the Court's analysis\u00d0namely, its conclusion that the St. Paulordinance is an unconstitutional content-based regulation ofspeech. Drawing on broadly worded dicta, the Court estab-lishes a near-absolute ban on content-based regulations ofexpression and holds that the First Amendment prohibitsthe regulation of \u00aeghting words by subject matter. Thus,while the Court rejects the \u00aaall-or-nothing-at-all\u00ba nature ofthe categorical approach, ante, at 384, it promptly embraces an absolutism of its own: Within a particular \u00aaproscribable\u00bacategory of expression, the Court holds, a government musteither proscribe allspeech or no speech at all. 1This aspect of the Court's ruling fundamentally misunderstands the roleand constitutional status of content-based regulations onspeech, con\u00aficts with the very nature of First Amendment jurisprudence, and disrupts well-settled principles of FirstAmendment law. 1The Court disputes this characterization because it has crafted two exceptions, one for \u00aacertain media or markets\u00ba and the other for contentdiscrimination based upon \u00aathe very reason that the entire class of speechat issue is proscribable.\u00ba Ante, at 388. These exceptions are, at best, ill de\u00aened. The Court does not tell us whether, with respect to the former,\u00aeghting words such as cross burning could be proscribed only in certainneighborhoods where the threat of violence is particularly severe, orwhether, with respect to the second category, \u00aeghting words that create aparticular risk of harm (such as a race riot) would be proscribable. Thehypothetical and illusory category of these two exceptions persuades methat either my description of the Court's analysis is accurate or that theCourt does not in fact mean much of what it says in its opinion.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 420 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Although the Court has, on occasion, declared that content-based regulations of speech are \u00aanever permitted,\u00baPolice Dept. of Chicago v.Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 99 (1972), such claims are overstated. Indeed, in Mosley itself, the Court indicated that Chicago's selective proscription of non-labor picketing was not per se unconstitutional, but rather could be upheld if the city demonstrated that nonlabor pick-eting was \u00aaclearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.\u00baId.,at 100. Contrary to the broad dicta in Mosley and else- where, our decisions demonstrate that content-based distinc-tions, far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitableand indispensable aspect of a coherent understanding of theFirst Amendment. This is true at every level of First Amendment law. In broadest terms, our entire First Amendment jurisprudencecreates a regime based on the content of speech. The scopeof the First Amendment is determined by the content of ex-pressive activity: Although the First Amendment broadlyprotects \u00aaspeech,\u00ba it does not protect the right to \u00aa\u00aex prices,breach contracts, make false warranties, place bets withbookies, threaten, [or] extort.\u00ba Schauer, Categories and theFirst Amendment: A Play in Three Acts, 34 Vand. L. Rev.265, 270 (1981). Whether an agreement among competitorsis a violation of the Sherman Act or protected activity undertheNoerr-Pennington doctrine 2hinges upon the content of the agreement. Similarly, \u00aathe line between permissible ad-vocacy and impermissible incitation to crime or violence de-pends, not merely on the setting in which the speech occurs,but also on exactly what the speaker had to say.\u00ba Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 66 (1976) (plural- ity opinion); see also Musser v.Utah, 333 U.

S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Likewise, whether speech falls within one of the cate- gories of \u00aaunprotected\u00ba or \u00aaproscribable\u00ba expression is de-termined, in part, by its content. Whether a magazine isobscene, a gesture a \u00aeghting word, or a photograph childpornography is determined, in part, by its content. Evenwithin categories of protected expression, the First Amend-ment status of speech is \u00aexed by its content. New York Times Co. v.Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), and Dun & Brad- street, Inc. v.Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749 (1985), establish that the level of protection given to speech dependsupon its subject matter: Speech about public of\u00aecials or matters of public concern receives greater protection thanspeech about other topics. It can, therefore, scarcely be saidthat the regulation of expressive activity cannot be predi-cated on its content: Much of our First Amendment jurispru-dence is premised on the assumption that content makes adifference. Consistent with this general premise, we have frequently upheld content-based regulations of speech. For example,inYoung v.American Mini Theatres, the Court upheld zon- ing ordinances that regulated movie theaters based on thecontent of the \u00aelms shown. In FCC v.Paci\u00aeca Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978) (plurality opinion), we upheld a restric-tion on the broadcast of speci\u00aec indecent words. In Lehman v.Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974) (plurality opinion), we upheld a city law that permitted commercial advertising, butprohibited political advertising, on city buses. In Broadrick v.Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973), we upheld a state law that restricted the speech of state employees, but only asconcerned partisan political matters. We have long recog-nized the power of the Federal Trade Commission to regu-late misleading advertising and labeling, see, e. g., Jacob Siegel Co. v.FTC, 327 U. S. 608 (1946), and the National Labor Relations Board's power to regulate an employer'selection-related speech on the basis of its content, see, e. g., NLRB v.Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 616\u00b1618 PAGES OPINPGT v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment It is also beyond question that the Government may choose to limit advertisements for cigarettes, see 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\u00b11340, 3but not for cigars; choose to regulate airline advertis- ing, see Morales v.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374 (1992), but not bus advertising; or choose to monitor solicita-tion by lawyers, see Ohralik v.Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447 (1978), but not by doctors. All of these cases involved the selective regulation of speech based on content\u00d0precisely the sort of regulation theCourt invalidates today. Such selective regulations are un-avoidably content based, but they are not, in my opinion,\u00aapresumptively invalid.\u00ba As these many decisions and ex-amples demonstrate, the prohibition on content-based regu-lations is not nearly as total as the Mosley dictum suggests. Disregarding this vast body of case law, the Court today goes beyond even the overstatement in Mosley and applies the prohibition on content-based regulation to speech thatthe Court had until today considered wholly \u00aaunprotected\u00baby the First Amendment\u00d0namely, \u00aeghting words. Thisnew absolutism in the prohibition of content-based regula-tions severely contorts the fabric of settled First Amend-ment law. Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hier- archy in the constitutional protection of speech. Core politi-cal speech occupies the highest, most protected position;commercial speech and nonobscene, sexually explicit speechare regarded as a sort of second-class expression; obscenityand \u00aeghting words receive the least protection of all. Assum-ing that the Court is correct that this last class of speech isnot wholly \u00aaunprotected,\u00ba it certainly does not follow that\u00aeghting words and obscenity receive the same sort of pro- tection afforded core political speech. Yet in ruling thatproscribable speech cannot be regulated based on subject 3See also Packer Corp. v.Utah, 285 U. S. 105 (1932) (Brandeis, J.)

S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment matter, the Court does just that.4Perversely, this gives \u00aeghting words greater protection than is afforded commer- cial speech. If Congress can prohibit false advertising di-rected at airline passengers without also prohibiting falseadvertising directed at bus passengers and if a city canprohibit political advertisements in its buses while allowingother advertisements, it is ironic to hold that a city cannotregulate \u00aeghting words based on \u00aarace, color, creed, r homosexuality.\u00ba Ante, at 391. The Court today turns First Amendment law on its head: Communication that was once entirely unprotected (and thatstill can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled to greater pro-tection than commercial speech\u00d0and possibly greater pro-tection than core political speech. See Burson v.Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 195, 196 (1992). Perhaps because the Court recognizes these perversities, it quickly offers some ad hoc limitations on its newly ex-tended prohibition on content-based regulations. First, theCourt states that a content-based regulation is valid \u00aa[w]henthe basis for the content discrimination consists entirely ofthe very reason the entire class of speech . . . is proscrib-able.\u00ba Ante, at 388. In a pivotal passage, the Court writes: \u00aa[T]he Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence that are directed against the Pres-ident, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 871\u00d0since the reasons why 4The Court states that the prohibition on content-based regulations \u00aaap- plies differently in the context of proscribable speech\u00ba than in the contextof other speech, ante, at 387, but its analysis belies that claim. The Court strikes down the St. Paul ordinance because it regulates \u00aeghting wordsbased on subject matter, despite the fact that, as demonstrated above, wehave long upheld regulations of commercial speech based on subject mat-ter. The Court's self-description is inapt: By prohibiting the regulationof \u00aeghting words based on its subject matter, the Court provides the sameprotection to \u00aeghting words as is currently provided to core politicalspeech.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 424 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, fromthe disruption that fear engenders, and from the possi-bility that the threatened violence will occur) have spe-cial force when applied to th e... President.\u00ba Ibid. As I understand this opaque passage, Congress may choose from the set of unprotected speech (all threats) to proscribeonly a subset (threats against the President) because thosethreats are particularly likely to cause \u00aafear of violence,\u00ba\u00aadisruption,\u00ba and actual \u00aaviolence.\u00ba Precisely this same reasoning, however, compels the con- clusion that St. Paul's ordinance is constitutional. Just asCongress may determine that threats against the Presidententail more severe consequences than other threats, so St.Paul's City Council may determine that threats based on thetarget's race, religion, or gender cause more severe harm toboth the target and to society than other threats. This lat-ter judgment\u00d0that harms caused by racial, religious, andgender-based invective are qualitatively different from thatcaused by other \u00aeghting words\u00d0seems to me eminently rea-sonable and realistic. Next, the Court recognizes that a State may regulate ad- vertising in one industry but not another because \u00aathe riskof fraud (one of the characteristics . . . . . .)\u00ba in the regulated industry is \u00aagreater\u00ba than in other indus-tries. Ibid. Again, the same reasoning demonstrates the constitutionality of St. Paul's ordinance. \u00aa[O]ne of the char-acteristics that justi\u00aees\u00ba the constitutional status of \u00aeghtingwords is that such words \u00aaby their very utterance in\u00afict in-jury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u00baChaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572. Certainly a legislature that may determine that the risk of fraud is greater in the legal505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 425 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment trade than in the medical trade may determine that the risk of injury or breach of peace created by race-based threats isgreater than that created by other threats. Similarly, it is impossible to reconcile the Court's analysis of the St. Paul ordinance with its recognition that \u00aaa prohibi-tion of \u00aeghting words that are directed at orgroups . . . would be facially valid.\u00ba Ante, at 392 (emphasis deleted). A selective proscription of unprotected expres-sion designed to protect \u00aacertain persons or groups\u00ba (for ex-ample, a law proscribing threats directed at the elderly)would be constitutional if it were based on a legitimate de-termination that the harm created by the regulated expres-sion differs from that created by the unregulated expression(that is, if the elderly are more severely injured by threatsthan are the nonelderly). Such selective protection is no dif-ferent from a law prohibiting minors (and only minors) fromobtaining obscene publications. See Ginsberg v.New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968). St. Paul has determined\u00d0reasonablyin my judgment\u00d0that \u00aeghting-word injuries on race,color, creed, gender\u00ba are qualitatively differentand more severe than \u00aeghting-word injuries based on othercharacteristics. Whether the selective proscription of pro-scribable speech is de\u00aened by the protected target (\u00aacertainpersons or groups\u00ba) or the basis of the harm (injuries \u00aabasedon race, color, creed, religion or gender\u00ba) makes no constitu-tional difference: What matters is whether the legislature'sselection is based on a legitimate, neutral, and reasonabledistinction. In sum, the central premise of the Court's ruling\u00d0that \u00aa[c]ontent-based regulations are presumptively invalid\u00ba\u00d0has simplistic appeal, but lacks support in our First Amend-ment jurisprudence. To make matters worse, the Courttoday extends this overstated claim to reach categories ofhitherto unprotected speech and, in doing so, wreaks havocin an area of settled law. Finally, although the Court recog-505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 426 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment nizes exceptions to its new principle, those exceptions under- mine its very conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is uncon-stitutional. Stated directly, the majority's position cannotwithstand scrutiny. II Although I agree with much of Justice White 's analysis, I do not join Part I\u00b1A of his opinion because I have reserva- tions about the \u00aacategorical approach\u00ba to the First Amend-ment. These concerns, which I have noted on other occa-sions, see, e. g., New York v.Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 778 (1982) (opinion concurring in judgment), lead me to \u00aend Justice White 's response to the Court's analysis unsatisfying. Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amend- ment has some appeal: Either expression is protected or itis not\u00d0the categories create safe harbors for governmentsand speakers alike. But this approach sacri\u00aeces subtlety forclarity and is, I am convinced, ultimately unsound. As aninitial matter, the concept of \u00aacategories\u00ba \u00aets poorly with thecomplex reality of expression. Few dividing lines in FirstAmendment law are straight and unwavering, and efforts atcategorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries.Our de\u00aenitions of \u00aaobscenity,\u00ba see, e. g., Marks v.United States, 430 U. S. 188, 198 (1977) ( Stevens, J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part), and \u00aapublic forum,\u00ba see, e. g., United States Postal Service v.Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U. de\u00aenition of \u00aapublic forum\u00ba), illustrate this alltoo well. The quest for doctrinal certainty through thede\u00aenition of categories and subcategories is, in my opinion,destined to fail. Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously the importance of context. The meaning of any expression and the legitimacy of its regulation can only be determined505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 427 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in context.5Whether, for example, a picture or a sentence is obscene cannot be judged in the abstract, but rather onlyin the context of its setting, its use, and its audience. Simi-larly, although legislatures may freely regulate most nonob-scene child pornography, such pornography that is part of \u00aaaserious work of art, a documentary on behavioral problems,or a medical or psychiatric teaching device\u00ba may be entitledto constitutional protection; the \u00aaquestion whether a speci\u00aecact of communication is protected by the First Amendmentalways requires some consideration of both its content andits context.\u00ba Ferber, 458 U. S., at 778 ( Stevens, J. , con- curring in judgment); see also Smith v.United States, 431 U. S. 291, 311\u00b1321 (1977) ( Stevens, J. , dissenting). The categorical approach sweeps too broadly when it declaresthat all such expression is beyond the protection of theFirst Amendment. Perhaps sensing the limits of such an all-or-nothing ap- proach, the Court has applied its analysis less categoricallythan its doctrinal statements suggest. The Court has recog-nized intermediate categories of speech (for example, for in-decent nonobscene speech and commercial speech) and geo-graphic categories of speech (public fora, limited public fora,nonpublic fora) entitled to varying levels of protection. TheCourt has also stringently delimited the categories of unpro-tected speech. While we once declared that \u00aa[l]ibelous ut-terances [are] not . pro-tected speech,\u00ba Beauharnais v.Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 266 (1952), our rulings in New York Times Co. v.Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964); Gertz v.Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), and Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749 (1985), have substantially quali\u00aeed this 5\u00aaA word,\u00ba as Justice Holmes has noted, \u00aais not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly incolor and content according to the circumstances and the time in which itis used.\u00ba Towne v.Eisner, 245 U. S. 418, 425 (1918); see also Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 201 (1964) (Warren, C. J., dissenting).505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:58 PAGES OPINPGT 428 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment broad claim. Similarly, we have consistently construed the \u00aa\u00aeghting words\u00ba exception set forth in Chaplinsky narrowly. See, e. g., Houston v.Hill, 482 U. S. 451 (1987); Lewis v.New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130 (1974); Cohen v.California, 403 U. S. 15 (1971). In the case of commercial speech, our ruling that\u00aathe Constitution imposes no . . . restraint respects purely commercial advertising,\u00ba Val- entine v.Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942), was expressly repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v.Virginia Citi- zens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976). In short, the history of the categorical approach is largely the historyof narrowing the categories of unprotected speech. This evolution, I believe, indicates that the categorical ap- proach is unworkable and the quest for absolute categories of\u00aaprotected\u00ba and \u00aaunprotected\u00ba speech ultimately futile. Myanalysis of the faults and limits of this approach persuadesme that the categorical approach presented in Part I\u00b1A ofJustice White 's opinion is not an adequate response to the novel \u00aaunderbreadth\u00ba analysis the Court sets forth today. III As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the Court's and part of Justice White 's analysis of the constitu- tionality of the St. Paul ordinance. Unlike the Court, I donot believe that all content-based regulations are equally in-\u00aerm and presumptively invalid; unlike Justice White ,Id o not believe that \u00aeghting words are wholly unprotected bythe First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe our deci-sions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one thatconsiders the content and context of the regulated speech,and the nature and scope of the restriction on speech. Apply-ing this analysis and assuming, arguendo, (as the Court does) that the St. Paul ordinance is notoverbroad, I conclude that such a selective, subject-matter regulation on proscribablespeech is constitutional.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 429 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisions clearly recognize that some content-based restrictions raisemore constitutional questions than others. Although theCourt's analysis of content-based regulations cannot be re-duced to a simple formula, we have considered a number offactors in determining the validity of such regulations. First, as suggested above, the scope of protection provided expressive activity depends in part upon its content andcharacter. We have long recognized that when governmentregulates political speech or \u00aathe expression of editorialopinion on matters of public importance,\u00ba FCC v.League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, (1984), its zenith,' \u00ba Meyer v.Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 425 (1988). In comparison, we have recog-nized that \u00aacommercial speech receives a limited form ofFirst Posadas de Pu erto Rico As- sociates v.Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328, 340 (1986), and that \u00aasociety's interest in protecting [sexually ex-plicit \u00aelms] is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitudethan [its] interest in untrammeled political debate,\u00ba Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 70; see also FCC v. Paci\u00aeca Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). The character of expressive activity also weighs in our consideration of itsconstitutional status. As we have frequently noted, \u00aa[t]hegovernment generally has a freer hand in restricting expres-sive conduct than it has in restricting the written or spokenword.\u00ba Texas v.Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989); see also United States v.O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). The protection afforded expression turns as well on the context of the regulated speech. We have noted, for exam-ple, that \u00aa[a]ny assessment of the precise scope of employerexpression, of course, must be made in the context of itslabor relations settin g...[ and] must take into account the economic dependence of the employees on their employers.\u00baNLRB v.Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 617. Similarly, the distinctive character of a university environment, see505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 430 R. A. V Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Widmar v.Vincent, U. S. 263, 277\u00b1280 (1981) ( Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), or a secondary school environ- ment, see Hazelwood School Dist. v.Kuhlmeier, 484 U. S. 260 (1988), in\u00afuences our First Amendment analysis. Thesame is true of the presence of a \u00aa `captive audience[, one]there as a matter of necessity, not of choice.' \u00ba Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S., at 302 (citation omitted). 6Per- haps the most familiar embodiment of the relevance of con-text is our \u00aafora\u00ba jurisprudence, differentiating the levels ofprotection afforded speech in different locations. The nature of a contested restriction of speech also in- forms our evaluation of its constitutionality. Thus, for ex-ample, \u00aa[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comesto this Court bearing a heavy presumption against itsconstitutional validity.\u00ba Bantam Books, Inc. v.Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58, 70 (1963). More particularly to the matter ofcontent-based regulations, we have implicitly distinguishedbetween restrictions on expression based on subject matter and restrictions based on viewpoint, indicating that the lat- ter are particularly pernicious. \u00aaIf there is a bedrock prin-ciple underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Govern-ment may not prohibit the expression of an idea simplybecause society \u00aends the idea itself offensive or disagree-able.\u00ba Texas v.Johnson, 491 U. S., at 414. \u00aaViewpoint discrimination is censorship in its purest form,\u00ba Perry Ed. Assn. v.Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 62 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting), and requires particular scrutiny, inpart because such regulation often indicates a legislative ef-fort to skew public debate on an issue, see, e. g., Schacht v. United States, 398 U. S. 58, 63 (1970). \u00aaEspecially where . . . the legislature's suppression of speech suggests an 6Cf.In re Chase, 468 F. 2d 128, 139\u00b1140 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissent- ing) (arguing that defendant who, for reasons of religious belief, refusedto rise and stand as the trial judge entered the courtroom was not subjectto contempt proceedings because he was not present in the courtroom \u00aaasa matter of choice\u00ba).505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 431 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendmentis plainly offended.\u00ba First Nat. Bank of Boston v.Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 785\u00b1786 (1978). Thus, although a regulationthat on its face regulates speech by subject matter may insome instances effectively suppress particular viewpoints,see, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y . v.Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y ., 546\u00b1547 (1980) ( Stevens, J. , concurring in judgment), in general, viewpoint-based restric-tions on expression require greater scrutiny than subject-matter-based restrictions. 7 Finally, in considering the validity of content-based regu- lations we have also looked more broadly at the scope ofthe restrictions. For example, in Young v.American Mini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 71, we found signi\u00aecant the fact that \u00aawhat [was] ultimately at stake [was] nothing more than alimitation on the place where adult \u00aelms may be exhibited.\u00baSimilarly, in FCC v.Paci\u00aeca Foundation, the Court empha- sized two dimensions of the limited scope of the FCC ruling.First, the ruling concerned only broadcast material whichpresents particular problems because it \u00aaconfronts the citi-z e n...i nt h ep r ivacy of the home\u00ba; second, the ruling was not a complete ban on the use of selected offensive words,but rather merely a limitation on the times such speech couldbe broadcast. 438 U. S., at 748\u00b1750. All of these factors play some role in our evaluation of content-based regulations on expression. Such a multi-faceted analysis cannot be con\u00afated into two dimensions.Whatever the allure of absolute doctrines, it is just too sim-ple to declare expression \u00aaprotected\u00ba or \u00aaunprotected\u00ba \u00aacontent based\u00ba or neutral.\u00ba 7Although the Court has sometimes suggested that subject-matter- based and viewpoint-based regulations are equally problematic, see, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y . v.Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y ., 447 U. at 537, our decisions belie such claims.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 432 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment In applying this analysis to the St. Paul ordinance, I as- sume, arguendo \u00d0as the Court does\u00d0that the ordinance only \u00aeghting words and therefore is not overbroad. Looking to the content and character of the regulated activ-ity, two things are clear. First, by hypothesis the ordinancebars only low-value speech, namely, \u00aeghting words. Byde\u00aenition such expression constitutes \u00aano essential part ofany exposition of ideas, and [is] of such slight social value asa step to truth that any bene\u00aet that may be derived from[it] is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order andmorality.\u00ba Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572. Second, the ordi- nance regulates \u00aaexpressive conduct [rather] tha n...t h e written or spoken word.\u00ba Texas v.Johnson, 491 U. S., at 406. Looking to the context of the regulated activity, it is again signi\u00aecant that the ordinance (by hypothesis) regulates only \u00aeghting words. Whether words are \u00aeghting words is deter-mined in part by their context. Fighting words are notwords that merely cause offense; \u00aeghting words must be di-rected at individuals so as to \u00aaby their very utterance in\u00afictinjury.\u00ba By hypothesis, then, the St. Paul ordinance re-stricts speech in confrontational and potentially violent situ-ations. The case at hand is illustrative. The cross burningin this case\u00d0directed as it was to a single African-Americanfamily trapped in their home\u00d0was nothing more than acrude form of physical intimidation. That this cross burningsends a message of racial hostility does not automaticallyendow it with complete constitutional protection. 8 8The Court makes much of St. Paul's description of the ordinance as regulating \u00aaa message.\u00ba Ante, at 393. As always, however, St. Paul's argument must be read in context: \u00aaFinally, we ask the Court to re\u00afect on the `content' of the `expressive conduct' represented by a `burning cross.' It is no less than the \u00aerst stepin an act of racial violence. It was and unfortunately still is the equiva-lent of [the] waving of a knife before the thrust, the pointing of a gunbefore it is \u00aered, the lighting of the match before the arson, the hangingof the noose before the lynching. It is not a political statement, or even505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 433 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment Signi\u00aecantly, the St. Paul ordinance regulates speech not on the basis of its subject matter or the viewpoint expressed,but rather on the basis of the harm the speech causes. In this regard, the Court fundamentally misreads the St. Paulordinance. The Court describes the St. Paul ordinance as regulating expression \u00aaaddressed to one of [several] speci\u00aeeddisfavored topics, \u00baante, at 391 (emphasis supplied), as polic- ing \u00aadisfavored subjects, \u00baibid. (emphasis supplied), and as \u00aaprohibit[ing ]... speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses,\u00ba ante, at 381 (emphasis supplied). Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the ordinance regulatesonly a subcategory of expression that causes injuries based on\u00aarace, color, creed, religion or gender,\u00ba not a subcategory that involves discussions that concern those characteristics. 9 The ordinance, as construed by the Court, criminalizes ex- pression that in\u00afictsinjury on] others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or a cowardly statement of hatred. It is the \u00aerst step in an act of assault. It can be no more protected than holding a gun to a victim['s] head. It isperhaps the ultimate expression of `\u00aeghting words.' \u00ba App. to Brief forPetitioner C\u00b16. 9The Court contends that this distinction is \u00aawordplay,\u00ba reasoning that \u00aa[w]hat makes [the harms caused by race-based threats] distinct from produced by other \u00aeghting . . . the fact that [the formerare] caused by a distinctive i dea.\u00ba Ante, at 392\u00b1393 (emphasis added). In this way, the Court concludes that regulating speech based on the in-jury it causes is no different from regulating speech based on its subjectmatter. This analysis fundamen tally miscomprehends the role of \u00aarace, color, creed, religion [and] gender\u00ba in contemporary American society.One need look no further than the recent social unrest in the Nation'scities to see that race-based threats may cause more harm to society andto individuals than other threats. Just as the statute prohibiting threatsagainst the President is justi\u00aeable because of the place of the President inour social and political order, so a statute prohibiting race-based threatsis justi\u00aeable because of the place of race in our social and political order.Although it is regrettable that race occupies such a place and is so incendi-ary an issue, until the Nation matures beyond that condition, laws such asSt. Paul's ordinance will remain reasonable and justi\u00aeable.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 434 R. A. V . v.ST. PAUL Stevens, J., concurring in judgment gender.\u00ba In this regard, the ordinance resembles the child pornography law at issue in Ferber, which in effect singled out child pornography because those publications caused fargreater harms than pornography involving adults. Moreover, even if the St. Paul ordinance did regulate \u00aeghting words based on its subject matter, such a regulationwould, in my opinion, be constitutional. As noted above,subject-matter-based regulations on commercial speech arewidespread and largely unproblematic. As we have longrecognized, subject-matter regulations generally do not raisethe same concerns of government censorship and the distor-tion of public discourse presented by viewpoint regulations.Thus, in upholding subject-matter regulations we have care-fully noted that viewpoint-based discrimination was not im-plicated. See Young v.American Mini Theatres, 427 U. S., at 67 (emphasizing \u00aathe need for absolute neutrality by thegovernment,\u00ba and observing that the contested statute wasnot animated by \u00aahostility for the point of view\u00ba of the the-aters); FCC v.Paci\u00aeca Foundation, 438 U.

Indeed, some subject- matter restrictions are a functional necessity in contempo-rary governance: \u00aaThe First Amendment does not requireStates to regulate for problems that do not exist.\u00ba Burson v.Freeman, 504 U. S., at 207. Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the St. Paul ordinance does notregulate expression based on viewpoint. The Court contends that the ordinance requires proponentsof racial intolerance to \u00aafollow the Marquis of Queensberryrules\u00ba while allowing advocates of racial tolerance to \u00aa\u00aeghtfreestyle.\u00ba The law does no such thing.505US2105I 07-09-96 19:34:59 PAGES OPINPGT 435 Cite as: 505 U. S. 377 (1992) Stevens, J., concurring in judgment The Court writes: \u00aaOne could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all `anti-Catholic bigots' are misbegotten; but not that all`papists' are, for that would insult and provoke violence`on the basis of religion.' \u00ba Ante, at 391\u00b1392. This may be true, but it hardly proves the Court's point. The Court's reasoning is asymmetrical. The response to asign saying that \u00aaall [religious] bigots are misbegotten\u00ba isa sign saying that \u00aaall advocates of religious tolerance aremisbegotten.\u00ba Assuming such signs could be \u00aeghting words(which seems to me extremely unlikely), neither sign wouldbe banned by the ordinance for the attacks were not \u00aabasedon . . . religion\u00ba but rather on one's beliefs about tolerance.Conversely (and again assuming such signs are \u00aeghtingwords), just as the ordinance would prohibit a Muslim fromhoisting a sign claiming that all Catholics were misbegotten,so the ordinance would bar a Catholic from hoisting a similarsign attacking Muslims. The St. Paul ordinance is evenhanded. In a battle be- tween advocates of tolerance and advocates of intolerance,the ordinance does not prevent either side from hurling\u00aeghting words at the other on the basis of their con\u00afictingideas, but it does bar both sides from hurling such words on the basis of the target's \u00aarace, color, creed, religion orgender.\u00ba To extend the Court's pugilistic metaphor, theSt. Paul ordinance simply bans punches \u00aabelow the belt\u00ba\u00d0by either party. It does not, therefore, favor one side of any debate. 10 10Cf.FCC v.League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.

The St. Paulordinance does not ban all \u00aahate speech,\u00ba nor does it ban,say, all cross burnings or all swastika displays. Rather itonly bans a subcategory of the already narrow category of\u00aeghting words. Such a limited ordinance leaves open andprotected a vast range of expression on the subjects of racial,religious, and gender equality.

In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court) regulates expressive activity that is wholly proscribable anddoes so not on the basis of viewpoint, but rather in recogni-tion of the different harms caused by such activity. Takentogether, these several considerations persuade me that theSt. Paul ordinance is not an unconstitutional content-basedregulation of speech. Thus, were the ordinance not over-broad, I would vote to uphold it.505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 437 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA certiorari to the supreme court of california No. 90\u00b18370. Argued February 25, 1992\u00d0Decided June 22, 1992 Before petitioner Medina's trial for, inter alia, \u00aerst-degree murder, the California court granted his motion for a competency hearing pursuantto a state law that forbids a men tally i ncompetent person to be tried or punished, establishes a presumption of competence, and placed onpetitioner the burden of proving incompetence by a preponderance ofthe evidence. The jury empaneled for the competency hearing foundMedina competent to stand trial and, subsequently, he was convictedand sentenced to death. The State Supreme Court af\u00aermed, rejectingMedina's claim that the competency statute's burden of proof and pre-sumption provisions violated his right to due process. Held: 1. The Due Process Clause permits a State to require that a defend- ant claiming incompetence to stand trial bear the burden of proving soby a preponderance of the evidence. Pp. 442\u00b1453. (a) Contrary to Medina's argument, the Mathews v.Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, test for evaluating procedural due process claims does notprovide the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of stateprocedural rules that are part of the criminal law process. It is not atall clear that Mathews was essential to the results in United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667, or Ake v.Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, the only criminal law cases in which this Court has invoked Mathews in resolving due process claims. Rather, the proper analytical approach is that setforth in Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S. 197, in which this Court held that the power of a State to regulate procedures for carrying out itscriminal laws, including the burdens of producing evidence and persua-sion, is not subject to proscription under the Due Process Clause unless\u00aa `it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions andconscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' \u00ba Id.,at 201\u00b1 202. Pp. 442\u00b1446. (b) There is no historical basis for concluding that allocating the burden of proof to a criminal defendant to prove incompetence violatesdue process. While the rule that an incompetent criminal defendant should not be required to stand trial has deep roots in this country'scommon-law heritage, no settled tradition exists for the proper alloca-tion of the burden of proof in a competency proceeding. Moreover, con-505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 438 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Syllabus temporary practice demonstrates that there remains no settled view on where the burden should lie. Pp. 446\u00b1448. (c) Nor does the State's allocation of the burden of proof to a de- fendant transgress any recognized principle of \u00aafundamental fairness\u00bain operation. Court's decision in Leland v.Oregon, 343 U. S. 790\u00d0 which upheld a State's right to place on a defendant the burden of prov-ing the defense of insanity\u00d0does not compel the conclusion that theprocedural rule at issue is constitutional, because there are signi\u00aecantdifferences between a claim of incompetence and a plea of not guilty byreason of insanity. Nonetheless, once the State has met its due processobligation of providing a defendant access to procedures for making acompetency evaluation, there is no basis for requiring it to assume theburden of vindicating the defendant's constitutional right not to be triedwhile legally incompetent by persuading the trier of fact that the de-fendant is competent to stand trial. Pp. 448\u00b1449. (d) Allocating the burden to the defendant is not inconsistent with this Court's holding in Pate v.Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 384, that a de- fendant whose competence is in doubt cannot be deemed to have waivedhis right to a competency hearing, because the question whether a de-fendant whose competence is in doubt can be deemed to have made aknowing and intelligent waiver is quite different from the question pre-sented here. Although psychiatry is an inexact science and reasonableminds may differ as to the wisdom of placing the burden of proof on thedefendant in these circumstances, the State is not required to adopt oneprocedure over another on the basis that it may produce results morefavorable to the accused. In addition, the fact that the burden of proofhas been allocated to the State on a variety of other issues implicatinga criminal defendant's constitutional rights does not mean that the bur-den must be placed on the State here. Lego v.Twomey, 404 U. S. 477, 489, distinguished. Pp. 449\u00b1452. 2. For the same reasons discussed herein with regard to the allocation of the burden of proof, the presumption of competence does not violatedue process. There is no reason to disturb the State Supreme Court'sconclusion that, in essence, the challenged presumption is a restatementof that burden.

It is well established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecutionof a defendant who is not competent to stand trial. Drope v.Missouri, 420 U. S. 162 (1975); Pate v.Robinson, 383 U. S. 375 (1966). The issue in this case is whether the Due Proc-ess Clause permits a State to require a defendant who al-leges incompetence to stand trial to bear the burden of prov-ing so by a preponderance of the evidence. I In 1984, petitioner Teo\u00aelo Medina, Jr., stole a gun from a pawnshop in Santa Ana, California. In the weeks that fol-lowed, he held up two gas stations, a drive-in dairy, and amarket, murdered three employees of those establishments,attempted to rob a fourth employee, and shot at two passers-by who attempted to follow his getaway car.

Before trial,petitioner's counsel moved for a competency hearing underCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1368 (West 1982), on the ground thathe was unsure whether petitioner had the ability to partici-pate in the criminal proceedings against him. 1 Record 320. Under California law, \u00aa[a] person cannot be tried or ad- judged to punishment while such person is mentally incom-petent.\u00ba Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1367 (West 1982). A de-fendant is mentally incompetent \u00aaif, as a result of mentaldisorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unableto understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or toassist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational man-ner.\u00ba Ibid. The statute establishes a presumption that the defendant is competent, and the party claiming incompetencebears the burden of proving that the defendant is incompe-tent by a preponderance of the evidence. \u00a7 1369(f) (\u00aaIt shallbe presumed that the defendant is mentally competent un-less it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that thedefendant is mentally incompetent\u00ba). The trial court granted the motion for a hearing and the preliminary issue of petitioner's competence to stand trialwas tried to a jury. Over the course of the 6-day hearing,in addition to lay testimony, the jury heard con\u00aficting experttestimony about petitioner's mental condition. The Su-preme Court of California gives this summary: \u00aaDr. Gold, a psychiatrist who knew defendant while he was in the Arizona prison system, testi\u00aeed that de-fendant was a paranoid schizophrenic and was incompe-tent to assist his attorney at trial. Dr. Echeandia, aclinical psychologist at the Orange County jail, doubtedthe accuracy of the schizophrenia diagnosis, and couldnot express an opinion on defendant's competence tostand trial. Dr. Sharma, a psychiatrist, likewise ex-pressed doubts regarding the schizophrenia diagnosisand leaned toward a \u00aending of competence. Dr. Pierce,505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 441 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Opinion of the Court a psychologist, believed defendant was schizophrenic, with impaired memory and hallucinations, but neverthe-less was competent to stand trial. Dr. Sakurai, a jailpsychiatrist, opined that although defendant sufferedfrom depression, he was competent, and that he mayhave been malingering. Dr. Shef\u00aeeld, who treated de-fendant for knife wounds he incurred in jail, could giveno opinion on the competency issue.\u00ba 51 Cal. 3d 870,880, 799 P. 2d 1282, 1288 (1990). During the competency hearing, petitioner engaged in sev- eral verbal and physical outbursts. App. 62, 81\u00b182; 3 Rec-ord 671, 699, 916. On one of these occasions, he overturnedthe counsel table. App. 81\u00b182. The trial court instructed the jury in accordance with \u00a7 1369(f) that \u00aathe defendant is presumed to be mentallycompetent and he has the burden of proving by a preponder-ance of the evidence that he is mentally incompetent as aresult of mental disorder or developmental disability.\u00ba App.87. The jury found petitioner competent to stand trial.Id.,at 89. A new jury was empaneled for the criminal trial, 4 Record 1020, and petitioner entered pleas of not guilty andnot guilty by reason of insanity, 51 Cal. 3d, at 899, 799 P. 2d,at 1300. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, petitioner wasfound guilty of all three counts of \u00aerst-degree murder and anumber of lesser offenses. Id.,at 878\u00b1879, 799 P. 2d, at 1287. He moved to withdraw his insanity plea, and the trial courtgranted the motion. Two days later, however, petitionermoved to reinstate his insanity plea. Although his counselexpressed the view that reinstatement of the insanity pleawas \u00aatactically unsound,\u00ba the trial court granted petitioner'smotion. Id.,at 899, 799 P. 2d, at 1300\u00b11301. A sanity hear- ing was held, and the jury found that petitioner was sane atthe time of the offenses. At the penalty phase, the juryfound that the murders were premeditated and deliberateand returned a verdict of death. The trial court imposedthe death penalty for the murder convictions and sentenced505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 442 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Opinion of the Court petitioner to a prison term for the remaining offenses. Id., at 878\u00b1880, 799 P. 2d, at 1287\u00b11288. On direct appeal to the California Supreme Court, peti- tioner did not challenge the standard of proof set forth in\u00a7 1369(f), but argued that the statute violated his right todue process by placing the burden of proof on him to estab-lish that he was not competent to stand trial. In addition,he argued that \u00a7 1369(f) violates due process by establishinga presumption that a defendant is competent to stand trialunless proven otherwise. The court rejected both of thesecontentions. Relying upon our decision in Leland v.Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), which rejected a due process challengeto an Oregon statute that required a criminal defendant toprove the defense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, thecourt observed that \u00aathe states ordinarily have great lati-tude to decide the proper placement of proof burdens.\u00ba 51Cal. 3d, at 884, 799 P. 2d, at 1291. In its view, \u00a7 1369(f) \u00aadoesnot subject the defendant to hardship or oppression,\u00ba be-cause \u00aaone might reasonably expect that the defendant andhis counsel would have better access than the People to thefacts relevant to the court's competency inquiry.\u00ba Id., at 885, 799 P. 2d, at 1291. The court also rejected petitioner'sargument that it is \u00aairrational\u00ba to retain a presumption ofcompetence after suf\u00aecient doubt has arisen as to a defend-ant's competence to warrant a hearing and \u00aadecline[d] to holdas a matter of due process that such a presumption mustbe treated as a mere presumption affecting the burden ofproduction, which disappears merely because a preliminary,often unde\u00aened and inde\u00aenite, `doubt' has arisen that justi-\u00aees further inquiry into the matter.\u00ba Id.,at 885, 799 P. 2d, at 1291\u00b11292. We granted 502 U. S. 924 (1991),and now af\u00aerm. II Petitioner argues that our decision in Mathews v.El- dridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), provides the proper analytical framework for determining whether California's allocation of505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 443 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Opinion of the Court the burden of proof in competency hearings comports with due process. We disagree. In Mathews, we articulated a three-factor test for evaluating procedural due processclaims which requires a court to consider \u00aa[f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the of\u00aecial action; second, the risk of an erroneous depriva-tion of such interest through the procedures used, andthe probable value, if any, of additional or substitute pro-cedural safeguards; and \u00aenally, the Government's inter-est, including the function involved and the \u00aescal andadministrative burdens that the additional or substituteprocedural requirement would entail.\u00ba Id.,at 335. In our view, the Mathews balancing test does not provide the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of stateprocedural rules which, like the one at bar, are part of thecriminal process. E. g., People v.Fields, 62 Cal. 2d 538, 542, 399 P. 2d 369, 371 (competency hearing \u00aamust be regardedas part of the proceedings in the criminal case\u00ba) (internalquotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 858 (1965). In the \u00aeeld of criminal law, we \u00aahave de\u00aened the category of infractions that violate `fundamental fairness' very nar-rowly\u00ba based on the recognition that, \u00aa[b]eyond the speci\u00aecguarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights, the Due Proc-ess Clause has limited operation.\u00ba Dowling v.United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (1990); United States v.Lo- vasco, 431 U. S. 783, 790 (1977). The Bill of Rights speaks in explicit terms to many aspects of criminal procedure, andthe expansion of those constitutional guarantees under theopen-ended rubric of the Due Process Clause invites undue interference with both considered legislative judgments andthe careful balance that the Constitution strikes between lib-erty and order. As we said in Spencer v.Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 564 (1967), \u00aait has never been thought that [decisionsunder the Due Process Clause] establish this Court as a rule-making organ for the promulgation of state rules of criminal505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 444 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Opinion of the Court procedure.\u00ba Accord, Estelle v.McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 70 (1991); Marshall v.Lonberger, 459 U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983). Mathews itself involved a due process challenge to the ade- quacy of administrative procedures established for the pur-pose of terminating Social Security disability bene\u00aets, andthe Mathews balancing test was \u00aerst conceived to address due process claims arising in the context of administrativelaw. Although we have since characterized the Mathews balancing test as \u00aaa general approach for testing challengedstate procedures under a due process claim,\u00ba Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 599 (1979), and applied it in a vari- ety of contexts, e. g., Santosky v.Kramer, 455 U. S. 745 (1982) (standard of proof for termination of parental rightsover objection); Addington v.Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979) (standard of proof for involuntary civil commitment to men-tal hospital for inde\u00aenite period), we have invoked Mathews in resolving due process claims in criminal law cases on onlytwo occasions. InUnited States v.Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667 (1980), we cited to the Mathews balancing test in rejecting a due process challenge to a provision of the Federal Magistrates Actwhich authorized magistrates to make \u00aendings and recom-mendations on motions to suppress evidence. In Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), we relied upon Mathews in holding that, when an indigent capital defendant has made apreliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offenseis likely to be a signi\u00aecant factor at trial, due process re-quires that the defendant be provided access to the assist-ance of a psychiatrist. Without disturbing the holdings ofRaddatz and Ake, it is not at all clear that Mathews was essential to the results reached in those cases. In Raddatz, supra, at 677\u00b1681, the Court adverted to the Mathews bal- ancing test, but did not explicitly rely upon it in conductingthe due process analysis. Raddatz, supra, at 700 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\u00aaThe Court recites th[e] test, but it does noteven attempt to apply it\u00ba). The holding in Ake can be un-505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 445 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Opinion of the Court derstood as an expansion of earlier due process cases holding that an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to the mini-mum assistance necessary to assure him \u00aaa fair opportunityto present his defense\u00ba and \u00aato participate meaningfully in[the] judicial proceeding.\u00ba Ake, supra, at 76. The proper analytical approach, and the one that we adopt here, is that set forth in Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), which was decided one year after Mathews. In Patterson, we rejected a due process challenge to a New York law which placed on a criminal defendant the burdenof proving the af\u00aermative defense of extreme emotional dis-turbance. Rather than relying upon the Mathews balancing test, however, we reasoned that a narrower inquiry wasmore appropriate: \u00aaIt goes without saying that preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States thanit is of the Federal Government, Irvine v.California, 347 U. S. 128, 134 (1954) (plurality opinion), and that weshould not lightly construe the Constitution so as to in-trude upon the administration of justice by the individ-ual States. Among other things, it is normally `withinthe power of the State to regulate procedures underwhich its laws are carried out, including the burden ofproducing evidence and the burden of persuasion,' andits decision in this regard is not subject to proscriptionunder the Due Process Clause unless `it offends someprinciple of justice so rooted in the traditions and con-science of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.'Speiser v.Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 523 (1958); Leland v. 343 U. S. 790, 798 (1952); Snyder v.Massachu- setts, 291 U. Patterson v.New York, supra, at 201\u00b1202. Accord, Martin v.Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 232 (1987). As Patter- sonsuggests, because the States have considerable expertise in matters of criminal procedure and the criminal process is505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 446 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Opinion of the Court grounded in centuries of common-law tradition, it is appro- priate to exercise substantial deference to legislative judg-ments in this area. The analytical approach endorsed inPatterson is thus far less intrusive than that approved in Mathews. Based on our review of the historical treatment of the bur- den of proof in competency proceedings, the operation of thechallenged rule, and our precedents, we cannot say that theallocation of the burden of proof to a criminal defendant toprove incompetence \u00aaoffends some principle of justice sorooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u00ba Patterson v.New York, supra, at 202 (internal quotation marks omitted). Historical practiceis probative of whether a procedural rule can be character-ized as fundamental. See 432 U. S., at 202; In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 361 (1970). The rule that a criminal defendantwho is incompetent should not be required to stand trial hasdeep roots in our common-law heritage. Blackstone ac-knowledged that a defendant \u00aawho became `mad' after thecommission of an offense should not be arraigned for it `be-cause he is not able to plead to it with that advice and cautionthat he ought,' \u00ba and \u00aaif he became `mad' after pleading, heshould not be tried, `for how can he make his defense?' \u00baDrope v.Missouri, 420 U. S., at 171 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *24); accord, 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown*34\u00b1*35. By contrast, there is no settled tradition on the proper allocation of the burden of proof in a proceeding to determinecompetence. Petitioner concedes that \u00aa[t]he common lawrule on this issue at the time the Constitution was adopted isnot entirely clear.\u00ba Brief for Petitioner 36. Early Englishauthorities either express no view on the subject, e. g., Firth's Case (1790), 22 Howell St. Tr. 307, 311, 317\u00b1318 (1817); Kinloch's Case (1746), 18 Howell St. Tr. 395, 411 (1813), or are ambiguous. E. g., King v.Steel, 1 Leach 452, 168 Eng. Rep. 328 (1787) (stating that, once a jury had determined505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT 447 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Opinion of the Court that the defendant was \u00aamute by the visitation of God\u00ba ( i. e., deaf and dumb) and not \u00aamute of malice,\u00ba there arose a \u00aapre-sumption of ideotism\u00ba that the prosecution could rebut bydemonstrating that the defendant had the capacity \u00aato un-derstand by signs and tokens\u00ba). Nineteenth century English decisions do not take a con- sistent position on the allocation of the burden of proof. Com-pare R.v.Turton, 6 Cox C. C. 385 (1854) (burden on defend- ant), with R.v.Davies, 3 Carrington & Kirwan 328, 175 Eng. Rep. 575 (1853) (burden on prosecution); see generally R.v. Podola, 43 Crim. App. 220, 235\u00b1236, 3 All E. R. 418, 429\u00b1430 (1959) (collecting con\u00aficting cases). American decisions dat-ing from the turn of the century also express divergentviews on the subject. E. g., United States v.Chisolm, 149 F. 284, 290 (SD Ala. 1906) (defendant bears burden of raisinga reasonable doubt as to competence); State v.Helm, 69 Ark. 167, 170\u00b1171, 61 S. W. 915, 916 (1901) (burden on defendantto prove incompetence). Contemporary practice, while of limited relevance to the due process inquiry, see Martin v.Ohio, supra, at 236; Pat- terson v.New York, supra, at 211, demonstrates that there remains no settled view of where the burden of proof shouldlie. The Federal Government and all 50 States haveadopted procedures that address the issue of a defendant'scompetence to stand trial. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4241; S. Brakel,J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law,Table 12.1, pp. 744\u00b1754 (3d ed. 1985). Some States have en-acted statutes that, like \u00a7 1369(f), place the burden of proofon the party raising the issue. E. g., Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 54\u00b1 56d(b) (1991); Pa. (Purdon Supp.1991). A number of state courts have said that the burdenof proof may be placed on the defendant to prove incompe-tence. E. g., Wallace v.State, 248 Ga. 255, 258\u00b1259, 282 S. E. 2d 325, 330 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 927 (1982); State v. Aumann, 265 N. W. 2d 316, 319\u00b1320 (Iowa 1978); State v. Chapman, 104 N. 324, 757 S. W. 2d 359, 362\u00b1363 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988) (en banc), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1091 (1989).Still other state courts have said that the burden rests withthe prosecution. E. g., Diaz v.State, 508 A. 2d 861, 863\u00b1864 (Del. 1986); Commonwealth v.Crowley, 393 Mass. N. E. 2d 357\u00b1358 (1984); 123 H. 465 A. 2d 912, 916 (1983); State v.Jones, 406 N. W. 2d 366, 369\u00b1370 (S. D. 1987). Discerning no historical basis for concluding that the allo- cation of the burden of proving incompetence to the defend-ant violates due process, we turn to consider whether the rule transgresses any recognized principle of \u00aafundamentalfairness\u00ba in operation. Dowling v.United States, 493 U. S., at 352. Respondent argues that our decision in Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), which upheld the right of the State to place on a defendant the burden of proving the de-fense of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, compels the con-clusion that \u00a7 1369(f) is constitutional because, like a \u00aendingof insanity, a \u00aending of incompetence has no necessary rela-tionship to the elements of a crime, on which the State bearsthe burden of proof. See also Rivera v.Delaware, 429 U. S. 877 (1976). This analogy is not convincing, because thereare signi\u00aecant differences between a claim of incompetenceand a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. See Drope v. Missouri, supra, at 176\u00b1177; Jackson v.Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 739 (1972). In a competency hearing, the \u00aaemphasis is on [the defend- ant's] capacity to consult with counsel and to comprehend theproceedings, and . . . this is by no means the same test asthose which determine criminal responsibility at the time ofthe crime.\u00ba Pate v.Robinson, 383 U. S., at 388\u00b1389 (Harlan, J., dissenting). If a defendant is incompetent, due processconsiderations require suspension of the criminal trial untilsuch time, if any, that the defendant regains the capacity toparticipate in his defense and understand the proceedingsagainst him. See Dusky v.United States, 362 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 449 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Opinion of the Court (1960) (per curiam). The entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, by contrast, presupposes that the defend-ant is competent to stand trial and to enter a plea. More-over, while the Due Process Clause affords an incompetentdefendant the right not to be tried, Drope v.Missouri, supra, at 172\u00b1173; Pate v.Robinson, supra, at 386, we have not said that the Constitution requires the States to recog-nize the insanity defense. See, e. g., Powell v.Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 536\u00b1537 (1968). Under California law, the allocation of the burden of proof to the defendant will affect competency determinations only in a narrow class of cases where the evidence is in equipoise;that is, where the evidence that a defendant is competent isjust as strong as the evidence that he is incompetent. SeeUnited States v.DiGilio, 538 F. 2d 972, 988 (CA3 1976), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 1038 (1977). Our cases recognize that adefendant has a constitutional right \u00aanot to be tried whilelegally incompetent,\u00ba and that a State's \u00aafailure to observeprocedures adequate to protect a defendant's right not to betried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial depriveshim of his due process right to a fair trial.\u00ba Drope v.Mis- souri, 420 U. S., at 172, 173. Once a State provides a defend- ant access to procedures for making a competency evalua-tion, however, we perceive no basis for holding that dueprocess further requires the State to assume the burden ofvindicating the defendant's constitutional right by persuad-ing the trier of fact that the defendant is competent tostand trial. Petitioner relies upon federal- and state-court decisions which have said that the allocation of the burden of proof tothe defendant in these circumstances is inconsistent with therule of Pate v.Robinson, supra, at 384, where we held that a defendant whose competence is in doubt cannot be deemedto have waived his right to a competency hearing. E. g., United States v.DiGilio, supra, at 988; People v.McCullum, 66 Court v.Bertrand, supra, at 727\u00b1728, 465 A. 2d, at 916. Because \u00aa `it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incom-petent, and yet knowingly or intelligently \u00aawaive\u00ba his rightto have the court determine his capacity to stand trial,' \u00ba ithas been said that it is also \u00aacontradictory to argue that adefendant who may be incompetent should be presumed topossess suf\u00aecient intelligence that he will be able to adduceevidence of his incompetency which might otherwise bewithin his grasp.\u00ba United States v.DiGilio, supra, at 988 (quoting Pate v.Robinson, supra, at 384). In our view, the question whether a defendant whose com- petence is in doubt may waive his right to a competencyhearing is quite different from the question whether the bur-den of proof may be placed on the defendant once a hearingis held. The rule announced in Pate was driven by our con- cern that it is impossible to say whether a defendant whosecompetence is in doubt has made a knowing and intelligentwaiver of his right to a competency hearing. Once a compe-tency hearing is held, however, the defendant is entitled tothe assistance of counsel, e. g., Estelle v.Smith, 451 U. S. 454, 469\u00b1471 (1981), and psychiatric evidence is brought to bearon the question of the defendant's mental condition, see, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1369(a), 1370 (West 1982 and Supp.1992); see generally Brakel, Parry, & Weiner, The MentallyDisabled and the Law, at 697\u00b1698. Although an impaireddefendant might be limited in his ability to assist counselin demonstrating incompetence, the defendant's inability toassist counsel can, in and of itself, constitute probative evi-dence of incompetence, and defense counsel will often havethe best-informed view of the defendant's ability to partici-pate in his defense. E. g., United States v.David, 167 U. S. App. D. C. 117, 122, 511 F. 2d 355, 360 (1975); United States ex rel. 1108 (CA2), cert. de- nied, U. S. 927 (1972). While reasonable minds may dif-fer as to the wisdom of placing the burden of proof on thedefendant in these circumstances, we believe that a State505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 451 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Opinion of the Court may take such factors into account in making judgments as to the allocation of the burden of proof, and we see no basisfor concluding that placing the burden on the defendant vio-lates the principle approved in Pate . Petitioner argues that psychiatry is an inexact science, and that placing the burden of proof on the defendant violatesdue process because it requires the defendant to \u00aabear therisk of being forced to stand trial as a result of an erroneous\u00aending of competency.\u00ba Brief for Petitioner 8. Our casesrecognize that \u00aa[t]he subtleties and nuances of psychiatricdiagnosis render certainties beyond in most situations,\u00ba because \u00aa[p]sychiatric diagnosi s...i st oa large extent based on medical `impressions' drawn from subjectiveanalysis and \u00aeltered through the experience of the diagnos-tician.\u00ba Addington v.Texas, 441 U. S., at 430. The Due Process Clause does not, however, require a State to adoptone procedure over another on the basis that it may produceresults more favorable to the accused. See, e. g., Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S., at 208 (\u00aaDue process does not require that every conceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, toeliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person\u00ba);Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934) (a state procedure \u00aadoes not run foul of the Fourteenth Amendmentbecause another method may seem to our thinking to befairer or wiser or to give a surer promise of protection tothe prisoner at the bar\u00ba). Consistent with our precedents,it is enough that the State affords the criminal defendant onwhose behalf a plea of incompetence is asserted a reasonableopportunity to demonstrate that he is not competent tostand trial. Petitioner further contends that the burden of proof should be placed on the State because we have allocated the burdento the State on a variety of other issues that implicate acriminal defendant's constitutional rights. E. g., Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168\u00b1169 (1986) (waiver of Miranda rights); Nix v.Williams, 467 U. 431, 444\u00b1445, 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 452 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Opinion of the Court (inevitable discovery of evidence obtained by unlawful means); United States v.Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 177\u00b1178, n. 14 (1974) (voluntariness of consent to search); Lego v.Two- mey, 404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972) (voluntariness of confession). The decisions upon which petitioner relies, however, do notcontrol the result here, because they involved situationswhere the government sought to introduce inculpatory evi-dence obtained by virtue of a waiver of, or in violation of,a defendant's constitutional rights. In such circumstances,allocating the burden of proof to the government furthersthe objective of \u00aadeterring lawless conduct by police and prosecution.\u00ba Ibid. No such purpose is served by allocat- ing the burden of proof to the government in a competencyhearing. In light of our determination that the allocation of the bur- den of proof to the defendant does not offend due process,it is not dif\u00aecult to dispose of petitioner's challenge to thepresumption of competence imposed by \u00a7 1369(f). UnderCalifornia law, a defendant is required to make a thresholdshowing of incompetence before a hearing is required and,at the hearing, the defendant may be prevented from makingdecisions that are normally left to the discretion of a compe-tent defendant. E. g., People v.Samuel, 29 Cal. 3d 489, 495\u00b1 496, 629 P. 2d 485, 486\u00b1487 (1981). Petitioner argues that,once the trial court has expressed a doubt as to the defend-ant's competence, a hearing is held, and the defendant is de-prived of his right to make determinations reserved to com-petent persons, it is irrational to retain the presumption thatthe defendant is competent. In rejecting this contention below, the California Supreme Court observed that \u00aa[t]he primary signi\u00aecance of the pre-sumption of competence is to place on defendant (or the Peo-ple, if they contest his competence) the burden of rebuttingit\u00ba and that, \u00aa[b]y its terms, the presumption of competenceis one which affects the burden of proof.\u00ba 51 Cal. 3d, at 885,799 P. 2d, at 1291. We see no reason to disturb the Califor-505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 453 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment nia Supreme Court's conclusion that, in essence, the chal- lenged presumption is a restatement of the burden of proof,and it follows from what we have said that the presumptiondoes not violate the Due Process Clause. Nothing in today's decision is inconsistent with our long- standing recognition that the criminal trial of an incompe-tent defendant violates due process. Drope v.Missouri, 420 U. S., at 172\u00b1173; Pate v.Robinson, 383 U. S., at 386; see also Riggins v.Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139 (1992) ( Kennedy, J. , concurring in judgment). Rather, our rejection of petition-er's challenge to \u00a7 1369(f) is based on a determination thatthe California procedure \u00aaconstitutionally adequate\u00ba toguard against such results, Drope v.Missouri, supra, and re\u00afects our considered view that \u00aa[t]raditionally, dueprocess has required that only the most basic proceduralsafeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society'sinterests against those of the accused ha[s] been left to thelegislative branch,\u00ba Patterson v.New York, supra, at 210. The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is Af\u00aermed. Justice O\u0092Connor , with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring in the judgment. I concur in the judgment of the Court, but I reject its intimation that the balancing of equities is inappropriate inevaluating whether state criminal procedures amount to dueprocess. Ante, at 443\u00b1446. We obviously applied the bal- ancing test of Mathews v.Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), in Ake v.Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985), a case concerning crim- inal procedure, and I do not see that Ake can be distin- guished here without disavowing the analysis on which itrests. The balancing of equities that Mathews v.Eldridge outlines remains a useful guide in due process cases. InMathews, however, we did not have to address the ques- tion of how much weight to give historical practice; in thecontext of modern administrative procedures, there OPINPGT 454 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment historical practice to consider. The same is true of the new administrative regime established by the federal criminalsentencing guidelines, and I have agreed that Mathews may be helpful in determining what process is due in that context.See Burns v.United States, 501 U. S. 129, 147\u00b1148 (1991) (Souter, J. , dissenting). While I agree with the Court that historical pedigree can give a procedural practice a presump-tion of constitutionality, see Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S. 197, 211 (1977), the presumption must surely be rebuttable. The concept of due process is, \u00aaperhaps, the least frozen concept of our law\u00d0the least con\u00aened to history and the most absorptive of powerful social standards of a progressivesociety. But neither the unfolding content of `due process'nor the particularized safeguards of the Bill of Rights disre-gard procedural ways that re\u00afect a national historic policy.\u00baGrif\u00aen v.Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 20\u00b121 (1956) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment). Against the historical status quo,I read the Court's opinion to allow some weight to be givencounterva iling considerations of fairness in operation, con- siderations much like those we evaluated in Mathews. See ante, at 448\u00b1453. Any less charitable reading of the Court's opinion would put it at odds with many of our criminal dueprocess cases, in which we have required States to instituteprocedures that were neither required at common law norexplicitly commanded by the text of the Constitution. See,e. g., Grif\u00aen v.Illinois, supra (due process right to trial tran- script on appeal); Brady v.Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963) (due process right to discovery of exculpatory evidence);Sheppard v.Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966) (due process right to protection from prejudicial publicity and courtroom dis-ruptions); Chambers v.Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284 (1973) (due process right to introduce certain evidence); Gagnon v.Scar- pelli, 411 U. S. 778 (1973) (due process right to hearing and counsel before probation revoked); Ake v.Oklahoma, supra (due process right to psychiatric examination when sanity issigni\u00aecantly in question).505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 455 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in judgment In determining whether the placement of the burden of proof is fundamentally unfair, relevant considerations in-clude: whether the government has superior access to evi-dence; whether the defendant is capable of aiding in thegarnering and evaluation of evidence on the matter to beproved; and whether placing the burden of proof on thegovernment is necessary to help enforce a further right,such as the right to be presumed innocent, the right to befree from self-incrimination, or the right to be tried whilecompetent. After balancing the equities in this case, I agree with the Court that the burden of proof may constitutionally rest onthe defendant. As the dissent points out, post, at 465, the competency determination is based largely on the testimonyof psychiatrists. The main concern of the prosecution, ofcourse, is that a defendant will feign incompetence in orderto avoid trial. If the burden of proving competence restson the government, a defendant will have less incentive tocooperate in psychiatric investigations, because an inconclu-sive examination will bene\u00aet the defense, not the prosecu-tion. A defendant may also be less cooperative in makingavailable friends or family who might have information aboutthe defendant's mental state. States may therefore decidethat a more complete picture of a defendant's competencewill be obtained if the defense has the incentive to produceall the evidence in its possession. The potentially greateroverall access to information provided by placing the burdenof proof on the defense may outweigh the danger that, inclose cases, a marginally incompetent defendant is broughtto trial. Unlike the requirement of a hearing or a psychiat-ric examination, placing the burden of proof on the govern-ment will not necessarily increase the reliability of the pro-ceedings. The equities here, then, do not weigh so much inpetitioner's favor as to rebut the presumption of constitu-tionality that the historical toleration of v.CALIFORNIA Blackmun, dissenting As the Court points out, ante, at 451\u00b1452, the other cases in which we have placed the burden of proof on the govern-ment are distinguishable. See Colorado v.Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168\u00b1169 (1986) (burden of proof on government toshow waiver of rights under Miranda v.Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)); Nix v.Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 444\u00b1445, n. 5 (1984) (burden on government to show inevitable discoveryof evidence obtained by unlawful means); United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 177\u00b1178, n. 14 (1974) (burden on gov- ernment to show voluntariness of consent to search); Lego v. Twomey, 404 U. S. 477, 489 (1972) (burden on government to show voluntariness of confession). In each of these cases,the government's burden of proof accords with its investi-gatory responsibilities. Before obtaining a confession, the government is required to ensure that the confession is givenvoluntarily. Before searching a private area without a war-rant, the government is generally required to ensure thatthe owner consents to the search. The government has noparallel responsibility to gather evidence of a defendant'scompetence. Justice Blackmun , with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenting. Teo\u00aelo Medina, Jr., may have been mentally incompetent when the State of California convicted him and sentencedhim to death. One psychiatrist testi\u00aeed he was incompe-tent. Another psychiatrist and a psychologist testi\u00aeed hewas not. Several other experts testi\u00aeed but did not expressan opinion on competence. Instructed to presume that peti-tioner Medina was competent, the jury returned a \u00aending ofcompetence. For all we know, the jury was entirely unde-cided. I do not believe a Constitution that forbids the trialand conviction of an incompetent person tolerates the trialand conviction of a person about whom the evidence of com-petency is so equivocal and unclear.

S. 162, 172 (1975). The Due Proc- ess Clause forbids the trial and conviction of persons incapa-ble of defending themselves\u00d0persons lacking the capacity tounderstand the nature and object of the proceedings againstthem, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing theirdefense. Id.,at 171. 1See also Pate v.Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966). The right to be tried while competent is the foundational right for the effective exercise of a defendant's other rightsin a criminal trial. \u00aaCompetence to stand trial is rudimen-tary, for upon it depends the main part of those rightsdeemed essential to a fair trial, including the right to effec-tive assistance of counsel, the rights to summon, to confront,and to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to testify onone's own behalf or to remain silent without penalty fordoing so.\u00ba Riggins v.Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 139 (1992) (Kennedy, J. , concurring in judgment). In the words of Professor Morris, one of the world's leading criminologists,incompetent persons \u00aaare not really present at trial; theymay not be able properly to play the role of an accused per-son, to recall relevant events, to produce evidence and wit-nesses, to testify effectively on their own behalf, to help con-front hostile witnesses, and to project to the trier of facts a 1\u00aa[I]t is not enough for the district judge to \u00aend that the defendant is oriented to time and place and has some recollection of events, but thatthe test must be whether he has suf\u00aecient present ability to consult withhis lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u00d0andwhether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceed-ings against him,\u00ba Dusky v.United States, 362 U.

Morris, Madness and the Criminal Law 37 (1982). This Court's cases are clear that the right to be tried while competent is so critical a prerequisite to the criminal processthat \u00aastate procedures must be adequate to protect this right.\u00ba Pate, 383 U. S., at 378 (emphasis added). \u00aa[T]he failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defend-ant's right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent tostand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fairtrial.\u00ba Drope, 420 U. S., at 172. In other words, the Due Process Clause does not simply forbid the State to try toconvict a person who is incompetent. It also demands ade-quate anticipatory, protective p rocedures to minimize the risk that an incompetent person will be convicted. JusticeFrankfurter recognized this in a related context: \u00aaIf the deeply rooted principle in our society against k illing an in- sane man is to be respected, at least the minimum provisionfor assuring a fair application of that principle is inherent inthe principle itself.\u00ba Solesbee v.Balkcom, 339 U. S. 9, 23 (1950) (dissenting opinion). Anticipatory protective proce-dures are necessary as well because \u00aawe have previously em-phasized the dif\u00aeculty of retrospectively determining an ac-cused's competence to stand trial.\u00ba Pate, 383 U. S., at 387. See also Drope, 420 U. S., at 183; Dusky v.United States, 362 U. S. 402, 403 (1960). See generally Miller & Germain,The Retrospective Evaluation of Competency to Stand Trial,11 Int'l J. Law and Psych. 113 (1988). This Court expressly has recognized that one of the re- quired procedural protections is \u00aafurther inquiry\u00ba or a hear-ing when there is a suf\u00aecient doubt raised about a defend-ant's competency. Drope, 420 U. S., at 180; Pate, 383 U. S., at 385\u00b1386. In my view, then, the only question before theCourt in this case is whether\u00d0as with the right to a hear-ing\u00d0placing the burden of proving competence on the Stateis necessary to protect adequately the underlying due proc-505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 459 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting ess right. I part company with the Court today, because I believe the answer to that question is in the af\u00aermative. II As an initial matter, I believe the Court's approach to this case effectively asks and answers the wrong doctrinal ques-tion. Following the lead of the parties, the Court mistak-enly frames its inquiry in terms of whether to apply a stand-ard it takes to be derived from language in Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), or a standard based on the func- tional balancing approach of Mathews v.Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976). Ante, at 442\u00b1446. The Court is not put to such a choice. Under Drope and Pate, it need decide only whether a procedure imposing the burden of proof upon thedefendant is \u00aaadequate\u00ba to protect the constitutional prohibi-tion against trial of incompetent persons. The Court, however, chooses the Patterson path, announc- ing that there is no violation of due process unless placingthe burden of proof of incompetency upon the defendant\u00aa ` \u00aaoffends some principle of justice so rooted in the tradi-tions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as funda-mental.\u00ba ' \u00ba Ante, at 445 (quoting Patterson, 432 U. S., at 202). Separating the primary right (the right not to be triedwhile incompetent) from the subsidiary right (the right notto bear the burden of proof of incompetency), the Court ac-knowledges the primary right to be fundamental in \u00aaourcommon-law heritage,\u00ba but determines the subsidiary rightto be without a \u00aasettled tradition\u00ba deserving of constitutionalprotection. Ante, at 446. This approach is mistaken, be- cause it severs two integrally related procedural rights thatcannot be examined meaningfully in isolation. The protec-tions of the Due Process Clause, to borrow the second JusticeHarlan's words, are simply not \u00aaa series of isolated pointspricked\u00ba out in terms of their most speci\u00aec level of historicgenerality. Poe v.Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 543 (1961) (dissent- ing opinion). Had the Court taken the same historical-505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 460 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Blackmun, J., dissenting categorical approach in Pate and Drope, it would not have recognized that a defendant has a right to a competencyhearing, for in neither of those cases was there any showingthat the mere denial of a hearing where there is doubt aboutcompetency offended any deeply rooted traditions of theAmerican people. In all events, I do not interpret the Court's reliance on Patterson to undermine the basic balancing of the gov- ernment's interests against the individual's interest that isgermane to any due process inquiry. While unw illing to discount the force of tradition and history, the CourtinPatterson did not adopt an exclusively tradition-based approach to due process analysis. Relying on Morrison v. California, 291 U. S. 82 (1934), the Court in Patterson looked to the \u00aaconvenience\u00ba to the government and \u00aahardship oroppression\u00ba to the defendant in forming its allocation of theburden of proof. 432 U. S., at 203, n. 9, and 210. \u00aa `The decisions are manifold that within limits of reason and fairness the burden of proof may be lifted from thestate in criminal prosecutions and cast on a defendant.The limits are in substance these, that the state shallhave proved enough to make it just for the defendant tobe required to repel what has been proved with excuseor explanation, or at least that upon a balancing of convenience or of the opportunities for knowledge theshifting of the burden will be found to be an aid to the accuser without subjecting the accused to hard- ship or oppression.

The statute providedthat, once the State proved the defendant used or occupiedfarmland, the burden of proving citizenship or eligibility fornaturalization rested upon the defendant. See 291 U. S.,at 84. At the time, persons of Asian ancestry were gener-ally not eligible for naturalization. See id.,at 85\u00b186. The Court observed that in the \u00aavast majority of cases,\u00ba therewould be no unfairness to the distribution of the burden, be-cause a defendant's Asian ancestry could plainly be observed.Id.,at 94. But, where the evidence is in equipoise\u00d0as when the defendant is of mixed blood and his outward appearancedoes not readily reveal his Asian ancestry\u00d0\u00aathe promotionof convenience from the point of view of the prosecution willbe outweighed by the probability of injustice to the accused.\u00baIbid. Thus, the Court concluded: \u00aaThere can be no escape from hardship and injustice, outweighing many times anyprocedural convenience, unless the burden of persuasion inrespect of racial origin is cast upon the People.\u00ba Id.,at 96. Consistent with Morrison, I read the Court's opinion today to acknowledge that Patterson does not relieve the Court from evaluating the underlying fairness of imposingthe burden of proof of incompetency upon the defendant.That is why the Court not only looks to \u00aathe historical treat-ment of the burden of proof in competency proceedings\u00ba butalso looks to \u00aathe operation of the challenged rule, and ourprecedents.\u00ba Ante, at 446. That is why the Court eventu- ally turns to determining \u00aawhether the rule [placing uponthe defendant the burden of proof of incompetency] trans-gresses any recognized principle of `fundamental fairness' inoperation.\u00ba Ante, at 448. Carrying out this inquiry, the Court points out that the defendant is already entitled to the assistance of counsel andto a psychiatric evaluation. Ante, at 450. It suggests as well that defense counsel will have \u00aathe best-informed view\u00baof the defendant's ability to 07-09-96 PAGES OPINPGT cordingly, the Court concludes: \u00aa[I]t is enough that the State affords the criminal defendant on whose behalf a plea of in-competence is asserted a reasonable opportunity to demon-strate that he is not competent to stand trial.\u00ba Ante, at 451. While I am unable to agree with the Court's conclusion, it isclear that the Court ends up engaging in a balancing inquiry not meaningfully distinguishable from that of the Mathews v.Eldridge test it earlier appears to forswear. 2 I am perplexed that the Court, while recognizing \u00aathe careful balance that the Constitution strikes between lib- erty and order,\u00ba ante, at 443 (emphasis added), intimates that the apparent \u00aaexpertise\u00ba of the States in criminal procedure 2Recently, several Members of this Court have expressly declined to limit Mathews v.Eldridge balancing to the civil administrative context and determined that Mathews provides the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of criminal rules of procedure. See Burns v.United States, 501 U. S. 129, 148\u00b1156 (1991) ( Souter, J. , joined in relevant part byWhite and O\u0092Connor, JJ. , dissenting) (applying Mathews to federal criminal sentencing procedures, stating that Mathews does not apply only to civil \u00aaadministrative\u00ba determinations but \u00aa[t]he Mathews analysis has thus been used as a general approach for determining the procedures re-quired by due process whenever erroneous governmental action wouldinfringe an individual's protected interest\u00ba). The Court also acknowl-edges that it has previously relied on Mathews v.Eldridge in at least two cases concerning criminal procedure. Ante, at 444 (citing Ake v.Okla- homa, 470 U. S. 68 (1985) (due process requires appointment of psychia- trist where defendant's sanity at the time of the offense is to be signi\u00aecantfactor at trial), and United States v.Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667 (1980) (due process does not require federal district judges to make de novo determi- nation with live testimony of issues presented in motion to suppress)). The Court claims that \u00aait is not at all clear\u00ba that Mathews was \u00aaessential to the results reached in\u00ba Ake and Raddatz. Ante, at 444. I am not sure what the Court means, because both cases unquestionably set forth thefull Mathews test and evaluated the interests. See Ake, 470 U. S., at 77\u00b183; Raddatz, 447 U. S., at 677\u00b1679. What the Court should \u00aend clear, if anything, from these two cases is that the speci\u00aec rights asserted there were historically novel and could hardly be said to have constituted \u00aaprin-ciple[s] of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our peopleas to be ranked as fundamental.\u00ba505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 463 Cite as: 505 U.

Because the Due Process Clause is not the Some Proc- ess Clause, I remain convinced that it requires carefulbalancing of the individual and governmental interests atstake to determine what process is due. III I believe that requiring a possibly incompetent person to carry the burden of proving that he is incompetent cannotbe called \u00aaadequate,\u00ba within the meaning of the decisions inPate and Drope, to protect a defendant's right to be tried only while competent. In a variety of other contexts, theCourt has allocated the burden of proof to the prosecutionas part of the protective procedures designed to ensure theintegrity of speci\u00aec underlying rights. In Lego v.Twomey, 404 U. S. 477 (1972), for example, the Court determined thatwhen the prosecution seeks to use at trial a confession chal-lenged as involuntary, \u00aathe prosecution must prove at leastby a preponderance of the evidence that the confession wasvoluntary,\u00ba because the defendant is \u00aaentitled to a reliableand clear-cut determination that the confession was in factvoluntarily rendered.\u00ba Id., at 489. See also Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 167\u00b1169 (1986) (burden on prosecu- tion to show defendant waived Miranda rights); Nix v.Wil- liams, 467 U. S. 431, 444, and n. 5 (1984) (burden on prosecu- tion to show inevitable discovery of evidence obtained byunlawful means); United States v.Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, 177\u00b1178, n. 14 (1974) (burden on prosecution to show volun-tariness of consent to search). Equally weighty concernswarrant imposing the burden of proof upon the State here. The Court suggests these cases are distinguishable be- cause they shift the burden of proof in order to deter lawlessconduct by law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities,while in this case deterrence is irrelevant. Ante, at 451\u00b1453.505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 464 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Blackmun, J., dissenting If anything, this distinction cuts against the Court's point of view. Deterrence of of\u00aecial misconduct during the investi-gatory stage of the criminal process has less to do with thefairness of the trial and an accurate determination of thedefendant's guilt than does the defendant's ability to under-stand and participate in the trial itself. Accordingly, thereis greater reason here to impose a trial-related cost upon thegovernment\u00d0in the form of the burden of proof\u00d0to ensurethe fairness and accuracy of the trial. Cf. United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U. S. 655, 660 (1992) (of\u00aecial miscon- duct in the form of forcible kidnaping of defendant for trial does not violate defendant's due process rights at trial).Moreover, given the Court's consideration of nontrial-relatedinterests, I wonder whether the Court owes any consider-ation to the public interest in the appearance of fairness inthe criminal justice system. The trial of persons aboutwhose competence the evidence is inconclusive unquestion-ably \u00aaundermine[s] the very foundation of our system ofjustice\u00d0our citizens' con\u00aedence in it.\u00ba Georgia v.McCol- lum, ante, at 49. \u00aaIn all kinds of litigation it is plain that where the burden of proof lies may be decisive of the outcome.\u00ba Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S., at 525. To be sure, the requirement of a hearing (once there is a threshold doubt as to competency)and the provision for a psychiatric evaluation, see Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 81 (1985), do ensure at least some protection against the trial of incompetent persons. Yet incases where the evidence is inconclusive, a defendant bearingthe burden of proof of his own incompetency now will stillbe subjected to trial. In my view, this introduces a system-atic and unacceptably high risk that persons will be triedand convicted who are unable to follow or participate in theproceedings determining their fate. I, therefore, cannotagree with the Court that \u00aareasonable minds may differ asto the wisdom of placing the burden of proof\u00ba on likely in-competent defendants. Ante, at 450.505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 465 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting The Court suggests that \u00aadefense counsel will often have the best-informed view of the defendant's ability to partici-pate in his defense.\u00ba Ibid. There are at least three good reasons, however, to doubt the Court's con\u00aedence. First,while the defendant is in custody, the State itself obviouslyhas the most direct, unfettered access to him and is in thebest position to observe his behavior. In the present case,Medina was held before trial in the Orange County jail sys-tem for more than a year and a half prior to his competencyhearing. 3 Tr. 677\u00b1684. During the months immediatelypreceding the competency hearing, he was placed several times for extended periods in a padded cell for treatmentand observation by prison psychiatric personnel. Id.,at 226, 682\u00b1684. While Medina was in the padded cell, prison per-sonnel observed his behavior every 15 minutes. Id.,at 226. Second, a competency determination is primarily a medical and psychiatric determination. Competency determinationsby and large turn on the testimony of psychiatric experts,not lawyers. \u00aaAlthough competency is a legal issue ulti-mately determined by the courts, recommendations bymental health professionals exert tremendous in\u00afuence onjudicial determinations, with rates of agreement typicallyexceeding 90%.\u00ba Nicholson & Johnson, Prediction of Com-petency to Stand Trial: Contribution of Demographics, Typeof Offense, Clinical Characteristics, and Psycholegal Ability,14 Int'l J. Law and Psych. 287 (1991) (citations omitted). Seealso S. Brakel, J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabledand the Law 703 (3d ed. 1985) (same). While the testimonyof psychiatric experts may be far from infallible, see Bare- foot v.Estelle, 463 U. ( Blackmun, J. , dis- senting), it is the experts and not the lawyers who are cred-ited as the \u00aabest informed,\u00ba and most able to gauge adefendant's ability to understand and participate in the legalproceedings affecting him. Third, even assuming that defense counsel has the \u00aabest- informed view\u00ba of the defendant's competency, PAGES OPINPGT 466 MEDINA v.CALIFORNIA Blackmun, J., dissenting view will likely have no outlet in, or effect on, the com- petency determination. Unlike the testimony of medicalspecialists or lay witnesses, the testimony of defense coun-sel is far more likely to be discounted by the fact\u00aender asself-interested and biased. Defense counsel may also bediscouraged in the \u00aerst place from testifying for fear ofabrogating an ethical responsibility or the attorney-clientprivilege. See, e. g., ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards \u00a7 7\u00b14.8(b), Commentary Introduction, p. 209, andCommentary, pp. 212\u00b1213 (1989). By way of example fromthe case at hand, it should come as little surprise that neither of Medina's two attorneys was among the dozens of personstestifying during the six days of competency proceedings inthis case. 1 Tr. 1\u00b15 (witness list). Like many psychological inquiries, competency evaluations are \u00aain the present state of the mental sciences . . . at besta hazardous guess however conscientious.\u00ba Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U. S., at 23 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). See also Ake v.Oklahoma, 470 U. S., at 81; Addington v.Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 430 (1979); Drope, 420 U. S., at 176. This un- avoidable uncertainty expands the range of cases where thefact\u00aender will conclude the evidence is in equipoise. TheCourt, however, dismisses this concern on grounds that\u00aa `[d]ue process does not require that every conceivable stepbe taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate the possibility ofconvicting an innocent person.' \u00ba Ante, at 451 (quoting Pat- terson, 432 U. S., at 208). Yet surely the Due Process Clause requires some conceivable steps be taken to eliminate the risk of erroneous convictions. I search in vain for any guid-ing principle in the Court's analysis that determines whenthe risk of a wrongful conviction happens to be acceptableand when it does not. The allocation of the burden of proof re\u00afects a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be distributedbetween litigants. Cf. Santosky v.Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 755 (1982) (standard of proof). This Court has said it well505us2106J 07-09-96 16:32:36 PAGES OPINPGT 467 Cite as: 505 U. S. 437 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting before: \u00aaThe individual should not be asked to share equally with society the risk of error when the possible injury to theindividual is signi\u00aecantly greater than any possible harm tothe state.\u00ba Addington v.Texas, 441 U. S., at 427. The costs to the State of bearing the burden of proof of compe-tency are not at all prohibitive. The Court acknowledgesthat several States already bear the burden, ante, at 447\u00b1 448, and that the allocation of the burden of proof will makea difference \u00aaonly in a narrow class of cases where the evi-dence is in equipoise,\u00ba ante, at 449. In those few dif\u00aecult cases, the State should bear the burden of remitting the de-fendant for further psychological observation to ensure thathe is competent to defend himself. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1370(a)(1) (West Supp. 1992) (defendant foundincompetent shall be \u00aadelivered\u00ba to state hospital or treat-ment facility \u00aawhich will promote the defendant's speedy res-toration to mental competence\u00ba). See also Jackson v.Indi- ana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972) (Due Process Clause allows State to hold incompetent defendant \u00aafor reasonable periodof time necessary to determine whether there is a substan-tial probability\u00ba of return to competency). In the narrowclass of cases where the evidence is in equipoise, the Statecan reasonably expect that it will speedily be able to returnthe defendant for trial. IV Just this Term the Court reaf\u00aermed that the Due Process Clause prevents the States from taking measures that under-mine the defendant's right to be tried while fully aware andable to defend himself. In Riggins v.Nevada, 504 U. S. 127 (1992), the Court reversed on due process grounds the con-viction of a defendant subjected to the forcible administra-tion of antipsychotic drugs during his trial. Rejecting thedissent's insistence that actual prejudice be shown, the Courtfound it to be \u00aa clearly possible \u00ba that the medications affected the defendant's \u00aaability to follow the proceedings, or the sub-stance of his communication with counsel.\u00ba id.,at 141 ( Kennedy, J. , concurring in judgment) (prosecution must show \u00aa no signi\u00aecant risk that the medication will impair or alter in any material waythe defendant's capacity or w illing ness to react to the testi- mony at trial or to assist his counsel\u00ba) (emphasis added). I consider it no less likely that petitioner Medina was tried and sentenced to death while effectively unable to defendhimself. That is why I do not share the Court's remarkablecon\u00aedence that \u00aa[n]othing in today's decision is inconsistentwith our longstanding recognition that the criminal trial ofan incompetent defendant violates due process.\u00ba Ante, at 453. I do not believe the constitutional prohibition againstconvicting incompetent persons remains \u00aafundamental\u00ba if theState is at liberty to go forward with a trial when the evi-dence of competency is inconclusive. Accordingly, I dissent.505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:05 PAGES OPINPGT 469 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit No. 91\u00b117. Argued March 25, 1992\u00d0Decided June 22, 1992 Floyd Cowart, whose estate is the petitioner, was injured while working on an oil drilling platform owned by Transco Exploration Company (Transco), in an area subject to the Longshore and Harbor Workers'Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act). The Department of Labor gaverespondent Compass Insurance Co. (Compass), the insurer for Cowart'semployer, respondent Nicklos D rilling Company (Nicklos), an informal notice that Cowart was due permanent disability payments, but nonewere ever made. In the meantime, Cowart settled a negligence actionwith Transco, which Nicklos funded under an indemni\u00aecation agreementwith Cowart did not secure from Nicklos or Com-pass a formal, prior, written approval of the settlement. Subsequently,Cowart \u00aeled a claim with the Department of Labor seeking disabilitypayments from Nicklos. Nicklos denied liability on the ground that re-covery was barred under \u00a7 33(g) of the Act, which provides that a \u00aaper- son entitled to compensation\u00ba must obtain prior written approval fromthe employer and its insurer of any settlement of a third-party claim,\u00a7 33(g)(1), and that the failure of the \u00aaemployee\u00ba to secure the approvalresults in forfeiture of all rights under the Act, \u00a7 33(g)(2). The Admin-istrative Law Judge awarded bene\u00aets, relying on Bene\u00aets ReviewBoard (BRB) decisions: one in which the BRB held in an earlierversion of \u00a7 33(g) the words \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba did notrefer to a person not yet receiving bene\u00aets; and another in which it heldthat, since this phrase was not altered in the 1984 amendments to theLHWCA that added \u00a7 33(g)(2), Congress was presumed to have adoptedthe BRB's interpretation. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that\u00a7 33(g) unambiguously provides for forfeiture whenever an LHWCAclaimant fails to meet the written-approval requirement. Held: Section 33(g)'s forfeiture provision applies to a worker whose em- ployer, at the time the worker settles with a third party, is neitherpaying compensation to the worker nor subject to an order to pay underthe Act. The section's language is plain and cannot support the BRB'sinterpretation. The normal meaning of entitlement includes a right orbene\u00aet for which a person quali\u00aees, regardless of whether the right orbene\u00aet has been acknowledged or adjudicated. Thus, Cowart PAGES OPINPGT 470 ESTATE COWART DRILLING CO. Opinion of the Court \u00aaentitled to compensation\u00ba at the moment his right to recovery under the Act vested. If the language of \u00a7 33(g)(1) left any doubt, the ambigu-ity would be eliminated by the statute's structure, especially the addi-tion of subsection (g)(2). This interpretation of \u00a7 33(g) is reinforced bythe fact that the phrase \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba is used else-where in the statute in contexts in which it cannot bear Cowart's mean-ing, and is not altered by the fact that subsection (g)(2) uses the term\u00aaemployee\u00ba rather than that phrase. Contrary to Cowart's argument,this interpretation of \u00a7 33(g) gives full meaning to all of subsection(g)(2)'s noti\u00aecation and consent requirements. The question whetherNicklos' participation in the settlement brings this case outside\u00a7 33(g)(1)'s terms is not addressed, since it was not fairly included withinthe question on which certiorari was granted. The possible harsh ef-fects of \u00a7 33(g) are recognized, but it is the duty of the courts to enforcethe judgment of the legislature; it is Congress that has the authority tochange the statute, not the courts.

The Act allows injuredworkers, without forgoing compensation under the Act, topursue claims against third parties for their injuries. But\u00a7 33(g) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 933(g), provides thatunder certain circumstances if a third-party claim is settledwithout the written approval of the worker's employer, allfuture bene\u00aets including medical bene\u00aets are forfeited. Thequestion we must decide today is whether the forfeiture pro-vision applies to a worker whose employer, at the time theworker settles with a third party, is neither paying compen-sation to the worker nor yet subject to an order to pay underthe Act. I The injured worker in this case was Floyd Cowart, and his estate is now the petitioner. Cowart suffered an injuryto his hand on July 20, 1983, while working on an oil dr illing platform owned by Transco Exploration Company (Transco).The platform was located on the Outer Continental Shelf, anarea subject to the Act. 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1333(b). Cowart wasan employee of the Nicklos Dr illing Company (Nicklos), who along with its insurer Compass Insurance Co. (Compass) arerespondents before us. Nicklos and Compass paid Cowarttemporary disability payments for 10 months following hisinjury. At that point Cowart's treating physician releasedhim to return to work, though he found Cowart had a 40%permanent partial disability. App. 75. The Department ofLabor noti\u00aeed Compass that Cowart was owed permanentdisability payments in the total amount of $35,592.77, pluspenalties and interest. This was an informal notice whichdid not constitute an award. No payments were made. Cowart, meanwhile, had \u00aeled an action against Transco al- leging that Transco's negligence caused his injury. On July1, 1985, Cowart settled the action for $45,000, of which hereceived $29,350.60 after attorney's fees and expenses.Nicklos funded the entire settlement under an indemni\u00aeca-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:05 PAGES OPINPGT 472 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Opinion of the Court tion agreement with Transco, and it had prior notice of the settlement amount. But Cowart made a mistake: He did notsecure from Nicklos a formal, prior, written approval of theTransco settlement. After settling, Cowart \u00aeled an administrative claim with the Department of Labor seeking disability payments fromNicklos. Nicklos denied liability on the grounds that underthe terms \u00a7 33(g)(2) of the LHWCA, Cowart had bene\u00aets by fa iling to secure approval from Nicklos and Compass of his settlement with Transco, in the manner re-quired by \u00a7 33(g)(1). Section 33(g) provides in pertinent part: \u00aa(g) Compromise obtained by person entitled to compensation \u00aa(1) If the person entitled to compensation (or the person's representative) enters into a settlement with athird person referred to in subsection (a) of this sectionfor an amount less than the compensation to which theperson (or the person's representative) would be entitledunder this chapter, the employer shall be liable for com-pensation as determined under subsection (f) of this sec-tion only if written approval of the settlement is ob-tained from the employer and the employer's carrier,before the settlement is executed, and by the personentitled to compensation (or the person's representa-tive).

The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rejected Nicklos' argument on the basis of prior interpretations of \u00a7 33(g) bythe Bene\u00aets Review Board (Board those decisions, O'Leary v.Southeast Stevedoring F. 2d 595 (CA9 1980), theBoard held that in an earlier version of \u00a7 33(g) the words\u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba referred only to injuredemployees whose employers were making compensation pay-ments, whether voluntary or pursuant to an award. TheO'Leary decision held that a person not yet receiving bene- \u00aets was not a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00ba even thoughthe person had a valid claim for bene\u00aets. The statute was amended to its present form, the form we have quoted, in 1984. In that year Congress redesignatedthen subsection (g) to what is now (g)(1) and modi\u00aeed itslanguage somewhat, but did not change the phrase \u00aapersonentitled to compensation.\u00ba Congress also added the currentsubsection (g)(2), as well as other provisions.

The Board reaf\u00aermed interpretation inO'Leary of the phrase \u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00ba saying that because the 1984 amendments had not changedthe speci\u00aec language, Congress was presumed to haveadopted the Board's previous interpretation. It noted thatnothing in the 1984 legislative history disclosed an intent tooverrule the Board's interpretations. The Board decidedthat the forfeiture provisions of subsection (g)(2), includingthe \u00aenal phrase providing that forfeiture occurs \u00aaregardlessof whether the employer . . . has made payments or acknowl-edged entitlement to was a \u00aaseparate provisio[n]applicable to separate situations.\u00ba 18 BRBS, at 29.

Opinion of the Court compensation because he was not receiving payments at the time of the Transco settlement. Thus, the written-approvalprovision did not apply and Cowart was entitled to bene\u00aets.Cowart's total disability award was for $35,592.77, less Cow-art's net recovery from Transco of $29,350.60, for a net awardof $6,242.17. In addition, Cowart was awarded interest, at-torney's fees, and future medical bene\u00aets, the last constitut-ing, we think, a matter of great potential consequence. TheBoard af\u00aermed in reliance on Dorsey. 23 BRBS 42 (1989) (per curiam) . On review, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 907 F. 2d 1552 (1990). Without address-ing the Board's speci\u00aec statutory interpretation, it held that\u00a7 33(g) contains no exceptions to its written-approval re-quirement. Because this holding, and a decision by a panelin a different case, Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. v.Barger, 910 F. 2d 276 (CA5 1990), con\u00aficted with a previous unpublisheddecision in the same Circuit, Kahny v.O. W. C. P., 729 F. 2d 777 (CA5 1984), the Court of Appeals granted rehearing enbanc. The Director of the Of\u00aece of Workers' CompensationPrograms (OWCP), a part of the Department of Labor, 20CFR \u00a7 701.201 (1991), appeared as a respondent before thefull Court of Appeals to defend the interpretation and deci-sion of the Board. In a per curiam opinion, the en banc Court of Appeals con\u00aermed the panel's decision reversing the BRB in its Cow- artcase. 927 F. 2d 828 (CA5 The Court of Appeals' majority held that \u00a7 33(g) is unambiguous in providing forforfeiture whenever an LHWCA claimant fails to get writtenapproval from his employer of a third-party settlement.The majority acknowledged the well-established principle re-quiring judicial deference to reasonable interpretations byan agency of the statute it administers, but concluded thatthe plain language of \u00a7 33(g) leaves no room for interpreta-tion.

II In a statutory construction case, the beginning point must be the language of the statute, and when a statute speakswith clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute'smeaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is\u00aenished. Demarest v.Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 190 (1991). The question is whether Cowart, at the time of the Transcosettlement, was a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba 33(g)(1) of the LHWCA. he did not comply with the written-approval require-ments of the statute, while Nicklos and Compass do not claimthat they lacked notice of the Transco settlement. By theterms of \u00a7 33(g)(2), Cowart would have forfeited his LHWCAbene\u00aets if, and only if, he was subject to the written-approvalprovisions of \u00a7 33(g)(1). Cowart claims that he is not subjectto the approval requirement because in his view the phrase\u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00ba as long interpreted byboth the BRB and the OWCP, limits the reach of \u00a7 33(g)(1)to injured workers who are either already receiving compen-sation payments from their employer, or in whose favor anaward of compensation has been entered. Nicklos and Com-pass, supported by the United States, defend the holding ofthe Court of Appeals that \u00a7 33(g) cannot support that read-ing. We agree with these respondents and hold that underthe plain language of \u00a7 33(g), Cowart forfeited his right to obtain the wr itten approval of Nicklos and Compass prior to settling 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 476 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Opinion of the Court The contro lling pri nciple in this case is the basic and unex- ceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear mean-ing of statutes as written. The principle can at times comeinto some tension with another fundamental principle of ourlaw, one requiring judicial deference to a reasonable statu-tory interpretation by an administering agency. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); National Railroad Passenger Corporation v.Boston & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 417 (1992). Of course, a reviewing court should not defer to an agency posi-tion which is contrary to an intent of Congress expressed in unambiguous terms. Km a r tC o r p . v.Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S. 281, 291 (1988); Chevron, supra, at 842\u00b1843. In any event, we need not resolve any tension of that sort here, becausethe Director of the OWCP and the Department of Laborhave altered their position regarding the best interpretationof \u00a7 33(g). The Director appears as a respondent before us,arguing in favor of the Court of Appeals' statutory interpre-tation, and contrary to his previous position. See Brief forFederal Respondent 8, n. 6. If the Director asked us todefer to his new statutory interpretation, this case might present a dif\u00aecult question regarding whether and underwhat circumstances deference is due to an interpretation for-mulated during litigation. See Bowen v.Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212\u00b1213 (1988); Martin v.Occupa- tional Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 158 (1991). The agency does not ask this, however. Instead,the federal respondent argues that the Court of Appeals wascorrect in saying the language of \u00a7 33(g) is plain and cannotsupport the interpretation given it by the Board. Becausewe agree with the federal respondent and the Court of Ap-peals, and because Cowart concedes that the position of theBRB is not entitled to any special deference, see Brief forPetitioner 25; see also Potomac Electric Power Co. v.Direc- tor, Of\u00aece of Workers' Compensation Programs, 449 U. S. 268, 278, n. 18 (1980); Martin v.Occupational Safety and505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 477 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Opinion of the Court Health Review Comm'n, supra, we need not resolve the dif- \u00aecult issues regarding deference which would be lurking inother circumstances. As a preliminary matter, the natural reading of the statute supports the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a person enti-tled to compensation need not be receiving compensation orhave had an adjudication in his favor. Both in legal and gen-eral usage, the normal meaning of entitlement includes aright or bene\u00aet for which a person quali\u00aees, and it does notdepend upon whether the right has been acknowledged oradjudicated. It means only that the person satis\u00aees the pre- requisites attached to the right. See generally Board of Regents of State Colleges v.Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972) (discussing property interests protected by the Due ProcessClause and contrasting an entitlement to an expectancy);Black's Law Dictionary 532 (6th ed. 1990) (de\u00aening \u00aaentitle\u00baas \u00aaTo qualify for; to furnish with proper grounds for seekingor claiming\u00ba). Cowart suffered an injury which by theterms of the LHWCA gave him a right to compensation fromhis employer. He became a person entitled to compensationat the moment his right to recovery vested, not when hisemployer admitted liability, an event even yet to happen. If the language of \u00a7 33(g)(1), in isolation, left any doubt, the structure of the statute would remove all ambiguity.First, and perhaps most important, when Congress amended\u00a7 33(g) in 1984, it added the explicit forfeiture features of\u00a7 33(g)(2), which specify that forfeiture occurs \u00aaregardless ofwhether the employer or the employer's insurer has madepayments or acknowledged entitlement to bene\u00aets under thischapter.\u00ba We read that phrase to modify the entirety ofsubsection (g)(2), including the beginning part discussing thewritten-approval requirement of paragraph (1). The BRBdid not \u00aend this amendment contro lling because the quoted language is not an explicit modi\u00aecation of subsection (1).This is a strained reading of what Congress intended. Sub-section (g)(2) leaves little doubt that the contemplated for-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 478 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Opinion of the Court feiture will occur whether or not the employer has made pay- ments or acknowledged liability. The addition of subsection (g)(2) in 1984 also precludes the primary argument made by the BRB in favor of its deci-sions in Dorsey and this case, and repeated by Cowart to us: That Congress in 1984, by reenacting the phrase \u00aapersonentitled to compensation,\u00ba adopted the Board's reading ofthat language in O'Leary. The argument might have had some force if \u00a7 33(g) had been reenacted without changes,but that was not the case. In 1984 Congress did more thanreenact \u00a7 33(g); it added new provisions and new language which on their face appear to have the speci\u00aec purpose ofoverruling the prior administrative interpretation. In lightof the clear import of \u00a7 33(g)(2), the Board erred in relyingon the purported lack of legislative history showing an ex-plicit intent to reject the O'Leary decision. Even were it relevant, the Board's reading of the legislative history issuspect because as the federal respondent demonstrates, thelegislative history of predecessor bills to the eventual 1984enactment do indicate an intent to overturn O'Leary. See Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation ActAmendments of 1981: Hearings on S. 1182 before the Sub-committee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor andHuman Resources, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 209, 210\u00b1211, 396(1981). In any event, administrative interpretation followedby congressional reenactment cannot overcome the plain lan-guage of a statute. Demarest v.Manspeaker, 498 U. S., at 190. And the language of \u00a7 33(g) is plain. Our interpretation of \u00a7 33(g) is reinforced by the fact that the phrase \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba appears else-where in the statute in contexts in which it cannot bear themeaning placed on it by Cowart. For example, \u00a7 14(h) of theLHWCA, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 914(h), requires an of\u00aecial to conductan investigation upon the request of a person entitled to com-pensation when, inter alia, the claim is controverted and payments are not being made. For that provision, the inter-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 479 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Opinion of the Court pretation championed by Cowart would be nonsensical. An- other dif\u00aeculty would be presented for the provision preced-ing \u00a7 33(g), \u00a7 33(f). It mandates that an employer's liabilitybe reduced by the net amount a person entitled to compensa-tion recovers from a third party. Under Cowart's reading,the reduction would not be available to employers who hadnot yet begun payment at the time of the third-party recov-ery. That result makes no sense under the LHWCA struc-ture. Indeed, when a litigant before the BRB made this ar-gument, the Board rejected it, acknowledging in so doingthat it had adopted differing interpretations of the identical language in \u00a7\u00a7 33(f) and 33(g). Force v.Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp., 23 BRBS 1, 4\u00b15 (1989). This result is contrary to the basic canon of statutory construction thatidentical terms within an Act bear the same meaning. Sulli- van v.Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990); Sorenson v.Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986). The Board's w illing- ness to adopt such a forced and unconventional approachdoes not convince us we should do the same. And we oweno deference to the BRB, see supra, at 476. Yet another reason why we are not convinced by the Board's position is that the Board's interpretation of \u00aapersonentitled to compensation\u00ba has not been altogether consistent;and Cowart's interpretation may not be the same as theBoard's in precise respects. At times the Board has saidthis language refers to an employee whose \u00aaemployer is actu-ally paying compensation either pursuant to an award or vol-untarily when claimant enters into a third party settlement.\u00baDorsey, 18 BRBS, at 28; 23 BRBS, at 44 (case below). At other times, sometimes within the same opinion, the Boardhas spoken in terms of the employer either making paymentsoracknowledging liability. O'Leary, 7 BRBS, at 147\u00b1149; Dorsey, supra, at see In Wilson , 17 BRBS 471, 480 (ALJ 1985). Cowart, on the other hand, would includewithin the phrase both employees receiving compensationbene\u00aets and employees who have a judicial award of compen-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 480 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Opinion of the Court sation but are not receiving bene\u00aets. Brief for Petitioner 6. This distinction is an important part of Cowart's response tothe position of the United States. Reply Brief for Petitioner8. It may be that the gap between the Board's and Cowart'spositions can be explained by the Board's inconsistency; butthat in itself weakens any argument that the Board's inter-pretation is entitled to some weight. We do not believe that Congress' use of the word \u00aaem- ployee\u00ba in subsection (g)(2), rather than the phrase \u00aapersonentitled to compensation,\u00ba undercuts our reading of thestatute. The plain meaning of subsection (g)(1) cannot be altered by the use of a somewhat different term in anotherpart of the statute. Subsection (g)(2) does not purport tospeak to the question of who is required under subsection(g)(1) to obtain prior written approval. Cowart's strongest argument to the Court of Appeals was that any ambiguity in the statute favors him because of thedeference due the OWCP Director's statutory construction,a deference which Nicklos and Compass concede is appro-priate. Brief for Private Respondents 7. As we have said,we are not faced with this dif\u00aecult issue because the viewsof the OWCP Director have changed since we granted certio-rari. Supra, at 476. It seems apparent to us that it would be quite inappropriate to defer to an interpretation whichhas been abandoned by the policymaking agency itself. Itis noteworthy, moreover, that even prior to this case the po-sition of the Department of Labor has not been altogetherconsistent. It is true that the Director has twice, albeit ina somewhat equivocal manner, endorsed the Board's rulingsinO'Leary and Dorsey. First, in a 1986 circular discussing the Board's Dorsey case a subordinate of the Director stated: \u00aaWhile the Board's position may not be totally consistentwith the amended language of Section 33(g), we think it is arational approach and have advised the Associate Solicitorthat we will support this position.\u00ba United States Dept. ofLabor, LHWCA Circular No. 86\u00b13, 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 481 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Opinion of the Court Next, in a manual published in 1989 the Director again adopted the Board's position that written approval of a set-tlement is required only from employers who are payingcompensation; but the statement ends with a qualifyingcomment, that \u00aa[t]he issue of consent to a settlement can bea complex matter. Judicial interpretation may be necessaryto resolve the issue. (See LHWCA CIRCULAR 86\u00b103, 5\u00b130\u00b186).\u00ba U. S. Dept. of Labor, Longshore and Harbor Work-ers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) Procedure Manual, ch. 3\u00b1600, \u00b6 9 (Sept. 1989). On the other hand, the Department ofLabor has issued regulations (effective in their current form since 1986) which are explicit that the written-approval re-quirement of \u00a7 33(g) applies to a settlement for less than theamount of compensation due under the LHWCA, \u00aaregardlessof whether the employer or carrier has made payments of[sic] acknowledged entitlement to bene\u00aets under the Act.\u00ba 20 CFR \u00a7 702.281(b) (1991). So the Department of Laborhas not been speaking with one voice on this issue. Thisfurther diminishes the persuasive power of the Director'searlier decision to endorse the BRB's questionable interpre-tation, a decision he has since reconsidered. The history of the Department of Labor regulation goes far toward con\u00aerming our view of the signi\u00aecance of the 1984amendments. The original \u00a7 702.281, proposed in 1976 andenacted in \u00aenal form in 1977, required only that an employeenotify his employer and the Department of any third-partyclaim, settlement, or judgment. 41 Fed. Reg. 34297 (1976);42 Fed. Reg. 45303 (1977). The sole reference to the for-feiture provisions was a closing parenthetical: \u00aaCaution:See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 933(g).\u00ba In 1985, in response to the 1984congressional amendments, the Department proposed toamend \u00a7 702.281 by replacing the closing parenthetical witha subsection (b), stating that failure to obtain written ap-proval of settlements for amounts less than the compensationdue under the Act would lead to forfeiture of future bene\u00aets.50 Fed. Reg. 400 (1985). In response to comments, the \u00aenal505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 482 ESTATE OF COWART Opinion of the Court rulemaking modi\u00aeed \u00a7 702.281(b) to clarify that the forfeit- ure provision applied regardless of whether the employerwas paying compensation. 51 Fed. Reg. 4284\u00b14285 (1986).Thus the evolution of \u00a7 702.281 suggests that at least someelements within the Department of Labor read the 1984 stat-utory amendments to adopt a rule different from the Board'sprevious decisions. We also reject Cowart's argument that our interpretation of \u00a7 33(g) leaves the noti\u00aecation requirements of \u00a7 33(g)(2)without meaning. An employee is required to provide noti-\u00aecation to his employer, but is not required to obtain writtenapproval, in two instances: (1) Where the employee obtainsa judgment, rather than a settlement, against a third party;and (2) Where the employee settles for an amount greaterthan or equal to the employer's total liability. Under ourconstruction the written-approval requirement of \u00a7 33(g)(1)is inapplicable but the noti\u00aecation require-ment of \u00a7 33(g)(2) remains in force. That is why subsec-tion (g)(2) mandates that an employer be noti\u00aeed of \u00aaanysettlement.\u00ba This view comports with the purposes and structure of \u00a7 33. Section 33(f) provides that the net amount of damagesrecovered from any third party for the injuries sustainedreduces the compensation owed by the employer. So theemployer is a real party in interest with respect to any set-tlement that might reduce but not extinguish the employer'sliability. The written-approval requirement of \u00a7 33(g) \u00aapro-tects the employer against his employee's accepting too littlefor his cause of action against a third party.\u00ba Banks v.Chi- cago Grain Trimmers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459, 467 (1968). In cases where a judgment is entered, however, the em-ployee does not determine the amount of his recovery, andemployer approval, even if somehow feasible, would serve nopurpose. And in cases where the employee settles forgreater than the employer's liability, the employer is pro-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 483 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Opinion of the Court tected regardless of the precise amount of the settlement because his liability for compensation is wiped out. Noti\u00aeca-tion provides full protection to the employer in these situa-tions because it ensures against fraudulent double recoveryby the employee. As a \u00aenal line of defense, Cowart's attorney suggested at oral argument that Nicklos' participation in the Transco set-tlement brought this case outside the terms of \u00a7 33(g)(1).Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u00b17. Relying on the recent decision of theCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in I. T. O. Corpora- tion of Baltimore v.Sellman, 954 F. 2d 239, 242\u00b1243 (1992), counsel argued that \u00a7 33(g)(1) requires written approval onlyof \u00aasettlement[s] with a third person,\u00ba and that Nicklos' par-ticipation in the Transco settlement meant it was not withathird person. Without indicating any view on the merits of this contention, we do not address it because it is notfairly included within the question on which certiorariwas granted. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). We need not today decide the retroactive effect of our deci- sion, nor the relevance of res judicata principles for otherLHWCA bene\u00aeciaries who may be affected by our decision.Cf.Pittston Coal Group v.Sebben, 488 U. S. 105, 121\u00b1123 (1988). We do recognize the stark and troubling possibilitythat signi\u00aecant numbers of injured workers or their familiesmay be stripped of their LHWCA bene\u00aets by this statute,and that its forfeiture penalty creates a trap for the unwary.It also provides a powerful tool to employers who resist lia-bility under the Act. Counsel for respondents stated duringoral argument that he had used the Transco settlement as ameans of avoiding Nicklos' liability under the LHWCA. Tr.of Oral 23\u00b126. These harsh effects of \u00a7 33(g) may beexacerbated by the inconsistent course followed over theyears by the federal agencies charged with enforcing the Act.But Congress has spoken with great clarity to the precisequestion raised by this case.

Blackmun, J., dissenting enforce the judgment of the Legislature, however much we might question its wisdom or fairness. Often we have urgedthe Congress to speak with greater clarity, and in this stat-ute it has done so. If the effects of the law are to be allevi-ated, that is within the province of the Legislature. It isCongress that has the authority to change the statute, notthe courts. For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Af\u00aermed. Justice Blackmun , with whom Justice Stevens and Justice O\u0092Connor join, dissenting. For more than 14 years, the Director of the Of\u00aece of Work- ers' Compensation Programs interpreted the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), 44Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 901 et seq. , in the very same way that petitioner Floyd Cowart's estate now urges.Indeed, the Director advocated Cowart's position in the Court of Appeals, both before the panel and before that courten banc. After certiorari was granted, however, and after Cowart's opening brief was \u00aeled, the federal respondent informed thisCourt: \u00aaIn light of the en banc decision in this case, theDepartment of Labor reexamined its views on the issue.\u00baBrief for Federal Respondent 8, n. 6. The federal respond-ent now assures us that the interpretation the Director ad-vanced and defended for 14 years is inconsistent with thestatute's \u00aaplain meaning.\u00ba The Court today accepts that im-probable contention, and in so doing rules that perhaps thou-sands of employees and their families must be denied deathand disability bene\u00aets. I cannot agree with the federal re-spondent's newly discovered interpretation, and still less doI \u00aend it to be compelled by the \u00aaplain meaning\u00ba of the stat-ute. The Court needlessly in\u00aficts additional injury uponthese workers and their families. I dissent.505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 485 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting I Ever since the LHWCA was adopted in 1927, it has in- cluded some version of the present \u00a7 33(g), 33 U. S. C.\u00a7 933(g), the provision at issue in this case. Because thatprovision cannot be considered in isolation from the broadercontext of \u00a7 33, or indeed, the LHWCA as a whole, somebackground on the structure of the Act and the history of\u00a7 33's interpretation is essential. A The LHWCA requires employers to provide compensation, \u00aairrespective of fault,\u00ba for injuries and deaths arising out ofcovered workers' employment. \u00a7\u00a7 3(a) and 4(b), 33 U. S. 903(a) and 904(b). In return for requiring the employerto pay statutory compensation without proof of negligence,the Act grants the employer immunity from tort liability,regardless of how serious its fault may have been. See\u00a7\u00a7 5(a) and 33(i). Bene\u00aets under the LHWCA are strictlylimited, generally to medical expenses and two-thirds of lostearnings, and are set out in detailed schedules contained inthe Act itself. See \u00a7\u00a7 7\u00b19. A fundamental assumption ofthe Act is that employers liable for bene\u00aets will pay compen-sation \u00aapromptly,\u00ba \u00aadirectly,\u00ba be issued. See \u00a7 14(a). In a case where a third party may be liable, the LHWCA does not require a claimant to elect between statutory com-pensation and tort recovery. \u00a7 33(a). Where a claimant hasaccepted compensation under a formal award, then, within aspeci\u00aeed time, he may \u00aele a civil action against the thirdparty. \u00a7 33(b). If a claimant recovers in that action, hiscompensation under the LHWCA is limited to the excess, ifany, of his statutory compensation over the net amount ofhis recovery. \u00a7 33(f). Section 33(f) thus operates as a setoffprovision, allowing an employer to reduce its LHWCA liabil-ity by the net amount a claimant obtains from a third party.Where the claimant nets as much or more from the third505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 486 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting party as he would have received from his employer under the LHWCA, the employer owes him no bene\u00aets. Section 33(g) of the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 933(g), ad- dresses the situation in which a claimant-plaintiff settles anaction against a third party for less than he would have re- ceived under the Act. Under \u00a7 33(f), considered alone, theclaimant in this situation would always be able to collect theremainder of his statutory bene\u00aets from the employer. Toprotect the employer from having to pay excessive \u00a7 33(f)compensation because of an employer's written approval of thethird-party settlement. See Banks v.Chicago Grain Trim- mers Assn., Inc., 390 U. S. 459, 467 (1968). Before the LHWCA's 1984 amendments, \u00a7 33(g) provided that if a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba settled for lessthan the compensation to which he was entitled under theAct, then the employer would be liable for compensation, asdetermined in \u00a7 33(f), only if the person obtained and duly\u00aeled with the Department of Labor the employer's writtenapproval of the settlement. The meaning of the term \u00aaper-son entitled to compensation\u00ba has proved to be a dif\u00aecultissue, both in the pre-1984 version of the Act and\u00d0as thiscase demonstrates\u00d0in the Act's current form. B This issue apparently was considered \u00aerst in O'Leary v. Southeast Stevedoring Co., 7 BRBS 144 (1977), aff'd, 622 F. 2d 595 (CA9 1980). In that case, the employer deniedliability for the death of the claimant's husband, contendingthat the decedent was not an employee covered by theLHWCA and that the injury did not arise out of his employ-ment. 7 BRBS, at 145. The employer persisted in denyingliability even after its position was rejected by the Bene\u00aets505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 487 Cite as: 505 U.

Even- tually, more than 28 months after her husband's accident, theclaimant settled a third-party suit for $37,500. About onemonth thereafter, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), onremand from the BRB, entered an award for the claimant.The value of the death bene\u00aets awarded, assuming that theclaimant would live out her normal life expectancy withoutremarrying, amounted to more than $150,000. See In re O'Leary, 5 BRBS 16, 20 (ALJ 1976). At that point, the em- ployer contested liability for any compensation on the groundthat, under \u00a7 33(g), the claimant had forfeited that compensa- tion by failing to obtain the employer's written approval of the settlement. The ALJ rejected the employer's position, reasoning that the claimant was not a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba atthe time of the settlement. The BRB af\u00aermed. The that the \u00aaunderlying concept\u00ba of the LHWCA isthat \u00aathe employer upon being informed of an injury willvoluntarily begin to pay compensation.\u00ba O'Leary, 7 BRBS, at 147 (citing \u00a7 14(a)). Further, the Board observed, \u00a7 33(g)refers to the conditions under which an employer will be \u00aalia-ble\u00ba for compensation under \u00a7 33(f); the reference to \u00aaliabil-ity,\u00ba the Board reasoned, \u00aacontemplat[es] that [the] employereither be making voluntary payments under the Act or thatit ha[s] been found liable for bene\u00aets by a judicial determina-tion.\u00ba Id., at 148. Moreover, the Board continued, \u00a7 33(b) gives the employer the right to pursue third parties only ifthe employer is paying compensation under an award.Thus, the premise of employer rights under \u00a7 33, the Boardconcluded, is that the employer is \u00aamaking either voluntarypayments under the Act or pursuant to an award.\u00ba Ibid. 1The BRB consists of persons appointed by the Secretary of Labor and empowered to \u00aahear and determine appeals raising a substantial questionof law or fact\u00ba with respect to DRILLING CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting The BRB observed that the employer in O'Leary had not paid compensation either voluntarily or pursuant to anaward, but, instead, consistently had denied liability. Itcould hardly have been clear to the claimant at the time shesettled her third-party suit that the BRB would ultimatelydecide in her favor. Indeed, only after that settlement andafter the ALJ award did the employer concede that theclaimant represented a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00baand then only to argue that, for that reason, she had forfeitedher right to compensation under \u00a7 33(g). The Board empha-sized that the employer's interpretation would place claim-ants in a severe bind: \u00aaIf a claimant was injured through the negligence of a third party and the employer denied coverage underthe Act, a claimant would be forced to sue the thirdparty. However, even if the claimant obtained a reason-able settlement offer, an employer could refuse to giveits consent to the third party settlement for any numberof reasons, e. g., it does not wish to approve the settle-ment on a form provided under the Act since its consentto jurisdiction under the Act might be inferred. Thiscould result in a claimant not being paid any compensa-tion, yet the claimant would be afraid to make a thirdparty settlement for in so doing he might waive hisrights to compensation under the Act. Ultimately, aclaimant going without income for a long enough timecould be forced into a third party settlement withoutemployer's consent to obtain money . . . .\u00ba Id., at 149. And interpretation of \u00a7 33(g), the em- ployee would thereby forfeit all right to compensation underthe Act. Surely, the Board concluded, \u00aaCongress by requir-ing written consent could not have contemplated such a re-sult.\u00ba Ibid.

Cooper Stevedoring Co. v.Director, Of\u00aece of Workers' Comp. Programs, U. S. Dept. of Labor, 826 F. 2d 1011 (CA11 1987), the Board rejected an employer'sargument that the \u00aenal clause of the new \u00a7 33(g)(2) shouldbe understood as overturning the O'Leary rule that no duty to obtain approval arises until the employer begins to paycompensation. Subsection (g)(1), the Board stated, reen-acted the prior version of \u00a7 33(g) as it was interpreted inO'Leary; the new subsection, (g)(2), was intended to apply to situations not covered by (g)(1) or O'Leary.

The Board interpretedthe \u00aenal of (g)(2)\u00d0language that echoes the Board'swords in O'Leary \u00d0to make clear that the noti\u00aecation re- quirement, described in (g)(2), was not subject to theO'Leary limitation that is incorporated in (g)(1). 18 BRBS, at 29. This interpretation is reinforced, the Board continued, by two other considerations. First, although in a number ofinstances the 1984 legislative history indicates a congres-sional intention to override other BRB and judicial decisions,that history \u00aaindicates no congressional intent to overruleO'Leary. \u00baId., at 30.

As O'Leary made clear, allowing employers to escape all LHWCA liability bywithholding approval from any settlement, while refusing to505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 491 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting pay bene\u00aets or acknowledge liability, could hardly be thought consistent with the purpose of encouraging prompt, volun-tary payment of LHWCA compensation. D Such was the legal background against which Cowart's claim was considered. In the administrative proceedings,the BRB relied on O'Leary and Dorsey to reject the argu- ment, offered by respondent Nicklos Dr illing Company, that by failing to obtain prior wr itten approval of his third-party settlement Cowart had not paying Cowart bene\u00aets, either or under an award, the Board reasoned, Cowart wasnot a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba within the meaningof \u00a7 33(g)(1), and he therefore was not required to obtainNicklos' approval of his settlement. 23 BRBS 42, 46 (1989).Instead, the Board held, Cowart was required only to giveNicklos notice of the settlement, as provided in \u00a7 33(g)(2).Because Nicklos indisputably had notice of the settlement\u00d0indeed, it had notice three months before the settlement wasconsummated\u00d0the Board ruled Cowart was eligible forLHWCA bene\u00aets. On Nicklos' petition for review, the Director of the Of\u00aece of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP)\u00d0head of theagency charged with administering the Act\u00d0defended theBoard's interpretation before the Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit. First a panel of the Court of Appeals, andthen the full court, by a divided vote sitting en banc, how-ever, rejected the Director's position, ruling that Cowartwas a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba and was requiredby Nicklos' written approval. See 1552 (1990) (panel), and 927 F. 2d 828 (1991) (en banc).We are told that after this Court granted certiorari, andafter Cowart \u00aeled his opening brief, the Director \u00aareexam-ined\u00ba his position and argued that the interpretation of\u00a7 33(g) he had maintained for 14 years, and defended in the505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 492 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting Court of Appeals, was inconsistent with the Act's plain meaning. II This Court today agrees with the Director's postcertiorari position that Cowart's claim for compensation is barred bythe \u00aaclear meaning\u00ba of the statute \u00aaas written.\u00ba Ante, at 476. According to the Court, Cowart is plainly a \u00aapersonentitled to compensation\u00ba within the meaning of \u00a7 33(g)(1),and his failure to obtain Nicklos' written approval of histhird-party settlement requires, by the \u00aaplain language\u00ba of\u00a7 33(g), that he be deemed to have forfeited his statutorybene\u00aets. Although the Court does not identify any plausi-ble statutory purpose whatsoever advanced by its reading,and although\u00d0to its credit\u00d0it acknowledges the \u00aaharsheffects\u00ba of its interpretation, ante, at 483, the Court ulti- mately concludes that the language of \u00a7 33 compels it to re-ject Cowart's position. In my view, the language of \u00a7 33 in no way compels the Court to deny Cowart's claim. In fact, the Court's relianceon the Act's \u00aaplain language,\u00ba ante, at 475, is selective: as discussed below, analysis of \u00a7\u00a7 33(b) and (f) of the Act showsthat, even leaving aside the question whether Cowart is a\u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00ba a consistently literal in- terpretation of the Act's language would not require Cowartto have obtained Nicklos' written approval of the settlement.Indeed, under a thoroughgoing \u00aaplain meaning\u00ba approach,Cowart would be entitled to receive full LHWCA bene\u00aets in addition to his third-party settlement, not just the excessof his statutory bene\u00aets over the settlement. At the same time, a consistently literal interpretation of the Act would commit the Court to positions it might beunwilling to take. The conclusion I draw is not that the Court should adopt a purely literal interpretation of the Act,but instead that the Court should recognize, as it has untiltoday, that the LHWCA must be read in light of the pur-poses and policies it would serve. Once that point is recog-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 493 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting nized, then, as suggested by the Court's closing remarks on the \u00aastark and troubling\u00ba implications of its interpretation,ante, at 483, it follows that recognition of Cowart's claim is fully consistent with the Act. A Were the Court truly to interpret the Act \u00aaas written,\u00ba it would not conclude that Cowart is barred from receivingcompensation. Section 33(g)(1) of the provides \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba settles with a thirdparty for an amount less than his statutory bene\u00aets, his em-ployer will be \u00aaliable for compensation as determined under subsection (f) \u00ba only if the \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba obtains and the employer's written approval. The \u00aaplainlanguage\u00ba of subsection (g)(1) does not establish any generalwritten-approval requirement binding either all \u00aapersons en-titled to compensation,\u00ba or the subset of those persons whosettle for less than their statutory bene\u00aets. Instead, it re-quires written approval only as a condition of receiving com-pensation \u00aaas determined under subsection (f).\u00ba Where the\u00aaperson entitled to \u00aaas determined under subsection (f),\u00ba subsection (g)(1)does not require to obtain written approval. The \u00aaplain language\u00ba of subsection (f) in turn suggests that the provision does not apply to Cowart's situation. Sub-section (f), by its terms, applies only \u00aa[i]f the person entitledto compensation institutes proceedings within the subsection (b).\u00ba And the \u00aaperiod prescribedin subsection terms of that subsection,upon the person's \u00aa[a]cceptance of compensation under anaward in a compensation order \u00aeled by the deputy commis-sioner, an administrative law judge, or the Board.\u00ba Cow-art's third-party suit was clearly not instituted within this period: He \u00aeled suit before any award of LHWCA bene\u00aets, and he still has not accepted (or been offered) compensation505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 494 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting under any award. Thus, he does not come within the \u00aaplain meaning\u00ba of subsection (f), and, accordingly, for the reasonsgiven above, he would not be bound by the subsection (g)(1)written-approval requirement. It would also follow that,because Nicklos indisputably received the notice required bysubsection (g)(2), that provision would not bar Cowart fromreceiving LHWCA compensation and medical bene\u00aets. Indeed, if Cowart is not covered by subsection (f), he would appear to have been eligible for a larger award thanhe sought. Subsection (f) does not authorize compensationotherwise unavailable; instead, it operates as a limit, in the speci\u00aeed circumstances, on the employer's LHWCA liability.If read literally, would not bar Cowart fromreceiving full LHWCA bene\u00aets, in addition to the amount he received in settlement of the third-party claim. It is true that \u00a7 33(f) has not always been read literally. Subsection (f) has been assumed to be applicable where, forexample, the claimant's third-party suit was \u00aeled after anemployer voluntarily began paying LHWCA compensation, not just where compensation was paid pursuant to an award.See, e. g., I. T. O. Corp. of Baltimore v.Sellman, 954 F. 2d 239, 240, 243\u00b1245 (CA4 1992); States 528 F. 2d 675, 678\u00b1679, n. 2 (CA9 1975) (referring to the availability of an employer's lien, where the employerhas paid compensation without an award, as \u00aajudicially cre-ated\u00ba rather than statutory), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 936(1976). That interpretation is eminently sensible and con-sistent with the statutory purpose of encouraging employersto make payments \u00aapromptly,\u00ba directly,\u00ba and \u00aawithout anaward.\u00ba See \u00a7 14(a). A contrary interpretation would pe-nalize employers who acknowledge liability and commencepayments without seeking an award, and it would rewardemployers who, whether in good faith or bad, contest theirliability until faced with a formal award. See Shellman, 528 F. 2d, at 679, n. 2 (\u00aaThe purpose of this Act would be frus-trated if a different result could be reached merely because505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 495 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting the employer pays compensation without entry of a formal award\u00ba). It is not obvious, however, that a similar argument from statutory purpose should be available to employers such asNicklos who refuse to pay bene\u00aets and then seek shelterunder \u00a7 33(f) (and by extension, \u00a7 33(g)(1)). And the fact re-mains that the Court professes to interpret the \u00aaclear mean-ing\u00ba of the statute \u00aaas written.\u00ba The Court's interpretationtoday, however, is no more compelled by the language of theLHWCA than the interpretation Cowart defends: The Courtis simply insensible to the fact that it implicitly has reliedupon presumed statutory purposes and policy considerationsto bring Nicklos and Cowart under the setoff Nicklos of the \u00aerst $29,000 in LHWCAliability. Only at that point does the Court invoke the plain meaning rule and insist on a \u00aaliteral\u00ba interpretation of\u00a7 33(g)(1). This selective insistence on of the last $6,242.17 Nicklos wouldotherwise have been bound to pay. B For these reasons, I think it clear that a purely textual approach to the LHWCA cannot justify the Court's holding.In my view, a more sensible approach is to consider \u00a7 33(g)as courts always have considered the other parts of \u00a7 33\u00d0inrelation to the history, structure, and policies of the Act. 1 Looking \u00aerst to \u00a7 33's history, for present purposes the most relevant aspect is the 1984 amendment to \u00a7 33(g)through which that provision assumed its present form.The amended provision clearly bears the impress of theBoard's O'Leary decision. The reference in \u00a7 33(g)(2) to that subsection's applicability, \u00aaregardless of whether the em-ployer or the employer's insurer has made payments or ac-knowledged entitlement to bene\u00aets,\u00ba tracks the limitation505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 496 ESTATE OF COWART CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting recognized in O'Leary \u00d0a limitation that had been unani- mously approved by panels of two Federal Courts of Ap-peals. The question, then, is whether Congress sought toincorporate that holding or to repudiate it in the 1984 amend-ments to \u00a7 33(g). The critical fact in this inquiry is Congress' use of the term \u00aaemployee,\u00ba rather than \u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00bain connection with the noti\u00aecation requirement. The use ofthis term is in marked contrast to the other clauses of \u00a7 33(g).Section 33(g)(1) conditions \u00a7 33(f) compensation of a settling\u00aaperson compensation\u00ba on securing the employer'swritten approval, and \u00a7 33(g)(2) provides, redun-dantly, that a \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba forfeits allrights to compensation and medical bene\u00aets if the writtenapproval mentioned in \u00a7 33(g)(1) is not obtained. The noti-\u00aecation clause of \u00a7 33(g)(2), however, provides that \u00aaif theemployee fails to notify the employer of any settlement ob- tained from or judgment rendered against a third person,all rights to compensation and medical bene\u00aets . . . shall beterminated, regardless of whether the employer or the em-ployer's insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitle-ment to bene\u00aets\u00ba (emphasis added). The use of the term \u00aaemployee\u00ba in \u00a7 33(g)(2) strongly sug- gests that Congress intended to incorporate the BRB's hold-ing in O'Leary. As mentioned, the language Congress chose for the last clause of \u00a7 33(g)(2) indicates that it was aware theBoard had adopted a restrictive interpretation of the term\u00aaperson entitled to compensation.\u00ba Congress retained thatterm in connection with the written-approval requirementof subsection (g)(1). Yet Congress chose the noti\u00aecation clause of subsection (g)(2),and \u00aaemployee,\u00ba unlike \u00aaperson entitled to compensation,\u00ba isa in the statute. See \u00a7 2(3). 2The 2Subject to exceptions not applicable here, that section of the Act de- \u00aenes the term \u00aaemployee\u00ba as \u00aaany person engaged in maritime employ-ment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 497 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting Court cannot explain why Congress would have chosen two different terms to apply to the different requirements. In-deed, on the Court's interpretation, the two terms are identi-cal in their extension. On the Court's reading, the term\u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba denotes only a statutoryemployee who has a claim that, aside from the requirementsof \u00a7 33(g), would be recognized as valid. And that is exactlythe denotation of the term \u00aaemployee\u00ba in connection withthe noti\u00aecation requirement. The fact that Congress choseto use different terms in connection with the different \u00a7 33(g)requirements\u00d0using, with respect to the written-approvalrequirement, a term that it knew had been narrowly inter-preted, and using, with respect to the noti\u00aecation require-ment, a term broadly de\u00aened in the statute itself\u00d0surelyindicates that Congress intended the two terms to have dif-ferent meanings. Had Congress intended the meaning theCourt attributes to it, it would have used the same term inboth contexts. 3 2 The inference that Congress intended to adopt the O'Leary rule in the amended language of \u00a7 33(g) is only strengthened operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and ship-breaker.\u00ba 3Two of the Court's other arguments concerning the 1984 amendments may deserve brief mention. First, the Court suggests in passing that \u00aathelegislative history of predecessor bills to the eventual 1984 enactmentdo indicate an intent to overturn O'Leary, \u00ba citing snippets of written testi- mony submitted during the lengthy 1981 hearings. See ante, at 478. Needless to say, statements buried in hearings conducted three years before the bill's passage fall far short of demonstrating any such congressional intent. The BRB was correct when it said in Dorsey that the legislative history of the 1984 amendments indicates no intention to overturn O'Leary. Second, the Court places great signi\u00aecance upon the fact that \u00aaat least some elements within the Department of Labor\u00ba read the post-1984 stat-ute differently from the Director of OWCP. Ante, at 482. The Court is quite clear, however, that it is the Director who administers the Act, seeante, at 480, not these other \u00aaelements,\u00ba and that the Director does not ask for deference to his recently adopted interpretation.505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 498 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting by consideration of the factual context to which the provision was designed to apply. As the Board noted in O'Leary, and as the Director argued to the Court of Appeals, the Actpresumes that employers, as a rule, will promptly recognizetheir LHWCA obligations and commence payments immedi-ately, without the need for a formal award. See \u00a7 14(a). Inthat situation, the claimant generally knows the value of thebene\u00aets to be received, and can accurately compare that \u00aeg-ure to any settlement offer. The claimant in this situationhas no strong interest in the precise amount of any settle-ment that nets less than the statutory bene\u00aets, so long as the costs of suit are covered, because by operation of \u00a7 33(f),he would not be allowed to retain any of the proceeds. Onthe other hand, the employer who has acknowledged liabilityhas a strong interest in recovering from the third party anybene\u00aets already paid to the claimant and in reducing or elim-inating any future bene\u00aets it has committed itself to pay.For the employer in this situation, the precise amount of asettlement for less than the claimant's statutory bene\u00aets isvitally important: any net dollar the claimant recovers in athird-party action is a dollar less the employer will have topay in LHWCA bene\u00aets. Given the parties' different incentives in the situation where the employer already is paying bene\u00aets, it makessense to require the claimant to protect the employer's inter-est, by requiring settlements to be reasonable in the employ-er's judgment. At the same time, giving the employer thispower of approval does not generally threaten the claimant'sinterests, since, as mentioned, only the employer has an in-terest in settlements above the threshold of the claimant-plaintiff's expenses and below the amount of promised ordelivered LHWCA bene\u00aets. Matters are quite different, however, when (as in the pres- ent case) the employer has refused to make statutory pay-ments and is not subject to an enforceable award at the timeof settlement. First, the claimant generally will not be able505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 499 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting to estimate with certainty whether he will receive any LHWCA bene\u00aets, let alone how much. Accordingly, thecalculation required by \u00a7 33(g)\u00d0a comparison betweenLHWCA bene\u00aets and settlement amount\u00d0will be far moredif\u00aecult. Second, the claimant who is not receivingLHWCA payments, and who cannot be certain that he everwill receive payments, will have a much more powerful inter-est in negotiating a third-party settlement that is as favor-able as possible. This claimant, unlike its counterpart whois receiving payments, therefore will have a strong incen-tive\u00d0independent of the \u00a7 33(g) requirements\u00d0to protect any interest the employer might have in reducing potentialLHWCA liability. Finally, disabled longshore employees, orthe families of a longshoreman killed on the job, are likely tobe in a highly vulnerable position, subject to \u00aenancial pres-sure that may lead them to overvalue a present lump-sumpayment and undervalue future periodic payments thatmight eventually be available under an LHWCA award. The employer who refuses to pay, by contrast, has taken the position that it owes no LHWCA bene\u00aets that may bereduced through a third-party settlement, and thus that ithas no real interest in the amount for which the third partysettles. Moreover, as has been noted, the claimant who isnot receiving bene\u00aets has a strong incentive to protect theemployer's interest in reducing or eliminating any LHWCAliability that might eventually be imposed. Under theCourt's interpretation of \u00a7 33(g)(1), however, such an em-ployer in many cases can ensure that it will never be re-quired to pay LHWCA bene\u00aets, even if it might otherwiseultimately be determined to be liable, simply by withholdingapproval of any settlement offer, regardless of amount. Inpractice, recalcitrant employers will seek to exempt them-selves from statutory liability by withholding approval ofsettlements, hoping that their employees' need for presentfunds will force them to settle without approval. I cannotbelieve that Congress intended to require LHWCA claim-505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 OPINPGT 500 ESTATE OF COWART v.NICKLOS DRILLING CO. Blackmun, J., dissenting ants to bet their statutory bene\u00aets on the possibility that future administrative and perhaps judicial proceedings,years later, might vindicate their position that the employershould have been paying bene\u00aets\u00d0particularly when theemployer's asserted interest is already adequately protectedindependently of \u00a7 33(g)(1). 3 The Court recognizes the patent unfairness of this situa- tion, and it as much as admits that its interpretation is outof line with the policies of the Act. See ante, at 483. Never- theless, the Court holds that the plain meaning of the term\u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba clearly applies to both cat-egories of claimants\u00d0those whose employers have denied li-ability, as well as those whose employers have acknowledgedthat they must pay statutory bene\u00aets. See ante, at 477. For that reason, the Court implies, regardless of what Con-gress may have thought it was accomplishing in the 1984amendments, the words \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00basimply will not bear the construction O'Leary gave them. See ante, at 478\u00b1479. Even setting aside my doubts, expressed above, about the plain meaning rule's application to this statute, I am not per-suaded by the Court's contention. In my view, it does notstrain ordinary language to describe claimants whose em-ployers have acknowledged LHWCA liability as \u00aapersonsentitled to compensation,\u00ba but to withhold that descriptionfrom claimants whose employers have denied liability forcompensation. This is particularly so, given the context inwhich the term appears in the statute. Section 33(g)(1) re-quires the \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba to compare two\u00aegures\u00d0the amount of a settlement offer, on the one hand,and the amount of compensation to which the person is enti-tled, on the other. But what is that latter \u00aegure in a situa-tion in which the employer denies liability in full or in part?Doubtless, the claimant could hazard a guess by consultingthe Act's jurisdictional provisions concerning who is covered505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 501 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting for which kind of accident, the compensation schedules in- cluded in the Act, and, in the case of a disability claim, theopinion of the claimant's doctor that the claimant, in fact, isdisabled. The very nature of the situation, however, is thatit is not clear that such a person is indeed \u00aaentitled to com-pensation\u00ba\u00d0that question, after all, is exactly the issue thatthe employer's position requires to be determined in admin-istrative and perhaps subsequent judicial proceedings. TheO'Leary limitation of the term \u00aaperson entitled to compen- sation\u00ba to the situation in which the claimant's employerhas acknowledged liability and commenced payments seemsto me fully consistent with the requirements of ordinarylanguage. It is true, as the Court observes, that under the O'Leary interpretation, the term \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00bawould take on different meanings in different contexts. Seeante, at 478. This Court, however, has not in\u00afexibly re- quired the same term to be interpreted in the same way forall purposes. Compare Barnhill v.Johnson, 503 U.

This Court has recognized: \u00aaMost words have different shades of meaning and con- sequently may be variously construed, not only whenthey occur in different statutes, but when used morethan once in the same statute or even in the sames e c t i o n .... \u00aaIt is not unusual for the same word to be used with different meanings in the same act, and there is no ruleof statutory construction which precludes the courtsfrom giving to the word the meaning which the legisla-ture intended it should have in each instance.\u00ba Atlan- tic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v.United States, 286 U.

Blackmun, J., dissenting This case is one in which the statutory term in question should be read contextually, rather than under the assump-tion that the term necessarily has the same meaning in allcontexts. The phrase \u00aaperson entitled to compensation\u00ba isnot de\u00aened in the statute, and it is susceptible of at least twointerpretations\u00d0a \u00aaformalist\u00ba interpretation, according towhich one may be entitled to compensation whether or notanyone ever acknowledges that fact, and a \u00aapositivist\u00ba or\u00aalegal realist\u00ba interpretation, according to which one is enti-tled to compensation only if the relevant decisionmaker hasso declared. Which of these two senses is \u00aacorrect\u00ba will de- pend upon context. The latter sense, I have suggested, isappropriate to a context in which liability for compensationis disputed and the employee is called upon to predict thefuture course of administrative and perhaps judicial proceed-ings\u00d0not just as to liability, but as to the precise amount ofliability. And, in any event, I think, the text and circum-stances of the 1984 amendment to \u00a7 33(g) indicate that Con-gress intended to adopt the \u00aarealist\u00ba interpretation foundinO'Leary. Moreover, the Court simply has failed to apply, or even mention, a maxim of interpretation, speci\u00aecally applicable tothe LHWCA, that strongly supports Cowart's position.This Court long has held that \u00aa `[t]his Act must be liberallyconstrued in conformance with its purpose, and in a waywhich avoids harsh and incongruous results.' \u00ba Director, OWCP v.Perini North River Associates, 459 U. S. 297, 315\u00b1 316 (1983), quoting Vor is v.Eikel, 346 U. S., at 333. The only point at which the Court in this case consults the pur-poses of the Act is at the end of its opinion, when it assuresthe reader that its interpretation of the noti\u00aecation require- ment of \u00a7 33(g)(2)\u00d0as opposed to its interpretation of the written-approval requirement stated in \u00a7 33(g)(1)\u00d0is consist-ent with the statute's purposes. See ante, at 482. Finally, underscoring its refusal to apply the maxim of liberal con-struction to this case, the Court ultimately acknowledges505us2107F 07-16-96 16:45:06 PAGES OPINPGT 503 Cite as: 505 U. S. 469 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting that the interpretation of \u00a7 33(g) it has adopted has \u00aaharsh effects\u00ba and \u00aacreates a trap for the unwary.\u00ba Ante, at 483. For my part, I can imagine no more appropriate occasion onwhich the maxim should be applied. 4 Once it is recognized that a claimant whose employer de- nies LHWCA liability is not a \u00aaperson entitled to compensa-tion\u00ba for purposes of \u00a7 33(g)(1), the proper resolution of thiscase is clear. Cowart was just such a claimant, and, accord-ingly, he was not bound by \u00a7 33(g)(1)'s written-approvalrequirement. It is undisputed that he satis\u00aeed of \u00a7 33(g)(2). It follows is no barto Cowart's eligibility for bene\u00aets. III The Court recognizes \u00aathe stark and troubling possibility that signi\u00aecant numbers of injured workers or their familiesmay be stripped of their LHWCA bene\u00aets by this statute.\u00baIbid. It attempts to justify the \u00aaharsh effects\u00ba of its deci- sion on the ground that it is but the faithful agent of theLegislature, and \u00aaCongress has spoken with great clarity tothe precise question raised by this case.\u00ba Ibid. In my view, Congress did not answer the question in the way theCourt suggests, let alone did it do so \u00aawith great clarity.\u00baThe responsibility for today's unfortunate decision rests notwith Congress, but with this very Court.

The DistrictCourt ultimately ruled, among other things, that these claims were pre-empted by the 1965 and 1969 Acts to the extent that the claims reliedon respondents' advertising, promotional, and public relations activitiesafter the effective date of the 1965 Act.

S. 504 (1992) Syllabus empt state-law damages actions, but superseded only positive enact- ments by state and federal rulemaking bodies mandating particularwarnings on cigarette labels or in cigarette advertisements. This con-clusion is required by the section's precise and narrow prohibition ofrequired cautionary \u00aastatement[s]\u00ba; by the strong presumption againstpre-emption of state police power regulations; by the fact that the re-quired \u00a7 4 warning does not by its own effect foreclose additional obliga-tions imposed under state law; by the fact that there is no general,inherent con\u00afict between federal pre-emption of state warning require-ments and the continued vitality of common-law damages actions; andby the Act's stated purpose and regulatory context, which establish that\u00a7 5 was passed to prevent a multiplicity of pending and diverse \u00aaregula-tions,\u00ba a word that most naturally refers to positive enactments ratherthan common-law actions. Pp. 517\u00b1520. Justice Stevens, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice O\u0092Connor, concluded in Parts V and VI that \u00a7 5(b) of the 1969 Act pre-empts certain of petitioner's failure-to-warn and fraudu-lent misrepresentation claims, but does not pre-empt other such claimsor the claims based on express warranty or conspiracy. Pp. 520\u00b1530. (a) The broad language of amended \u00a7 5(b) extends the section's pre- emptive reach beyond positive enactments to include some common-lawdamages actions. The statutory phrase \u00aarequirement or prohibition\u00basuggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law,but, in fact, easily encompasses obligations that take the form ofcommon-law rules, while the phrase \u00aaimposed under State law\u00ba clearlycontemplates common law as well as statutes and regulations. Thisdoes not mean, however, that \u00a7 5(b) pre-empts all common-law claims,nor does the statute indicate that any familiar subdivision of commonlaw is or is not pre-empted. Instead, the precise language of \u00a7 5(b) mustbe fairly but\u00d0in light of the presumption against pre-emption\u00d0nar-rowly construed, and each of petitioner's common-law claims must beexamined to determine whether it is in fact pre-empted. The centralinquiry in each case is straightforward: whether the legal duty that isthe predicate of the common-law damages action satis\u00aees \u00a7 5(b)'s expressterms, giving those terms a fair but narrow reading. Each phrasewithin the section limits the universe of common-law claims pre-emptedby the statute. Pp. 517\u00b1524. (b) Insofar as claims under either of petitioner's failure-to-warn theo- ries\u00d0 i. e., that respondents were negligent in the manner that they tes- ted, researched, sold, promoted, and advertised their cigarettes, andthat they failed to provide adequate warnings of smoking's conse-quences\u00d0require a showing that OPINPGT 506 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Syllabus promotions should have included additional, or more clearly stated, warnings, those claims rely on a state-law \u00aarequirement or prohibition...w i t h respect . advertising or promotion\u00ba within \u00a7 5(b)'s meaning and are pre-empted. Pp. 524\u00b1525. (c) To the extent that petitioner has a viable claim for breach of ex- press warranties, that claim is not pre-empted. While the general duty not to breach such warranties arises under state law, a manufacturer'sliability for the breach derives from, and is measured by, the terms ofthe warranty. A common-law remedy for a contractual commitmentvoluntarily undertaken should not be regarded as a \u00aarequirement . .imposed under which is predicated on a state-law prohibition against advertis-ing and promotional statements tending to minimize smoking's healthhazards, and which alleges that respondents' advertising neutralized theeffect of the federally mandated warning labels. However, the claimsbased on petitioner's second fraudulent-misrepresentation theory\u00d0which alleges intentional fraud both by false representation and conceal-ment of material facts\u00d0are not pre-empted. The concealment allega-tions, insofar as they rely on a state-law duty to disclose material factsthrough channels of communication other than advertising and promo-tions, do not involve an obligation \u00aawith respect to\u00ba those activitieswithin \u00a7 5(b)'s meaning. Moreover, those fraudulent-misrepresentationclaims that do arise with respect to advertising and promotions are notpredicated on a duty \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba but rather on amore general obligation\u00d0the duty not to deceive. Pp. 527\u00b1529. (e) Petitioner's claim alleging a conspiracy among respondents to mis- represent or conceal material facts concerning smoking's health hazardsis not pre-empted, since the predicate duty not to conspire to commitfraud that underlies that claim is not a prohibition \u00aabased on smokingand health\u00ba as that \u00a7 5(b) phrase is properly construed. P. 530. Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter, concluded that the modi\u00aeed language of \u00a7 5(b) in the 1969 Act does not clearly exhibit the necessary congressional intent to pre-empt state common-law damages actions, and therefore concurred inthe judgment that certain of petitioner's failure-to-warn and fraudulent-misrepresentation claims, as well as his express warranty and conspir-acy claims, are not pre-empted by that Act.

Opinion of the Court Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts V and VI. \u00aaWarning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to YourHealth. \u00ba A federal statute enacted in 1969 requires that warning (or a variation thereof) to appear in a conspicuousplace on every package of cigarettes sold in the UnitedStates. 1The questions presented to us by this case are whether that statute, or its 1965 predecessor which requireda less alarming label, pre-empted petitioner's common-lawclaims against respondent cigarette manufacturers. Petitioner is the son of Rose Cipollone, who began smoking in 1942 and who died of lung cancer in 1984. He claims thatrespondents are responsible for Rose Cipollone's death be-cause they breached express warranties contained in theiradvertising, because they failed to warn consumers about thehazards of smoking, because they fraudulently misrepre-sented those hazards to consumers, and because they con-spired to deprive the public of medical and scienti\u00aec infor-mation about smoking. The Court of Appeals held thatpetitioner's state-law claims were pre-empted by federal statutes, 893 F. 2d 541 (CA3 1990), and other courts haveagreed with that analysis. 2The highest court of the State of New Jersey, however, has held that the federal statutes 1Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91\u00b1222, 84 Stat. 87, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\u00b11340. In 1984, Congress amended thestatute to require four more explicit warnings, used on a rotating basis.See Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, Pub. L. 98\u00b1474, 98 Stat. 2201.Because petitioner's claims arose before 1984, neither party relies on thislater Act. 2The Court of Appeals' analysis was initially set forth in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 789 F. 2d 181 (CA3 1986). Other federal courts have adopted a similar analysis. See Pennington v.Vistron Corp., 876 F. 2d 414 (CA5 F. 2d 230 (CA6 1988); Stephen v.American Brands, Inc., 825 F. 2d 312 (CA11 1987); Palmer 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 509 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of the Court did not pre-empt similar common-law claims.3Because of the manifest importance of the issue, we granted certiorarito resolve the con\u00afict, 499 U. S. 935 (1991). We now reversein part and af\u00aerm in part. I On August 1, 1983, Rose Cipollone and her husband \u00aeled a complaint invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the FederalDistrict Court. Their complaint alleged that Rose Cipollonedeveloped lung cancer because she smoked cigarettes manu-factured and sold by the three respondents. After herdeath in 1984, her husband \u00aeled an amended complaint.After trial, he also died; their son, executor of both estates,now maintains this action. Petitioner's third amended complaint alleges several dif- ferent bases of recovery, relying on theories of strict liability,negligence, express warranty, and intentional tort. Theseclaims, all based on New Jersey law, divide into \u00aeve catego-ries. The \u00aadesign defect claims\u00ba allege that respondents'cigarettes were defective because respondents failed to usea safer alternative design for their products and because thesocial value of their product was outweighed by the dangersit created (Count 2, App. 83\u00b184). The \u00aafailure to warnclaims\u00ba allege both that the product was \u00aadefective as a re-sult of [respondents'] failure to provide adequate warningsof the health consequences of cigarette smoking\u00ba (Count 3,App. 85) and that respondents \u00aawere negligent in the manner[that] they tested, researched, sold, promoted and adver-tised\u00ba their cigarettes (Count 4, App. 86). The \u00aaexpresswarranty claims\u00ba allege that respondents had \u00aaexpressly 3Dewey v.R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 121 N. J. 69, 577 A. 2d 1239 (1990) (holding that the Cigarette Act does not pre-empt plaintiff's failure-to-warn and misrepresentation claims); see also Forster v.R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 437 N. W. 2d 655 (Minn. 1989) (holding that plaintiffs' claim in strict liability for unsafe design was not pre-empted; claims for mis-representation and breach of express warranty would also not be pre-empted).505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 510 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of the Court warranted that smoking the cigarettes which they manufac- tured and sold did not present any signi\u00aecant health conse-quences\u00ba (Count 7, App. 88). The \u00aafraudulent misrepresen-tation claims\u00ba allege that respondents had willfully, \u00aathroughtheir advertising, attempted to neutralize the [federallymandated] warnin[g]\u00ba labels (Count 6, App. 87\u00b188), and thatthey had possessed, but had \u00aaignored and failed to act upon,\u00bamedical and scienti\u00aec data indicating that \u00aacigarettes werehazardous to the health of consumers\u00ba (Count 8, App. 89).Finally, the \u00aaconspiracy to defraud claims\u00ba allege that re-spondents conspired to deprive the public of such medical and scienti\u00aec data (ibid.). As one of their defenses, respondents contended that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, enacted in1965, and its successor, the Public Health Cigarette SmokingAct of 1969, protected them from any liability based on theirconduct after 1965. In a pretrial ruling, the District Courtconcluded that the federal statutes were intended to estab-lish a uniform warning that would prevail throughout thecountry and that would protect cigarette manufacturers frombeing \u00aasubjected to varying requirements from state Inc., 593 F. Supp. 1146, 1148 (NJ 1984), but that the statutes did not pre-emptcommon-law actions. Id., at 1153\u00b11170. 4Accordingly, the court granted a motion to strike the pre-emption defenseentirely. 4The court explained: \u00aaHowever, the existence of the present federally mandated warning does not prevent an individual from claiming that the risks of smoking aregreater than the warning indicates, and that therefore such warning isinadequate. The court recognizes that it will be extremely dif\u00aecult for a plaintiff to prove that the present warning is inadequate to inform of thedangers, whatever they may be. However, the dif\u00aeculty of proof cannotpreclude the opportunity to be heard, and affording that opportunity will not undermine the purposes of the Act.\u00ba 593 F.

The court rejected respondents' contention that the federal Acts ex-pressly pre-empted common-law actions, but accepted theircontention that such actions would con\u00afict with federal law.Relying on the statement of purpose in the statutes, 5the court concluded that Congress' \u00aacarefully drawn balance be-tween the purposes of warning the public of the hazards ofcigarette smoking and protecting the interests of nationaleconomy\u00ba would be upset by state-law damages actionsbased on noncompliance with \u00aawarning, advertisement, andpromotion obligations other than those prescribed in the[federal] Act.\u00ba Id.,at 187.

This Court denied a petition for certiorari, 479 U. S. 1043 (1987), and the case returned to the District Court for trial.Complying with the Court of Appeals' mandate, the Dis-trict Court held that the failure-to-warn, express-warranty,fraudulent-misrepresentation, and conspiracy-to-defraudclaims were barred to the extent that they relied on respond-ents' advertising, promotional, and public relations activi-ties after January 1, 1966 (the effective date of the 1965Act). 649 F.

Following extensive dis- covery and a 4-month trial, the jury answered a seriesof special interrogatories and awarded $400,000 in damagesto Rose Cipollone's husband. In brief, it rejected all of the fraudulent-misrepresentation and conspiracy claims, but found that respondent Liggett had breached its duty to warnand its express warranties before 1966. It found, however,that Rose Cipollone had \u00aa `voluntarily and unreasonably en-counter[ed] a known danger by smoking cigarettes' \u00ba and that80% of the responsibility for her injuries was attributableto her. See 893 F. 2d, at 554 (summarizing jury \u00aendings).For that reason, no damages were awarded to her estate.However, the jury awarded damages to compensate her hus-band for losses caused by respondents' breach of expresswarranty. On cross-appeals from the \u00aenal judgment, the Court of Ap- peals af\u00aermed the District Court's pre-emption rulings butremanded for a new trial on several issues not relevant toour decision.

See U. S. Dept.of Health and Human Services, Report of the Surgeon Gen-eral, Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25Years of Progress 5 (1989). The ensuing decades saw a widerange of epidemiologic and laboratory studies on the healthhazards of smoking.

In July 1965, Congress en- acted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act(1965 Act or Act). 8The 1965 Act effectively adopted half of the FTC's regulation: the Act mandated warnings on ciga-rette packages (\u00a7 5(a)), but barred the requirement of suchwarnings in cigarette advertising (\u00a7 5(b)). 9 Section 2 of the Act declares the statute's two purposes: (1) adequately informing the public that cigarette smokingmay be hazardous to health, and (2) protecting the nationaleconomy from the burden imposed by diverse, nonuniform,and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regula-tions. 10In furtherance of the \u00aerst purpose, \u00a7 4 of the Act made it unlawful to sell or distribute any cigarettes in theUnited States unless the package bore a conspicuous labelstating: \u00aa Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazard- ous to Your Health. \u00ba In furtherance of the second pur- pose, \u00a7 5, captioned \u00aaPreemption,\u00ba provided in part: \u00aa(a) No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by section 4 of thisAct, shall be required on any cigarette package. \u00aa(b) No statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes thepackages of which are labeled in conformity with theprovisions of this Act.\u00ba Although the Act took effect January 1, 1966, \u00a7 10 of the Act provided that its provisions affecting the regulation of ad-vertising would terminate on July 1, 1969. As that termination date approached, federal authorities prepared to issue further regulations on cigarette advertis-ing. The FTC announced the reinstitution of its 1964 pro- 8Pub.

State authorities also prepared to take actions reg-ulating cigarette advertisements. 11 It was in this context that Congress enacted the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (1969 Act or Act),12 which amended the 1965 Act in several ways. First, the1969 Act strengthened the warning label, in part by requir-ing a statement that cigarette smoking \u00aais dangerous\u00ba ratherthan that it \u00aamay be hazardous.\u00ba Second, the 1969 Actbanned cigarette advertising in \u00aaany medium of electroniccommunication subject to [FCC] jurisdiction.\u00ba Third, andrelated, the 1969 the pre-emption provision byreplacing the original \u00a7 5(b) with a provision that reads: \u00aa(b) No requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with re-spect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettesthe packages of which are labeled in conformity with theprovisions of this Act.\u00ba Although the Act also directed the FTC not to \u00aatake any action before July 1, 1971, with respect to its pending traderegulation rule proceeding relating to cigarette advertising,\u00bathe narrowing of the pre-emption provision to prohibit onlyrestrictions \u00aaimposed under State law\u00ba cleared the way for the FTC to extend the warning-label requirement to printadvertisements for cigarettes. The FTC did so in 1972.See In re Lorillard, 80 F. T.

Id.,at 186. Never- theless, reading the statute as a whole in the light of thestatement of purpose in \u00a7 2, and considering the potentialregulatory effect of state common-law actions on the federalinterest in uniformity, the Court of Appeals concluded thatCongress had impliedly pre-empted petitioner's claims chal-lenging the adequacy of the warnings on labels or in adver-tising or the propriety of respondents' advertising and pro-motional activities. Id.,at 187. In our opinion, the pre-emptive scope of the 1965 Act and the 1969 Act is governed entirely by the express language in\u00a7 5 of each Act. When Congress has considered the issueof pre-emption and has included in the enacted legislationa provision explicitly addressing that issue, and when thatprovision provides a \u00aareliable indicium of congressional in-tent with respect to state authority,\u00ba Malone v.White Motor Corp., 435 U. S., at 505, \u00aathere is no need to infer congres- sional intent to pre-empt state laws from the substantiveprovisions\u00ba of the legislation. California Federal Sav- ings & Loan Assn. v.Guerra, 479 U. S. 272, 282 (1987) (opin- ion of Marshall, J.). Such reasoning is a variant of thefamiliar principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius: Congress' enactment of a provision de\u00aening the pre-emptivereach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach arenot pre-empted. In this case, the other provisions of the1965 and 1969 Acts offer no cause to look beyond \u00a7 5 of eachAct. Therefore, we need only identify the domain expresslypre-empted by each of those sections. As the 1965 and 1969provisions differ substantially, we consider each in turn. broad as the 1965 provision. The court's ultimate ruling that petitioner's claims were impliedly pre-empted effective January 1, 1966, re\u00afects thefact that the 1969 Act did not alter the statement of purpose in \u00a7 2, whichwas critical to GROUP, Opinion of the Court IV In the 1965 pre-emption provision regarding advertising (\u00a7 5(b)), Congress spoke precisely and narrowly: \u00aaNo state- ment relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of [properly labeled] cigarettes.\u00ba Section 5(a) used the same phrase (\u00aaNo statement relating to smoking and health\u00ba) with regard to cigarette labeling. As \u00a7 5(a)made clear, that phrase referred to the sort of warningprovided for in \u00a7 4, which set forth verbatim the warningCongress determined to be appropriate. Thus, on theirface, these provisions merely prohibited state and federalrulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionarystatements on cigarette labels (\u00a7 5(a)) or in cigarette ad-vertisements (\u00a7 5(b)). Beyond the precise words of these provisions, this read- ing is appropriate for several reasons. First, as discussedabove, we must construe these provisions in light of the pre-sumption against the pre-emption of state police power regu-lations. This presumption reinforces the appropriateness ofa narrow reading of \u00a7 5. Second, the warning required in \u00a7 4does not by its own effect foreclose additional obligationsimposed under state law. That Congress requires a particu-lar warning label does not automatically pre-empt a regula-tory \u00aeeld. See McDermott v.Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115, 131\u00b1 132 (1913). Third, there is no general, inherent con\u00afictbetween federal pre-emption of state warning requirementsand the continued vitality of state common-law damagesactions. For example, in the Comprehensive SmokelessTobacco Health Education Act of 1986, 14Congress expressly pre-empted state or local imposition of a \u00aastatement relatingto the use of smokeless tobacco products and health\u00ba but, atthe same time, preserved state-law damages actions basedon those products. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 4406. All of these con-siderations indicate that \u00a7 5 is best read as having super- 14Pub. L. 99\u00b1252, 100 Stat. 30, as codi\u00aeed, S.

S. 504 (1992) Opinion of the Court seded only positive enactments by legislatures or administra- tive agencies that mandate particular warning labels.15 This reading comports with the 1965 Act's statement of purpose, which expressed an intent to avoid \u00aadiverse, non-uniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertisingregulations with respect to any relationship between smok- ing and health.\u00ba Read against the backdrop of regulatoryactivity undertaken by state legislatures and federal agen-cies in response to the Surgeon General's report, the term\u00aaregulation\u00ba most naturally refers to positive enactments bythose bodies, not to common-law damages actions. The regulatory context of the 1965 Act also supports such a reading. As noted above, a warning requirement promul-gated by the FTC and other requirements under consider-ation by the States were the catalyst for passage of the 1965Act. These regulatory actions animated the passage of \u00a7 5,which re\u00afected Congress' efforts to prevent \u00aaa multiplicityof State and local regulations pertaining to labeling of ciga-rette packages,\u00ba H. R. Rep. No. 449, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 4(1965), and to \u00aapreemp[t] all Federal, State, and local authori-ties from requiring any statement relating to smoking and health in the advertising of cigarettes.\u00ba Id.,at 5 (emphasis supplied). 16 For these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 5 of the 1965 Act only pre-empted state and federal rulemaking bodies from 15Cf.Banzhaf v.FCC, 132 U. S. App. D. C. 14, 405 F. 2d 1082 (1968) (holding that 1965 Act did not pre-empt FCC's fairness policy as appliedto cigarette advertising), cert. denied, 396 U. S. 842 (1969). 16Justice Scalia takes issue with our narrow reading of the phrase \u00aaNo statement.\u00ba His criticism, however, relies solely on an interpretationof those two words, arti\u00aecially severed from both textual and legislativecontext. As demonstrated above, the phrase \u00aaNo statement\u00ba in \u00a7 5(b) re-fers to the similar phrase in \u00a7 5(a), which refers in turn to \u00a7 4, which itselfsets forth a particular statement. This context, combined with the regu- latory setting in which Congress acted, establishes that a narrow readingof the phrase \u00aaNo 520 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Stevens, J. mandating particular cautionary statements and did not pre-empt state-law damages actions.17 V Compared to its predecessor in the 1965 Act, the plain lan- guage of the pre-emption provision in the 1969 Act is muchbroader. First, the later Act bars not simply \u00aastatement[s]\u00babut rather \u00aarequirement[s] or prohibition[s ]...i mposed under State the beyondstatements \u00aain the advertising\u00ba to obligations \u00aawith respectto the advertising or promotion\u00ba of cigarettes. Notwithstanding these substantial differences in language, both petitioner and respondents contend that the 1969 Actdid not materially alter the pre-emptive scope of federallaw. 18Their primary support for this contention is a sen- tence in a Committee Report which states that the 1969amendment \u00aaclari\u00aeed\u00ba the 1965 version of \u00a7 5(b). S. Rep.No. 91\u00b1566, p. 12 (1969). We reject the parties' reading asincompatible with the language and origins of the amend-ments. As we noted in another context, \u00aa[i]nferences fromlegislative history cannot rest on so slender a reed. More- over, the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardousbasis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u00ba United States v.Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). The 1969 Act worked substantial changes in the law: rewriting the labelwarning, banning broadcast advertising, and allowing theFTC to regulate print advertising. In the context of suchrevisions and in light of the substantial changes in wording, 17This interpretation of the 1965 Act appears to be consistent with re- spondents' contemporaneous understanding of the Act. Although re-spondents have participated in a great deal of litigation relating to ciga-rette use beginning in the 1950's, it appears that this case is the \u00aerst inwhich they have raised \u00a7 5 as a pre-emption defense. 18See Brief for PAGES OPINPGT 521 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. we cannot accept the parties' claim that the 1969 Act did not alter the reach of \u00a7 5(b).19 Petitioner next contends that \u00a7 5(b), however broadened by the 1969 Act, does not pre-empt common-law actions. He offers two theories for limiting the reach of the amended\u00a7 5(b). First, he argues that common-law damages actionsdo not impose \u00aarequirement[s] or prohibition[s]\u00ba and thatCongress injunc-tion[s], or executive pronouncement[s].\u00ba 20We disagree; such an analysis is at odds both with the plain words of the1969 Act and with the general understanding of common-lawdamages actions. The phrase \u00aa[n]o requirement or prohibi-tion\u00ba sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction betweenpositive enactments and common law; to the contrary, thosewords easily encompass obligations that take the form ofcommon-law rules. As we noted in another context, \u00aa[state]regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief. Theobligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed tobe, a potent method of governing conduct and contro lling policy.\u00ba San Diego Building Trades Council v.Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959). Although portions of the legislative history of the 1969 Act suggest that Congress was primarily concerned with positiveenactments by States and localities, see S. Rep. No. 91\u00b1566,p. 12, the language of the Act plainly reaches beyond suchenactments. \u00aaWe must give effect to this plain language un-less there is good reason to believe Congress intended thelanguage to have some more restrictive meaning.\u00ba Shaw v. 19As noted above, the 1965 Act's statement of purpose (\u00a7 2) suggested that Congress was concerned primarily with \u00aaregulations\u00ba\u00d0positive en-actments, rather than common-law damages actions. Although the 1969Act did not amend \u00a7 2, we are not persuaded that the retention of thatportion of the 1965 Act is a suf\u00aecient basis for rejecting the plain meaningof the broad language that Congress added to v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Stevens, J. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 97 (1983). In this case there is no \u00aagood reason to believe\u00ba that Congress meant lessthan what it said; indeed, in light of the narrowness of the1965 Act, there is \u00aagood reason to believe\u00ba that Congressmeant precisely what it said in amending that Act. Moreover, common-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty,and it is dif\u00aecult to say that such actions do not impose \u00aare-quirements or prohibitions.\u00ba See W. Prosser, Law of Torts4 (4th ed. 1971); Black's Law Dictionary 1489 (6th ed. 1990)(de\u00aening \u00aatort\u00ba as \u00aaalways [involving] a violation of some duty owing to plaintiff\u00ba). It is in this way that the 1969version of \u00a7 5(b) differs from its predecessor: Whereas thecommon law would not normally require a vendor to use anyspeci\u00aec statement on its packages or in its advertisements, it is the essence of the common law to enforce duties thatare either af\u00aermative requirements or negative prohibitions. We therefore reject petitioner's argument that the phrase\u00aarequirement or prohibition\u00ba limits the 1969 Act's pre-emptive scope to positive enactments by legislatures andagencies. Petitioner's second argument for excluding common-law rules from the reach of \u00a7 5(b) hinges on the phrase \u00aaimposedunder State law.\u00ba This argument fails as well. At leastsince Erie R. Co. v.Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), we have recognized the phrase \u00aastate law\u00ba to include common law aswell as statutes and regulations. Indeed just last Term, theCourt stated that the phrase \u00aa `all other law, including Stateand municipal admit of [a] distinction . .between positive enactments and common-law rules of liabil-ity.\u00ba Norfolk & Western R. Co. v.Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 128 (1991). Although the presumption againstpre-emption might give good reason to construe the phrase\u00aastate law\u00ba in a pre-emption provision more narrowly thanan identical phrase in another context, in this case such aconstruction is not appropriate.

No. 91\u00b1566, p. 16 (1969), the ConferenceCommittee replaced this language with \u00aaState law with respect to advertising or promotion.\u00ba In such a situation,\u00a7 5(b)'s pre-emption of \u00aastate law\u00ba cannot fairly be limited topositive enactments. That the pre-emptive scope of \u00a7 5(b) cannot be limited to positive enactments does not mean that that section pre-empts all common-law claims. For example, as respondentsconcede, \u00a7 5(b) does not generally pre-empt \u00aastate-law obliga-tions to avoid marketing cigarettes with manufacturing de-fects or to use a demonstrably safer alternative design forcigarettes.\u00ba 21For purposes of \u00a7 5(b), the common law is not of a piece. Nor does the statute indicate that any familiar subdivision of common-law claims is or is not pre-empted. We thereforecannot follow petitioner's passing suggestion that \u00a7 5(b) pre-empts liability for omissions but not for acts, or that \u00a7 5(b) pre-empts liability for unintentional torts but not for inten-tional torts. Instead we must fairly but\u00d0in light of thestrong presumption against pre-emption\u00d0narrowly construethe precise language of \u00a7 5(b) and we must look to each ofpetitioner's common-law claims to determine whether it isin fact pre-empted. 22The central inquiry in each case is 21Brief for Respondents 14. 22Petitioner makes much of the fact that Congress did not expressly include common law within \u00a7 5's pre-emptive reach, as it has in other stat-utes. See, e. g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 1144(c)(1); 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 1715z\u00b117(d). Respond- ents make much of the fact that Congress did not include a saving clausepreserving common-law claims, again, as it has in other statutes. See,e. g., 17 U. S. C. \u00a7 301. Under our analysis of \u00a7 5, these omissions make perfect sense: Congress was neither pre-empting nor saving common law505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 524 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Stevens, J. straightforward: we ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages action constitutes a\u00aarequirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . .imposed under State law with respect t o... advertising or promotion,\u00ba giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.As discussed below, each phrase within that clause limits theuniverse of common-law claims pre-empted by the statute. We consider each category of damages actions in turn. In doing so, we express no opinion on whether these actions areviable claims as a matter of state law; we assume, arguendo, that they are. Failure to Warn To establish liability for a failure to warn, petitioner must show that \u00aaa warning is necessary to make a product . . .reasonably safe, suitable and \u00aet for its intended use,\u00ba thatrespondents failed to provide such a warning, and that thatfailure was a proximate cause of petitioner's injury. Tr.12738. In this case, petitioner offered two closely relatedtheories concerning the failure to warn: \u00aerst, that respond-ents \u00aawere negligent in the manner [that] they tested, re-searched, sold, promoted, and advertised\u00ba their cigarettes;and second, that respondents failed to provide \u00aaadequatewarnings of the health consequences of cigarette smoking.\u00baApp. 85\u00b186. Petitioner's claims are pre-empted to the extent that they rely on a state-law \u00aarequirement or prohibition . . . with re-spect t o... advertising or promotion.\u00ba Thus, insofar as claims under either failure-to-warn theory require a showingthat respondents' post-1969 advertising or promotions shouldhave included additional, or more clearly stated, warnings,those claims are pre-empted. The Act does not, however,pre-empt petitioner's claims that rely solely on respondents' as a whole\u00d0it was simply pre-empting particular common-law claims, saving others.505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 525 Cite as: 505 U.

Breach of Express Warranty Petitioner's claim for breach of an express warranty arises under N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 12A:2\u00b1313(1)(a) (West 1962), whichprovides: \u00aaAny af\u00aermation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomespart of the basis of the bargain creates an express war-ranty that the goods shall conform to the af\u00aermationor promise.\u00ba Petitioner's evidence of an express warranty consists largely of statements made in respondents' advertising. See . . . . the propriety of aparty's actions with respect to the advertising and promotionof cigarettes,\u00ba 789 F. 2d, at 187, the District Court ruled thatthis claim \u00aainevitably brings into question [respondents'] ad-vertising and promotional activities, and is therefore pre-empted\u00ba after 1965. 649 F. Supp., at 675. As demonstratedabove, however, the 1969 Act does not sweep so broadly: Theappropriate inquiry is not whether a claim challenges the\u00aapropriety\u00ba of advertising and promotion, but whether theclaim would require the imposition under state law of a re-quirement or prohibition based on smoking and health withrespect to advertising or promotion. A manufacturer's liability for breach of an express war- ranty derives from, and is measured by, the terms of thatwarranty. Accordingly, the \u00aarequirement[s]\u00ba imposed by anexpress warranty claim are not \u00aaimposed under State law,\u00babut rather imposed by the warrantor. 23If, for example, a 23Thus it is that express warranty claims are said to sound in contract rather than in tort.

Justice Scalia might be correct if the Act pre-empted \u00aaliability\u00ba imposed under state law (as he suggests, post, at 551); but instead the Act expressly pre-empts only a \u00aarequirement or prohibition\u00ba imposed under state law.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation Petitioner alleges two theories of fraudulent misrepresen- tation. First, petitioner alleges that respondents, throughtheir advertising, neutralized the effect of federally man-dated warning labels. Such a claim is predicated on a state-law prohibition against statements in advertising and promo-tional materials that tend to minimize the health hazardsassociated with smoking. Such a prohibition, however, is merely the converse of a state-law requirement that warn- ings be included in advertising and promotional materials.Section 5(b) of the 1969 Act pre-empts both requirementsand prohibitions; it therefore supersedes petitioner's \u00aerstfraudulent-misrepresentation theory. Regulators have long recognized the relationship between prohibitions on advertising that downplays the dangers ofsmoking and requirements for warnings in advertisements.For example, the FTC, in promulgating its initial trade regu-lation rule in 1964, criticized advertising that \u00aaassociated cig-arette smoking with such positive attributes as contentment,glamour, romance, youth, happines s...a tt h e same time suggesting that smoking is an activity at least consistentwith physical health and well-being.\u00ba The Commissionconcluded: \u00aaTo avoid giving a false impression that smoking [is] in- nocuous, the cigarette manufacturer who represents thealleged pleasures or satisfactions of cigarette smokingin his advertising must also disclose the serious risks tolife that smoking involves.\u00ba 29 Fed. Reg. 8356 (1964). Longstanding regulations of the Food and Drug Administra- tion express a similar understanding of the relationship be-tween required warnings and advertising that \u00aanegates ordisclaims\u00ba those warnings: \u00aaA hazardous substance shall PAGES OPINPGT 528 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Stevens, J. there appears in or on the label ...s t atements, designs, or other graphic material that in any manner negates or dis-claims [the required warning].\u00ba 21 CFR \u00a7 191.102 seems quite clear that petitioner's \u00aerst theoryof fraudulent misrepresentation is inextricably related topetitioner's \u00aerst failure-to-warn theory, a theory that wehave already concluded is largely pre-empted by \u00a7 5(b). Petitioner's second theory, as construed by the District Court, alleges intentional fraud and misrepresentation bothby \u00aafalse representation of a material fact material fact.\u00ba of this claim is a state-law duty not to make false statementsof material fact or to conceal such facts. Our pre-emptionanalysis requires us to determine whether such a duty is thesort of requirement or prohibition proscribed by \u00a7 5(b). to the advertising or promotion\u00ba ofcigarettes. Petitioner's claims that respondents concealedmaterial facts are therefore not pre-empted insofar as thoseclaims rely on a state-law duty to disclose such facts throughchannels of communication other than advertising or promo-tion. Thus, for example, if state law obliged respondentsto disclose material facts about smoking and health to anadministrative agency, \u00a7 5(b) would not pre-empt a state-lawclaim based on a failure to ful\u00aell that obligation. Moreover, petitioner's fraudulent-misrepresentation claims that do arise with respect to advertising and promotions(most notably claims based on allegedly false statements ofmaterial fact made in advertisements) are not pre-emptedby \u00a7 5(b). Such claims are predicated not on a duty \u00aabasedon smoking and health\u00ba but rather on a more general obliga- 25The District Court stated that this claim \u00aaconsists of the following elements: 1) a material misrepresentation of . . . fact false as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. tion\u00d0the duty not to deceive. This understanding of fraud by intentional misstatement is appropriate for several rea-sons. First, in the 1969 Act, Congress offered no sign thatit wished to insulate cigarette manufacturers from long-standing rules governing fraud. To the contrary, both the1965 and the 1969 Acts explicitly reserved the FTC's author-ity to identify and punish deceptive advertising practices\u00d0an authority that the FTC had long exercised and continuesto exercise. See \u00a7 5(c) of the 1965 Act; \u00a7 of the 1969Act; see also nn. 7, 9, supra. This indicates that Congress intended the phrase \u00aarelating to smoking and health\u00ba (whichwas essentially unchanged by the 1969 Act) to be construednarrowly, so as not to proscribe the regulation of deceptiveadvertising. 26 Moreover, this reading of \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba is wholly consistent with the purposes of the 1969 Act.State-law prohibitions on false statements of material fact donot create \u00aadiverse, nonuniform, and confusing\u00ba standards.Unlike state-law obligations render a product \u00aareasonably safe,\u00ba state-law pro-scriptions on intentional fraud rely only on a single, uniformstandard: falsity. Thus, we conclude that the phrase \u00aabasedon smoking and health\u00ba fairly but narrowly construed doesnot encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulentstatements. Accordingly, petitioner's claim based on alleg-edly fraudulent statements made in respondents' advertise-ments is not pre-empted by \u00a7 5(b) of the 1969 Act. 27 26The Senate Report emphasized that the \u00aapreemption of regulation or prohibition with respect to cigarette advertising is narrowly phrased to preempt only State action based on smoking and health. It would in no way affect the power of any State . . . with respect to the taxation or thesale of cigarettes to minors, or the prohibition of smoking in public build-ings, or similar police regulations. \u00ba S. Rep. No. 91\u00b1566, p. 12 (1969) (em- phasis supplied). 27Both Justice Blackmun and Justice Scalia challenge the level of generality employed in our analysis. Justice Blackmun contends that, as a matter of consistency, we should construe failure-to-warn claims not505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 530 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Stevens, J. Conspiracy to Misrepresent or Conceal Material Facts Petitioner's \u00aenal claim alleges a conspiracy among re- spondents to misrepresent or conceal material facts concern-ing the health hazards of smoking. 28The predicate duty un- derlying this claim is a duty not to conspire to commit fraud.For the reasons stated in our analysis of petitioner's inten-tional fraud claim, this duty is not pre-empted by \u00a7 5(b) forit is not a prohibition \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba as thatphrase is properly construed. Accordingly, we conclude thatthe 1969 Act does not pre-empt petitioner's conspiracy claim. VI To summarize our holding: The 1965 Act did not pre-empt state-law damages actions; the 1969 Act pre-empts petition-er's claims based on a failure to warn and the neutralization as based on smoking and health, but rather as based on the broader duty \u00aato inform consumers of known risks.\u00ba Post, at 543. Justice Scalia con- tends that, again as a matter of consistency, we should construe fraudulent-misrepresentation claims not as based on a general duty not to deceive but rather as \u00aabased on smoking and health.\u00ba Admittedly, each of thesepositions has some conceptual attraction. However, our ambition here isnot theoretical elegance, but rather a fair understanding of congressionalpurpose. To analyze failure-to-warn claims at the highest level of generality (as Justice Blackmun would have us do) would render the 1969 amend- ments almost meaningless and would pay too little respect to Congress'substantial reworking of the Act. On the other hand, to analyze fraudclaims at the lowest level of generality (as Justice Scalia would have us do) would con\u00afict both with the background presumption against pre-emption and with legislative history that plainly expresses an intent topreserve the \u00aapolice regulations\u00ba of the States. See n. 25, supra. 28The District Court described the evidence of conspiracy as follows: \u00aaEvidence presented by [petitioner], particularly that contained in the documents of [respondents] themselves, indicates . . . that the industry ofwhich these [respondents] were and are a part entered into a sophisticatedconspiracy.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly re- versed in part and af\u00aermed in part, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Blackmun , with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter join, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part. I The Court today would craft a compromise position con- cerning the extent to which federal law pre-empts personsinjured by cigarette manufacturers' unlawful conduct frombringing state common-law damages claims against thosemanufacturers. I, however, \u00aend the Court's divided holdingwith respect to the original and amended versions of thefederal statute entirely unsatisfactory. Our precedents donot allow us to infer a scope of pre-emption beyond thatwhich clearly is mandated by Congress' language. In myview, neither version of the federal legislation at issue here provides the kind of unambiguous evidence of congressionalintent necessary to displace state common-law damagesclaims. I therefore join Parts I, II, III, and IV of theCourt's opinion, but dissent from Parts V and VI. A I agree with the Court's exposition, in Part III of its opin- ion, of the underlying principles of pre-emption law, and inparticular with its recognition that the pre-emptive scope ofthe Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (1965Act or Act) and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 532 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC.

Where, as here, Congress has included in legislationa speci\u00aec provision addressing\u00d0and indeed, entitled\u00d0pre-emption, the Court's task is one of statutory interpretation\u00d0only to \u00aaidentify the domain expressly pre-empted\u00ba by theprovision.

I further agree with the Court that we cannot \u00aend the state common-law damages claims at issue in this case pre-empted by federal law in the absence of clear and unambigu-ous evidence that Congress intended that result. See ante, at 516. The Court describes this reluctance to infer pre-emption in ambiguous cases as a \u00aapresumption against thepre-emption of state police power regulations.\u00ba Ante, at 518. Although many of the cases in which the Court hasinvoked such a presumption against displacement of statelaw have involved implied pre-emption, see, e. g., Florida Lime & Avocado Gr owers, Inc. v.Paul, 373 U.

In such cases, the question is not whether Congress intended to pre-empt state regulation, but to whatextent. We do not, absent unambiguous evidence, infer a scope of pre-emption beyond that which clearly is mandatedby Congress' language. 1I therefore agree with the Court's unwilling ness to conclude that the state common-law dam- ages claims at issue in this case are pre-empted unless such result is \u00aa `the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' \u00baAnte, at 516 (quoting Rice v.Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.

B I also agree with the Court's application of the foregoing principles in Part IV of its opinion, where it concludes that 1The Court construes congressional inroads on state power narrowly in other contexts, as well. For example, the Court repeatedly has held that,in order to waive a State's sovereign immunity from suit in federal court,Congress must make its intention \u00aaunmistakably clear in the language ofthe statute.\u00ba Atascadero State Hospital v.Scanlon, 473 U.

In my view, the words of \u00a7 5(b) ofthat Act (\u00aaNo statement relating to smoking and health shallbe required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packagesof which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act\u00ba) can bear only one meaning: that States are prohibitedmerely from \u00aamandating particular cautionary statements. . . in cigarette advertisements.\u00ba Ante, at 518.

II My agreement with the Court ceases at this point. Given the Court's proper analytical focus on the scope of the ex-press pre-emption provisions at issue here and its acknowl-edgment that the 1965 Act does not pre-empt state common-law damages claims, I \u00aend the plurality's conclusion that the1969 Act pre-empts at least some common-law damagesclaims little short of baf\u00afing. In my view, the modi\u00aeed lan-guage of \u00a7 5(b), U. S.

Nonetheless, the plurality reaches a differ-ent conclusion, and its reasoning warrants scrutiny.505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:27 PAGES OPINPGT 535 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J.

More important, the question whether common-law dam- ages actions exert a regulatory effect on manufacturers anal- ogous to that of positive enactments\u00d0an assumption crucialto the that the phrase \u00aarequirement encompasses actions\u00d0is signi\u00ae-cantly more complicated than the brief quotationfrom San Diego Building Trades Council v.Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959), see ante, at 521, would suggest. The effect of tort law on a manufacturer's behavior is nec- essarily indirect. Although an award of damages by its verynature attaches additional consequences to the manufactur-er's continued unlawful conduct, no particular course of ac-tion ( e. g., the adoption of a new warning label) is required. A manufacturer found liable on, for example, a failure-to-warn claim may respond in a number of ways. It may de-cide to accept damages awards as a cost of doing businessand not alter its behavior in any way. See Goodyear Atomic Corp. v.Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 185\u00b1186 (1988) (corporation \u00aamay choose to disregard [state] safety regulations and sim-ply pay an additional\u00ba damages award if an employee is in-jured as a result of a safety violation). Or, by contrast, itmay choose to avoid future awards by dispensing warningsthrough a variety of alternative mechanisms, such as pack-age inserts, public service advertisements, or general educa-tional programs. The level of choice that a defendant re-tains in shaping its own behavior distinguishes the indirectregulatory effect of the common law from positive enact-505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 537 Cite as: 505 U.

J. 69, 90, 577 A. 2d 1239, 1249 (1990); Garner, Cigarette Dependency andCivil Liability: A Modest Proposal, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1423,1454 (1980). Moreover, tort law has an entirely separatefunction\u00d0compensating victims\u00d0that sets it apart from di-rect forms of regulation. See Ferebee v.Chevron Chemical Co., 237 U. S. App. D. C. 164, 175, 736 F. 2d 1529, 1540, cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1062 (1984). Despite its earlier acknowledgment, consistent with the foregoing conception of damages actions, that \u00aathere is nogeneral, inherent con\u00afict between federal pre-emption ofstate warning requirements and the continued Garmon 's statement that \u00aaregulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damagesas through some form of preventive relief,\u00ba 359 U. S., at 247,suf\u00aecient authority to warrant extinguishing the common-law actions at issue in this case. See ante, at 521. I am not persuaded. Not only has the Court previously distinguishedGarmon, 3but it has declined on several recent occasions to \u00aend the regulatory effects of state tort law direct or substan-tial enough to warrant pre-emption. InGoodyear Atomic Corp. v.Miller, for example, the Court distinguished, for purposes of pre-emption analysis, 2Congress, in fact, has expressly allowed common-law damages actions to survive while pre-empting other, more direct forms of state regulation.See, e. g., Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, \u00a7 7, 100 Stat. 34, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 4406; Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 651 et seq., as construed in Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., ante, p. 88. 3The Court has explained that Garmon, in which a state common-law damages award was found to be pre-empted by the National Labor Rela-tions Act, involved a special \u00aapresumption of federal pre-emption\u00ba relatingto the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. SeeBrown v.Hotel Employees, 468 U. S. 491, 502 (1984); English v.General Electric Co., 496 U.

S., at 185. Rely-ing in part on its earlier decision in Silkwood v.Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 256 (1984), 4the Court stated that \u00aaCon- gress may reasonably determine that incidental regulatorypressure is acceptable, whereas direct regulatory authorityis not.\u00ba 486 U. S., at 186. Even more recently, the Courtdeclined in English v.General Electric Co., 496 U. S., at 86, to \u00aend state common-law damages claims for emotional dis-tress pre-empted by federal nuclear energy law. The Courtconcluded that, although awards to former employees foremotional distress would attach \u00aaadditional consequences\u00ba toretaliatory employer conduct and could lead employers toalter the underlying conditions about which employees werecomplaining, ibid., such an effect would be \u00aaneither direct nor substantial enough\u00ba to warrant pre-emption. Id.,at 85. In light of the recognized distinction in this Court's juris- prudence between direct state regulation and the indirectregulatory effects of common-law damages actions, it cannot be said that damages claims are clearly or unambiguously\u00aarequirements\u00ba or \u00aaprohibitions\u00ba imposed under state law. 4The Court in Silkwood declined to \u00aend state punitive damages awards pre-empted by federal nuclear safety laws, explaining: \u00aaIt may be that theaward of damages based on the state law of negligence or strict liabilityis regulatory in the sense that a nuclear plant will be threatened with damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regula-tory consequence was something that Congress was quite willing to ac- cept.\u00ba 464 U. S., at 256. Although the Court has noted that the decisioninSilkwood was based in \u00aasubstantial part\u00ba on af\u00aermative evidence in the legislative history suggesting that Congress did not intend to includecommon-law damages remedies within the pre-empted \u00aeeld, see English v.General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 86 (1990), Silkwood 's discussion of the regulatory effects of the common law is instructive and has been reliedon in subsequent cases. See, e. g., Goodyear, 486 U.

The plain language of the 1969 Act's modi\u00aeed pre-emption provision simply cannot bear the broad interpretation theplurality would impart to it. B Not only does the text of the revised \u00a7 5(b) fail clearly or manifestly to require pre-emption of state common-law dam-ages actions, but there is no suggestion in the legislativehistory that Congress intended to expand the scope of thepre-emption provision when it amended the statute in 1969.The plurality acknowledges the evidence that Congress itselfperceived the changes in \u00a7 5(b) to be a mere \u00aa `clari\u00ae[cation]' \u00baof the existing narrow pre-emption provision, ante, at 520 (quoting S. Rep. No. 91\u00b1566, p. 12 (1969) (hereinafterS. Rep.)), but it dismisses these statements of legislativeintent as the \u00aa `views of a subsequent Congress.' \u00ba Ante, at 520 (quoting United States v.Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960)). The plurality is wrong not only as a factual mat-ter\u00d0for the statements of the Congress that amended \u00a7 5(b)are contemporaneous, not \u00aasubsequent,\u00ba to enactment of therevised pre-emption a legal matter, aswell. This Court accords \u00aagreat weight\u00ba to an amendingCongress' interpretation of the underlying statute. See,e. g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 380\u00b1381, and n. 8 (1969). Viewing the revisions to \u00a7 5(b) as generally nonsubstantive in nature makes sense. By replacing the word \u00aastatement\u00bawith the slightly broader term, \u00aarequirement,\u00ba and addingthe word \u00aaprohibition\u00ba to ensure that a State could not dothrough negative mandate ( e. g., banning all cigarette adver- tising) that which it already was forbidden to do throughpositive mandate ( e. g., mandating particular cautionary statements), Congress sought to \u00aaclarif[y]\u00ba the existing pre-505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 540 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Blackmun, J. cautions against confusing and nonuniform state laws and regulations. S. Rep., at 12.5 Just as it acknowledges the evidence that Congress' changes in the pre-emption provision were nonsubstantive,the plurality admits that \u00aaportions of the legislative historyof the 1969 Act suggest that Congress was primarily con-cerned with positive enactments by States and localities.\u00baAnte, at 521. Indeed, the relevant Senate Report explains that the revised pre-emption provision is \u00aaintended to in-clude not only action by State statute but by all other admin-istrative actions or local ordinances or regulations by anypolitical subdivisions of any State,\u00ba a list remarkable for theabsence of any reference to common-law damages actions.S. Rep., at 12. Cf., e. g., 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1144(a) and (c)(1) (ERISA statute de\u00aenes \u00aaany and laws\u00ba as used inpre-emption provision to mean \u00aaall laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having the effect of law\u00ba) (emphasis added). The plurality dismisses this statementwith the simple observation that \u00aathe language of the Actplainly reaches beyond such [positive] enactments.\u00ba Ante, at 521. Yet, as discussed above, the words of \u00a7 5(b) (\u00aare-quirement or prohibition\u00ba) do not so \u00aaplainly\u00ba extend tocommon-law damages actions, and the plurality errs in plac-ing so much weight on this fragile textual hook. The plurality further acknowledges that, at the same time that Congress amended the pre-emption provision of \u00a7 5(b),it made no effort to alter the statement of purpose containedin \u00a7 2 of the 1965 Act. Ante, at 521, n. 19. Although the 5In the one reported case construing the scope of pre-emption under the 1965 Act, Banzhaf v.FCC \u00b1-a case of which Congress was aware, see S.

S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. plurality relegates this fact to a footnote, the continued vital- ity of \u00a7 2 is signi\u00aecant, particularly in light of the Court'sreliance on the same statement of purpose for its earlier con-clusion that the 1965 Act does notpre-empt state common- law damages actions. See ante, at 519 (concluding that Con- gress' expressed intent to avoid diverse, nonuniform, andconfusing regulations \u00aamost naturally refers to positive en-actments by [state legislatures and federal agencies], not tocommon-law damages actions\u00ba). Finally, there is absolutely no suggestion in the legislative history that Congress intended to leave plaintiffs who were injured as a result of cigarette manufacturers' unlawful con-duct without any alternative remedies; yet that is the regret-table effect of the ruling today that many state common-lawdamages claims are pre-empted. The Court in the past hashesitated to \u00aend pre-emption where federal law provides nocomparable remedy. See Rabin, A Sociolegal History of theTobacco Tort Litigation, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 853, 869 (1992) (not-ing the \u00aarather strong tradition of federal deference to com-peting state interests in compensating injury victims\u00ba). In-deed, in Silkwood, the Court took note of \u00aaCongress' failure to provide any federal remedy\u00ba for injured persons, andstated that it was \u00aadif\u00aecult to believe that Congress would,without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse forthose injured by illegal conduct.\u00ba 464 U. S., at 251. Seealso id., at 263 ( Blackmun, J. , dissenting) (\u00aa[I]t is inconceiv- able that Congress intended to leave victims with no remedyat all\u00ba). Unlike other federal statutes where Congress has eased the bite of pre-emption by establishing \u00aacomprehensive\u00ba civilenforcement schemes, see, e. g., Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.Mc- Clendon, 498 U. S. 133, 144\u00b1145 (1990) (discussing \u00a7 502(a) of ERISA), the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act is bar-ren of alternative remedies. The Act merely empowers theFederal Trade Commission to regulate unfair or deceptiveadvertising practices (15 U. S. C. \u00a7 16:46:28 GROUP, INC. Opinion of Blackmun, J. criminal penalties (misdemeanor and \u00aene not to exceed $10,000) for violations of the Act's provisions (\u00a7 1338), andauthorizes federal courts, upon the to violations of the Act (\u00a7 1339). Unlike the plu-rality, I am unwilling to believe that Congress, without any mention of state common-law damages actions or of its inten-tion dramatically to expand the scope of federal pre-emption,would have eliminated the only means of judicial recourse forthose injured by cigarette manufacturers' unlawful conduct. Thus, not only does the plain language of the 1969 Act fail clearly to require pre-emption of petitioner's state common-law damages claims, but there is no suggestion in the legisla-tive history that Congress intended to expand the scope ofthe pre-emption provision in the drastic manner that the plu-rality attributes to it. Our obligation to infer pre-emptiononly where Congress' intent is clear and manifest mandatesthe conclusion that state common-law damages actions arenot pre-empted by the 1969 Act. 6 III Stepping back from the speci\u00aecs of the plurality's pre- emption analysis to view the result the plurality ultimatelyreaches, I am further disturbed. Notwithstanding theCourt's ready acknowledgment that \u00aa ` \u00aa[t]he purpose of Con-gress is the ultimate touchstone\u00ba ' of pre-emption analysis,\u00baante, at 516 (quoting Malone v.White Motor Corp., 435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978)), the plurality proceeds to create a crazy quilt 6Every Court of Appeals to consider the question, including the Third Circuit in an earlier opinion in this case, similarly has concluded that statecommon-law damages claims are notexpressly pre-empted under the 1969 Act. See, e. g., Cipollone v.Liggett Group, Inc., 789 F. 2d 181, 185\u00b1186 v.R. J. Tobacco 849 F. 2d 230, 234 (CA6 1988); Palmer v.Liggett Group, Inc., 825 F. 2d 620, 625 (CA1 1987). See also Dewey v.R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 121 N. J. 69, 85, 577 A. 2d 1239, 1247 (1990); Forster v.R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., N.

The most obvious problem with the plurality's analysis is its frequent shift in the level of generality at which it exam-ines the individual claims. For example, the plurality statesthat fraudulent-misrepresentation claims (at least those in-volving false statements of material fact in advertisements)are \u00aapredicated not on a duty `based on smoking and health'but rather on a more general obligation\u00d0the duty not todeceive,\u00ba and therefore are not pre-empted by \u00a7 5(b) of the 1969 Act. Ante, at 528\u00b1529. Yet failure-to-warn claims\u00d0 which could just as easily be described as based on a \u00aamoregeneral obligation\u00ba to inform consumers of known risks\u00d0implicitly are found to be \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba andare declared pre-empted. See ante, at 524. The plurality goes on to hold that express warranty claims are not pre-empted because the duty at issue is undertaken by the manu-facturer and is not \u00aaimposed under State law.\u00ba Ante, at 525. Yet, as the plurality itself must acknowledge, \u00aathe general duty not to breach warranties arises under state law,\u00ba ibid. (emphasis added); absent the State's decision to penalizesuch behavior through the creation of a common-law dam-ages action, no warranty claim would exist. In short, I can perceive no principled basis for many of the plurality's asserted distinctions among the common-lawclaims, and I cannot believe that Congress intended to createsuch a hodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when itamended the pre-emption provision in 1970. Although theplurality acknowledges that \u00a7 5(b) fails to \u00aaindicate that anyfamiliar subdivision of common-law claims is or is not pre-empted,\u00ba ante, at 523, it ignores the simplest and most obvi- ous explanation for the statutory silence: that Congressnever intended to displace state common-law damagesclaims, much less to cull through them in the manner theplurality does today. I can only speculate as to the dif\u00aeculty505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 544 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Scalia, J. lower courts will encounter in attempting to implement today's decision. IV By \u00aending federal pre-emption of certain state common- law damages claims, the decision today eliminates a criticalcomponent of the States' traditional ability to protect thehealth and safety of their citizens. Yet such a radical re-adjustment of federal-state relations is warranted under this Court's precedents only if there is clear evidence that Con-gress intended that result. Because I believe that neitherversion of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and AdvertisingAct evidences such a clear congressional intent to pre-emptstate common-law damages actions, I respectfully dissentfrom Parts V and VI of Justice Stevens\u0092 opinion. Justice Scalia , with whom Justice Thomas joins, con- curring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. Today's decision announces what, on its face, is an extra- ordinary and unprecedented principle of federal statutoryconstruction: that express pre-emption provisions must beconstrued narrowly, \u00aain light of the presumption against thepre-emption of state police power regulations.\u00ba Ante, at 518. The life span of this new rule may have been blessedlybrief, inasmuch as the opinion that gives it birth in Part Iproceeds to ignore it in Part V , by adjudging at least someof the common-law tort claims at issue here pre-empted. Inmy view, there is no merit to this newly crafted doctrineof narrow construction. Under the Supremacy Clause, U. S.Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, our job is to interpret Congress'sdecrees of pre-emption neither narrowly nor broadly, but inaccordance with their apparent meaning. If we did that jobin the present case, we would \u00aend, under the 1965 Act, pre-emption of petitioner's failure-to-warn claims; PAGES OPINPGT 545 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. I The Court's threshold description of the law of pre- emption is accurate enough: Though we generally \u00aa `assum[e]that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to besuperseded by . . . Federal Act that [is] the clear andmanifest purpose of Congress,' \u00ba ante, at 516 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)), we have traditionally not thought that to require express statutorytext. Where state law is in actual con\u00afict with federal law,see, e. g., Paci\u00aec Gas & Elec. v.State Energy Resources Conservation and Develo pment Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 204 (1983), or where it \u00aastands as an obstacle to the accomplish-ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives ofCongress,\u00ba Hines v.Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), or even where the nature of Congress's regulation, or its scope,convinces us that \u00aaCongress left no room for the States tosupplement it,\u00ba Rice, supra, at 230, we have had no dif\u00aeculty declaring that state law must yield. The ultimate questionin each case, as we have framed the inquiry, is one of Con-gress's intent, as revealed by the text, structure, purposes,and subject matter of the statutes involved. See, e. g., Eng- lish v.General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 78\u00b179 (1990); Shaw v.Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 95 (1983). The Court goes beyond these traditional principles, how- ever, to announce two new ones. First, it says that expresspre-emption provisions must be given the narrowest possibleconstruction. This is in its view the consequence of ouroft-repeated assumption that, absent convincing evidence ofstatutory intent to pre-empt, \u00aa `the historic police powers ofthe States [are] not to be superseded,' \u00ba see ante, at 516. But it seems to me that assumption dissolves once there isconclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the expresswords of the statute itself, and the only remaining questionis what the scope of that pre-emption is meant to be. There- upon, I think, our responsibility is to apply to the text ordi-nary principles of statutory construction.505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 546 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Scalia, J. That is precisely what our express pre-emption cases have done. Less than a month ago, in Morales v.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374 (1992), we held that the Airline Deregulation Act's provision pre-empting state laws \u00aarelat-ing to [airline] rates, routes, or services,\u00ba 49 U. S. C. App.\u00a7 1305(a)(1), was broad enough to reach state fare advertisingregulations despite the availability of plausible limiting con-structions. We made no mention of any \u00aaplain-statement\u00barule, or rule of narrow construction, but applied the usual\u00aa`\u00aaassumption that the ordinary meaning of [the statu- tory] l anguage accurately expresses the legislative pur- pose. \u00ba'\u00ba Morales, supra, at 383 (quoting FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 57 (1990)) (emphasis added). And last Term, in Norfolk & Western R. Co. v.Train Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117 (1991), we interpreted an express pre-emptionprovision broadly despite the fact that a well-respectedcanon of statutory construction supported a narrower read-ing. See id., at 129; id., at 136 ( Stevens, J. , dissenting). We said not a word about a \u00aapresumption agains t... pre- emption,\u00ba ante, at 518, that was to be applied to construction of the text. In light of our w illing ness to \u00aend pre-emption in the ab- sence of any explicit statement of pre-emptive intent, the notion that such explicit statements, where they exist, aresubject to a \u00aaplain-statement\u00ba rule is more than somewhatodd. To be sure, our jurisprudence abounds with rules of\u00aaplain statement,\u00ba \u00aaclear statement,\u00ba and \u00aanarrow construc-tion\u00ba designed variously to ensure that, absent unambiguousevidence of Congress's intent, extraordinary constitutionalpowers are not invoked, or important constitutional protec-tions eliminated, or seemingly inequitable doctrines applied.See, e. g., United States v.Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538 (1980) (waivers of federal sovereign immunity must be \u00aaunequivo-cally expressed\u00ba); Will v.Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65 (1989) (clear statement required to compelStates to entertain damages suits against themselves in state505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 547 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 234, 243 (1985) (abrogation of state sovereign immunity must beexpressed \u00aain unmistakable language\u00ba). But none of those rules exists alongside a doctrine whereby the same result soprophylactically protected from careless explicit provisioncan be achieved by sheer implication, with no express state- ment of intent at all. That is the novel regime the Courtconstructs today. The results seem odder still when one takes into account the second new rule that the Court announces: \u00aaWhen Con-gress has considered the issue of pre-emption and has in- cluded in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly ad-dressing that issue ,...w e need only identify the domain expressly pre-empted by [that provision].\u00ba Ante, at 517. Once there is an express pre-emption provision, in otherwords, all doctrines of implied pre-emption are eliminated.This proposition may be correct insofar as implied \u00aa\u00aeeld\u00bapre-emption is concerned: The existence of an express pre-emption provision tends to contradict any inference thatCongress intended to occupy a \u00aeeld broader than the stat-ute's express language de\u00aenes. However, with regard toimplied \u00aacon\u00afict\u00ba pre-emption\u00d0 i. e., where state regulation actually con\u00aficts with federal law, or where state regulation\u00aastands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\u00baof Congress's purposes, Hines, supra, at 67\u00d0the Court's sec- ond new rule works mischief. If taken seriously, it wouldmean, for example, that if a federal consumer protection lawprovided that no state agency or court shall assert jurisdic-tion under state law over any workplace safety issue withrespect to which a federal standard is in effect, then a stateagency operating under a law dealing with a subject otherthan workplace safety ( e. g., consumer protection) could im- pose requirements entirely contrary to federal law\u00d0forbid-ding, for example, the use of certain safety equipment thatfederal law requires.

When this second novelty is combinedwith the \u00aerst, the result is extraordinary: The statute thatsays anything about pre-emption must say everyth ing; and it must do so with great exactitude, as any ambiguity con-cerning its scope will be read in favor of preserving statepower. If this is to be the law, surely only the most sportingof Congresses will dare to say anything about pre-emption. The proper rule of construction for express pre-emption provisions is, it seems to me, the one that is customary forstatutory provisions in general: Their language should begiven its ordinary meaning. FMC Corp. v.Holliday, supra, at 57; Shaw v.Delta Air Lines, 463 U. S., at 97. When this suggests that the pre-emption provision was intended tosweep broadly, our construction must sweep broadly as well.See, e. g., id., at 96\u00b197. And when it bespeaks a narrow scope of pre-emption, so must our judgment. See, e. g., Fort Halifax Packing Co. v.Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 7\u00b18 (1987). Apply- ing its niggardly rule of construction, the Court \u00aends (notsurprisingly) that none of petitioner's claims\u00d0common-lawfailure to warn, breach of express warranty, and intentionalfraud and misrepresentation\u00d0is pre-empted under \u00a7 5(b) ofthe 1965 Act. And save for the failure-to-warn claims, theCourt reaches the same result under \u00a7 5(b) of the 1969 Act.I think most of that is error. Applying ordinary principlesof statutory construction, I believe petitioner's failure-to-warn claims are pre-empted by the 1965 Act, and all hiscommon-law claims by the 1969 Act. II With much of what the plurality says in Part V of its opin- ion I agree\u00d0that \u00aathe language of the [1969] Act plainlyreaches beyond [positive] ante, at 521; that the general tort-law duties petitioner invokes against the ciga-rette companies can, as a general matter, impose \u00aarequire-ment[s] or prohibition[s]\u00ba within the meaning of \u00a7 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 549 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. 1969 Act, ibid.; and that the phrase \u00aaState law\u00ba as used in that provision embraces state common law, ante, at 523. I take issue with the plurality, however, on its applicationof these general principles to the present case. Its \u00aendingthat they produce only partial pre-emption of petitioner'scommon-law claims rests upon three misperceptions that Ishall discuss in turn, under headings indicating the errone-ously permitted claims to which they apply. A Pre-1969 Failure-to-Warn Claims According to the Court, 1\u00a7 5(b) of the 1965 Act \u00aais best read as having superseded only positive enactments by legisla-tures or administrative agencies that mandate particular warning labels.\u00ba Ante, at 518\u00b1519 (emphasis added). In essence, the Court reads \u00a7 5(b)'s critical language \u00aaNo state- ment relating to smoking and healt h...s h a l lb e required\u00ba to mean \u00aaNo particular statement relating to smoking and health shall be required.\u00ba The Court reasons that becausecommon-law duties do not require cigarette manufacturersto include any particular statement in their advertising, but only some statement warning of health risks, those duties survive the 1965 Act. I see no basis for this element of\u00aaparticularity.\u00ba To require a warning about cigarette healthrisks is to require a \u00aastatement relating to smoking andhealth.\u00ba If the \u00aapresumption agains t... pre-emption,\u00ba ante, at 518, requires us to import limiting language into the 1965 Act, I do not see why it does not require us to importsimilarly limiting language into the 1969 Act\u00d0so that a \u00aare-quirement . . . based on smoking and healt h...w i t h respect to advertising\u00ba means only a speci\u00aec requirement, and not just general, noncigarette-speci\u00aec duties imposed by tortlaw. The divergent treatment of the 1965 Act cannot be jus- 1The plurality is joined by Justices Blackmun, Kennedy, and Sou- ter in its analysis of the 1965 Act.505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 550 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Scalia, J. ti\u00aeed by the Act's statement of purposes, which, as the Court notes, expresses concern with \u00aadiverse, nonuniform, andconfusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations. \u00ba 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331(2) (emphasis added). That statement ofpurposes was left untouched by Congress in 1969, and thusshould be as restrictive of the scope of the later \u00a7 5(b) as theCourt believes it is of the scope of the earlier one. 2 To the extent petitioner's claims are premised speci\u00aecally on respondents' failure (during the period in which the 1965Act was in force) to include in their advertising any state- ment relating to smoking and health, I would \u00aend thoseclaims, no less than the similar post-1969 claims, pre-empted.In addition, for reasons I shall later explain, see Part III,infra, I would \u00aend pre-emption even of those claims based on respondents' failure to make health-related statements toconsumers outside their advertising. However, since \u00a7 5(b) of the 1965 Act enjoins only those laws that require \u00aastate- ment[s]\u00ba in cigarette advertising, those of petitioner's claimsthat, if accepted, would penalize statements voluntarily made by the cigarette companies must be deemed to survive.As these would appear to include petitioner's breach-of-express-warranty and intentional fraud and misrepresenta-tion claims, I concur in the Court's judgment in this respect. 2The Court apparently thinks that because \u00a7 4 of the Act, imposing the federal package-labeling requirement, \u00aaitself sets forth a particular state- ment,\u00ba ante, at 519, n. 16, \u00a7 5(b), the advertising pre-emption provision must be read to proscribe only those state laws that compel the use ofparticular statements in advertising. Besides being a complete non se- quitur, this reasoning proves too much: The similar prescription of a par- ticular warning in the 1969 Act would likewise require us to con\u00aene the pre-emptive scope of that later statute to speci\u00aec, prescriptive \u00aarequire-ment[s] or prohibition[s]\u00ba (which, I presume, would not include tort-lawobligations to warn consumers about product dangers). And under boththe 1965 and 1969 versions of the Act, the package-labeling pre-emptionprovision of \u00a7 5 (a), no less than the advertising pre-emption provision of \u00a75(b),would have to be limited to the prescription of particular language, leaving the States free to impose general health-labeling requirements.These results are obviously contrary to the Act's stated purposes.505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 551 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. B Post-1969 Breach-of-Express-Warranty Claims In the context of this case, petitioner's breach-of-express- warranty claim necessarily embodies an assertion that re-spondents' advertising and promotional materials madestatements to the effect that cigarette smoking is not un-healthy. Making such statements ci villy acti onable an advertising . based on smoking and health.\u00ba The plurality appearsto accept this, but \u00aends that liability for breach of expresswarranty is not \u00aaimposed under State law\u00ba within the mean-ing of \u00a7 5(b) of the 1969 Act. \u00aa[R]ather,\u00ba it says, the duty \u00aaisbest understood as undertaken by the manufacturer itself.\u00baAnte, at 526. I cannot agree. When liability attaches to a particular promise or repre- sentation, it attaches by law. For the making of a voluntary promise or representation, no less than for the commissionof an intentional tort, it is the background law against whichthe act occurs, and not the act itself, that supplies the ele-ment of legal obligation. See Home Building & Loan Assn. v.Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 429 (1934); N. J. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12A:2\u00b1313(1), 12A:2\u00b1714, and 12A:2\u00b1715 (West 1962) (pro-viding for enforcement of express warranties). Of course,New Jersey's law of express warranty attaches legal conse-quences to the cigarette manufacturer's voluntary conduct inmaking the warranty, and in that narrow sense, I suppose,the warranty obligation can be said to be \u00aaundertaken by themanufacturer.\u00ba But on that logic it could also be said thatthe duty to warn about the dangers of cigarettes is under-taken voluntarily by manufacturers when they choose to sellin New Jersey; or, more generally, that any legal duty im- posed on volitional behavior is not one imposed by law. The plurality cites no authority for its curious view, which is reason enough to doubt it. In addition, however, we re-jected this very argument last Term in Norfolk & Western505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 552 CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT of Scalia, J. R. Co. v.Train Dispatchers, where we construed a federal exemption \u00aafrom the antitrust laws and from all other law,\u00ba49 U. S. C. \u00a7 11341(a), to include an exemption from contractobligations. We observed, in a passage \u00afatly inconsistentwith the plurality's analysis today, that \u00aa[a] contract has nolegal force apart from the law that acknowledges its binding character. \u00ba 499 U. S., at 130. Cf. id.,at 139 ( Stevens, J. , dissenting). I would \u00aend petitioner's claim for breach ofexpress warranty pre-empted by \u00a7 5(b) of the 1969 Act. C Post-1969 Fraud and Misrepresentation Claims According to the plurality, at least one of petitioner's in- tentional fraud and misrepresentation claims survives \u00a7 5(b)of the 1969 Act because the common-law duty underlyingthat claim is not \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba within themeaning of the Act. See ante, at 528\u00b1529. If I understand the plurality's reasoning, it proceeds from the implicitassumption that only duties deriving from laws that arespeci\u00aecally directed to \u00aasmoking and health,\u00ba or that areuniquely crafted to address the relationship between ciga-rette companies and their putative victims, fall within \u00a7 5(b)of the Act, as amended. Given that New Jersey's tort-law\u00aaduty not to deceive,\u00ba ante, at 529, is a general one, applica- ble to all commercial actors and all kinds of commerce, itfollows from this assumption that \u00a7 5(b) does not pre-emptclaims based on breaches of that duty. This analysis is suspect, to begin with, because the plural- ity is unwilling to apply it consistently. As Justice Black- mun cogently explains, see ante, at 543 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), if New Jersey's common-lawduty to avoid false statements of material fact\u00d0as appliedto cigarette companies' behavior\u00d0is not \u00aabased on smok-ing and health,\u00ba the same must be said of New Jersey'scommon-law duty to warn about a product's dangers. Each duty transcends the relationship between the cigarette com-505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 553 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. panies and cigarette smokers; neither duty was speci\u00aecally crafted with an eye toward \u00aasmoking and health.\u00ba None ofthe arguments the plurality advances to support its distinc-tion between the two is persuasive. That Congress speci\u00ae-cally preserved, in both the 1965 and 1969 Acts, the FederalTrade Commission's authority to police deceptive advertisingpractices, see \u00a7 5(c) the 1965 Act; \u00a7 7(b) of the 1969 Act;ante, at 529, does not suggest that Congress intended compa- rable state authority to survive \u00a7 5(b). In fact, at least inthe 1965 Act (which generally excluded federal as well asstate regulation), the exemption suggested that \u00a7 5(b) was broad enough to reach laws governing fraud and misrepre-sentation. And it is not true that the States' laws governingfraud and misrepresentation in advertising impose identicallegal standards, whereas their laws \u00aaconcerning the warningnecessary to render a product `reasonably safe' \u00ba are quitediverse, ibid. The question whether an ad featuring a glam- orous, youthful smoker with pearly-white teeth is \u00aamisrepre-sentative\u00ba would almost certainly be answered differentlyfrom State to State. See ante, at 527 (discussing FTC's ini- tial cigarette advertising rules). Once one is forced to select a consistent methodology for evaluating whether a given legal duty is \u00aabased on smokingand health,\u00ba it becomes obvious that the methodology mustfocus not upon the ultimate source of the duty ( e. g., the com- mon law) but upon its proximate application. Use of the\u00aaultimate source\u00ba approach ( i. e., a legal duty is not \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba unless the law from which it derivesis directed only to smoking and health) would gut the stat-ute, inviting the very \u00aadiverse, nonuniform, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331(2). And the problem is not simplythe common law: Requirements could be imposed by stateexecutive agencies as well, so long as they were operatingunder a general statute authorizing their supervision of \u00aacommercial CIPOLLONE v.LIGGETT GROUP, INC. Opinion of Scalia, J. Jersey and many other States have such statutes already on the books. E. g., N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 56:8\u00b11 et seq. (West 1989); N. Y . Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 349 et seq. (McKinney 1988 and Supp. 1992); Texas Bus. & Com. Code Ann. \u00a7 17.01 et seq. (1987 and Supp. 1992). I would apply to all petitioner's claims what I have called a \u00aaproximate application\u00ba methodology for determining whether they invoke duties \u00aabased on smoking and health\u00ba\u00d0I would ask, that is, whether, whatever the source of theduty, it imposes an obligation in this case because of theeffect of smoking upon health. On that basis, I would \u00aendpetitioner's failure-to-warn and misrepresentation claimsboth pre-empted. III Finally, there is an additional \u00afaw in the plurality's opin- ion, a systemic one that even its otherwise correctdisposition of petitioner's post-1969 failure-to-warn \u00aarequire-ment[s] or prohibition[s ]...` with respect o...a d v ertising or promotion, ' \u00ba state-law claims premised on the failure to warn consumers \u00aathrough channels of communication otherthan advertising or promotion\u00ba are not covered. Ante, at 528 (emphasis added); see ante, at 524. This preserves not only the (somewhat fanciful) claims based on duties havingno relation to the advertising and promotion (one could imag-ine a law requiring manufacturers to disclose the health haz-ards of their products to a state public-health agency), butalso claims based on duties that can be complied with bytaking action either within the advertising and promotional realm or elsewhere. Thus, if\u00d0as appears to be the case in New Jersey\u00d0a State's common law requires manufacturersto advise consumers of their products' dangers, but the lawis indifferent as to how that requirement is met ( i. e., through \u00aaadvertising or promotion\u00ba or otherwise), the pluralitywould apparently be \u00aend as long505us2108K 07-16-96 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 555 Cite as: 505 U. S. 504 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. as the jury were instructed not to zero in on de\u00aeciencies in the manufacturers' advertising or promotion. I think that is inconsistent with the law of pre-emption. Advertising and promotion are the normal means by whicha manufacturer communicates required product warnings toprospective customers, and by far the most economicalmeans. It is implausible that Congress meant to save ciga-rette companies from being compelled to convey such datato consumers through that means, only to allow them to becompelled to do so through means more onerous still. Asa practical matter, such a \u00aatell-the-consumers-any-way-you-wish\u00ba law compels manufacturers to relinquish the advertis-ing and promotion immunity accorded them by the Act. Thetest for pre-emption in this setting should be one of practicalcompulsion, i. e., whether the law practically compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior that Congress hasbarred the States from prescribing directly. Cf., e. g., Ray v.Atlantic Rich\u00aeeld Co., 435 U. S. 151, 173, n. 25 (1978). Though the hypothetical law requiring disclosure to a stateregulatory agency would seem to survive this test, I wouldhave no dif\u00aeculty \u00aending that test met with respect to statelaws that require the cigarette companies to meet generalstandards of \u00aafair warning\u00ba regarding smoking and health. *** Like Justice Blackmun , \u00aaI can only speculate as to the dif\u00aeculty lower courts will encounter in attempting toimplement [today's] decision.\u00ba Ante, at 543\u00b1544 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Must expresspre-emption provisions really be given their narrowest rea-sonable construction (as the Court says in Part III), or needthey not (as the plurality does in Part V)? Are courts toignore all doctrines of implied pre-emption whenever thestatute at issue contains an express pre-emption provision,as the Court says today, or are they to continue to applythem, as we have in the past? 16:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT 556 Opinion of Scalia, J. does \u00aastate law\u00ba include legal duties imposed on voluntary acts (as we held last Term in Norfolk & Western R. Co. ), or does it not (as the plurality says today)? These and otherquestions raised by today's decision will \u00aell the lawbooks foryears to come. A disposition that raises more questionsthan it answers does not serve the country well.505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 557 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus CITY OF BURLINGTON v.DAGUE et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit No. 91\u00b1810. Argued April 21, 1992\u00d0Decided June 24, 1992 After ruling on the merits for respondents, the District Court determined that they were \u00aasubstantially prevailing\u00ba parties entitled to \u00aareason-able\u00ba attorney's fees under the attorney's fee provisions of the SolidWaste Disposal Act and the Clean Water Act. The District Court cal-culated the fee award by, inter alia, enhancing the \u00aalodestar\u00ba amount by 25% on the grounds that respondents' attorneys were retained on acontingent-fee basis and that without such enhancement respondentswould have faced substantial dif\u00aeculties in obtaining suitable counsel.The Court of Appeals af\u00aermed the fee award. Held: The fee-shifting statutes at issue do not permit enhancement of a fee award beyond the lodestar amount to re\u00afect the fact that a party'sattorneys were retained on a contingent-fee basis. In Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711 (Dela- ware Valley II), this Court addressed, but did not resolve, a question essentially identical to the one presented here. The position taken bythe principal opinion in that case, id.,at 723\u00b1727 (opinion of White, J. )\u00d0 that the typical federal fee-shifting statute does not permit an attor-ney's fee award to be enhanced on account of contingency\u00d0is adopted.The position advocated by Delaware Valley II 's concurrence, id.,at 731, 733 ( O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\u00d0 that contingency enhancement is appropriate in de\u00aened limited circum-stances\u00d0is rejected, since it is based upon propositions that are mutu-ally inconsistent as a practical matter; would make enhancement turnupon a circular test for a very large proportion of contingency-fee cases;and could not possibly achieve its supposed goal of mirroring marketincentives to attorneys to take cases. Beyond that approach, there isno other basis, fairly derivable from the fee-shifting statutes, by whichcontingency enhancement, if adopted, could be restricted to fewer thanall contingent-fee cases. Moreover, contingency enhancement is notcompatible with the fee-shifting statutes at issue, since such enhance-ment would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or anticipated time) incases where his client does notprevail; is unnecessary to the determina- tion of a reasonable fee and inconsistent with this Court's general rejec-tion of the contingent-fee model in favor of the lodestar model, see, e. g., Blanchard v.Bergeron, 489 U.

This case presents the question whether a court, in deter- mining an award of reasonable attorney's fees under \u00a7 7002(e)of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), 90 Stat. 2826, asamended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 6972(e), or \u00a7 505(d) of the Federal WaterPollution Control Act (Clean Water Act (CWA)), 86 Stat. 889,as amended, 33 U. S.

Although different fee-shifting statutes areinvolved, the question is essentially identical to the one weaddressed, but did not resolve, in Pennsylvania v.Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) . I Respondent Ernest Dague, Sr. (whom we will refer to in place of all the respondents), owns land in Vermont adjacent to a land\u00aell that was owned and operated by petitioner cityof Burlington. Represented by attorneys retained on acontingent-fee basis, he sued Burlington over its operationof the land\u00aell. The District Court ruled, inter alia, that Burlington had violated provisions of the SWDA and theCWA, and ordered Burlington to close the land\u00aell by January1, 1990. It also determined that Dague was a \u00aasubstantiallyprevailing party\u00ba entitled to an award of attorney's fees under the Acts, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 6972(e); 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1365(d).732 F. Supp. 458 (Vt. 1989). In calculating the attorney's fees award, the District Court \u00aerst found reasonable the \u00aegures advanced by Dague for hisattorneys' hourly rates and for the number of hours ex-pended by them, producing a resulting \u00aalodestar\u00ba attorney'sfee of $198,027.50.

S. 557 (1992) Opinion of the Court if it is payable without regard to the outcome of the suit; it is contingent if the obligation to pay depends on a par-ticular result's being obtained. Under the most commoncontingent-fee contract for litigation, the attorney receivesno payment for his services if his client loses. Under thisarrangement, the attorney bears a contingent risk of nonpay-ment that is the inverse of the case's prospects of success: ifhis client has an 80% chance of winning, the attorney's con-tingent risk is 20%. InDelaware Valley II, we reversed a judgment that had af\u00aermed enhancement of a fee award to re\u00afect the contin-gent risk of nonpayment. In the process, we addressedwhether the typical federal fee-shifting statute (there,\u00a7 304(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 7604(d)) permitsan attorney's fees award to be enhanced on account of con-tingency. In the principal opinion, Justice White , joined on this point by three other Justices, determined that suchenhancement is not permitted. 483 U. S., at 723\u00b1727. Jus- tice O\u0092Connor , in an opinion concurring in part and concur- ring in the judgment, concluded that no enhancement forcontingency is appropriate \u00aaunless the applicant can estab-lish that without an adjustment for risk the preva iling party would have faced substantial dif\u00aeculties in \u00aending counselin the local or other relevant market,\u00ba id.,at 733 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that any enhancement \u00aamustbe based on the difference in market treatment of contingentfee cases as a class, rather than on an assessment of the `riskiness' of any particular case,\u00ba id., at 731 (emphasis in original). Justice Blackmun 's dissenting opinion, joined by three other Justices, concluded that enhancement for con-tingency is always statutorily required. Id.,at 737\u00b1742, 754. We turn again to this same issue.

S. C. \u00a7 6972(e) (emphasis added); 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1365(d) (emphasis added). This language is similarto that of many other federal fee-shifting statutes, see, e. g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988, 2000e\u00b15(k), 7604(d); our case law constru-ing what is a \u00aareasonable\u00ba fee applies uniformly to all ofthem. Flight Attendants v.Zipes, 491 U. S. 754, 758, n. 2 (1989). The \u00aalodestar\u00ba \u00aegure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence. We haveestablished a \u00aastrong presumption\u00ba that the fee, Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565, and have placed upon the fee applicant who seeks more thanthat the burden of showing that \u00aasuch an adjustment isnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee.\u00ba Blum v.Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals held, and Dague argues here, that a\u00aareasonable\u00ba fee for attorneys who have been retained on acontingency-fee basis must go beyond the lodestar, to com-pensate for risk of loss and of consequent nonpayment. Fee-shifting statutes should be construed, he contends, to repli-cate the economic incentives that operate in the private legalmarket, where attorneys working on a contingency-fee basiscan be expected to charge some premium over their ordinaryhourly rates. Petitioner Burlington argues, by contrast,that the lodestar fee may not be enhanced for contingency. We note at the outset that an enhancement for contingency would likely duplicate in substantial part factors alreadysubsumed in the lodestar. The risk of loss in a particularcase (and, therefore, the attorney's contingent risk) is theproduct of two factors: (1) the legal and factual merits of theclaim, and (2) the dif\u00aeculty of establishing those merits.The second factor, however, is ordinarily re\u00afected in thelodestar\u00d0either in the higher number of hours expended toovercome the dif\u00aeculty, or in the higher hourly rate of theattorney skilled and experienced enough to do so. Blum,505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 563 Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992) Opinion of the Court supra, at 898\u00b1899. Taking account of it again through lode- star enhancement amounts to double counting. Delaware Valley II, 483 U. S., at 726\u00b1727 (plurality opinion). The \u00aerst factor (relative merits of the claim) is not re- \u00afected in the lodestar, but there are good reasons why itshould play no part in the calculation of the award. It is, ofcourse, a factor that always exists (no claim has a 100% chance of success), so that computation of the lodestar wouldnever end the court's cases. Blackmun, J. , dissenting). Moreover, the conse- quence of awarding contingency enhancement to take ac- count of this \u00aamerits\u00ba factor would be to provide attorneyswith the same incentive to bring relatively meritless claimsas relatively meritorious ones. Assume, for example, twoclaims, one with underlying merit of 20%, the other of 80%.Absent any contingency enhancement, a contingent-fee at-torney would prefer to take the latter, since he is four timesmore likely to be paid. But with a contingency enhance-ment, this preference will disappear: the enhancement forthe 20% claim would be a multiplier of 5 (100/20), which isquadruple the 1.25 multiplier (100/80) that would attach tothe 80% claim. Thus, enhancement for the contingency riskposed by each case would encourage meritorious claims tobe brought, but only at the social cost of indiscriminatelyencouraging nonmeritorious claims to be brought as well.We think that an unlikely objective of the \u00aareasonable fees\u00baprovisions. \u00aaThese statutes were not designed as a formof economic relief to improve the \u00aenancial lot of lawyers.\u00baDelaware Valley I, 478 U. S., at 565. Instead of enhancement based upon the contingency risk posed by each case, Dague urges that we adopt the approachset forth in the Delaware Valley II concurrence. We decline to do so, \u00aerst and foremost because we do not see how it canintelligibly be applied. On the one hand, it would requirethe party seeking contingency enhancement to \u00aaestablishthat without the adjustment for risk [he] 20:05:24 PAGES of the Court substantial dif\u00aeculties in \u00aending counsel in the local or other relevant market.' \u00ba 483 U. S., at 733. On the other hand,it would forbid enhancement based \u00aaon an assessment ofthe `riskiness' of any particular case.\u00ba Id., at 731; see id., at 734 (no enhancement \u00aabased on `legal' risks or risks pecu-liar to the case\u00ba). But since the predominant reason that acontingent-fee claimant has dif\u00aeculty \u00aending counsel in anylegal market where the winner's attorney's fees will be paidby the loser is that attorneys view his case as too risky(i. e., too unlikely to succeed), these two propositions, as a practical matter, collide. See King v.Palmer, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 362, 371, 950 F. 2d 771, 780 (1991) (en banc), cert.pending sub nom. King v.Ridley, No. 91\u00b11370. A second dif\u00aeculty with the approach taken by the concur- rence in Delaware Valley II is that it would base the contin- gency enhancement on \u00aathe difference in market treatmentof contingent fee cases as a class. \u00ba 483 U. S., at 731 (empha- sis in original). To begin with, for a very large proportionof contingency-fee cases\u00d0those seeking not monetary dam-ages but injunctive or other equitable relief\u00d0there is no\u00aamarket treatment.\u00ba Such cases scarcely exist, except tothe extent Congress has created an arti\u00aecial \u00aamarket\u00ba forthem by fee shifting\u00d0and looking to that \u00aamarket\u00ba for the meaning of fee shifting is obviously circular. Our decreeswould follow the \u00aamarket,\u00ba which in turn is based on ourdecrees. See King v.Palmer, 285 U. S. App. D. C. 68, 76, 906 F. 2d 762, 770 (1990) (W illiams, J., concurring) (\u00aaI see the judicial judgment as de\u00aening the market, not vice versa\u00ba),vacated, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 362, 950 F. 2d 771 (1991), cert.pending sub nom. King v.Ridley, No. 91\u00b11370. But even apart from that dif\u00aeculty, any approach that applies uniformtreatment to the entire class of contingent-fee cases, or toany conceivable subject-matter-based subclass, cannot possi-bly achieve the supposed goal of mirroring market incen-tives. As discussed above, the contingent risk of a case (andhence the dif\u00aeculty of getting contingent-fee 565 Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992) Opinion of the Court it) depends principally upon its particular merits. Contin- gency enhancement calculated on any class-wide basis, therefore, guarantees at best (leaving aside the double- counting problem described earlier) that those cases withinthe class that have the class-average chance of success willbe compensated according to what the \u00aamarket\u00ba requires toproduce the services, and that all cases having above-class- average chance of success will be overcompensated. Looking beyond the Delaware Valley II concurrence's ap- proach, we perceive no other basis, fairly derivable from thefee-shifting statutes, by which contingency enhancement, ifadopted, could be restricted to fewer than all contingent-feecases. And we see a number of reasons for concluding thatno contingency enhancement whatever is compatible withthe fee-shifting statutes at issue. First, just as the statu-tory language limiting fees to preva iling (or substantially prevailing) parties bars a preva iling plaintiff from recovering fees relating to claims on which he lost, Hensley v.Ecker- hart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983), so should it bar a preva iling plain- tiff from recovering for the risk of loss. See Delaware Val- ley II, supra, at 719\u00b1720, 724\u00b1725 (principal opinion). An attorney operating on a contingency-fee basis pools the riskspresented by his various cases: cases that turn out to besuccessful pay for the time he gambled on those that did not.To award a contingency enhancement under a fee-shiftingstatute would in effect pay for the attorney's time (or antici-pated time) in cases where his client does notprevail. Second, both before and since Delaware Valley II, \u00aawe have generally turned away from the contingent-feemodel\u00ba\u00d0which would make the fee award a percentage ofthe value of the relief awarded in the primary action*\u00d0\u00aato *Contrary to Justice Blackmun 's understanding, post, at 572, there is no reason in theory why the contingent-fee model could not apply to reliefother than damages; where injunctive relief is obtained, for example, thefee award would simply be a percentage of the value of the injunctiverelief. There would be, to be sure, severe problems of administration in505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 566 BURLINGTON Court the lodestar model.\u00ba Venegas v.Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 87 (1990). We have done so, it must be noted, even though thelodestar model often (perhaps, generally) results in a largerfee award than the contingent-fee model. See, e. g., Report of the Federal Courts Study Committee 104 (Apr. 2, 1990)(lodestar method may \u00aagive lawyers incentives to run uphours unnecessarily, which can lead to overcompensation\u00ba).For example, in Blanchard v.Bergeron, 489 U. S. 87 (1989), we held that the lodestar governed, even though it produceda fee that substantially exceeded the amount provided in thecontingent-fee agreement between plaintiff and his counsel(which was self-evidently an amount adequate to attract theneeded legal services). Id., at 96. Contingency enhance- ment is a feature inherent in the contingent-fee model (sinceattorneys factor in the particular risks of a case in negotiat-ing their fee and in deciding whether to accept the case). Toengraft this feature onto the lodestar model would be to con-coct a hybrid scheme that resorts to the contingent-fee modelto increase a fee award but not to reduce it. Contingencyenhancement is therefore not consistent with our general re-jection of the contingent-fee model for fee awards, nor is itnecessary to the determination of a reasonable fee. And \u00aenally, the interest in ready administrability that has underlain our adoption of the lodestar approach, see, e. g., Hensley, 461 U. S., at 433, and the related interest in avoiding burdensome satellite litigation (the fee application \u00aashouldnot result in a second major litigation,\u00ba id.,at 437), counsel strongly against adoption of contingency enhancement. Con-tingency enhancement would make the setting of fees morecomplex and arbitrary, hence more unpredictable, and hencemore litigable. It is neither necessary nor even possible forapplication of the fee-shifting statutes to mimic the intrica- determining the value of injunctive relief, but such problems simply high- light why we have rejected the contingent-fee model in favor of the lode-star model.505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 567 Cite 557 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting cies of the fee-paying market in every respect.

S., at 715\u00b1727, we hold that enhancement for contingency is not permitted under the fee-shifting statutes at issue. We reverse the Court of Appeals'judgment insofar as it af\u00aermed the 25% enhancement of thelodestar. It is so ordered. Justice Blackmun , with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenting. In language typical of most federal fee-shifting provisions, the statutes involved in this case authorize courts to awardthe prevailing party a \u00aareasonable\u00ba attorney's fee. 1Two principles, in my view, require the conclusion that the \u00aaen-hanced\u00ba fee awarded to respondents was reasonable. First,this Court consistently has recognized that a \u00aareasonable\u00bafee is to be a \u00aafully compensatory fee,\u00ba Hensley v.Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983), and is to be \u00aacalculated on the basisof rates and practices preva iling in the relevant market.\u00ba Missouri v.Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 286 (1989). Second, it is a fact of the market that an attorney who is paid only whenhis client prevails will tend to charge a higher fee than onewho is paid regardless of outcome, 2and relevant profes- sional standards long have recognized that this practice isreasonable. 3 1See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1365(d) (Clean Water Act); 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 6972(e) (Solid Waste Disposal Act). 2See, e. g., R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law \u00a7 21.9, pp. 534\u00b1535 (3d ed. 1986). 3See Canons of Ethics \u00a7 12, 33 A. B. A. Rep. 575, 578 (1908); Model Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2\u00b1106(B)(8) (1980); ABA Model Rulesof BURLINGTON v.DAGUE Blackmun, J., dissenting The Court does not deny these principles. It simply re- fuses to draw the conclusion that follows ineluctably: If astatutory fee consistent with market practices is \u00aareason-able,\u00ba and if in the private market an attorney who assumesthe risk of nonpayment can expect additional compensation,then it follows that a statutory fee may include additionalcompensation for contingency and still qualify as reasonable.The Court's decision to the contrary violates the principleswe have applied consistently in prior cases and will seriouslyweaken the enforcement of those statutes for which Con-gress has authorized fee awards\u00d0notably, many of our Na-tion's civil rights laws and environmental laws. I Congress' purpose in adopting fee-shifting provisions was to strengthen the enforcement of selected federal laws byensuring that private persons seeking to enforce those lawscould retain competent counsel. See S. Rep. No. 94\u00b11011,p. 6 (1976). In particular, federal fee-shifting provisionshave been designed to address two related dif\u00aeculties thatotherwise would prevent private persons from obtainingcounsel. First, many potential plaintiffs lack suf\u00aecient re-sources to hire attorneys. See H. R. Rep. No. 94\u00b11558, p. 1(1976); S. Rep. No. 94\u00b11011, at 2. Second, many of the stat-utes to which Congress attached fee-shifting provisionstypically will generate either no damages or only small re-coveries; accordingly, plaintiffs bringing cases under thesestatutes cannot offer attorneys a share of a recovery suf\u00ae-cient to justify a standard contingent-fee arrangement. SeePennsylvania v.Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air (Delaware Valley II), 483 U. S. 711, 749 (1987) (dissenting opinion); H. R. Rep. No. 94\u00b11558, at 9. The strat-egy of the fee-shifting provisions is to attract competentcounsel to selected federal cases by ensuring that if theyprevail, counsel will receive fees commensurable with whatthey could obtain in other litigation. If federal fee-bearing505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 569 Cite as: 505 U. S. 557 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting litigation is less remunerative than private litigation, then the only attorneys who will take such cases will be underem-ployed lawyers\u00d0who likely will be less competent than thesuccessful, busy lawyers who would shun federal fee-bearinglitigation\u00d0and public interest lawyers who, by any measure,are insuf\u00aeciently numerous to handle all the cases for whichother competent attorneys cannot be found. See Delaware Valley II, 483 U. S., at 742\u00b1743 (dissenting opinion). In many cases brought under federal statutes that author- ize fee shifting, plaintiffs will be unable to ensure that theirattorneys will be compensated for the risk that they might not prevail. This will be true in precisely those situationstargeted by the fee-shifting statutes\u00d0where plaintiffs lacksuf\u00aecient funds to hire an attorney on a win-or-lose basis andwhere potential damages awards are insuf\u00aecient to justify astandard contingent-fee arrangement. In these situations,unless the fee-shifting statutes are construed to compensateattorneys for the risk of nonpayment associated with loss,the expected return from cases brought under federal fee-shifting provisions will be less than could be obtained inotherwise comparable private litigation offering guaranteed,win-or-lose compensation. Prudent counsel, under theseconditions, would tend to avoid federal fee-bearing claims infavor of private litigation, even in the very situations forwhich the attorney's fee statutes were designed. This willbe true even if the fee-bearing claim is more likely meritori-ous than the competing private claim. InDelaware Valley II, \u00aeve Justices of this Court con- cluded that for these reasons the broad statutory term \u00aarea-sonable attorney's fee\u00ba must be construed to permit, in somecircumstances, compensation above the hourly win-or-loserate generally borrowed to compute the lodestar fee. See483 at 731, in judgment); id.,at 735 (dissenting opinion). Together with the three Justices who joined my dissentingopinion in that case, I would have allowed enhancement505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 570 BURLINGTON v.DAGUE Blackmun, J., dissenting where, and to the extent that, the attorney's compensation is contingent upon preva iling and receiving a statutory award. I indicated that if, by contrast, the attorney andclient have been able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment\u00d0either in full, by agreeing to win-or-lose compensation or toa contingent share of a substantial damages recovery, orin part, by arranging for partial payment\u00d0then to that ex-tent enhancement should be unavailable. Id.,at 748\u00b1749. I made clear that the \u00aarisk\u00ba for which enhancement might beavailable is not the particular factual and legal riskiness of anindividual case, but the risk of nonpayment associated withcontingent cases considered as a class. Id.,at 745\u00b1747, 752. Congress, I concluded, did not intend to prohibit districtcourts from considering contingency in calculating a \u00aareason-able\u00ba attorney's fee. 4 Justice O\u0092Connor 's concurring opinion agreed that \u00aaCon- gress did not intend to foreclose consideration of contingencyin a reasonable fee,\u00ba id.,at 731, and that \u00aacompensa- tion for contingency must be based on the difference in mar-ket treatment of contingent-fee cases as a class, rather than on an assessment of the `riskiness' of any particular case\u00ba(emphasis in original). Ibid. As I understand her opinion, 4A number of bills introduced in Congress would have done just this, by prohibiting \u00aabonuses and multipliers\u00ba where a suit is against the UnitedStates, a State, or a local government. These bills failed to receive con-gressional approval. See Delaware Valley II, 483 U. S., at 739, n. 3 (dis- senting opinion). Moreover, in some instances Congress explicitly has prohibited enhance- ments, as in the 1986 amendments to the Education of the HandicappedAct. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1415(e)(4)(C) (\u00aa[n]o bonus or multiplier may be usedin calculating the fees awarded under this subsection\u00ba). Congress' ex-press prohibition on enhancement in this statute suggests that it did notunderstand the standard fee-shifting language used elsewhere to bar en-hancement. Cf. West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 92\u00b197 (1991) (relying, in part, on express authorization of expert-witness fees in subsequently passed fee-shifting statutes to infer that suchfees could not have been included in unsupplemented references to \u00aaattor-ney's fees\u00ba).505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES as: S. 557 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting Justice O\u0092Connor further agreed that a court considering an enhancement must determine whether and to what extentthe attorney's compensation was contingent, as well aswhether and to what extent that contingency was, or couldhave been, mitigated. Her concurrence added, however, anadditional inquiry designed to make the market-based ap-proach \u00aanot merely justi\u00aeable in theory but also objectiveand nonarbitrary in practice.\u00ba Id., at 732. She suggested two additional \u00aaconstraints on a court's discretion\u00ba in deter-mining whether, and how much, enhancement is warranted.First, \u00aadistrict courts and courts of appeals should treat adetermination of how a particular market compensates forcontingency as contro lling future cases involving the same market,\u00ba and varying rates of enhancement among marketsmust be justi\u00aeable by reference to real differences in thosemarkets. Id.,at 733. Second, the applicant bears the bur- den of demonstrating that without an adjustment for risk\u00aathe prevailing party would have faced substantial dif\u00aecul- ties in \u00aending counsel in the local or other relevant market.\u00baIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). II After criticizing at some length an approach it admits re- spondents and their amici do not advocate, see ante, at 563\u00b1 564, and after rejecting the approach of the Delaware Val- ley II concurrence, see ante, at 564\u00b1565, the Court states that it \u00aasee[s] a number of reasons for concluding that nocontingency enhancement whatever is compatible with thefee-shifting statutes at issue.\u00ba Ante, at 565. I do not \u00aend any of these arguments persuasive. The Court argues, \u00aerst, that \u00aa[a]n attorney operating on a contingency-fee basis pools the risks presented by his vari-ous cases\u00ba and uses the cases that were successful to subsi-dize those that were not. Ibid. \u00aaTo award a contingency enhancement under a fee-shifting v.DAGUE Blackmun, J., dissenting limitation, by allowing the attorney to recover fees for cases in which his client does not prevail. Ibid. What the words \u00aain effect\u00ba conceal, however, is the Court's inattention to thelanguage of the statutes: The provisions at issue in this case,like fee-shifting provisions generally, authorize fee awardsto prevailing parties, not their attorneys. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7 1365(d); 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 6972(e); see also Venegas v.Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 87 (1990). Respondents simply do not advocateawarding fees to any party who has not prevailed. More-over, the Court's reliance on the \u00aapreva iling party\u00ba limitation somewhat misleading: the Court's real objection to contin- gency enhancement is that the amount of an enhanced award would be excessive, not that parties receiving enhanced feeawards are not preva iling par ties entitled to an award. In prior cases the Court has been careful to distinguish be-tween these two issues. See, e. g., Hensley v.Eckerhart, 461 U. S., at 433 (The only \u00aabrings the plaintiff . . . across the statutory threshold. Itremains for the district court to determine what fee is`reasonable' \u00ba). Second, the Court suggests that \u00aaboth before and since Delaware Valley II, `we have generally turned away from the contingent-fee model'\u00d0which would make the fee awarda percentage of the value of the relief awarded in the pri-mary action\u00d0`to the lodestar model.' \u00ba Ante, at 565\u00b1566 (footnote omitted), quoting Venegas v.Mitchell, 495 U. S., at 87. This argument simply plays on two meanings of\u00aacontingency.\u00ba Most assuredly, respondents\u00d0who receivedno damages for their fee-bearing claims\u00d0do not advocate\u00aamak[ing] the fee award a percentage\u00ba of that amount.Rather, they argue that the lodestar \u00aegure must be enhanced because their attorneys' compensation was contingent onprevailing, and because their attorneys could not otherwise be compensated for assuming the risk of nonpayment. Third, the Court suggests that allowing for contingency enhancement \u00aawould make the setting of fees more complex505us2109K 07-09-96 20:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 573 Cite as: 557 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting and arbitrary\u00ba and would likely lead to \u00aaburdensome satellite litigation\u00ba that this Court has said should be avoided. Ante, at 566. The present case is an odd one in which to makethis point: The issue of enhancement hardly occupied centerstage in the fees portion of this litigation, and it became atime-consuming matter only after the Court granted cer-tiorari, limited to this question alone. 5Moreover, if Jus- tice O\u0092Connor 's standard were adopted, the matter of the amount by which fees should be increased would quickly be-come settled in the various district courts and courts ofappeals for the different kinds of federal litigation. Andin any event, speculation that enhancement determinationswould be \u00aaburdensome\u00ba does not speak to the issue whetherthey are required by the fee-shifting statutes. The \u00aenal objection to be considered is the Court's conten- tion that any approach that treats contingent-fee cases as aclass is doomed to failure. The Court's argument on thisscore has two parts. First, the Court opines that \u00aafor a verylarge proportion of contingency-fee cases\u00ba\u00d0cases in is sought\u00d0\u00aathere is no `market treat-ment,' \u00ba except insofar as Congress has created an \u00aaarti\u00aecial\u00bamarket with the fee-shifting statutes themselves. It is cir- cular, the Court contends, to \u00aaloo[k] to that `market' for the meaning of fee-shifting.\u00ba Ante, at 564. And even leaving that dif\u00aeculty aside, the Court continues, the real \u00aarisk\u00ba towhich lawyers respond is the riskiness of particular cases.Because under a class-based contingency enhancement sys-tem the same enhancement will be awarded whether the 5It is fair to say that petitioner's attention was directed almost exclu- sively toward the merits issues, both in the lower courts and in its petitionfor certiorari. While petitioner sharply contested respondents' entitle- ment to an award and objected to the amount of the lodestar, its oppositionto enhancement occupies only a single page of its memorandum in opposi-tion to the motion for fees and costs. See App. 224\u00b1225. Only a littlemore than 1 page of the 30-page petition for certiorari is devoted to theissue of contingency enhancement. See Pet. PAGES 80% or 20%, \u00aa all cases having above-class-average chance of success will be overcompen-sated\u00ba (emphasis in original). Ante, at 565. Both parts of this argument are mistaken. The circular- ity objection overlooks the fact that even under the Court'sunenhanced lodestar approach, the district court must \u00aend arelevant private market from which to select a fee. TheCourt offers no reason why this market disappears onlywhen the inquiry turns to enhancement. The second part ofthe Court's argument is mistaken so far as it assumes theonly relevant incentive to which attorneys respond is the riskof losing particular cases. As explained above, a proper sys-tem of contingency enhancement addresses a different kindof incentive: the common incentive of all lawyers to avoidany fee-bearing claim in which the plaintiff cannot guarantee the lawyer's compensation if he does not prevail. Because,as the Court observes, \u00aano claim has a 100% chance of suc-cess,\u00ba ante, at 563, any such case under a pure lodestar sys- tem will offer a lower prospective return per hour than onein which the lawyer will be paid at the same lodestar rate,win or lose. Even the least meritorious case in which the attorney is guaranteed compensation whether he wins orloses will be economically preferable to the most meritorious fee-bearing claim in which the attorney will be paid only ifhe prevails, so long as the cases require the same amount oftime. Yet as noted above, this latter kind of case\u00d0in whichpotential plaintiffs can neither afford to hire attorneys on astraight hourly basis nor offer a percentage of a substantialdamages recovery\u00d0is exactly the kind of case for which thefee-shifting statutes were designed. III Preventing attorneys who bring actions under fee-shifting statutes from receiving fully compensatory fees will harmfar more than the legal profession.

The amicus briefs \u00aeled in this case make clear that we can expect many merito-rious actions will not be \u00aeled, or, if \u00aeled, will be prosecutedby less experienced and able counsel. 6Today's decision weakens the protections we afford important federal rights. I dissent. Justice O\u0092Connor , dissenting. I continue to be of the view that in certain circumstances a \u00aareasonable\u00ba attorney's fee should not be computed by thepurely retrospective lodestar \u00aegure, but also must incorpo-rate a reasonable incentive to an attorney contemplatingwhether or not to take a case in the \u00aerst place. See Penn- sylvania v.Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711, 731\u00b1734 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) (O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg- ment). As Justice Blackmun cogently explains, when an attorney must choose between two cases\u00d0one with a clientwho will pay the attorney's fees win or lose and the otherwho can only promise the statutory compensation if the caseis successful\u00d0the attorney will choose the fee-paying client,unless the contingency client can promise an enhancementof suf\u00aecient magnitude to justify the extra risk of nonpay-ment. Ante, at 568\u00b1569. Thus, a reasonable fee should be one that would \u00aaattract competent counsel,\u00ba Delaware Val- ley II, supra, at 733 ( O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and in some markets this must in-clude the assurance of a contingency enhancement if theplaintiff should prevail. I therefore dissent from the Court'sholding that a \u00aareasonable\u00ba attorney's fee can never includean enhancement for cases taken on contingency. 6See Brief for Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law et al. asAmici Curiae 16\u00b122; Brief for Alabama Employment 576 BURLINGTON v.DAGUE O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting In my view the promised enhancement should be \u00aabased on the difference in market treatment of contingent fee casesas a class, rather than on an assessment of the `riskiness' ofany particular case.\u00ba 483 U. S., at 731 (emphasis omitted).AsJustice Blackmun has shown, the Court's reasons for rejecting a market-based approach do not stand up to scru-tiny. Ante, at 574. Admittedly, the courts called upon to determine the enhancements appropriate for variousmarkets would be required to make economic calculationsbased on less-than-perfect data. Yet that is also the case,for example, in inverse condemnation and antitrust cases, and the Court has never suggested that the dif\u00aeculty ofthe task or possible inexactitude of the result justi\u00aees forgo-ing those calculations altogether. As Justice Blackmun notes, these initial hurdles would be overcome as the en-hancements appropriate to various markets became settledin the district courts and courts of appeals. Ante, at 573. In this case, the District Court determined that a 25% con- tingency enhancement was appropriate by reliance on thelikelihood of success in the individual case. App. to Pet. forCert. 132\u00b1133. The Court of Appeals af\u00aermed on the basisof its holding in Friends of the Earth v.Eastman Kodak Co., 834 F. 2d 295 (CA2 1987), which asks simply whether, with-out the possibility of a fee enhancement, the preva iling party would not have been able to obtain competent counsel. 935F. 2d 1343, 1360 (CA2 1991) (citing Friends of the Earth, supra ). Although I believe that inquiry is part of the con- tingency enhancement determination, see Delaware Valley II, supra, at 733 ( O\u0092Connor, J., concurring in part and con- curring in judgment), I also believe that it was error to basethe degree of enhancement on case-speci\u00aec factors. BecauseI can \u00aend no market-speci\u00aec support for the enhance-ment \u00aegure in the af\u00aedavits submitted by respondents insupport of the fee request, I would vacate the judgmentaf\u00aerming the fee award and remand for a market-based as-sessment of a suitable enhancement for contingency.505us2110z 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 577 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus LEE et al. v.WEISMAN, personally and as next friend of WEISMAN certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit No. 90\u00b11014. Argued November 6, 1991\u00d0Decided June 24, 1992 Principals of public middle and high schools in Providence, Rhode Island, are permitted to invite members of the clergy to give invocations andbenedictions at their schools' graduation ceremonies. Petitioner Lee, amiddle school principal, invited a rabbi to offer such prayers at the grad-uation ceremony for Deborah Weisman's class, gave the rabbi a pam-phlet containing guidelines for the composition of public prayers at civicceremonies, and advised him that the prayers should be nonsectarian.Shortly before the ceremony, the District Court denied the motion ofrespondent Weisman, Deborah's father, for a temporary restrainingorder to prohibit school of\u00aecials from including the prayers in the cere-mony. Deborah and her family attended the ceremony, and the prayerswere recited. Subsequently, Weisman sought a permanent injunctionbarring Lee and other petitioners, various Providence public schoolof\u00aecials, from inviting clergy to deliver invocations and benedictionsat future graduations. It appears likely that such prayers will be con- ducted at Deborah's high school graduation. The District Court en-joined petitioners from continuing the practice at issue on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.The Court of Appeals af\u00aermed. Held: Including clergy who offer prayers as part of an of\u00aecial public school graduation ceremony is forbidden by the Establishment Clause.Pp. 586\u00b1599. (a) This Court need not revisit the questions of the de\u00aenition and scope of the principles governing the extent of permitted accommoda-tion by the State for its citizens' religious beliefs and practices, for thecontrolling precedents as they relate to prayer and religious exercise inprimary and secondary public schools compel the holding here. Thus,the Court will not reconsider its decision in Lemon v.Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602. The principle that government may accommodate the freeexercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations im-posed by the Establishment Clause, which guarantees at a minimumthat a government may not coerce anyone to support or participate inreligion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which \u00aaestablishes a505us2110z 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 578 LEE v.WEISMAN Syllabus [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.\u00ba Lynch v.Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 678. Pp. 586\u00b1587. (b) State of\u00aecials here direct the performance of a formal religious exercise at secondary schools' promotional and graduation ceremonies.Lee's decision that prayers should be given and his selection of thereligious participant are choices attributable to the State. Moreover,through the pamphlet and his advice that the prayers be nonsectarian,he directed and controlled the prayers' content. That the directionsmay have been given in a good-faith attempt to make the prayers ac-ceptable to most persons does not resolve the dilemma caused by theschool's involvement, since the government may not establish an of\u00aecialor civic religion as a means of avoiding the establishment of a religionwith more speci\u00aec creeds. Pp. 587\u00b1590. (c) The Establishment Clause was inspired by the lesson that in the hands of government what might begin as a tolerant expression of reli-gious views may end in a policy to indoctrinate and coerce. Prayerexercises in elementary and secondary schools carry a particular risk ofindirect coercion. Engel v.Vitale, 370 U. S. 421; School Dist. of Abing- ton v.Schempp, 374 U. S. 203. The school district's supervision and control of a high school graduation ceremony places subtle and indirectpublic and peer pressure on attending students to stand as a group ormaintain respectful silence during the invocation and benediction. Areasonable dissenter of high school age could believe that standing orremaining silent signi\u00aeed her own participation in, or approval of, thegroup exercise, rather than her respect for it. And the State may notplace the student dissenter in the dilemma of participating or protesting.Since adolescents are often susceptible to peer pressure, especially inmatters of social convention, the State may no more use social pressureto enforce orthodoxy than it may use direct means. The embarrass-ment and intrusion of the religious exercise cannot be refuted by ar-guing that the prayers are of a de minimis character, since that is an affront to the rabbi and those for whom the prayers have meaning, andsince any intrusion was both real and a violation of the objectors' rights. Pp. 590\u00b1594. (d) Petitioners' argument that the option of not attending the cere- mony excuses any inducement or coercion in the ceremony itself is re-jected. In this society, high school graduation is one of life's most sig-ni\u00aecant occasions, and a student is not free to absent herself from theexercise in any real sense of the term \u00aavoluntary.\u00ba Also not dispositiveis the contention that prayers are an essential part of these ceremoniesbecause for many persons the occasion would lack meaning without therecognition that human achievements cannot be understood apart fromtheir spiritual essence. This position fails to acknowledge that what505us2110z 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 579 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Syllabus for many was a spiritual imperative was for the Weismans religious conformance compelled by the State. It also gives insuf\u00aecient recogni-tion to the real con\u00afict of conscience faced by a student who would haveto choose whether to miss graduation or conform to the state-sponsoredpractice, in an environment where the risk of compulsion is especiallyhigh. Pp. 594\u00b1596. (e) Inherent differences between the public school system and a ses- sion of a state legislature distinguish this case from Marsh v.Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, which condoned a prayer exercise. The atmosphere at astate legislature's opening, where adults are free to enter and leave withlittle comment and for any number of reasons, cannot compare with theconstraining potential of the one school event most important for thestudent to attend.

S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court I A Deborah Weisman graduated from Nathan Bishop Middle School, a public school in Providence, at a formal ceremonyin June 1989. She was about 14 years old. For many yearsit has been the policy of the Providence School Committeeand the Superintendent of Schools to permit principals toinvite members of the clergy to give invocations and benedic-tions at middle school and high school graduations. Many,but not all, of the principals elected to include prayers aspart of the graduation ceremonies. Acting for himself andhis daughter, Deborah's father, Daniel Weisman, objected toany prayers at Deborah's middle school graduation, but to noavail. The school principal, petitioner Robert E. Lee, in-vited a rabbi to deliver prayers at the graduation exercisesfor Deborah's class. Rabbi Leslie Gutterman, of the TempleBeth El in Providence, accepted. It has been the custom of Providence school of\u00aecials to provide invited clergy with a pamphlet entitled \u00aaGuidelinesfor Civic Occasions,\u00ba prepared by the National Conferenceof Christians and Jews. The Guidelines recommend thatpublic prayers at nonsectarian civic ceremonies be composedwith \u00aainclusiveness and sensitivity,\u00ba though they acknowl-edge that \u00aa[p]rayer of any kind may be inappropriate onsome civic occasions.\u00ba App. 20\u00b121. The principal gaveRabbi Gutterman the pamphlet before the graduation and advised him the invocation and benediction should be nonsec-tarian. Agreed Statement of Facts \u00b6 17, id.,at 13.

S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court The record in this case is sparse in many respects, and we are unfamiliar with any \u00aexed custom or practice at middleschool graduations, referred to by the school district as \u00aapro-motional exercises.\u00ba We are not so constrained with refer-ence to high schools, however. High school graduations aresuch an integral part of American cultural life that we canwith con\u00aedence describe their customary features, con\u00aermedby aspects of the record and by the parties' representationsat oral argument. In the Providence school system, mosthigh school graduation ceremonies are conducted away fromthe school, while most middle school ceremonies are held on school premises. Classical High School, which Deborah nowattends, has conducted its graduation ceremonies on schoolpremises. Agreed Statement of Facts \u00b6 37, id.,at 17. The parties stipulate that attendance at graduation ceremonies isvoluntary. Agreed Statement of Facts \u00b6 41, id.,at 18. The graduating students enter as a group in a processional, sub-ject to the direction of teachers and school of\u00aecials, and sittogether, apart from their families. We assume the clergy'sparticipation in any high school graduation exercise wouldbe about what it was at Deborah's middle school ceremony.There the students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance andremained standing during the rabbi's prayers.

Even on the assumption that there was a respect-ful moment of silence both before and after the prayers, therabbi's two presentations must not have extended much be-yond a minute each, if that. We do not know whether heremained on stage during the whole ceremony, or whetherthe students received individual diplomas on stage, or if hehelped to congratulate them. The school board (and the United States, which supports it as amicus curiae ) argued that these short prayers and others like them at graduation exercises are of profoundmeaning to many students and parents throughout this coun-try who consider that due respect and acknowledgment fordivine guidance and for the deepest spiritual aspirations of505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 584 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court our people ought to be expressed at an event as important in life as a graduation. We assume this to be so in address-ing the dif\u00aecult case now before us, for the signi\u00aecance ofthe prayers lies also at the heart of Daniel and DeborahWeisman's case. B Deborah's graduation was held on the premises of Nathan Bishop Middle School on June 29, 1989. Four days beforethe ceremony, Daniel Weisman, in his individual capacity asa Providence taxpayer and as next friend of Deborah, soughta temporary restraining order in the United States DistrictCourt for the District of Rhode Island to prohibit school of\u00ae-cials from including an invocation or benediction in the grad-uation ceremony. The court denied the motion for lack ofadequate time to consider it. Deborah and her family at-tended the graduation, where the prayers were recited. InJuly 1989, Daniel Weisman \u00aeled an amended complaint seek-ing a permanent injunction barring petitioners, various of\u00ae-cials of the Providence public schools, from inviting theclergy to deliver invocations and benedictions at futuregraduations. We \u00aend it unnecessary to address DanielWeisman's taxpayer standing, for a live and justiciable con-troversy is before us. Deborah Weisman is enrolled as astudent at Classical High School in Providence and from therecord it appears likely, if not certain, that an invocation andbenediction will be conducted at her high school graduation.Agreed Statement of Facts \u00b6 38, App. 17. The case was submitted on stipulated facts. The District Court held that petitioners' practice of including invoca-tions and benedictions in public school graduations violatedthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, andit enjoined petitioners from continuing the practice. 728F. Supp. 68 (1990). The court applied the three-partEstablishment Clause test set forth in Lemon v.Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). Under that test as described in ourpast cases, to satisfy the Establishment Clause a governmen-505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 585 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court tal practice must (1) re\u00afect a clearly secular purpose; (2) have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits reli-gion; and (3) avoid excessive government entanglement withreligion. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 773 (1973). The District Court held that petitioners' actions violated the second part of the test,and so did not address either the \u00aerst or the third. Thecourt decided, based on its reading of our precedents, thatthe effects test of Lemon is violated whenever government action \u00aacreates an identi\u00aecation of the state with a religion,or with religion in general,\u00ba 728 F. Supp., at 71, or when \u00aathe effect of the governmental action is to endorse one religionover another, or to endorse religion in general.\u00ba Id.,at 72. The court determined that the practice of including invoca-tions and benedictions, even so-called nonsectarian ones, inpublic school graduations an of govern-mental power with religious practice, endorses religion, andviolates the Establishment Clause. In so holding the courtexpressed the determination not to follow Stein v.Plainwell Community Schools, 822 F. 2d 1406 (1987), in which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, relying on our deci-sion in Marsh v.Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), held that benedictions and invocations at public school graduations arenot always unconstitutional. In Marsh we upheld the con- stitutionality of the Nebraska State Legislature's practice ofopening each of its sessions with a prayer offered by a chap-lain paid out of public funds. The District Court in this casedisagreed with the Sixth Circuit's reasoning because it be-lieved that Marsh was a narrow decision, \u00aalimited to the unique situation of legislative prayer,\u00ba and did not have anyrelevance to school prayer cases. 728 F. Supp., at 74. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit af\u00aermed. The majority opinion by Judge Tor-ruella adopted the opinion of the District Court. 908 F. 2d1090 (1990). Judge Bownes joined the majority, but wrotea separate concurring opinion in which he decided that the505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 586 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court practices challenged here violated all three parts of the Lemon test. Judge Bownes went on to agree with the Dis- trict Court that Marsh had no application to school prayer cases and that the Stein decision was \u00afawed. He concluded by suggesting that under Establishment Clause rules noprayer, even one excluding any mention of the Deity, couldbe offered at a public school graduation ceremony. 908F. 2d, at 1090\u00b11097. Judge Campbell dissented, on the basisofMarsh and Stein. He reasoned that if the prayers deliv- ered were nonsectarian, and if school of\u00aecials ensured thatpersons representing a variety of beliefs and ethical systemswere invited to present invocations and benedictions, therewas no violation of the Establishment Clause. 908 F. 2d, at1099. We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 918 (1991), and nowaf\u00aerm. II These dominant facts mark and control the con\u00aenes of our decision: State of\u00aecials direct the performance of a formalreligious exercise at promotional and graduation ceremoniesfor secondary schools. Even for those students who objectto the religious exercise, their attendance and participationin the state-sponsored religious activity are in a fair and realsense obligatory, though the school district does not requireattendance as a condition for receipt of the diploma. This case does not require us to revisit the dif\u00aecult ques- tions dividing us in recent cases, questions of the de\u00aenitionand full scope of the principles governing the extent of per-mitted accommodation by the State for the religious beliefsand practices of many of its citizens. See County of Alle- gheny v.American Civil Liberties Union, Greater U. S. 573 (1989); Wallace v.Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985); Lynch v.Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 (1984). For without reference to those principles in other contexts, thecontro lling precedents as they relate to prayer and religious exercise in primary and secondary public schools compel theholding here that the policy of the city of Providence is an505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 587 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court unconstitutional one. We can decide the case without recon- sidering the general constitutional framework by which pub-lic schools' efforts to accommodate religion are measured.Thus we do not accept the invitation of petitioners and ami- custhe United States to reconsider our decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra. The government involvement with reli- gious activity in this case is pervasive, to the point of creat-ing a state-sponsored and state-directed religious exercise ina public school. Conducting this formal religious observ-ance con\u00aficts with settled rules pertaining to prayer exer-cises for students, and that suf\u00aeces to determine the question before us. The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limi-tations imposed by the Establishment Clause. It is beyonddispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees thatgovernment may not coerce anyone to support or participatein religion or its exercise, or otherwise act in a way which\u00aaestablishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends todo so.\u00ba Lynch, supra, at 678; see also County of Allegheny, supra, at 591, quoting Everson v.Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 15\u00b116 (1947). The State's involvement in theschool prayers challenged today violates these centralprinciples. That involvement is as troubling as it is undenied. A school of\u00aecial, the principal, decided that an invocation and abenediction should be given; this is a choice attributable tothe State, and from a constitutional perspective it is as ifa state statute decreed that the prayers must occur. Theprincipal chose the religious participant, here a rabbi, andthat choice is also attributable to the State. The reason forthe choice of a rabbi is not disclosed by the record, but thepotential for divisiveness over the choice of a particularmember of the clergy to conduct the ceremony is apparent. Divisiveness, of course, can attend any state decision re- specting religions, and neither its existence nor its potential505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 588 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court necessarily invalidates the State's attempts to accommodate religion in all cases. The potential for divisiveness is of par-ticular relevance here though, because it centers around anovert religious exercise in a secondary school environmentwhere, as we discuss below, see infra, at 593\u00b1594, subtle co- ercive pressures exist and where the student had no realalternative which would have allowed her to avoid the factor appearance of participation. The State's role did not end with the decision to include a prayer and with the choice of a clergyman. Principal Leeprovided Rabbi Gutterman with a copy of the \u00aaGuidelines for Civic Occasions,\u00ba and advised him that his prayers shouldbe nonsectarian. Through these means the principal di-rected and controlled the content of the prayers. Even ifthe only sanction for ignoring the instructions were that therabbi would not be invited back, we think no religious repre-sentative who valued his or her continued reputation andeffectiveness in the community would incur the State's dis-pleasure in this regard. It is a cornerstone principle of ourEstablishment Clause jurisprudence that \u00aait is no part of thebusiness of government to compose of\u00aecial prayers for anygroup of the American people to recite as a part of a religiousprogram carried on by government,\u00ba Engel v.Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 425 (1962), and that is what the school of\u00aecials at-tempted to do. Petitioners argue, and we \u00aend nothing in the case to refute it, that the directions for the content of the prayers were agood-faith attempt by the school to ensure that the sectarian-ism which is so often the \u00afashpoint for religious animositybe removed from the graduation ceremony. The concern isunderstandable, as a prayer which uses ideas or images iden-ti\u00aeed with a particular religion may foster a different sort ofsectarian rivalry than an invocation or benediction in termsmore neutral. The school's explanation, however, does notresolve the dilemma caused by its participation. The ques-tion is not the good faith of the school in attempting to make505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 589 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court the prayer acceptable to most persons, but the legitimacy of its undertaking that enterprise at all when the object is toproduce a prayer to be used in a formal religious exercisewhich students, for all practical purposes, are obliged toattend. We are asked to recognize the existence of a practice of nonsectarian prayer, prayer within the embrace of what isknown as the Judeo-Christian tradition, prayer which ismore acceptable than one which, for example, makes explicitreferences to the God of Israel, or to Jesus Christ, or to apatron saint. There may be some support, as an empirical observation, to the statement of the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit, picked up by Judge Campbell's dissent in theCourt of Appeals in this case, that there has emerged in thiscountry a civic religion, one which is tolerated when sectar-ian exercises are not. Stein, 822 F. 2d, at 1409; 908 F. 2d 1090, 1098\u00b11099 (CA1 1990) (Campbell, J., dissenting) (casebelow); see also Note, Civil Religion and the EstablishmentClause, 95 Yale L. J. 1237 (1986). If common ground can bede\u00aened which permits once con\u00aficting faiths to express theshared conviction that there is an ethic and a morality whichtranscend human invention, the sense of community and pur-pose sought by all decent societies might be advanced. Butthough the First Amendment does not allow the governmentto sti\u00afe prayers which aspire to these ends, neither does itpermit the government to undertake that task for itself. The First Amendment's Religion Clauses mean that reli- gious beliefs and religious expression are too precious to beeither proscribed or prescribed by the State. The designof the Constitution is that preservation and transmission ofreligious beliefs and worship is a responsibility and a choicecommitted to the private sphere, which itself is promisedfreedom to pursue that mission. It must not be forgottenthen, that while concern must be given to de\u00aene the protec-tion granted to an objector or a dissenting nonbeliever, thesesame Clauses exist to protect religion from government in-505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 590 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court terference. James Madison, the principal author of the Bill of Rights, did not rest his opposition to a religious establish-ment on the sole ground of its effect on the minority. Aprincipal ground for his view was: \u00aa[E]xperience witnesseththat ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintainingthe purity and ef\u00aecacy of Religion, have had a contrary op-eration.\u00ba Memorial and Remonstrance Against ReligiousAssessments (1785), in 8 Papers of James Madison 301(W. Rachal, R. Rutland, B. Ripel, & F. Teute eds. 1973). These concerns have particular application in the case of school of\u00aecials, whose effort to monitor prayer will be per- ceived by the students as inducing a participation they mightotherwise reject. Though the efforts of the school of\u00aecialsin this case to \u00aend common ground appear to have been agood-faith attempt to recognize the common aspects of reli-gions and not the divisive ones, our precedents do not permitschool of\u00aecials to assist in composing prayers as an incidentto a formal exercise for their students. Engel v.Vitale, supra, at 425. And these same precedents caution us to measure the idea of a civic religion against the central mean-ing of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, whichis that all creeds must be tolerated and none favored. Thesuggestion that government may establish an of\u00aecial or civicreligion as a means of avoiding the establishment of a reli-gion with more speci\u00aec creeds strikes us as a contradictionthat cannot be accepted. The degree of school involvement here made it clear that the graduation prayers bore the imprint of the State andthus put school-age children who objected in an untenableposition. We turn our attention now to consider the positionof the students, both those who desired the prayer and shewho did not. To endure the speech of false ideas or offensive content and then to counter it is part of learning how to live in apluralistic society, a society which insists upon open dis-course towards the end of a tolerant citizenry. And toler-505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 591 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court ance presupposes some mutuality of obligation. It is argued that our constitutional vision of a free society requires con-\u00aedence in our own ability to accept or reject ideas of whichwe do not approve, and that prayer at a high school gradua-tion does nothing more than offer a choice. By the timethey are seniors, high school students no doubt have beenrequired to attend classes and assemblies and to completeassignments exposing them to ideas they \u00aend distasteful orimmoral or absurd or all of these. Against this background,students may consider it an odd measure of justice to besubjected during the course of their educations to ideas deemed offensive and irreligious, but to be denied a brief,formal prayer ceremony that the school offers in return.This argument cannot prevail, however. It overlooks a fun-damental dynamic of the Constitution. The First Amendment protects speech and religion by quite different mechanisms. Speech is protected by ensur-ing its full expression even when the government partici-pates, for the very object of some of our most importantspeech is to persuade the government to adopt an idea as itsown. Meese v.Keene, 481 U. S. 465, 480\u00b1481 (1987); see also Keller v.State Bar of California, 496 U. S. 1, 10\u00b111 (1990); Abood v.Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977). The method for protecting freedom of worship and freedom ofconscience in religious matters is quite the reverse. In reli-gious debate or expression the government is not a primeparticipant, for the Framers deemed religious establishmentantithetical to the freedom of all. The Free Exercise Clauseembraces a freedom of conscience and worship that has closeparallels in the speech provisions of the First Amendment,but the Establishment Clause is a speci\u00aec prohibition onforms of state intervention in religious affairs with no pre-cise counterpart in the speech provisions. Buckley v.Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 92\u00b193, and n. 127 (1976) (per curiam). The ex- planation lies in the lesson of history that was and is theinspiration for the Establishment Clause, the lesson that in505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 592 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court the hands of government what might begin as a tolerant ex- pression of religious views may end in a policy to indoctri-nate and coerce. A state-created orthodoxy puts at graverisk that freedom of belief and conscience which are the soleassurance that religious faith is real, not imposed. The lessons of the First Amendment are as urgent in the modern world as in the 18th century when it was written.One timeless lesson is that if citizens are subjected to state-sponsored religious exercises, the State disavows its ownduty to guard and respect that sphere of inviolable con-science and belief which is the mark of a free people. Tocompromise that principle today would be to deny our owntradition and forfeit our standing to urge others to securethe protections of that tradition for themselves. As we have observed before, there are heightened con- cerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtlecoercive pressure in the elementary and secondary publicschools. See, e. g., School Dist. of Abington v.Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 307 (1963) (Goldberg, J., concurring); Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 584 (1987); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 261\u00b1262 (1990) ( Kennedy, J., concurring). Our decisions in Engel v.Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), and School Dist. of Abington, supra, recognize, among other things, that prayer exercises in public schools carry a particular risk of indirectcoercion. The concern may not be limited to the contextof schools, but it is most pronounced there. See County of Allegheny v.American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S., at 661 ( Kennedy, J. , concur- ring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). What tomost believers may seem nothing more than a reasonablerequest that the nonbeliever respect their religious prac-tices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever ordissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of theState to enforce a religious orthodoxy.505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 593 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court We need not look beyond the circumstances of this case to see the phenomenon at work. The undeniable fact is thatthe school district's supervision and control of a high schoolgraduation ceremony places public pressure, as well as peerpressure, on attending students to stand as a group or, atleast, maintain respectful silence during the invocation andbenediction. This pressure, though subtle and indirect, canbe as real as any overt compulsion. Of course, in our culturestanding or remaining silent can signify adherence to a viewor simple respect for the views of others. And no doubtsome persons who have no desire to join a prayer have little objection to standing as a sign of respect for those who do.But for the dissenter of high school age, who has a reasonableperception that she is being forced by the State to pray in amanner her conscience will not allow, the injury is no lessreal. There can be no doubt that for many, if not most, ofthe students at the graduation, the act of standing or remain-ing silent was an expression of participation in the rabbi'sprayer. That was the very point of the religious exercise.It is of little comfort to a dissenter, then, to be told that forher the act of standing or remaining in silence signi\u00aees mererespect, rather than participation. What matters is that,given our social conventions, a reasonable dissenter in thismilieu could believe that the group exercise signi\u00aeed her ownparticipation or approval of it. Finding no violation under these circumstances would place objectors in the dilemma of participating, with all thatimplies, or protesting. We do not address whether thatchoice is acceptable if the affected citizens are mature adults,but we think the State may not, consistent with the Estab-lishment Clause, place primary and secondary school chil-dren in this position. Research in psychology supports thecommon assumption that adolescents are often susceptible topressure from their peers towards conformity, and that thein\u00afuence is strongest in matters of social convention. Brit-tain, Adolescent Choices and Parent-Peer Cross-Pressures,505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 594 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court 28 Am.

The injury caused by the government's action, and the rea- son why Daniel and Deborah Weisman object to it, is thatthe State, in a school setting, in effect required participationin a religious exercise. It is, we concede, a brief exerciseduring which the individual can concentrate on joining itsmessage, meditate on her own religion, or let her mindwander. But the embarrassment and the intrusion of thereligious exercise cannot be refuted by arguing that theseprayers, and similar ones to be said in the future, are of ade minimis character. To do so would be an affront to the rabbi who offered them and to all those for whom the prayerswere an essential and profound recognition of divine author-ity. And for the same reason, we think that the intrusion isgreater than the two minutes or so of time consumed forprayers like these. Assuming, as we must, that the prayerswere offensive to the student and the parent who now object,the intrusion was both real and, in the context of a secondaryschool, a violation of the objectors' rights. That the intru-sion was in the course of promulgating religion that soughtto be civic or nonsectarian rather than pertaining to one sectdoes not lessen the offense or isolation to the objectors. Atbest it narrows their number, at worst increases their senseof isolation and affront. See supra, at 593. There was a stipulation in the District Court that attend- ance at graduation and promotional ceremonies is voluntary.Agreed Statement of Facts \u00b6 41, App. 18. Petitioners and505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 595 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court the United States, as amicus, made this a center point of the case, arguing that the option of not attending the graduationexcuses any inducement or coercion in the ceremony itself.The argument lacks all persuasion. Law reaches past for-malism. And to say a teenage student has a real choice notto attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the ex-treme. True, Deborah could elect not to attend commence-ment without renouncing her diploma; but we shall not allowthe case to turn on this point. Everyone knows that in oursociety and in our culture high school graduation is one oflife's most signi\u00aecant occasions. A school rule which ex- cuses attendance is beside the point. Attendance may notbe required by of\u00aecial decree, yet it is apparent that a stu-dent is not free to absent herself from the graduation exer-cise in any real sense of the term \u00aavoluntary,\u00ba for absencewould require forfeiture of those intangible bene\u00aets whichhave motivated the student through youth and all her highschool years. Graduation is a time for family and those clos-est to the student to celebrate success and express mutualwishes of gratitude and respect, all to the end of impressingupon the young person the role that it is his or her right andduty to assume in the community and all of its diverse parts. The importance of the event is the point the school district and the United States rely upon to argue that a formalprayer ought to be permitted, but it becomes one of the prin-cipal reasons why their argument must fail. Their conten-tion, one of considerable force were it not for the constitu-tional constraints applied to state action, is that the prayersare an essential part of these ceremonies because for manypersons an occasion of this signi\u00aecance lacks meaning if thereis no recognition, however brief, that human achievementscannot be understood apart from their spiritual essence.We think the Government's position that this interest suf-\u00aeces to force students to choose between compliance or for-feiture demonstrates fundamental inconsistency in its argu-mentation. It fails to acknowledge that what for many of505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 596 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court Deborah's classmates and their parents was a spiritual im- perative was for Daniel and Deborah Weisman religious con-formance compelled by the State. While in some societiesthe wishes of the majority might prevail, the EstablishmentClause of the First Amendment is addressed to this contin-gency and rejects the balance urged upon us. The Constitu-tion forbids the State to exact religious conformity from astudent as the price of attending her own high school gradua-tion. This is the calculus the Constitution commands. The Government's argument gives insuf\u00aecient recognition to the real con\u00afict of conscience faced by the young student. The essence of the Government's position is that with regardto a civic, social occasion of this importance it is the objector,not the majority, who must take unilateral and private actionto avoid compromising religious scruples, hereby electing tomiss the graduation exercise. This turns conventional FirstAmendment analysis on its head. It is a tenet of the FirstAmendment that the State cannot require one of its citizensto forfeit his or her rights and bene\u00aets as the price of resist-ing conformance to state-sponsored religious practice. Tosay that a student must remain apart from the ceremonyat the opening invocation and closing benediction is to riskcompe lling conformity in an environment analogous to the classroom setting, where we have said the risk of compulsionis especially high. See supra, at 593\u00b1594. Just as in Engel v.Vitale, 370 U. S., at 430, and School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 224\u00b1225, where we found that provi- sions within the challenged legislation permitting a studentto be voluntarily excused from attendance or participationin the daily prayers did not shield those practices from inval-idation, the fact that attendance at the graduation ceremo-nies is voluntary in a legal sense does not save the religiousexercise. Inherent differences between the public school system and a session of a state legislature distinguish this case fromMarsh v.Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 PAGES OPINPGT 597 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Opinion of the Court tions we have raised in objection to the invocation and bene- diction are in many respects similar to the arguments weconsidered in Marsh. But there are also obvious differ- ences. The atmosphere at the opening of a session of a statelegislature where adults are free to enter and leave with lit-tle comment and for any number of reasons cannot comparewith the constraining potential of the one school event mostimportant for the student to attend. The in\u00afuence and forceof a formal exercise in a school graduation are far greaterthan the prayer exercise we condoned in Marsh. The Marsh majority in fact gave speci\u00aec recognition to this dis- tinction and placed particular reliance on it in upholding theprayers at issue there. 463 U. S., at 792. Today's case isdifferent. At a high school graduation, teachers and princi-pals must and do retain a high degree of control over theprecise contents of the program, the speeches, the timing,the movements, the dress, and the decorum of the students.Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v.Fraser, 478 U. S. 675 (1986). In this atmosphere the state-imposed character of an invoca-tion and benediction by clergy selected by the school com-bine to make the prayer a state-sanctioned religious exercisein which the student was left with no alternative but tosubmit. This is different from Marsh and suf\u00aeces to make the religious exercise a First Amendment violation. OurEstablishment Clause jurisprudence remains a delicate andfact-sensitive one, and we cannot accept the parallel reliedupon by petitioners and the United States between the factsofMarsh and the case now before us. Our decisions in Engel v.Vitale, supra, and School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, supra, require us to distinguish the public school context. We do not hold that every state action implicating religion is invalid if one or a few citizens \u00aend it offensive. Peoplemay take offense at all manner of religious as well as nonre-ligious messages, but offense alone does not in every caseshow a violation. We know too that sometimes to endure505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 598 LEE v.WEISMAN Opinion of the Court social isolation or even anger may be the price of conscience or nonconformity. But, by any reading of our cases, the con-formity required of the student in this case was too high anexaction to withstand the test of the Establishment Clause.The prayer exercises in this case are especially improper be-cause the State has in every practical sense compelled at-tendance and participation in an explicit religious exercise atan event of singular importance to every student, one theobjecting student had no real alternative to avoid. Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line- drawing, of determining at what point a dissenter's rights ofreligious freedom are infringed by the State. \u00aaThe First Amendment does not prohibit practices which by any realistic measure create none of the dan-gers which it is designed to prevent and which do not sodirectly or substantially involve the state in religiousexercises or in the favoring of religion as to have mean-ingful and practical impact. It is of course true thatgreat consequences can grow from small beginnings, butthe measure of constitutional adjudication is the abilityand willing ness to distinguish between real threat and mere shadow.\u00ba School Dist. of Abington v.Schempp, supra, at 308 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Our society would be less than true to its heritage if it lacked abiding concern for the values of its young people, andwe acknowledge the profound belief of adherents to manyfaiths that there must be a place in the student's life forprecepts of a morality higher even than the law we todayenforce. We express no hostility to those aspirations, nor would our oath permit us to do so. A relentless and all-pervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect ofpublic life could itself become inconsistent with the Constitu-tion. See School Dist. of Abington, supra, at 306 (Goldberg, J., concurring). We recognize that, at graduation time andthroughout the course of the educational process, there will505us2110L 04-22-99 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 599 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Blackmun, J., concurring be instances when religious values, religious practices, and religious persons will have some interaction with the publicschools and their students. See Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.Mergens, 496 U. S. 226 (1990). But these matters, often questions of accommoda-tion of religion, are not before us. The sole question pre-sented is whether a religious exercise may be conducted ata graduation ceremony in circumstances where, as we havefound, young graduates who object are induced to conform.No holding by this Court suggests that a school can persuadeor compel a student to participate in a religious exercise.That is being done here, and it is forbidden by the Establish-ment Clause of the First Amendment. For the reasons we have stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Af\u00aermed. Justice Blackmun , with whom Justice Stevens and Justice O\u0092Connor join, concurring. Nearly half a century of review and re\u00aenement of Estab- lishment Clause jurisprudence has distilled one clear under-standing: Government may neither promote nor af\u00aeliate it-self with any religious doctrine or organization, nor may itobtrude itself in the internal affairs of any religious institu-tion. The application of these principles to the present casemandates the decision reached today by the Court. I This Court \u00aerst reviewed a challenge to state law under the Establishment Clause in Everson v.Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947). 1Relying on the history of the 1A few earlier cases involving federal laws touched on interpretation of the Establishment Clause. In Reynolds v.United States, 98 U. S. 145 (1879), and Davis v.Beason, 133 U. S. 333 (1890), the Court considered the Clause in the context of federal laws prohibiting bigamy. The Court inReynolds accepted Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Asso-505us2110F 18:56:59 PAGES OPINPGT 600 LEE v.WEISMAN Blackmun, J., concurring Clause, and the Court's prior analysis, Justice Black outlined the considerations that have become the touchstone of Es-tablishment Clause jurisprudence: Neither a State nor theFederal Government can pass laws which aid one religion,aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Nei- ther a State nor the Federal Government, openly or secretly,can participate in the affairs of any religious organizationand vice versa. 2\u00aaIn the words of Jefferson, the clause ciation \u00aaalmost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect\u00ba of the First Amendment. 98 U. S., at 164. In that letter Jefferson pennedhis famous lines that the Establishment Clause built \u00aaa wall of separationbetween church and State.\u00ba Ibid. Davis considered \u00aa[t]he \u00aerst . . . to prohibit legislationfor the support of any religious tenets, or the modes of worship of anysect.\u00ba 133 U. S., at 342. In another case, Brad\u00aeeld v.Roberts, 175 U. S. 291 (1899), the Court held that it did not violate the Establishment Clausefor Congress to construct a hospital building for caring for poor patients,although the hospital was managed by sisters of the Roman CatholicChurch. The Court reasoned: \u00aaThat the in\u00afuence of any particular churchmay be powerful over the members of a non-sectarian and secular corpora-tion, incorporated for a certain de\u00aened purpose and with clearly statedpowers, is surely not suf\u00aecient to convert such a corporation into a reli-gious or sectarian body.\u00ba Id., at 298. Finally, in 1908 the Court held that \u00aathe spirit of the Constitution\u00ba did not prohibit the Indians from usingtheir money, held by the United States Government, for religious educa-tion. See Quick Bear v.Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 81. 2The Court articulated six examples of paradigmatic practices that the Establishment Clause prohibits: \u00aaThe `establishment of religion' clause ofthe First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the FederalGovernment can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid onereligion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neithercan force nor in\u00afuence a person to go to or to remain away from churchagainst his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefsor disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in anyamount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities orinstitutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they mayadopt to teach or practice religion.

Students said aloud a short prayer selectedby the State Board of Regents: \u00aa `Almighty God, we acknowl- edge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessingsupon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.' \u00ba Id., at 422. Justice Black, writing for the Court, again madeclear that the First Amendment forbids the use of the poweror prestige of the government to control, support, or in\u00afu-ence the religious beliefs and practices of the Americanpeople. Although the prayer was \u00aadenominationally neu-tral\u00ba and \u00aaits observance on the part of the students [was]voluntary,\u00ba id.,at 430, the Court found that it violated this essential precept of the Establishment Clause. A year later, the Court again invalidated government- sponsored prayer in public schools in School Dist. of Abing- ton v.Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963). In Schempp, the school day for Baltimore, Maryland, and Abington Township,Pennsylvania, students began with a reading from the Bible,or a recitation of the Lord's Prayer, or both. After athorough review of the Court's prior Establishment Clausecases, the Court concluded: organizations or groups and vice versa. \u00baEverson v.Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.

The test may be stated as follows: what arethe purpose and the primary effect of the enactment?If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion,then the enactment exceeds the scope of legislativepower as circumscribed by the Constitution.\u00ba Id., at 222. Because the schools' opening exercises were government- sponsored religious ceremonies, the Court found that theprimary effect was the advancement of religion and held,therefore, that the activity violated the EstablishmentClause. Id.,at 223\u00b1224. Five years later, the next time the Court considered whether religious activity in public schools violated the Es-tablishment Clause, it reiterated the principle that govern-ment \u00aamay not aid, foster, or promote one religion or reli-gious theory against another or even against the militantopposite.\u00ba Epperson v.Arkansas, 393 U.

There can be \u00aano doubt\u00ba that the \u00aainvoca-tion of God's blessings\u00ba delivered at Nathan Bishop MiddleSchool \u00aais a religious activity.\u00ba Engel, 370 U. S., at 424. In the words of Engel, the rabbi's prayer \u00aais a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of theAlmighty. The nature of such a prayer has always beenreligious.\u00ba Id., at 424\u00b1425. The question then is whether the government has \u00aaplac[ed] its of\u00aecial stamp of approval\u00baon the prayer.

S., at 16. The discussion in Everson re\u00afected the Madisonian concern that secular and religious authorities must not interfere with each other's respectivespheres of choice and in\u00afuence. See generally The Complete Madison298\u00b1312 (S. Padover ed. 1953). 4Since 1971, the Court has decided 31 Establishment Clause cases. In only one instance, the decision of Marsh v.Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), has the Court not rested its decision on the basic principles described inLemon. For example, in the most recent Establishment Clause case, Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.Mergens, 496 U. S. 226 (1990), the Court applied the three-part Lemon analysis to the Equal Access Act, which made it unlawful for public secondary schoolsto deny equal access to any student wishing to hold religious meetings.Id., at 248\u00b1253 (plurality opinion); id.,at 262 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). In no case involving religious activities in public schoolshas the Court failed to apply vigorously the Lemon factors.505us2110F sures students to attend and participate in the prayer, there can be no doubt that the government is advancing and pro-moting religion. 5As our prior decisions teach us, it is this that the Constitution prohibits. II I join the Court's opinion today because I \u00aend nothing in it inconsistent with the essential precepts of the EstablishmentClause developed in our precedents. The Court holds thatthe graduation prayer is unconstitutional because the State\u00aain effect required participation in a religious exercise.\u00baAnte, at 594. Although our precedents make clear that proof of government coercion is not necessary to prove an Estab-lishment Clause violation, it is suf\u00aecient. Government pres-sure to participate in a religious activity is an obvious indica-tion that the government is endorsing or promoting religion. But it is not enough that the government restrain from compe lling religious practices: It must not engage in them either. See Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concur- ring). The Court repeatedly has recognized that a violationof the Establishment Clause is not predicated on coercion.See, e. g., id., at 223; id., at 229 (Douglas, J., concurring); Wal- lace v.Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 72 J. , concur- ring in judgment) (\u00aaThe decisions [in Engel and Schempp ] acknowledged the coercion implicit under the statutoryschemes, but they expressly turned only on the fact that thegovernment was sponsoring a manifestly religious exercise\u00ba(citation omitted)); Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v.Nyquist, 413 U.

The scope of the Establishment Clause's prohibitions de- veloped in our case law derives from the Clause's purposes.The First Amendment encompasses two distinct guaran-tees\u00d0the government shall make no law respecting an es-tablishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercisethereof\u00d0both with the common purpose of securing reli- gious liberty. 7Through vigorous enforcement of both Clauses, we \u00aapromote and assure the fullest possible scopeof religious liberty and tolerance for all and . . . nurture theconditions which secure the best hope of attainment of thatend.\u00ba Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). There is no doubt that attempts to aid religion through government coercion jeopardize freedom of conscience.Even subtle pressure diminishes the right of each individualto choose voluntarily what to believe.

S. 421, 431 (1962). 7See, e. g., Everson, 330 U.

Our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, how- ever, because the Court has recognized that \u00aathe fullest pos-sible scope of religious liberty,\u00ba Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring), entails more than freedom fromcoercion. The Establishment Clause protects religious lib-erty on a grand scale; it is a social compact that guaranteesfor generations a democracy and a strong religious commu-nity\u00d0both essential to safeguarding religious liberty. \u00aaOurfathers seem to have been perfectly sincere in their beliefthat the members of the Church would be more patriotic,and the citizens of the State more religious, by keeping theirrespective functions entirely separate.\u00ba Religious Liberty,in Essays and Speeches of Jeremiah S. Black 53 (C.

When the government arrogates to itself a role in religious affairs, it abandons its obligation as guarantor of democracy.Democracy requires the nourishment of dialog and dissent,while religious faith puts its trust in an ultimate divine au-thority above all human deliberation.

It is these understandings and fears that underlie our Es- tablishment Clause jurisprudence. We have believed thatreligious freedom cannot exist in the absence of a free demo-cratic government, and that such a government cannot en-dure when there is fusion between religion and the politicalregime. We have believed that religious freedom cannotthrive in the absence of a vibrant religious community andthat such a community cannot prosper when it is bound tothe secular. And we have believed that these were the ani-mating principles behind the adoption of the EstablishmentClause. To that end, our cases have prohibited governmentendorsement of religion, its sponsorship, and active involve-ment in religion, whether or not citizens were coerced toconform. I remain convinced that our jurisprudence is not mis- guided, and that it requires the decision reached by theCourt today. Accordingly, I join the Court in af\u00aerming thejudgment of the Court of Appeals. Justice Souter , with whom Justice Stevens and Justice O\u0092Connor join, concurring. I join the whole of the Court's opinion, and fully agree that prayers at public school graduation ceremonies indirectly co-erce religious observance. I write separately nonethelesson two issues of Establishment Clause analysis that underliemy independent resolution of this case: whether the Clauseapplies to governmental practices that do not favor one reli-gion or denomination over others, and whether state coer-cion of religious conformity, over and above state endorse-ment of religious exercise or belief, is a necessary elementof an Establishment Clause violation. I Forty-\u00aeve years ago, this Court announced a basic princi- ple of constitutional law from which it has not strayed: the505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 610 LEE v.WEISMAN Souter, J., concurring Establishment Clause forbids not only state practices that \u00aaaid one religio n...o r prefer one religion over another,\u00ba but also those that \u00aaaid all religions.\u00ba Everson v.Board of E d .o fE w i n g , 330 U. S. 1, 15 (1947). Today we reaf\u00aerm that principle, holding that the Establishment Clause forbidsstate-sponsored prayers in public school settings no matterhow nondenominational the prayers may be. In barring theState from sponsoring generically theistic prayers where itcould not sponsor sectarian ones, we hold true to a line ofprecedent from which there is no adequate historical caseto depart. A Since Everson, we have consistently held the Clause appli- cable no less to governmental acts favoring religion gener-ally than to acts favoring one religion over others. 1Thus, inEngel v.Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), we held that the pub- lic schools may not subject their students to readings of anyprayer, however \u00aadenominationally neutral.\u00ba Id., at 430. More recently, in Wallace v.Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985), we held that an Alabama moment-of-silence statute passed forthe sole purpose of \u00aareturning voluntary prayer to publicschools,\u00ba id.,at 57, violated the Establishment Clause even though it did not encourage students to pray to any particu-lar deity. We said that \u00aawhen the underlying principle hasbeen examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court hasunambiguously concluded that the individual freedom ofconscience protected by the First Amendment embracesthe right to select any religious faith or none at all.\u00ba Id., at 52\u00b153. This conclusion, we held, \u00aaderives support not only from the interest in respecting the individual's freedom of conscience, but also from theconviction that religious beliefs worthy of respect arethe product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful, 1Cf.Larson v.Valente, 456 U.

B Some have challenged this precedent by reading the Es- tablishment Clause to permit \u00aanonpreferential\u00ba state promo-tion of religion. The challengers argue that, as originallyunderstood by the Framers, \u00aa[t]he Establishment Clausedid not require government neutrality between religionand irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Governmentfrom providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion.\u00ba Wallace, supra, at 106 ( Rehnquist , J., dissenting); see also R. Cord, Separation of Church and State: Historical Fact and CurrentFiction (1988). While a case has been made for this position,it is not so convincing as to warrant reconsideration of oursettled law; indeed, I \u00aend in the history of the Clause's tex-tual development a more powerful argument supporting theCourt's jurisprudence following Everson. When James Madison arrived at the First Congress with a series of proposals to amend the National Constitution, oneof the provisions read that \u00aa[t]he civil rights of none shall beabridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shallany national religion be established, nor shall the full andequal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pre-text, infringed.\u00ba 1 Annals of Cong. 434 (1789). Madison'slanguage did not last long. It was sent to a Select Commit-tee of the House, which, without explanation, changed it toread that \u00aano religion shall be established by law, nor shallthe equal rights of conscience be infringed.\u00ba Id., at 729. Thence the proposal went to the Committee of the Whole,which was in turn dissatis\u00aeed with the Select Committee'slanguage and adopted an alternative proposed by SamuelLivermore of New Hampshire: \u00aaCongress shall make no lawstouching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.\u00baSee id.,at 731.

See, e. g., Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v.Amos, 483 U. S. 327 (1987) (upholding legislative exemption of religiousgroups from certain obligations under civil rights laws). The House rewrote the amendment once more before send- ing it to the Senate, this time adopting, without recordeddebate, language derived from a proposal by Fisher Amesof Massachusetts: \u00aaCongress shall make no law establishingReligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, nor shall the rights of conscience be infringed.\u00ba 1 Documentary His-tory of the First Federal Congress of the United States ofAmerica 136 (Senate Journal) (L. de Pauw ed. 1972); see 1Annals of Cong. 765 (1789). Perhaps, on further re\u00afection,the Representatives had thought Livermore's proposal tooexpansive, or perhaps, as one historian has suggested, theyhad simply worried that his language would not \u00aasatisfy thedemands of those who wanted something said speci\u00aecallyagainst establishments of religion.\u00ba L. Levy, The Establish-ment Clause 81 (1986) (hereinafter Levy). We do not know;what we do know is that the House rejected the Select Com-mittee's version, which arguably ensured only that \u00aanoreligion\u00ba enjoyed an of\u00aecial preference over others, and de-liberately chose instead a prohibition extending to laws es-tablishing \u00aareligion\u00ba in general. The sequence of the Senate's treatment of this House pro- posal, and the House's response to the Senate, con\u00aerm thatthe Framers meant the Establishment Clause's prohibitionto encompass nonpreferential aid to religion. In September1789, the Senate considered a number of provisions thatwould have permitted such aid, and ultimately it adopted oneof them. First, it brie\u00afy entertained this language: \u00aaCon-gress shall make no law establishing One Religious Sect orSociety in preference to others, nor shall the rights of con-science be infringed.\u00ba See 1 Documentary History, at 151505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 614 LEE v.WEISMAN Souter, J., concurring (Senate Journal); id., at 136. After rejecting two minor amendments to that proposal, see id., at 151, the Senate dropped it altogether and chose a provision identical to theHouse's proposal, but without the clause protecting the\u00aarights of conscience,\u00ba ibid. With no record of the Senate debates, we cannot know what prompted these changes, butthe record does tell us that, six days later, the Senate wenthalf circle and adopted its narrowest language yet: \u00aaCon-gress shall make no law establishing articles of faith or amode of worship, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion.\u00baId., at 166. The Senate sent this proposal to the House along with its versions of the other constitutional amend-ments proposed. Though it accepted much of the Senate's work on the Bill of Rights, the House rejected the Senate's version of the Es- tablishment Clause and called for a joint conference commit-tee, to which the Senate agreed. The House conferees ulti-mately won out, persuading the Senate to accept this as the\u00aenal text of the Religion Clauses: \u00aaCongress shall make nolaw respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibitingthe free exercise thereof.\u00ba What is remarkable is that, un-like the earliest House drafts or the \u00aenal Senate proposal,the prevailing language is not limited to laws respecting an establishment of \u00aaa re- 2Some commentators have suggested that by targeting laws respecting \u00aaan\u00ba establishment of religion, the Framers adopted the very nonpreferen-tialist position whose much clearer articulation they repeatedly rejected.See, e. g., R. Cord, Separation of Church and State 11\u00b112 (1988). Yet the inde\u00aenite article before the word \u00aaestablishment\u00ba is better seen as evi-dence that the Clause forbids any kind of establishment, including a non-preferential one. If the Framers had wished, for some reason, to use theinde\u00aenite term to achieve a narrow meaning for the Clause, they couldfar more aptly have placed it before the word \u00aareligion.\u00ba See Laycock,\u00aaNonpreferential\u00ba Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original Intent,27 Wm. & Mary U. S. 577 (1992) Souter, J., concurring peatedly considered and deliberately rejected such narrow language and instead extended their prohibition to state sup-port for \u00aareligion\u00ba in general. Implicit in their choice is the distinction between preferen- tial and nonpreferential establishments, which the weight ofevidence suggests the Framers appreciated. See, e. g., Lay- cock, \u00aaNonpreferential\u00ba Aid 902\u00b1906; Levy 91\u00b1119. But cf.T. Curry, The First Freedoms 208\u00b1222 (1986). Of particu-lar note, the Framers were vividly familiar with efforts inthe Colonies and, later, the States to impose general, nonde-nominational assessments and other incidents of ostensibly ecumenical establishments. See generally Levy 1\u00b162. TheVirginia statute for religious freedom, written by Jeffersonand sponsored by Madison, captured the separationist re-sponse to such measures. Condemning all establishments,however nonpreferentialist, the statute broadly guaranteedthat \u00aano man shall be compelled to frequent or support anyreligious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever,\u00ba includinghis own. Act for Establishing Religious Freedom (1785), in5 The Founders' Constitution 84, 85 (P. Kurland & R. Lernereds. 1987). Forcing a citizen to support even his own churchwould, among other things, deny \u00aathe ministry those tempo-rary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of theirpersonal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest andunremitting labours for the instruction of mankind.\u00ba Id.,at 84.

Livingston (July 10,1822), in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 105, 106. What we thus know of the Framers' experience under- scores the observation of one prominent commentator, thatcon\u00aening the Establishment Clause to a prohibition on pref-erential aid \u00aarequires a premise that the Framers were ex-traordinarily bad drafters\u00d0that they believed one thing butadopted language that said something substantially differ-ent, and that they did so after repeatedly attending to the505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 616 language.\u00ba Laycock, \u00aaNonpreferential\u00ba Aid 883; see also County of Allegheny v.American Civil Liber- ties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 647\u00b1 648 (1989) (opinion of Stevens, J. ). We must presume, since there is no conclusive evidence to the contrary, that theFramers embraced the signi\u00aecance of their textual judg-ment. 3Thus, on balance, history neither contradicts nor warrants reconsideration of the settled principle that the Es-tablishment Clause forbids support for religion in general noless than support for one religion or some. C While these considerations are, for me, suf\u00aecient to reject the nonpreferentialist position, one further concern animatesmy judgment. In many contexts, including this one, non- preferentialism requires some distinction between \u00aasectar-ian\u00ba religious practices and those that would be, by somemeasure, ecumenical enough to pass Establishment Clausemuster. Simply by requiring the enquiry, nonpreferen-tialists invite the courts to engage in comparative theology.I can hardly imagine a subject less amenable to the compe- 3In his dissent in Wallace v.Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985), The Chief Justice rested his nonpreferentialist interpretation partly on the post- rati\u00aecation actions of the early National Government. Aside from thewilling ness of some (but not all) early Presidents to issue ceremonial reli- gious proclamations, which were at worst trivial breaches of the Establish-ment Clause, see infra, at 630\u00b1631, he cited such seemingly preferential aid as a treaty provision, signed by Jefferson, authorizing federal subsidi-zation of a Roman Catholic priest and church for the Kaskaskia Indians.472 U. S., at 103. But this proves too much, for if the EstablishmentClause permits a special appropriation of tax money for the religious activ-ities of a particular sect, it forbids virtually nothing. See Laycock, \u00aaNon-preferential\u00ba Aid 915. Although evidence of historical practice can indeedfurnish valuable aid in the interpretation of contemporary language, actslike the one in question prove only that public of\u00aecials, no matter whenthey serve, can turn a blind eye to constitutional principle.

Since the nonpreferentiality of a prayer must be judged by its text, Justice Blackmun pertinently observes, ante, at 604, n. 5, that Rabbi Gutter- man drew his exhortation \u00aa `[t]o do justly, to love mercy, towalk humbly' \u00ba straight from the King James version ofMicah, ch. 6, v. 8. At some unde\u00aenable point, the similaritiesbetween a state-sponsored prayer and the sacred text of aspeci\u00aec religion would so closely identify the former with thelatter that even a nonpreferentialist would have to concede a breach of the Establishment Clause. And even if Micah'sthought is suf\u00aeciently generic for most believers, it still em-bodies a straightforwardly theistic premise, and so does therabbi's prayer. Many Americans who consider themselvesreligious are not theistic; some, like several of the Framers,are deists who would question Rabbi Gutterman's plea fordivine advancement of the country's political and moral good.Thus, a nonpreferentialist who would condemn subjectingpublic school graduates to, say, the Anglican liturgy wouldstill need to explain why the government's preference fortheistic over nontheistic religion is constitutional. Nor does it solve the problem to say that the State should promote a \u00aadiversity\u00ba of religious views; that position wouldnecessarily compel the government and, inevitably, thecourts to make wholly inappropriate judgments about thenumber of religions the State should sponsor and the relativefrequency with which it should sponsor each. In fact, theprospect would be even worse than that. As Madison ob-served in criticizing religious Presidential proclamations,the practice of sponsoring religious messages tends, overtime, \u00aato narrow the recommendation to the standard ofthe predominant sect.\u00ba Madison's \u00aaDetached Memoranda,\u00ba3 Wm. & ed. 1946) (hereinafterMadison's \u00aaDetached Memoranda\u00ba).

II Petitioners rest most of their argument on a theory that, whether or not the Establishment Clause permits extensivenonsectarian support for religion, it does not forbid the stateto sponsor af\u00aermations of religious belief that coerce neithersupport for religion nor participation in religious observance.I appreciate the force of some of the arguments supportinga \u00aacoercion\u00ba analysis of the Clause. See generally County of Allegheny, supra, at 655\u00b1679 (opinion of Kennedy , J.); McConnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment,27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 933 (1986). But we could not adoptthat reading without abandoning our settled law, a coursethat, in my view, the text of the Clause would not readilypermit. Nor does the extratextual evidence of originalmeaning stand so unequivocally at odds with the textualpremise inherent in existing precedent that we should funda-mentally reconsider our course. A Over the years, this Court has declared the invalidity of many noncoercive state laws and practices conveying a mes-sage of religious endorsement. For example, in County of Allegheny, supra, we forbade the prominent display of a na- tivity scene on public property; without contesting the dis-sent's observation that the cre\u00c1che coerced no one into accept- ing or supporting whatever message it proclaimed, \u00aeveMembers of the Court found its display unconstitutional as astate endorsement of Christianity.

But virtually everyone acknowledges that theClause bans more than formal establishments of religion inthe traditional sense, that is, massive state support for reli-gion through, among other means, comprehensive schemesof taxation. See generally Levy 1\u00b162 (discussing such es-tablishments in the Colonies and early States). This muchfollows from the Framers' explicit rejection of simpler provi-sions prohibiting either the establishment of a religion orlaws \u00aaestablishing religion\u00ba in favor of the broader ban onlaws \u00aarespecting an establishment of religion.\u00ba See supra, at 612\u00b1614. While some argue that the Framers added the word \u00aarespecting\u00ba simply to foreclose federal interference withstate establishments of religion, see, e. g., Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1157(1991), the language sweeps more broadly than that. InMadison's words, the Clause in its \u00aenal form forbids \u00aaevery-thing like\u00ba a national religious establishment, see Madison's\u00aaDetached Memoranda\u00ba 558, and, after incorporation, itforbids \u00aaeverything like\u00ba a state religious establishment. 4 Cf. County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 649 (opinion of Stevens, J. ).

While one may argue that theFramers meant the Establishment Clause simply to orna-ment the First Amendment, cf. T. Curry, The First Freedoms216\u00b1217 (1986), that must be a reading of last resort. With-out compe lling ev idence to the contrary, we should presume that the Framers meant the Clause to stand for somethingmore than petitioners attribute to it.505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 LEE v.WEISMAN Souter, J., concurring C Petitioners argue from the political setting in which the Establishment Clause was framed, and from the Framers'own political practices following rati\u00aecation, that govern-ment may constitutionally endorse religion so long as it doesnot coerce religious conformity. The setting and the prac-tices warrant canvassing, but while they yield some evidencefor petitioners' argument, they do not reveal the degree ofconsensus in early constitutional thought that would raise athreat to stare decisis by challenging the presumption that the Establishment Clause adds something to the Free Exer-cise Clause that follows it. The Framers adopted the Religion Clauses in response to a long tradition of coercive state support for religion, partic-ularly in the form of tax assessments, but their special antip-athy to religious coercion did not exhaust their hostility tothe features and incidents of establishment. Indeed, Jeffer-son and Madison opposed any political appropriation of reli-gion, see infra, at 623\u00b1626, and, even when challenging the hated assessments, they did not always temper their rhetoricwith distinctions between coercive and noncoercive state ac-tion. When, for example, Madison criticized Virginia's gen-eral assessment bill, he invoked principles antithetical to allstate efforts to promote religion. An assessment, he wrote,is improper not simply because it forces people to donate\u00aathree pence\u00ba to religion, but, more broadly, because \u00aait isitself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equalrank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do notbend to those of the Legislative authority.\u00ba J. Madison,Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments(1785), in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 83. Madison sawthat, even without the tax collector's participation, an of\u00aecialendorsement of religion can impair religious liberty. Petitioners contend that because the early Presidents in- cluded religious messages in their inaugural and Thanksgiv-ing Day addresses, the Framers could not have meant the505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 623 Cite as: 505 U.

The argument ignores the fact, however,that Americans today \u00aend such proclamations less controver-sial than did the founding generation, whose publishedthoughts on the matter belie petitioners' claim. PresidentJefferson, for example, steadfastly refused to issue Thanks-giving proclamations of any kind, in part because he thoughtthey violated the Religion Clauses. Letter from ThomasJefferson to Rev. S. Miller (Jan. 23, 1808), in 5 The Founders'Constitution, at 98. In explaining his views to the ReverendSamuel Miller, Jefferson effectively anticipated, and re-jected, petitioners' position: \u00aa[I]t is only proposed that I should recommend, not pre- scribe a day of fasting & prayer. That is, that I shouldindirectly assume to the U. S. an authority over reli- gious exercises which the Constitution has directly pre-cluded from them. It must be meant too that thisrecommendation is to carry some authority, and to besanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it;not indeed of \u00aene and imprisonment, but of some degreeof proscription perhaps in public opinion.\u00ba Id.,at 98\u00b199 (emphasis in original). By condemning such noncoercive state practices that, in \u00aarecommending\u00ba the majority faith, demean religious dis-senters \u00aain public opinion,\u00ba Jefferson necessarily condemnedwhat, in modern terms, we call of\u00aecial endorsement of reli-gion.

During his \u00aerst three years in of\u00aece, James Madison also refused to call for days of thanksgiving and prayer, thoughlater, amid the political turmoil of the War of 1812, he did soon four separate occasions. See Madison's \u00aaDetached Mem-oranda\u00ba 562, and n. 54.

And one can call any act of endorsement a form of coercion, but only ifone is willing to di lute the meaning of \u00aacoercion\u00ba until there is no meaning left. Jefferson's position straightforwardly contradicts the claim that ashowing of \u00aacoercion,\u00ba under any normal de\u00aenition, is prerequisite to asuccessful Establishment Clause claim. At the same time, Jefferson'spractice, like Madison's, see infra this page and 625, sometimes diverged from principle, for he did include religious references in his inauguralspeeches. See Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the UnitedStates 17, 22\u00b123 (1989); see also n. 3, supra . Petitioners also seek comfort in a different passage of the same letter. Jefferson argued that Presidential religious proclamations violate not justthe Establishment Clause, but also the Tenth Amendment, for \u00aawhatmight be a right in a state government, was a violation of that right whenassumed by another.\u00ba Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Rev. S. Miller(Jan. 23, 1808), in 5 The Founders' Constitution 99 (P. Kurland & R. Lernereds. 1987). Jefferson did not, however, restrict himself to the TenthAmendment in condemning such proclamations by a national of\u00aecer. I donot, in any event, understand petitioners to be arguing that the Establish-ment Clause is exclusively a structural provision mediating the respectivepowers of the State and National Governments. Such a position wouldentail the argument, which petitioners do not make, and which we wouldalmost certainly reject, that incorporation of the Establishment Clauseunder the Fourteenth Amendment was erroneous. 6Madison found this practice \u00aaa palpable violation o f...

While his writingssuggest mild variations in his interpretation of the Estab-lishment Clause, Madison was no different in that respectfrom the rest of his political generation. That he expressedso much doubt about the constitutionality of religious proc-lamations, however, suggests a brand of separationismstronger even than that embodied in our traditional jurispru-dence.

Cord, Sep-aration of Church and State 53 (1988). Yet in the face of theseparationist dissent, those practices prove, at best, that theFramers simply did not share a common understanding of the Establishment Clause, and, at worst, that they, like otherpoliticians, could raise constitutional ideals one day and turntheir backs on them the next. \u00aaIndeed, by 1787 the provi-sions of the state bills of rights had become what Madisoncalled mere `paper parchments'\u00d0expressions of the mostlaudable sentiments, observed as much in the breach as inpractice.\u00ba Kurland, The Origins of the Religion Clauses ofthe Constitution, 27 Wm. & Mary L.

Ten years after proposing the FirstAmendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards.If the early Congress's political actions were determinative,and not merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning,we would have to gut our current First Amendment doctrineto make room for political censorship. While we may be unable to know for certain what the Framers meant by the Clause, we do know that, around thetime of its rati\u00aecation, a respectable body of opinion sup-ported a considerably broader reading than petitioners urgeupon us. This consistency with the textual considerationsis enough to preclude fundamentally reexamining our settledlaw, and I am accordingly left with the task of consideringwhether the state practice at issue here violates our tradi-tional understanding of the Clause's proscriptions.505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 627 Cite as: 505 U.

Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders'Constitution, at 106. Our aspiration to religious liberty, em-bodied in the First Amendment, permits no other standard. A That government must remain neutral in matters of reli- gion does not foreclose it from ever taking religion into ac-count. The State may \u00aaaccommodate\u00ba the free exercise ofreligion by relieving people from generally applicable rulesthat interfere with their religious ca llings. See, e. g., Corpo- ration of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints v.Amos, 483 U. S. 327 (1987); see also Sherbert v.Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963). to the505us2110M 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 628 LEE v.WEISMAN Souter, J., concurring views of some,7such accommodation does not necessarily signify an of\u00aecial endorsement of religious observance overdisbelief. In everyday life, we routinely accommodate religious be- liefs that we do not share. A Christian inviting an OrthodoxJew to lunch might take pains to choose a kosher restaurant;an atheist in a hurry might yield the right of way to anAmish man steering a horse-drawn carriage. In so acting,we express respect for, but not endorsement of, the funda-mental values of others. We act without expressing a posi-tion on the theological merit of those values or of religiousbelief in general, and no one perceives us to have taken sucha position. The government may act likewise. Most religions encour- age devotional practices that are at once crucial to the livesof believers and idiosyncratic in the eyes of nonadherents.By de\u00aenition, secular rules of general application are drawn from the nonadherent's vantage and, consequently, fail totake such practices into account. Yet when enforcement ofsuch rules cuts across religious sensibilities, as it often does,it puts those affected to the choice of taking sides betweenGod and government. In such circumstances, accommodat-ing religion reveals nothing beyond a recognition that gen-eral rules can unnecessarily offend the religious consciencewhen they offend the conscience of secular society not at all.Cf.Welsh v.United States, 398 U. S. 333, 340 (1970) (plurality opinion). Thus, in freeing the Native American Churchfrom federal laws forbidding peyote use, see Drug Enforce-ment Administration Miscellaneous Exemptions, 21 CFR 7See, e. g., Thomas v.Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div. , 450 U.

S., 577 (1992) Souter, J., concurring \u00a7 1307.31 (1991), the government conveys no endorsement of peyote rituals, the Church, or religion as such; it simplyrespects the centrality of peyote to the lives of certainAmericans. See Note, The Free Exercise Boundaries ofPermissible Accommodation Under the EstablishmentClause, 99 Yale L. J. 1127, 1135\u00b11136 (1990). B Whatever else may de\u00aene the scope of accommodation per- missible under the Establishment Clause, one requirement isclear: accommodation must lift a discernible burden on thefree exercise of religion. See County of Allegheny, supra, at 601, n. 51; id., at 631\u00b1632 ( J., concurring in and concurring of Presiding Bishop, supra, O\u0092Connor , J., concurring in see also Monthly, supra, at 18, 18\u00b119, n. 8 (plurality opinion); Wallace v.Jaffree, supra, at 57\u00b158, n. 45. But see County of Allegheny, supra, at 663, n. 2 ( Kennedy , J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).Concern for the position of religious individuals in themodern regulatory State cannot justify of\u00aecial solicitudefor a religious practice unburdened by general rules; suchgratuitous largesse would effectively favor religion over dis-belief. By these lights one easily sees that, in sponsoringthe graduation prayers at issue here, the State has crossedthe line from permissible accommodation to unconstitu-tional establishment. Religious students cannot complain that omitting prayers from their graduation ceremony would, in any realistic sense,\u00aaburden\u00ba their spiritual ca llings. To be sure, many of them invest this rite of passage with spiritual signi\u00aecance, butthey may express their religious feelings about it before andafter the ceremony. They may even organize a privatelysponsored baccalaureate if they desire the company of like-minded students. Because they accordingly have no needfor the machinery of the State to af\u00aerm their beliefs, the505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 630 LEE v.WEISMAN Souter, J., government's sponsorship of prayer at the graduation cere- mony is most reasonably understood as an of\u00aecial endorse-ment of religion and, in this instance, of theistic religion.One may fairly say, as one commentator has suggested, thatthe government brought prayer into the ceremony \u00aapreciselybecause some people want a symbolic af\u00aermation that gov-ernment approves and endorses their religion, and becausemany of the people who want this af\u00aermation place little orno value on the costs to religious minorities.\u00ba Laycock,Summary and Synthesis: The Crisis in Religious Liberty, 60Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 841, 844 (1992). 8 Petitioners would de\u00afect this conclusion by arguing that graduation prayers are no different from Presidential reli-gious proclamations and similar of\u00aecial \u00aaacknowledgments\u00baof religion in public life. But religious invocations inThanksgiving Day addresses and the like, rarely noticed, ig-nored without effort, conveyed over an impersonal medium,and directed at no one in particular, inhabit a pallid zoneworlds apart from of\u00aecial prayers delivered to a captive audi-ence of public school students and their families. Madisonhimself respected the difference between the trivial and theserious in constitutional practice. Realizing that his con- 8If the State had chosen its graduation day speakers according to wholly secular criteria, and if one of those speakers (not a state actor) had individ-ually chosen to deliver a religious message, it would have been harder toattribute an endorsement of religion to the State. Cf. Witters v.Washing- ton Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986). But that is not our case. Nor is this a case where the State has, without singling out reli-gious groups or individuals, extended bene\u00aets to them as members ofa broad class of bene\u00aeciaries de\u00aened by clearly secular criteria. 274\u00b1275 696 (opinion of Harlan, J.) (\u00aaIn any particular case the critical question iswhether the circumference of legislation encircles a class so broad that itcan be fairly concluded that religious institutions could be thought to fallwithin the natural perimeter\u00ba). Finally, this is not a case like Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), in which government of\u00aecials invoke spirit- ual inspiration entirely for their own bene\u00aet without directing any reli-gious message at the citizens they lead.505us2110M 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 631 Cite as: 505 U.

These views of course prevent me from joining today's opinion, which is conspicuously bereft of any reference tohistory. In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibitsinvocations and benedictions at public school graduation cer-emonies, the Court\u00d0with nary a mention that it is doing505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 632 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., dissenting so\u00d0lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school grad- uation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of aneven more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarianprayer to God at public celebrations generally. As its in-strument of destruction, the bulldozer of its social engineer-ing, the Court invents a boundless, and boundlessly manipu-lable, test of psychological coercion, which promises to do forthe Establishment Clause what the Durham rule did for the insanity defense. See Durham v.United States, 94 U. S. App. D. C. 228, 214 F. 2d 862 (1954). Today's opinion showsmore forcefully than volumes of argumentation why ourNation's protection, that fortress which is our Constitution,cannot possibly rest upon the changeable philosophical pred-ilections of the Justices of this Court, but must have deepfoundations in the historic practices of our people. I Justice Holmes' aphorism that \u00aaa page of history is worth a volume of logic,\u00ba New York Trust Co. v.Eisner, 256 U.

The history and tradition of our Nation are replete with public ceremonies featuring prayers of thanksgiving and pe-tition. Illustrations of this point have been amply providedin our prior opinions, see, e. g., Lynch, supra, at 674\u00b1678; Marsh, supra, at 786\u00b1788; see also Wallace v.Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 100\u00b1103 (1985) ( Rehnquist, J. , dissenting); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 446\u00b1450, and n. 3 (1962) (Stewart, J., dissenting), but since the Court is so oblivious to our historyas to suggest that the Constitution restricts \u00aapreservationand transmission of religious beliefs . . . to the privatesphere,\u00ba ante, at 589, it appears necessary to provide another brief account. From our Nation's origin, prayer has been a prominent part of governmental ceremonies and proclamations. TheDeclaration of Independence, the document marking ourbirth as a separate people, \u00aaappeal[ed] to the Supreme Judgeof the world for the rectitude of our intentions\u00ba and avowed\u00aaa \u00aerm reliance on the protection of divine Providence.\u00ba Inhis \u00aerst inaugural address, after swearing his oath of of\u00aeceon a Bible, George Washington deliberately made a prayer apart of his \u00aerst of\u00aecial act as President: \u00aa[I]t would be peculiarly improper to omit in this \u00aerst of\u00aecial act my fervent supplications to that AlmightyBeing who rules over the universe, who presides in thecouncils of nations, and whose providential aids can sup-ply every human defect, that His benediction may conse-crate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselvesfor these essential purposes.\u00ba Inaugural Addresses ofthe Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. 101\u00b110,p. 2 (1989). Such supplications have been a characteristic feature of inau- gural addresses ever since. Thomas Jefferson, for example,505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 634 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., prayed in his \u00aerst inaugural address: \u00aa[M]ay that In\u00aenite Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead ourcouncils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue foryour peace and prosperity.\u00ba Id.,at 17. In his second inau- gural address, Jefferson acknowledged his need for divineguidance and invited his audience to join his prayer: \u00aaI shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from theirnative land and planted them in a country \u00afowing withall the necessaries and comforts of life; who has coveredour infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and power, and to whose goodness Iask you to join in supplications with me that He will soenlighten the minds of your servants, guide their coun-cils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever theydo shall result in your good, and shall secure to you thepeace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.\u00ba Id., at 22\u00b123. Similarly, James Madison, in his \u00aerst inaugural address, placed his con\u00aedence \u00aain the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations,whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensedto this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound toaddress our devout gratitude for the past, as well as ourfervent supplications and best hopes for the future.\u00baId.,at 28. Most recently, President Bush, continuing the tradition es- tablished by President Washington, asked those attendinghis inauguration to bow their heads, and made a prayer his\u00aerst of\u00aecial act as President. Id.,at 346. Our national celebration of Thanksgiving likewise dates back to President Washington. As we recounted in Lynch:505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 635 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting \u00aaThe day after the First Amendment was proposed, Congress urged President Washington to proclaim `aday of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed byacknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signalfavours of Almighty God.' President Washington pro-claimed November 26, 1789, a day of thanksgiving to`offe[r] our prayers and supplications to the Great Lordand Ruler of Nations, and beseech Him to pardon ournational and other transgressions . . . .' \u00ba 465 U. S., at675, n. 2 (citations omitted). This tradition of Thanksgiving Proclamations\u00d0with their religious theme of prayerful gratitude to God\u00d0has beenadhered to by almost every President. Id.,at 675, and 2 and 3; Wallace v.Jaffree, supra, at 100\u00b1103 ( Rehnquist, J. , dissenting). The other two branches of the Federal Government also have a long-established practice of prayer at public events.As we detailed in Marsh, congressional sessions have opened with a chaplain's prayer ever since the First Congress. 463U. S., at 787\u00b1788. And this Court's own sessions haveopened with the invocation \u00aaGod save the United States andthis Honorable Court\u00ba since the days of Chief Justice Mar-shall. 1 C. Warren, The Supreme Court in United StatesHistory 469 (1922). In addition to this general tradition of prayer at public ceremonies, there exists a more speci\u00aec tradition of invoca-tions and benedictions at public school graduation exercises.By one account, the \u00aerst public high school graduation cere-mony took place in Connecticut in July 1868\u00d0the verymonth, as it happens, that the Fourteenth Amendment (thevehicle by which the Establishment Clause has been appliedagainst the States) was rati\u00aeed\u00d0when \u00aa15 seniors from theNorwich Free Academy marched in their best Sunday suitsand dresses into a church hall and waited through majesticmusic and long prayers.\u00ba Brodinsky, Commencement RitesObsolete?

As the Court obliquely acknowledges in describing the \u00aacustomaryfeatures\u00ba of high school graduations, ante, at 583, and as re- spondents do not contest, the invocation and benedictionhave long been recognized to be \u00aaas traditional as any otherparts of the [school] graduation program and are widelyestablished.\u00ba H. McKown, Commencement Activities 56(1931); see also Brodinsky, supra, at 5. II The Court presumably would separate graduation invo- cations and benedictions from other instances of public\u00aapreservation and transmission of religious beliefs\u00ba on theground that they involve \u00aapsychological coercion.\u00ba I \u00aend ita suf\u00aecient embarrassment that our Establishment Clausejurisprudence regarding holiday displays, see County of Al- legheny v.American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pitts- burgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 (1989), has come to \u00aarequir[e] scrutiny more commonly associated with interior decoratorsthan with the judiciary.\u00ba American Jewish Congress v. Chicago, 827 F. 2d 120, 129 (CA7 1987) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). But interior decorating is a rock-hard sciencecompared to psychology practiced by amateurs. A few cita-tions of \u00aa[r]esearch in psychology\u00ba that have no particularbearing upon the precise issue here, ante, at 593, cannot dis- guise the fact that the Court has gone beyond the realmwhere judges know what they are doing. The Court's argu-ment that state of\u00aecials have \u00aacoerced\u00ba students to take partin the invocation and benediction at graduation ceremoniesis, not to put too \u00aene a point on it, incoherent. The Court identi\u00aees two \u00aadominant facts\u00ba that it says dic- tate its ruling that invocations and benedictions at publicschool graduation ceremonies violate the EstablishmentClause. Ante, at 586. Neither of them is in any relevant sense true.505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 637 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting A The Court declares that students' \u00aaattendance and partici- pation in the [invocation in a fair andreal sense obligatory.\u00ba Ibid. But what exactly is this \u00aafair and real sense\u00ba? According to the Court, students at gradu-ation who want \u00aato avoid the fact or appearance of participa-tion,\u00ba ante, at 588, in the invocation and benediction are psy- chologically obligated by \u00aapublic pressure, as well as peer pressure, . . . to stand as a group or, at least, maintain re-spectful silence\u00ba during those prayers. Ante, at 593. This assertion\u00d0 the very linchpin of the Court's opinion \u00d0is al- most as intriguing for what it does not say as for what itsays. It does not say, for example, that students are psycho-logically coerced to bow their heads, place their hands in aDu\u00c8rer-like prayer position, pay attention to the prayers, utter \u00aaAmen,\u00ba or in fact pray. (Perhaps further intensivepsychological research remains to be done on these matters.)It claims only that students are psychologically coerced . or,at least, maintain added). Both halves of this disjunctive ( both of which must amount to the fact or appearance of participationin prayer if the Court's analysis is to survive on its ownterms) merit particular attention. To begin with the latter: The Court's notion that a student who simply sits in \u00aarespectful silence\u00ba during the invocation and benediction (when all others are standing) has somehowjoined\u00d0or would somehow be perceived as having joined\u00d0in the prayers is nothing short of ludicrous. We indeed livein a vulgar age. But surely \u00aaour social conventions,\u00ba ibid., have not coarsened to the point that anyone who doesnot stand on his chair and shout obscenities can reasonablybe deemed to have assented to everything said in his pres-ence. Since the Court does not dispute that students ex-posed to prayer at graduation ceremonies retain (despite\u00aasubtle coercive pressures,\u00ba ante, at 588) the free will to sit, cf.ante, at 593, there is absolutely no basis for the Court's505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 638 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., dissenting decision. It is fanciful enough to say that \u00aaa reasonable dis- senter,\u00ba standing head erect in a class of bowed heads, \u00aacouldbelieve that the group exercise signi\u00aeed her own participa-tion or approval of it,\u00ba ibid. It is beyond the absurd to say that she could entertain such a belief while pointedlydeclining to rise. But let us assume the very worst, that the nonparticipat- ing graduate is \u00aasubtly coerced \u00ba...t os t and! Even that half of the disjunctive does not remotely establish a \u00aapartici-pation\u00ba (or an \u00aaappearance of participation\u00ba) in a religiousexercise. The Court acknowledges that \u00aain our culture standin g...c a ns i g n i f y adherence to a view or simple re- spect for the views of others.\u00ba Ibid. (Much more often the latter than the former, I think, except perhaps in theproverbial town meeting, where one votes by standing.)But if it is a permissible inference that one who is standingis doing so simply out of respect for the prayers of othersthat are in progress, then how can it possibly be said that a\u00aareasonable dissente r...c o u l db e l i e v e that the group exer- cise signi\u00aeed her own participation or approval\u00ba? Quite ob-viously, it cannot. I may add, moreover, that maintainingrespect for the religious observances of others is a funda-mental civic virtue that government (including the publicschools) can and should cultivate\u00d0so that even if it were thecase that the displaying of such respect might be mistakenfor taking part in the prayer, I would deny that the dissent-er's interest in avoiding even the false appearance of partici- pation constitutionally trumps the government's interest in fostering respect for religion generally. The opinion manifests that the Court itself has not given careful consideration to its test of psychological coercion.For if it had, how could it observe, with no hint of concern ordisapproval, that students stood for the Pledge of Allegiance,which immediately preceded Rabbi Gutterman's invocation?Ante, at 583. The government can, of course, no more coerce political orthodoxy than religious orthodoxy. West505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 639 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943). Moreover, since the Pledge of Allegiance has been revisedsince Barnette to include the phrase \u00aaunder God,\u00ba recital of the Pledge would appear to raise the same EstablishmentClause issue as the invocation and benediction. If studentswere psychologically coerced to remain standing during theinvocation, they must also have been psychologically coerced,moments before, to stand for (and thereby, in the Court's view,take part in or appear to take part in) the Pledge. Must thePledge therefore be barred from the public schools (bothfrom graduation ceremonies and from the classroom)? InBarnette we held that a public school student could not be compelled to recite the Pledge; we did not even hint that she could not be compelled to observe respectful silence\u00d0indeed,even to stand in respectful silence\u00d0when those who wished to recite it did so. Logically, that ought to be the next proj-ect for the Court's bulldozer. I also \u00aend it odd that the Court concludes that high school graduates may not be subjected to this supposed psychologi-cal coercion, yet refrains from addressing whether \u00aamatureadults\u00ba may. Ante, at 593. I had thought that the reason graduation from high school is regarded as so signi\u00aecant anevent is that it is generally associated with transition fromadolescence to young adulthood. Many graduating seniors,of course, are old enough to vote. Why, then, does the Courttreat them as though they were \u00aerst-graders? Will we soonhave a jurisprudence that distinguishes between mature andimmature adults? B The other \u00aadominant fac[t]\u00ba identi\u00aeed by the Court is that \u00aa[s]tate of\u00aecials direct the performance of a formal religiousexercise\u00ba at school graduation ceremonies. Ante, at 586. \u00aaDirect[ing] the performance of a formal religious exercise\u00bahas a sound of liturgy to it, summoning up images of the princi-pal directing acolytes where to carry the cross, or showing therabbi where to unroll the Torah. A Court professing to be505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 640 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., dissenting engaged in a \u00aadelicate and fact-sensitive\u00ba line-drawing, ante, at 597, would better describe what it means as \u00aaprescribingthe content of an invocation and benediction.\u00ba But eventhat would be false. All the record shows is that principalsof the Providence public schools, acting within their dele-gated authority, have invited clergy to deliver invocationsand benedictions at graduations; and that Principal Lee in-vited Rabbi Gutterman, provided him a two-page pamphlet,prepared by the National Conference of Christians and Jews,giving general advice on inclusive prayer for civic occasions,and advised him that his prayers at graduation should benonsectarian. How these facts can fairly be transformedinto the charges that Principal Lee \u00aadirected and controlledthe content of [Rabbi that school of\u00aecials prayers,' \u00ba ante, at 588, and that \u00aagovernment involvement with religious activity in this caseis pervasive,\u00ba ante, at 587, is dif\u00aecult to fathom. The Court identi\u00aees nothing in the record remotely suggesting thatschool of\u00aecials have ever drafted, edited, screened, or cen-sored graduation prayers, or that Rabbi Gutterman was amouthpiece of the school of\u00aecials. These distortions of the record are, of course, not harmless error: without them the Court's solemn assertion that theschool of\u00aecials could reasonably be perceived to be \u00aaenforc[-ing] a religious orthodoxy,\u00ba ante, at 592, would ring as hollow as it ought. III The deeper \u00afaw in the Court's opinion does not lie in its wrong answer to the question whether there was state-induced \u00aapeer-pressure\u00ba coercion; it lies, rather, in theCourt's making violation of the Establishment Clause hingeon such a precious question. The coercion that was a hall-mark of historical establishments of religion was coercion ofreligious orthodoxy and of \u00aenancial support by force of law and threat of penalty.

Thus, for example, in the Colony ofVirginia, where the Church of England had been established,ministers were required by law to conform to the doctrineand rites of the Church of England; and all persons wererequired to attend church and observe the Sabbath, weretithed for the public support of Anglican ministers, and weretaxed for the costs of building and repairing churches. Id., at 3\u00b14. The Establishment Clause was adopted to prohibit such an establishment of religion at the federal level (and to protectstate establishments of religion from federal interference).I will further acknowledge for the sake of argument that, assome scholars have argued, by 1790 the term \u00aaestablish-ment\u00ba had acquired an additional meaning\u00d0\u00aa\u00aenancial sup-port of religion generally, by public taxation\u00ba\u00d0that re\u00afectedthe development of \u00aageneral or multiple\u00ba establishments, notlimited to a single church. Id.,at 8\u00b19. But that would still be an establishment coerced by force of law. And I will fur- ther concede that our constitutional tradition, from the Dec-laration of Independence and the \u00aerst inaugural address ofWashington, quoted earlier, down to the present day, has,with a few aberrations, see Church of Holy Trinity v.United States, 143 U. S. 457 (1892), ruled out of order government- sponsored endorsement of religion\u00d0even when no legalcoercion is present, and indeed even when no ersatz, \u00aapeer-pressure\u00ba psycho-coercion is present\u00d0where the endorse-ment is sectarian, in the sense of specifying details uponwhich men and women who believe in a benevolent, omni-potent Creator and Ruler of the world are known to differ(for example, the divinity of Christ). But there is simply nosupport for the proposition that the of\u00aecially sponsorednondenominational invocation and benediction read OPINPGT 642 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., dissenting them\u00d0violated the Constitution of the United States. To the contrary, they are so characteristically American theycould have come from the pen of George Washington orAbraham Lincoln himself. Thus, while I have no quarrel with the Court's general proposition that the Establishment Clause \u00aaguarantees thatgovernment may not coerce anyone to support or participatein religion or its exercise,\u00ba ante, at 587, I see no warrant for expanding the concept of coercion beyond acts backed bythreat of penalty\u00d0a brand of coercion that, happily, isreadily discernible to those of us who have made a career ofreading the disciples of Blackstone rather than of Freud.The Framers were indeed opposed to coercion of religiousworship by the National Government; but, as their own spon-sorship of nonsectarian prayer in public events demon- strates, they understood that \u00aa[s]peech is not coercive; thelistener may do as he likes.\u00ba American Jewish Congress v. Chicago, 827 F. 2d, at 132 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). This historical discussion places in revealing perspective the Court's extravagant claim that the State has \u00aafor allpractical purposes,\u00ba ante, at 589, and \u00aain every practical sense,\u00ba ante, at 598, compelled students to participate in prayers at graduation. Beyond the fact, stipulated to by theparties, that attendance at graduation is voluntary, there isnothing in the record to indicate that failure of attendingstudents to take part in the invocation or benediction wassubject to any penalty or discipline. Contrast this with, forexample, the facts of Barnette: Schoolchildren were required by law to recite the Pledge of Allegiance; failure to do soresulted in expulsion, threatened the expelled child with theprospect of being sent to a reformatory for criminally in-clined juveniles, and subjected his parents to prosecution(and incarceration) for causing delinquency. 319 U. S., at629\u00b1630. To characterize the \u00aasubtle coercive pressures,\u00baante, at 588, allegedly 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 643 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting lent of the legal sanctions in Barnette i s...w e l l ,l e tm e just say it is not a \u00aadelicate and fact-sensitive\u00ba analysis. The Court relies on our \u00aaschool prayer\u00ba cases, Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962), and School Dist. of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963). Ante, at 592. But whatever the merit of those cases, they do not support, much less com-pel, the Court's psycho-journey. In the \u00aerst place, Engel and Schempp do not constitute an exception to the rule, dis- tilled from historical practice, that public ceremonies mayinclude prayer, see supra, at 633\u00b1636; rather, they simply do not fall within the scope of the rule (for the obvious reason that school instruction is not a public ceremony). Second, wehave made clear our understanding that school prayer occurswithin a framework in which legal coercion to attend school(i. e., coercion under threat of penalty) provides the ultimate backdrop. In Schempp, for example, we emphasized that the prayers were \u00aaprescribed as part of the curricular activi-ties of students who are required by law to attend school.\u00ba 374 U. S., at 223 (emphasis added). Engel 's suggestion that the school prayer program at issue there\u00d0which permittedstudents \u00aato remain silent or be excused from S., at 430\u00d0involved \u00aaindirect coercive pressure,\u00ba id.,at 431, should be understood against this backdrop of legal coer-cion. The question whether the opt-out procedure in Engel suf\u00aeced to dispel the coercion resulting from the mandatoryattendance requirement is quite different from the questionwhether forbidden coercion exists in an environment utterly devoid of legal compulsion. And \u00aenally, our school prayer cases turn in part on the fact that the classroom is inherentlyan instructional setting, and daily prayer there\u00d0whereparents are not present to counter \u00aathe students' emulationof teachers as role models and the children's susceptibilityto peer pressure,\u00ba Edwards v.Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 584 (1987)\u00d0might be thought to raise special concerns regardingstate interference with the liberty of parents to direct thereligious upbringing of their children: \u00aaFamilies entrust pub-505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 644 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., dissenting lic schools with the education of their children, but condition their trust on the understanding that the classroom willnot purposely be used to advance religious views that maycon\u00afict with the private beliefs of the student and his orher family.\u00ba Ibid.; seePierce v.Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534\u00b1535 (1925). Voluntary prayer at graduation\u00d0a one-time ceremony at which parents, friends, and relatives arepresent\u00d0can hardly be thought to raise the same concerns. IV Our Religion Clause jurisprudence has become bedeviled (so to speak) by reliance on formulaic abstractions that arenot derived from, but positively con\u00afict with, our long-accepted constitutional traditions. Foremost among thesehas been the so-called Lemon test, see Lemon v.Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612\u00b1613 (1971), which has received well-earnedcriticism from many Members of this Court. See, e. g., County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 655\u00b1656 (opinion 108\u00b1112 (Rehnquist, dissenting); Roemer Md., 426 U. S. 736, 768\u00b1769 (1976) ( White, J., concurring in judgment). The Court today demonstrates the irrelevance of Lemon by essentially ignoring it, see ante, at 587, and the interment of that case may be the one happybyproduct of the Court's otherwise lamentable decision. Un-fortunately, however, the Court has replaced Lemon with its psycho-coercion test, which suffers the double disability ofhaving no roots whatever in our people's historic practice,and being as in\u00aenitely expandable as the reasons for psycho-therapy itself. Another happy aspect of the case is that it is only a juris- prudential disaster and not a practical one. Given the oddbasis for the Court's decision, invocations and benedictionswill be able to be given at public school graduations next505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 645 Cite as: 505 U. S. 577 (1992) Scalia, J., dissenting June, as they have for the past century and a half, so long as school authorities make clear that anyone who abstains fromscreaming in protest does not necessarily participate in theprayers. All that is seemingly needed is an announcement,or perhaps a written insertion at the beginning of the gradu-ation program, to the effect that, while all are asked to risefor the invocation and benediction, none is compelled to joinin them, nor will be assumed, by rising, to have done so.That obvious fact recited, the graduates and their parentsmay proceed to thank God, as Americans have always done,for the blessings He has generously bestowed on them andon their country. *** The reader has been told much in this case about the per- sonal interest of Mr. Weisman and his daughter, and verylittle about the personal interests on the other side. Theyare not inconsequential. Church and state would not besuch a dif\u00aecult subject if religion were, as the Court appar-ently thinks it to be, some purely personal avocation that canbe indulged entirely in secret, like pornography, in the pri-vacy of one's room. For most believers it is not that, and has never been. Religious men and women of almost alldenominations have felt it necessary to acknowledge andbeseech the blessing of God as a people, and not just as indi-viduals, because they believe in the \u00aaprotection of divineProvidence,\u00ba as the Declaration of Independence put it, notjust for individuals but for societies; because they believeGod to be, as Washington's \u00aerst Thanksgiving Proclamationput it, the \u00aaGreat Lord and Ruler of Nations.\u00ba One can be-lieve in the effectiveness of such public worship, or one candeprecate and deride it. But the longstanding Americantradition of prayer at of\u00aecial ceremonies displays with unmis-takable clarity that the Establishment Clause does not forbidthe government to accommodate it. The narrow context of the present case involves a commu- nity's celebration of one of the milestones in its young citi-505us2110K 04-22-99 18:57:00 PAGES OPINPGT 646 LEE v.WEISMAN Scalia, J., dissenting zens' lives, and it is a bold step for this Court to seek to banish from that occasion, and from thousands of similar cele-brations throughout this land, the expression of gratitude toGod that a majority of the community wishes to make. Theissue before us today is not the abstract philosophical ques-tion whether the alternative of frustrating this desire of areligious majority is to be preferred over the alternative ofimposing \u00aapsychological coercion,\u00ba or a feeling of exclusion,upon nonbelievers. Rather, the question is whether a man- datory choice in favor of the former has been imposed by the United States Constitution. As the age-old practices of our people show, the answer to that question is not at allin doubt. I must add one \u00aenal observation: The Founders of our Re- public knew the fearsome potential of sectarian religious be-lief to generate civil dissension and civil strife. And theyalso knew that nothing, absolutely nothing, is so inclined tofoster among religious believers of various faiths a tolera-tion\u00d0no, an affection\u00d0for one another than voluntarily join-ing in prayer together, to the God whom they all worshipand seek. Needless to say, no one should be compelled todo that, but it is a shame to deprive our public culture of theopportunity, and indeed the encouragement, for people to doit voluntarily. The Baptist or Catholic who heard and joinedin the simple and inspiring prayers of Rabbi Gutterman onthis of\u00aecial and patriotic occasion was inoculated from reli-gious bigotry and prejudice in a manner that cannot be repli-cated. To deprive our society of that important unifyingmechanism, in order to spare the nonbeliever what seems tome the minimal inconvenience of standing or even sitting inrespectful nonparticipation, is as senseless in policy as it isunsupported in law. For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 647 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit No. 90\u00b1857. Argued October 9, 1991\u00d0Reargued February 24, 1992\u00d0 Decided June 24, 1992 In February 1980, petitioner Doggett was indicted on federal drug charges, but he left the country before the Drug Enforcement Agencycould secure his arrest. The DEA knew that he was later imprisonedin Panama, but after requesting that he be expelled back to the UnitedStates, never followed up on his status. Once the DEA discovered thathe had left Panama for Colombia, it made no further attempt to locatehim. Thus, it was unaware that he reentered this country in 1982 andsubsequently married, earned a college degree, found steady employ-ment, lived openly under his own name, and stayed within the law. TheMarshal's Service eventually located him during a simple credit checkon individuals with outstanding warrants. He was arrested in Septem-ber 1988, 8 1/2years after his indictment. He moved to dismiss the in- dictment on the ground that the Government's failure to prosecute himearlier violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, but theDistrict Court denied the motion, and he entered a conditional guiltyplea. The Court of Appeals af\u00aermed. Held: The delay between Doggett's indictment and arrest violated his right to a speedy trial. His claim meets the Barker v.Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 530, criteria for evaluating speedy trial claims. First, the extraor-dinary 8 1/2-year lag between his indictment and arrest clearly suf\u00aeces to trigger the speedy trial enquiry. Second, the Government was toblame for the delay. The District Court's \u00aending that the Governmentwas negligent in pursuing Doggett should be viewed with considerabledeference, and neither the Government nor the record provides any rea-son to reject that \u00aending. Third, Doggett asserted in due course hisright to a speedy trial. The courts below found that he did not knowof his indictment before his arrest, and, in the factual basis supportinghis guilty plea, the Government essentially conceded this point. Fi-nally, the negligent delay between Doggett's indictment and arrest pre-sumptively prejudiced his ability to prepare an adequate defense. TheGovernment errs in arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause does not sig-ni\u00aecantly protect a defendant's interest in fair adjudication. United States v.Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320\u00b1323; United States v.MacDo nald, 456 U. S. 1, 8; United States v.Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 648 DOGGETT the Court guished. Nor does Doggett's failure to cite any speci\u00aecally demonstra- ble prejudice doom his claim, since excessive delay can compromise atrial's reliability in unidenti\u00aeable ways. Presumptive prejudice is partof the mix of relevant Barker factors and increases in importance with the length of the delay. Here, the Government's egregious persistencein failing to prosecute Doggett is suf\u00aecient to warrant granting relief.The negligence caused delay six times as long as that generally deemedsuf\u00aecient to trigger judicial review, and the presumption of prejudiceis neither extenuated, as by Doggett's acquiescence, nor 906 F. 2d 573, reversed and remanded.

With them on the briefs were Solicitor General Starr, Ronald J. Mann, and Patty Merkamp Stemler. Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. In this case we consider whether the delay of 8 1/2years between petitioner's indictment and arrest violated his SixthAmendment right to a speedy trial. We hold that it did. I On February 22, 1980, petitioner Marc Doggett was in- dicted for conspiring with several others to import and dis-tribute cocaine. See 84 Stat. 1265, 1291, as amended, 21U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 963. Douglas Driver, the Drug EnforcementAdministration's (DEA's) principal agent investigating theconspiracy, told the United States Marshal's Service that theDEA would oversee the apprehension of Doggett and hisconfederates. On March 18, 1980, two police out505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 649 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Opinion of the Court under Driver's orders to arrest Doggett at his parents' house in Raleigh, North Carolina, only to \u00aend that he was notthere. His mother told the of\u00aecers that he had left forColombia four days earlier. To catch Doggett on his return to the United States, Driver sent word of his outstanding arrest warrant to allUnited States Customs stations and to a number of law en-forcement organizations. He also placed Doggett's name inthe Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS),a computer network that helps Customs agents screen peopleentering the country, and in the National Crime Information Center computer system, which serves similar ends. TheTECS entry expired that September, however, and Doggett'sname vanished from the system. In September 1981, Driver found out that Doggett was under arrest on drug charges in Panama and, thinking thata formal extradition request would be futile, simply askedPanama to \u00aaexpel\u00ba Doggett to the United States. Althoughthe Panamanian authorities promised to comply when theirown proceedings had run their course, they freed Doggettthe following July and let him go to Colombia, where hestayed with an aunt for several months. On September 25,1982, he passed unhindered through Customs in New YorkCity and settled down in Virginia. Since his return to theUnited States, he has married, earned a college degree,found a steady job as a computer operations manager, livedopenly under his own name, and stayed within the law. Doggett's travels abroad had not wholly escaped the Gov- ernment's notice, however. In 1982, the American Embassyin Panama told the State Department of his departure toColombia, but that information, for whatever reason, eludedthe DEA, and Agent Driver assumed for several years thathis quarry was still serving time in a Panamanian prison.Driver never asked DEA of\u00aecials in Panama to check intoDoggett's status, and only after his own fortuitous assign-ment to that country in 1985 did he discover Doggett's depar-505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 650 DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court ture for Colombia. Driver then simply assumed Doggett had settled there, and he made no effort to \u00aend out for sureor to track Doggett down, either abroad or in the UnitedStates. Thus Doggett remained lost to the American crimi-nal justice system until September 1988, when the Marshal'sService ran a simple credit check on several thousand peoplesubject to outstanding arrest warrants and, within minutes,found out where Doggett lived and worked. On September5, 1988, nearly 6 years after his return to the United Statesand 8 1/2years after his indictment, Doggett was arrested. He naturally moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the Government's failure to prosecute him earlier vio-lated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. TheFederal Magistrate hearing his motion applied the criteriafor assessing speedy trial claims set out in Barker v.Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972): \u00aa[l]ength of delay, the reason for thedelay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice tothe defendant.\u00ba Id.,at 530 (footnote omitted). The Magis- trate found that the delay between Doggett's indictment andarrest was long enough to be \u00aapresumptively prejudicial,\u00baMagistrate's Report, reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 27\u00b128, that the delay \u00aaclearly [was] attributable to the negli-gence of the government,\u00ba id.,at 39, and that Doggett could not be faulted for any delay in asserting his right to a speedytrial, there being no evidence that he had known of thecharges against him until his arrest, id.,at 42\u00b144. The Mag- istrate also found, however, that Doggett had made no af-\u00aermative showing that the delay had impaired his ability tomount a successful defense or had otherwise prejudiced him.In his recommendation to the District Court, the Magistratecontended that this failure to demonstrate particular preju-dice suf\u00aeced to defeat Doggett's speedy trial claim. The District Court took the recommendation and denied Doggett's motion. Doggett then entered a conditional guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2),505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 651 Cite as: 505 U.

A split panel of the Court of Appeals af\u00aermed. 906 F. 2d 573 (CA11 1990). Following Circuit Ring- staff v.Howard, 885 F. 2d 1542 (CA11 1989) (en banc), the court ruled that Doggett could prevail only by proving \u00aaac-tual prejudice\u00ba or by establishing that \u00aathe \u00aerst threeBarker factors weigh[ed] heavily in his favor.\u00ba 906 F. 2d, at 582. The majority agreed with the Magistrate that Doggetthad not shown actual prejudice, and, attributing the Govern-ment's delay to \u00aanegligence\u00ba rather than \u00aabad faith,\u00ba id.,at 578\u00b1579, it concluded that Barker 's \u00aerst three factors did not weigh so heavily against the Government as to make proofof speci\u00aec prejudice unnecessary. Judge Clark dissented,arguing, among other things, that the majority had placedundue emphasis on Doggett's inability to prove actualprejudice. We granted Doggett's petition for certiorari, 498 U. S. 1119 (1991), and now reverse. II The Sixth Amendment guarantees that, \u00aa[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy...t r i a l.... \u00ba O ni t s face, the Speedy Trial Clause is writ- ten with such breadth that, taken literally, it would forbidthe government to delay the trial of an \u00aaaccused\u00ba for anyreason at all. Our cases, however, have quali\u00aeed the literalsweep of the provision by speci\u00aecally recognizing the rele-vance of four separate enquiries: whether delay before trialwas uncommonly long, whether the government or the crimi-nal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, indue course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial,and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay's result. SeeBarker, supra, at 530. The \u00aerst of these is actually a double enquiry. Simply to trigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege thatthe interval between accusation and trial has crossed the505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 652 DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES the Court threshold dividing ordinary from \u00aapresumptively prejudicial\u00ba delay, 407 U. S., at 530\u00b1531, since, by de\u00aenition, he cannotcomplain that the government has denied him a \u00aaspeedy\u00batrial if it has, in fact, prosecuted his case with customarypromptness. If the accused makes this showing, the courtmust then consider, as one factor among several, the extentto which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimumneeded to trigger judicial examination of the claim. See id., at 533\u00b1534. This latter enquiry is signi\u00aecant to the speedytrial analysis because, as we discuss below, the presumptionthat pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensi\u00aeesover time. In this case, the extraordinary 8 1/2-year lag be- tween Doggett's indictment and arrest clearly suf\u00aeces totrigger the speedy trial enquiry; 1its further signi\u00aecance within that enquiry will be dealt with later. As for Barker 's second criterion, the Government claims to have sought Doggett with diligence. The \u00aendings of thecourts below are to the contrary, however, and we reviewtrial court determinations of negligence with considerabledeference. See Cooter States, 348 U. S. 19, 20\u00b122 (1954); 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice andProcedure \u00a7 2590 (1971). The Government gives us nothingto gainsay the \u00aendings that have come up to us, and we seenothing fatal to them in the record. For six years, the Gov-ernment's investigators made no serious effort to test theirprogressively more questionable assumption that Doggett 1Depending on the nature of the charges, the lower courts have gener- ally found postaccusation delay \u00aapresumptively prejudicial\u00ba at least as itapproaches one year. See 2 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure\u00a7 18.2, p. 405 (1984); Joseph, Speedy Trial Rights in Application, 48 Ford.L. Rev. 611, 623, n. 71 (1980) (citing cases). We note that, as the term isused in this threshold context, \u00aapresumptive prejudice\u00ba does not necessar-ily indicate a statistical probability of prejudice; it simply marks the pointat which courts deem the delay unreasonable enough to trigger the Barker enquiry. Cf. U viller, Barker v.Wingo: Speedy Trial Gets a Fast OPINPGT 653 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Opinion of the Court was living abroad, and, had they done so, they could have found him within minutes. While the Government's leth-argy may have re\u00afected no more than Doggett's relativeunimportance in the world of drug traf\u00aecking, it was still\u00aendable negligence, and the \u00aending stands. The Government goes against the record again in suggest- ing that Doggett knew of his indictment years before he wasarrested. Were this true, Barker 's third factor, concerning invocation of the right to a speedy trial, would be weighedheavily against him. But here again, the Government istrying to revisit the facts. At the hearing on Doggett'sspeedy trial motion, it introduced no evidence challengingthe testimony of Doggett's wife, who said that she did notknow of the charges until his arrest, and of his mother, whoclaimed not to have told him or anyone else that the policehad come looking for him. From this the Magistrate implic-itly concluded, Magistrate's Report, reprinted at App. to Pet.for Cert. 42\u00b144, and the Court of Appeals expressly reaf-\u00aermed, 906 F. 2d, at 579\u00b1580, that Doggett had won theevidentiary battle on this point. Not only that, but in thefactual basis supporting Doggett's guilty plea, the Govern-ment explicitly conceded that it had \u00aano information that Doggett was aware of the indict- ment before he left the United States in March 1980, orprior to his arrest. His mother testi\u00aeed at the suppres-sion hearing that she never told him, and Barnes andRiddle [Doggett's confederates] state they did not havecontact with him after their arrest [in 1980].\u00ba 2 Rec-ord, Exh. 63, p. 2. While one of the Government's lawyers later expressed amazement that \u00aathat particular stipulation is in the factualbasis,\u00ba Tr. 13 (Mar. 31, 1989), he could not make it go away,and the trial and appellate courts were entitled to acceptthe defense's unrebutted and DOGGETT Opinion of the Court Doggett's ignorance. Thus, Doggett is not to be taxed for invoking his speedy trial right only after his arrest. III The Government is left, then, with its principal contention: that Doggett fails to make out a successful speedy trial claimbecause he has not shown precisely how he was prejudicedby the delay between his indictment and trial. A We have observed in prior cases that unreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial threatens to producemore than one sort of harm, including \u00aaoppressive pretrialincarceration,\u00ba \u00aaanxiety and concern of the accused,\u00ba and\u00aathe possibility that the [accused's] defense will be impaired\u00baby dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.Barker, 407 U. S., at 532; see also Smith v.Hooey, 393 U. S. 374, 377\u00b1379 (1969); United States v.Ewell, 383 U. S. 116, 120 (1966). Of these forms of prejudice, \u00aathe most serious is thelast, because the inability of a defendant adequately to pre-pare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u00ba 407U. S., at 532. Doggett claims this kind of prejudice, andthere is probably no other kind that he can claim, since hewas subjected neither to pretrial detention nor, he hassuccessfully contended, to awareness of unresolved chargesagainst him. The Government answers Doggett's claim by citing lan- guage in three cases, United States v.Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320\u00b1323 (1971), United States v.MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 8 (1982), and United States v.Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312 (1986), for the proposition that the Speedy Trial Clause doesnot signi\u00aecantly protect a criminal defendant's interest infair adjudication. In so arguing, the Government asks us,in effect, to read part of Barker right out of the law, and that we will not do. In context, the cited passages supportnothing beyond the principle, which we have independently505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 655 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Opinion of the Court based on textual and historical grounds, see Marion, supra, at 313\u00b1320, that the Sixth Amendment right of the accusedto a speedy trial has no application beyond the con\u00aenes ofa formal criminal prosecution. Once triggered by arrest,indictment, or other of\u00aecial accusation, however, the speedytrial enquiry must weigh the effect of delay on the accused'sdefense just as it has to weigh any other form of prejudicethat Barker recognized. 2See Moore v.Arizona, 414 U. S. n. at 377\u00b1379; at 120. As an alternative to limiting Barker, the Government claims Doggett has failed to make any af\u00aermative showingthat the delay weakened his ability to raise speci\u00aec defenses,elicit speci\u00aec testimony, or produce speci\u00aec items of evidence.Though Doggett did indeed come up short in this respect,the Government's argument takes it only so far: consider-ation of prejudice is not limited to the speci\u00aecally demonstra-ble, and, as it concedes, Brief for United States 28, n. 21;Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u00b134 (Feb. 24, 1992), af\u00aermative proof ofparticularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trialclaim. See Moore, supra, at 26; Barker, supra, at explicitly recognized impairment of one's de- fense is the most dif\u00aecult form of speedy trial prejudice toprove because time's erosion of exculpatory evidence andtestimony \u00aacan rarely be shown.\u00ba 407 U. S., at 532. Andthough time can tilt the case against either side, see id.,at 521; Loud Hawk, supra, at 315, one cannot generally be sure which of them it has prejudiced more severely. Thus, wegenerally have to recognize that excessive delay presump-tively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that nei-ther party can prove or, for that matter, identify. While 2Thus, we reject the Government's argument that the effect of delay on adjudicative accuracy is exclusively a matter for consideration under theDue Process Clause. We leave intact our earlier observation, see United States v.MacDo nald, 456 U. S. 1, 7 (1982), that a defendant may invoke due process to challenge delay both before and after of\u00aecial accusation.505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:35 PAGES OPINPGT 656 DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES Opinion of the Court such presumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a Sixth Amendment claim without regard to the other Barker crite- ria, see Loud Hawk, supra, at 315, it is part of the mix of relevant facts, and its importance increases with the lengthof delay. B This brings us to an enquiry into the role that presumptive prejudice should play in the disposition of Doggett's speedytrial claim. We begin with hypothetical and somewhat eas-ier cases and work our way to this one. Our speedy trial standards recognize that pretrial delay is often both inevitable and wholly justi\u00aeable. The govern-ment may need time to collect witnesses against the accused,oppose his pretrial motions, or, if he goes into hiding, trackhim down. We attach great weight to such considerationswhen balancing them against the costs of going forward witha trial whose probative accuracy the passage of time hasbegun by degrees to throw into question. See Loud Hawk, supra, at 315\u00b1317. Thus, in this case, if the Government had pursued Doggett with reasonable diligence from his in-dictment to his arrest, his speedy trial claim would fail. In-deed, that conclusion would generally follow as a matter ofcourse however great the delay, so long as Doggett could notshow speci\u00aec prejudice to his defense. The Government concedes, on the other hand, that Dog- gett would prevail if he could show that the Government hadintentionally held back in its prosecution of him to gain someimpermissible advantage at trial. See Brief for UnitedStates 28, n. 21; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u00b134 (Feb. 24, 1992). Thatwe cannot doubt. Barker stressed that of\u00aecial bad faith in causing delay will be weighed heavily against the govern-ment, 407 U. S., at 531, and a bad-faith delay the length ofthis negligent one would present an overwhelming case fordismissal. Between diligent prosecution and bad-faith delay, of\u00aecial negligence in bringing an accused to trial occupies the mid-505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 657 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Opinion of the Court dle ground. While not compe lling relief in e very case where bad-faith delay would make relief virtually automatic, nei-ther is negligence automatically tolerable simply because theaccused cannot demonstrate exactly how it has prejudicedhim. It was on this point that the Court of Appeals erred,and on the facts before us, it was reversible error. Barker made it clear that \u00aadifferent weights [are to be] assigned to different reasons\u00ba for delay. Ibid. Although negligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than adeliberate intent to harm the accused's defense, it still fallson the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unac- ceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once ithas begun. And such is the nature of the prejudice pre-sumed that the weight we assign to of\u00aecial negligence com-pounds over time as the presumption of evidentiary preju-dice grows. Thus, our toleration of such negligence variesinversely with its protractedness, cf. Arizona v.Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51 (1988), and its consequent threat to the fairnessof the accused's trial. Condoning prolonged and unjusti\u00ae-able delays in prosecution would both penalize many defend-ants for the state's fault and simply encourage the govern-ment to gamble with the interests of criminal suspectsassigned a low prosecutorial priority. The Government, in-deed, can hardly complain too loudly, for persistent neglect inconcluding a criminal prosecution indicates an uncommonlyfeeble interest in bringing an accused to justice; the moreweight the Government attaches to securing a conviction,the harder it will try to get it. To be sure, to warrant granting relief, negligence unac- companied by particularized trial prejudice must have lastedlonger than negligence demonstrably causing such prejudice.But even so, the Government's egregious persistence in fail-ing to prosecute Doggett is clearly suf\u00aecient. The lag be-tween Doggett's indictment and arrest was 8 1/2years, and he would have faced trial 6 years earlier than he did but for theGovernment's inexcusable oversights. The DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting delay attributable to the Government's negligence far ex- ceeds the threshold needed to state a speedy trial claim;indeed, we have called shorter delays \u00aaextraordinary.\u00ba SeeBarker, supra, at 533. When the Government's negligence thus causes delay six times as long as that generally suf\u00ae-cient to trigger judicial review, see n. 1, supra, and when the presumption of prejudice, albeit unspeci\u00aeed, is neitherextenuated, 3as by the defendant's acquiescence, e. g., 407 U. S., at 534\u00b1536, nor persuasively rebutted,4the defendant is entitled to relief. IV We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and re- mand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion. So ordered. Justice O\u0092Connor , dissenting. I believe the Court of Appeals properly balanced the con- siderations set forth in Barker v.Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972). Although the delay between indictment and trial waslengthy, petitioner did not suffer any anxiety or restrictionon his liberty. The only harm to petitioner from the lapse 3Citing United States v.Broce, 488 U. S. 563, 569 (1989), the Government argues that, by pleading guilty, Doggett waived any right to claim thatthe delay would have prejudiced him had he gone to trial. Brief forUnited States 30. Yet Doggett did not sign a guilty plea simpliciter, but a conditional guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure11(a)(2), thereby securing the Government's explicit consent to his reser-vation of \u00aathe right to appeal the adverse Court ruling on his Motion toDismiss for violation of Constitutional Speedy Trial provisions based uponpost-indictment delay.\u00ba Plea Agreement, 2 Record, Exh. 66, p. 1. Onecannot reasonably construe this agreement to bar Doggett from pursuingas effective an appeal as he could have raised had he not pleaded guilty. 4While the Government ably counters Doggett's efforts to demonstrate particularized trial prejudice, it has not, and probably could not have, af-\u00aermatively proved that the delay left his ability to defend himself unim-paired. Cf. U viller, 72 Colum. L. Rev., at 1394\u00b11395.505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 659 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Thomas, J., dissenting of time was potential prejudice to his ability to defend his case. We have not allowed such speculative harm to tip thescales. Instead, we have required a showing of actual prej-udice to the defense before weighing it in the balance. Aswe stated in United States v.Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 315 (1986), the \u00aapossibility of prejudice is not suf\u00aecient to sup-port respondents' position that their speedy trial rights wereviolated. In this case, moreover, delay is a two-edgedsword. It is the Government that bears the burden of prov-ing its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The passage of timemay make it dif\u00aecult or impossible for the Government tocarry this burden.\u00ba The Court of Appeals followed thisholding, and I believe we should as well. For this reason, Irespectfully dissent. Justice Thomas , with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, dissenting. Just as \u00aabad facts make bad law,\u00ba so too odd facts make odd law. Doggett's 8 1/2-year odyssey from youthful drug dealing in the tobacco country of North Carolina, throughstints in a Panamanian jail and in Colombia, to life as a com-puter operations manager, homeowner, and registered voterin suburban Virginia is extraordinary. But even more ex-traordinary is the Court's conclusion that the Governmentdenied Doggett his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trialdespite the fact that he has suffered none of the harms thatthe right was designed to prevent. I respectfully dissent. I We have long identi\u00aeed the \u00aamajor evils\u00ba against which the Speedy Trial Clause is directed as \u00aaundue and oppressiveincarceration\u00ba and the \u00aaanxiety and concern accompanyingpublic accusation.\u00ba United States v.Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320 (1971). The Court does not, and cannot, seriously dis-pute that those two concerns lie at the heart of the Clause,and that neither concern is implicated here. Doggett was505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 660 DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES Thomas, J., dissenting neither in United States custody nor subject to bail during the entire 81/2-year period at issue. Indeed, as this case comes to us, we must assume that he was blissfully unawareof his indictment all the while, and thus was not subjectto the anxiety or humiliation that typically accompanies aknown criminal charge. Thus, this unusual case presents the question whether, in- dependent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clauseprotects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudiceto his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time;and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commis-sion of his crime. The Court today proclaims that the \u00aerstof these additional harms is indeed an independent concernof the Clause, and on that basis compels reversal of Doggett'sconviction and outright dismissal of the indictment againsthim. As to the second of these harms, the Court remainsmum\u00d0despite the fact that we requested supplementalbrie\u00aeng on this very point. 1 I disagree with the Court's analysis. In my view, the Sixth Amendment's speedy trial guarantee does not provideindependent protection against either prejudice to an ac-cused's defense or the disruption of his life. I shall considereach in turn. A As we have explained, \u00aathe Speedy Trial Clause's core concern is impairment of liberty. \u00baUnited States v.Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312 (1986) (emphasis added). When- ever a criminal trial takes place long after the events atissue, the defendant may be prejudiced in any number ofways. But \u00aa[t]he Speedy Trial Clause does not purport to 1See 502 U. S. 976 (1991) (directing the parties to brief the question \u00aawhether the history of the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendmentsupports the view that the Clause protects a right of citizens to repose,free from the fear of secret or unknown indictments for past crimes, inde-pendent of any interest in preventing lengthy pretrial incarceration orprejudice to the case of a criminal defendant\u00ba).505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 661 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Thomas, J., dissenting protect a defendant from all effects \u00afowing from a delay be- fore trial.\u00ba Id., at 311. The Clause is directed not gen- erally against delay-related prejudice, but against delay-related prejudice to a defendant's liberty. \u00aaThe speedy trialguarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthyincarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but never-theless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an ac-cused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption oflife caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminalcharges.\u00ba United States v.MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1, 8 (1982). Thus, \u00aawhen defendants are not incarcerated or subjected to other substantial restrictions on their liberty, a court shouldnot weigh that time towards a claim under the Speedy TrialClause.\u00ba Loud Hawk, supra, at 312. A lengthy pretrial delay, of course, may prejudice an ac- cused's ability to defend himself. But, we have explained,prejudice to the defense is not the sort of impairment of lib-erty against which the Clause is directed. \u00aaPassage of time,whether before or after arrest, may impair memories, causeevidence to be lost, deprive the defendant of witnesses, andotherwise interfere with his ability to defend himself. But this possibility of prejudice at trial is not itself suf\u00aecientreason to wrench the Sixth Amendment from its proper con-text. \u00baMarion, supra, at 321\u00b1322 (footnote omitted; empha- sis added). Even though a defendant may be prejudiced bya pretrial delay, and even though the government may beunable to provide a valid justi\u00aecation for that delay, theClause does not come into play unless the delay impairs thedefendant's liberty. \u00aaInordinate delay . . . may impair a de- fendant's ability to present an effective defense. But themajor evils protected against by the speedy trial guaranteeexist quite apart from actual or possible prejudice to an ac- cused's defense.\u00ba 404 U. S., at 320 (emphasis added). These explanations notwithstanding, we have on occasion identi\u00aeed the prevention of prejudice to the defense as anindependent and fundamental objective of the Speedy Trial505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 662 DOGGETT v.UNITED dissenting Clause. In particular, in Barker v.Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 532 (1972), we asserted that the Clause was \u00aadesigned to pro-tect\u00ba three basic interests: \u00aa(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the ac-cused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u00ba See also Smith v.Hooey, 393 U. S. 374, 377\u00b1378 (1969); United States v.Ewell, 383 U. S. 116, 120 (1966). In- deed, the Barker Court went so far as to declare that of these three interests, \u00aathe most serious is the last, because theinability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skewsthe fairness of the entire system.\u00ba 407 U. S., at 532. We are thus confronted with two con\u00aficting lines of au- thority, the one declaring that \u00aalimit[ing] the possibility thatthe defense will be impaired\u00ba is an independent and funda-mental objective of the Speedy Trial Clause, e. g., Barker, supra, at 532, and the other declaring that it is not, e. g., Marion, 404 U. S. 307 (1971); MacDonald, supra; Loud Hawk, supra. The Court refuses to acknowledge this con- \u00afict. Instead, it simply reiterates the relevant languagefrom Barker and asserts that Marion, MacDonald, and Loud Hawk \u00aasupport nothing beyond the principle . . . that the Sixth Amendment right of the accused to a speedy trialhas no application beyond the con\u00aenes of a formal criminalprosecution.\u00ba Ante, at 654\u00b1655. That attempt at reconcili- ation is eminently unpersuasive. It is true, of course, that the Speedy Trial Clause by its terms applies only to an \u00aaaccused\u00ba; the right does not attachbefore indictment or arrest. See Marion, supra, at 313\u00b1315, 320\u00b1322; Dillingham v.United States, 423 U. S. 64, 64\u00b165 (1975) (per curiam). But that limitation on the Clause's protection only con\u00aerms that preventing prejudice to the de-fense is not one of its independent and fundamental objec-tives. For prejudice to the defense stems from the interval between crime and trial, which is quite distinct from the in- terval between accusation and trial. If the Clause were in-505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 663 Cite as: 505 U. S. 647 (1992) Thomas, J., dissenting deed aimed at safeguarding against prejudice to the defense, then it would presumably limit allprosecutions that occur long after the criminal events at issue. A defendant prose-cuted 10 years after a crime is just as hampered in his abilityto defend himself whether he was indicted the week after the crime or the week before the trial\u00d0but no one wouldsuggest that the Clause protects him in the latter situation,where the delay did not substantially impair his liberty,either through oppressive incarceration or the anxiety ofknown criminal charges. Thus, while the Court is correctto observe that the defendants in Marion, MacDonald, and Loud Hawk were not subject to formal criminal prosecution during the lengthy period of delay prior to their trials, thatobservation misses the point of those cases. With respect tothe relevant consideration\u00d0 the defendants' ability to defend themselves despite the passage of time \u00d0they were in pre- cisely the same situation as a defendant who had long sincebeen indicted. The initiation of a formal criminal prosecu-tion is simply irrelevant to whether the defense has beenprejudiced by delay. Although being an \u00aaaccused\u00ba is necessary to trigger the Clause's protection, it is not suf\u00aecient to do so. The touch-stone of the speedy trial right, after all, is the substantialdeprivation of liberty that typically accompanies an \u00aaaccusa-tion,\u00ba notthe accusation itself. That explains why a person who has been arrested but not indicted is entitled to the pro-tection of the Clause, see Dillingham, supra, even though technically he has not been \u00aaaccused\u00ba at all. 2And it ex- 2In this regard, it is instructive to compare the Sixth Amendment's speedy trial right to its right to counsel, which also applies only to an\u00aaaccused.\u00ba The right to counsel, we have held, does not attach until \u00aa `ator after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\u00d0whetherby way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, orarraignment.' \u00ba United States v.Gouveia, 467 U.

See, e. g., United States v.Watson, 599 F. 2d 1149, 1156\u00b11157, and n. 5 (CA2 1979), modi\u00aeed on other grounds sub nom. United States v.Muse, 633 F. 2d 1041 (CA2 1980) (en banc); United States v.Hay, 527 F. 2d 990, 994, and n. 4 (CA10 1975); cf. United States v.Lewis, 907 F. 2d 773, 774, n. 3 (CA8 1990). It is misleading, then, for the Court to accuse the Govern- ment of \u00aaask[ing] us, in effect, to read part of Barker right out of the law,\u00ba ante, at 654, a course the Court resolutely rejects. For the issue here is not simply whether the rele-vant language from Barker should be read out of the law, but whether that language trumps the contrary logic of Marion, MacDonald, and Loud Hawk. The Court's protestations notwithstanding, the two lines of authority cannot be recon-ciled; to reaf\u00aerm the one is to undercut the other. In my view, the choice presented is not a hard one. Bark- er's suggestion that preventing prejudice to the defense is a fundamental and independent objective of the Clause isplainly dictum. Never, until today, have we confronted acase where a defendant subjected to a lengthy delay afterindictment nonetheless failed to suffer any substantial im-pairment of his liberty. I think it fair to say that Barker simply did not contemplate such an unusual situation. More-over, to the extent that the Barker dictum purports to ele- vate considerations of prejudice to the defense to fundamen-tal and independent status under the Clause, it cannot be other words, for purposes of the right to counsel, an \u00aaaccused\u00ba must in fact be accused of a crime; unlike the speedy trial right, it does notattach upon arrest.

To the contrary, \u00aa `the bringingoverly stale criminal charges,' \u00ba Marion, 404 U. S., at 322 (quoting Ewell, 383 U. S., at 122).

S. 25 (1973) (per curiam), is not to the contrary. The petitioner there was tried for murder in Arizona \u00aa[a]lmost three years after he was charged and 28 months afterhe \u00aerst demanded that Arizona either extradite him from California,where he was serving a prison term, or drop a detainer against him.\u00baIbid. The Arizona Supreme Court denied him speedy trial relief on the ground that \u00aaa showing of prejudice to the defense at trial was essentialto establish a federal speedy trial claim.\u00ba Ibid. We rejected that rea- soning, emphasizing the contextual nature of the speedy trial analysis setforth in Barker v.Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972). To hold that a speedy trial claim can succeed without a showing of actual trial prejudice is not, of course, to hold that such a claim can succeedwithout a showing of any prejudice at all. Moore, like Barker, is clearly premised on the assumption that the defendant invoking the protection ofthe Speedy Trial Clause has been subjected to the evils against which theClause was designed to protect. Indeed, Moore makes this assumption quite explicit, observing that prejudice is \u00aa `inevitably present in everycase to some extent, for every defendant will either be incarcerated pend- ing trial or on bail subject to substa ntial restrictions on his liberty. '\u00ba Moore, supra, at 27 (quoting Barker, supra, at 537 ( White, J., concurring)) (emphasis added). While accurate in the vast majority of cases, that ob- servation is not inevitably true\u00d0as PAGES OPINPGT 666 DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES Thomas, J., dissenting courts on an ad hoc basis, they \u00aaprovide predictability by specifying a limit beyond which there is an irrebuttablepresumption that a defendant's right to a fair trial wouldbe prejudiced.\u00ba 404 U. S., at 322. Furthermore, the Due Process Clause always protects defendants against fundamentally unfair treatment by thegovernment in criminal proceedings. See United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783 (1977). As we explained in Marion, \u00aathe Due Process Claus e...w o u l d require dismissal of [an] indictment if it were shown at trial that [a] dela y... caused substantial prejudice to [a defendant's] rights to a fair trialand that the delay was an intentional device to gain tacticaladvantage over the accused.\u00ba 404 U. S., at 324. See alsoMacDonald, 456 U. S., at 8 (\u00aaThe Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is . . . not primarily intended to prevent preju-dice to the defense caused by passage of time; that interestis protected primarily by the Due Process Clause and bystatutes of limitations\u00ba). 4 4The result in the case may well be explained by an improvident con- cession. While the U nited States argued essentially that a defendant's speedy trial rights cannot be violated where he is neither incarcerated norsubject to the anxiety of known criminal charges, it did not claim that thiswas invariably so. Instead, the United States conceded that a defendantwhose liberty was in no way impaired by a pretrial delay could neverthe-less succeed in a speedy trial claim if the government had intentionallycaused the delay for the speci\u00aec purpose of prejudicing the defense orinjuring the defendant in some other signi\u00aecant way. The defendant inthis case is not entitled to relief, the United States asserts, because the delay in bringing him to trial was, at worst, caused by negligence. Not surprisingly, the Court seizes on this concession with relish. See ante, at 655, 656 (citing Brief for United States 28, n. 21, Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u00b134 (Feb. 24, 1992)). For if defendants can bring successful speedy trialclaims even though they have not been \u00aaincarcerated or subjected to othersubstantial restrictions on their liberty,\u00ba United States v.Loud Hawk, 474 U. S. 302, 312 (1986), then the Clause's protections necessarily extend be-yond those core concerns. If the Clause does not protect a defendantwhose liberty has not been impaired by a delay, then it simply does notprotect him; its protections cannot be triggered solely by the government'sbad motives.

B It remains to be considered, however, whether Doggett is entitled to relief under the Speedy Trial Clause because ofthe disruption of his life years after the criminal events atissue. In other words, does the Clause protect a right torepose, free from secret or unknown indictments? In myview, it does not, for much the same reasons set forth above. The common law recognized no right of criminals to re- pose. \u00aaThe maxim of our law has always been `Nullum tem-pus occurrit regi,' [`time does not run against the king'], andas a criminal trial is regarded as an action by the king, itfollows that it may be brought at any time.\u00ba 2 J. Stephen,A History of the Criminal Law of England 1, 2 (1883) (notingexamples of delays in prosecution ranging from 14 to 35years). See also F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Prac- one hand, and bad-faith conduct, on the other. As noted in text, the Due Process Clause is the proper recourse for an accused whose defense is materially prejudiced by bad-faith governmental behavior. See United States v.Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783 (1977); cf. Arizona v.Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51 (1988). The Court, thus, is certainly entitled to decide this particular case ad- versely to the United States on the ground that the concession undercutthe Government's entire argument. But the Court goes much further.It af\u00aermatively endorses the point conceded, thereby embedding in thelaw the mischievous notion that a defendant is entitled to the protectionof the Speedy Trial Clause even though he has suffered none of the harmsagainst which the Clause protects, as long as the government's conduct issuf\u00aeciently culpable. I would disregard the concession, for much the samereasons that we sometimes consider an argument that a litigant haswaived. See, e. g., Arcadia v.Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73, 77 (1990); Kamen v.Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 99\u00b1100 (1991); United States v.Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 246 (1992) ( Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). I see little sense in elevating an unwise concession intounwise law.505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 \u00a7 316, p. 209 (8th ed. 1880) (\u00aaWhil e... courts look with disfavor on prosecutions that have been unduly delayed,there is, at common law, no absolute limitation which pre-vents the prosecution of offences after a speci\u00aeed time hasarrived\u00ba) (footnote omitted); 1 H. Wood, Limitation of Ac-tions \u00a7 28, p. 117 (4th ed. 1916) (\u00aaAt common law there is nolimitation to criminal proceedings by indictment\u00ba). That is not to deny that our legal system has long recog- nized the value of repose, both to the individual and to soci-ety. But that recognition \u00aends expression not in the sweep-ing commands of the Constitution, or in the common law, but in any number of speci\u00aec statutes of limitations enacted bythe federal and state legislatures. Such statutes not onlyprotect a defendant from prejudice to his defense (as dis-cussed above), but also balance his interest in repose againstsociety's interest in the apprehension and punishment ofcriminals. Cf. Toussie v.United States, 397 U. S. 112, 114\u00b1 115 (1970). In general, the graver the offense, the longerthe limitations period; indeed, many serious offenses, suchas murder, typically carry no limitations period at all. See,e. g., Note, The Statute of Limitations in Criminal Law: A Penetrable Barrier to Prosecution, 102 U. Pa. L. Rev. 630,652\u00b1653 (1954) (comparing state statutes of limitations forvarious crimes); Uelmen, Making Sense out of the CaliforniaCriminal Statute of Limitations, 15 Pac. L. J. 35, 76\u00b179 (1983)(same). These statutes refute the notion that our societyever has recognized any general right of criminals to repose. Doggett, however, asks us to hold that a defendant's inter- est in repose is a value independently protected by theSpeedy Trial Clause. He emphasizes that at the time of hisarrest he was \u00aaleading a normal, productive and law-abidinglife,\u00ba and that his \u00aaarrest and prosecution at this late dateinterrupted his life as a productive member of society andforced him to answer for actions taken in the distant past.\u00baSupplemental Brief for Petitioner on Reargument 2.

S. 647 (1992) Thomas, J., dissenting illuminate the protections of the Speedy Trial Clause, not to take the measure of one man's life. There is no basis for concluding that the disruption of an accused's life years after the commission of his alleged crimeis an evil independently protected by the Speedy TrialClause. Such disruption occurs regardless of whether the individual is under indictment during the period of delay.Thus, had Doggett been indicted shortly before his 1988 ar-rest rather than shortly after his 1980 crime, his reposewould have been equally shattered\u00d0but he would not haveeven a colorable speedy trial claim. To recognize a constitu-tional right to repose is to recognize a right to be triedspeedily after the offense. That would, of course, convert the Speedy Trial Clause into a constitutional statute of limi-tations\u00d0a result with no basis in the text or history of theClause or in our precedents. II Our constitutional law has become ever more complex in recent decades. That is, in itself, a regrettable develop-ment, for the law draws force from the clarity of its commandand the certainty of its application. As the complexity oflegal doctrines increases, moreover, so too does the dangerthat their foundational principles will become obscured. Ifear that danger has been realized here. So engrossed isthe Court in applying the multifactor balancing test set forthinBarker that it loses sight of the nature and purpose of the speedy trial guarantee set forth in the Sixth Amendment.The Court's error, in my view, lies not so much in its particu-lar application of the Barker test to the facts of this case, but more fundamentally in its failure to recognize that thespeedy trial guarantee cannot be violated\u00d0and thus Barker does not apply at all\u00d0when an accused is entirely unaware of a pending indictment against him. I do not mean to question Barker 's approach, but merely its scope. We have long recognized that whether an accused505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 670 DOGGETT v.UNITED STATES Thomas, J., dissenting has been denied his right to a speedy trial \u00aadepends upon circumstances.\u00ba Beavers v.Haubert, 198 U. S. 77, 87 (1905). By setting forth a number of relevant factors, Barker pro- vided this contextual inquiry with at least a modicum ofstructure. But Barker 's factors now appear to have taken on a life of their own. Instead of simply guiding the inquirywhether an individual who has been deprived of a liberty protected by the Clause is entitled to relief, Barker has be- come a source for new liberties under the Clause. In myview, application of Barker presupposes that an accused has been subjected to the evils against which the Speedy TrialClause is directed\u00d0and, as I have explained, neither pretrialdelay nor the disruption of life is itself such an evil. 5 Today's opinion, I fear, will transform the courts of the land into boards of law enforcement supervision. For theCourt compels dismissal of the charges against Doggett notbecause he was harmed in any way by the delay between hisindictment and arrest, 6but simply because the Government's efforts to catch him are found wanting. Indeed, the Courtexpressly concedes that \u00aaif the Government had pursuedDoggett with reasonable diligence from his indictment to hisarrest, his speedy trial claim would fail.\u00ba Ante, at 656. Our function, however, is not to slap the Government on the wrist 5To recognize that neither of these considerations provides an independ- ent ground for speedy trial relief, of course, is not to say that neitherof them is relevant to speedy trial analysis. Both may be appropriate considerations in the highly contextual inquiry whether a defendant whohasbeen deprived of a liberty protected by the Clause is entitled to relief. See Barker, 407 U. S., at 530\u00b1533. 6It is quite likely, in fact, that the delay bene\u00aeted Doggett. At the time of his arrest, he had been living an apparently normal, law-abiding life forsome \u00aeve years\u00d0a point not lost on the District Court Judge, who, insteadof imposing a prison term, sentenced him to three years' probation and a$1,000 \u00aene. App. 114\u00b1115. Thus, the delay gave Doggett the opportu-nity to prove what most defendants can only promise: that he no longerposed a threat to society. There can be little doubt that, had he beentried immediately after his cocaine-importation activities, he would havereceived a harsher sentence.505us2111M 07-09-96 20:45:36 PAGES OPINPGT 671 Cite as: 505 U.

Argued March 25, 1992\u00d0Decided June 26, 1992 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and oper- ates three major airports in the New York City area and controls certainterminal areas at the airports (hereinafter terminals), adopted a regula-tion forbidding, inter alia, the repetitive solicitation of money within the terminals. However, solicitation is permitted on the sidewalksoutside the terminal buildings. Petitioner International Society forKrishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON), a not-for-pro\u00aet religious corpo-ration whose members, among other things, solicit funds in public placesto support their movement, brought suit seeking declaratory and injunc-tive relief under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the regulation deprivedits members of their First Amendment rights. The District Courtgranted ISKCON summary judgment, concluding that the terminalswere public fora, and that the regulation banning solicitation failed be-cause it was not narrowly tailored to support a compelling state interest.The Court of Appeals reversed as here relevant. It determined thatthe terminals are not public fora, and found that the ban on solicitationwas reasonable. Held: 1. An airport terminal operated by a public authority is a nonpublic forum, and thus a ban on solicitation need only satisfy a reasonablenessstandard. Pp. 677\u00b1683. (a) The extent to which the Port Authority can restrict expressive activity on its property depends on the nature of the forum. Regula-tion of traditional public fora or designated public fora survives only ifit is narrowly drawn to achieve a compelling state interest, but limita-tions on expressive activity conducted on any other government-ownedproperty need only be reasonable to survive. Perry Ed. Assn. v.Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45, 46. Pp. 677\u00b1679. (b) Neither by tradition nor purpose can the terminals be described as public fora. Airports have not historically been made available forspeech activity. Given the lateness with which the modern air terminalhas made its appearance, it hardly quali\u00aees as a property that has \u00aaim-memorially . . . time out of mind\u00ba been held public trust and used505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 673 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Syllabus for the purposes of expressive activity. See Hague v.Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515. Nor have airport opera- tors opened terminals to such activities, see Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 802, as evidenced by the opera- tors' frequent and continuing litigation in this area. Pp. 679\u00b1681. (c) That speech activities may have historically occurred at \u00aatrans- portation nodes\u00ba such as rail and bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Islandis not relevant. Many of these sites traditionally have had private own-ership. In addition, equating airports with other transportation cen-ters would not take into account differences among the various facilitiesthat may affect the extent to which such facilities can accommodateexpressive activity. It is unsurprising to \u00aend differences among thefacilities. The Port Authority, other airport builders and managers,and the Federal Government all share the view that terminals are dedi-cated to the facilitation of ef\u00aecient air travel, not the solicitation of con-tributions. Pp. 681\u00b1683. 2. The Port Authority's ban on solicitation is reasonable. Solicitation may have a disruptive effect on business by slowing the path of boththose who must decide whether to contribute and those who must altertheir paths to avoid the solicitation. In addition, a solicitor may causeduress by targeting the most vulnerable persons or commit fraud byconcealing his af\u00aeliation or shortchanging purchasers. The fact thatthe targets are likely to be on a tight schedule, and thus are unlikely tostop and complain to authorities, compounds the problem. The PortAuthority has determined that it can best achieve its legitimate interestin monitoring solicitation activity to assure that travelers are not inter-fered with unduly by limiting solicitation to the sidewalk areas outsidethe terminals. That area is frequented by an overwhelming percentageof airport users, making ISKCON's access to the general public quitecomplete. Moreover, it would be odd to conclude that the regulation isunreasonable when the Port Authority has otherwise assured access to auniversally traveled area. While the i nconvenience caused by ISKCON may seem small, the Port Authority could reasonably worry that theincremental effects of having one group and then another seek suchaccess could prove quite disruptive.

The Port Authority owns and operates three majorairports in the greater New York City area: John F. KennedyInternational Airport (Kennedy), La Guardia Airport (LaGuardia), and Newark International Airport (Newark). Thethree airports collectively form one of the world's busiestmetropolitan airport complexes. They serve approximately8% of this country's domestic airline market and more than50% of the trans-Atlantic market. By decade's end they areexpected to serve at least 110 m illion passengers annually. Id.,at 578. The airports are funded by user fees and operated to make a regulated pro\u00aet. Id.,at 581. Most space at the three air- ports is leased to commercial airlines, which bear primaryresponsibility for the leasehold. The Port Authority retainscontrol over unleased portions, including La Guardia's Cen-tral Terminal Building, portions of Kennedy's InternationalArrivals Building, and Newark's North Terminal Building(we refer to these areas collectively as the \u00aaterminals\u00ba).The terminals are generally accessible to the general publicand contain various commercial establishments such as res-taurants, snack stands, bars, newsstands, and stores of vari-ous types. Id.,at 578. Virtually all who visit the terminals do so for purposes related to air travel. These visitors prin-cipally include passengers, those meeting or seeing off pas-sengers, \u00afight crews, and terminal employees. Ibid. The Port Authority has adopted a regulation forbidding within the terminals the repetitive solicitation of money ordistribution of literature. The regulation states: \u00aa1.

The regulation governs only the terminals; the Port Au- thority permits solicitation and distribution on the sidewalksoutside the terminal buildings. The regulation effectivelyprohibits ISKCON from performing sankirtan in the termi- nals. As a result, ISKCON brought suit seeking declara-tory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, allegingthat the regulation worked to deprive its members of rightsguaranteed under the First Amendment. 1The District Court analyzed the claim under the \u00aatraditional publicforum\u00ba doctrine. It concluded that the terminals were akinto public streets, 721 F. Supp. 572, 577 (SDNY 1989), thequintessential traditional public fora.

Under this approach, regulation of speech on gov-ernment property that has traditionally been available forpublic expression is subject to the highest scrutiny.

They also disagreewhether the regulation survives the \u00aareasonableness\u00ba reviewgoverning nonpublic fora, should that prove the appropriatecategory. 4Like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the terminals are nonpublic fora and that the regulation reason-ably limits solicitation. The suggestion that the government has a high burden in justifying speech restrictions relating to traditional publicfora made its \u00aerst appearance in Hague v.Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.

United States v.Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 179\u00b1180 (1983). These precedents foreclose the conclusion that airport terminals are public fora. Re\u00afecting the general growth ofthe air travel industry, airport terminals have only recentlyachieved their contemporary size and character. See H.Hubbard, M. McClintock, & F.

Reg. 35314 (1980). Thus, the tradition of airport ac-tivity does not demonstrate that airports have historicallybeen made available for speech activity. Nor can we saythat these particular terminals, or airport terminals gener-ally, have been intentionally opened by their operators tosuch activity; the frequent and continuing litigation evidenc-505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 681 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Opinion of the Court ing the operators' objections belies any such claim. See n. 2, supra. In short, there can be no argument that society's time-tested judgment, expressed through acquiescence in acontinuing practice, has resolved the issue in petitioners'favor. Petitioners attempt to circumvent the history and practice governing airport activity by pointing our attention to thevariety of speech activity that they claim historically oc-curred at various \u00aatransportation nodes\u00ba such as rail sta-tions, bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island. Even if wewere inclined to accept petitioners' historical account de- scribing speech activity at these locations, an account re-spondent contests, we think that such evidence is of littleimport for two reasons. First, much of the evidence is irrel-evant to public fora analysis, because sites such as bus and rail terminals traditionally have had private ownership. See United Transportation Union v.Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 687 (1982); H. Grant & C. Bohi, The Country Rail-road Station in America 11\u00b115 (1978); U. S. Dept. of Trans-portation, The Intercity Bus Terminal Study 31 (Dec. 1984).The development of privately owned parks that ban speechactivity would not change the public fora status of publiclyheld parks. But the reverse is also true. The practices ofprivately held transportation centers do not bear on thegovernment's regulatory authority over a publicly ownedairport. Second, the relevant unit for our inquiry is an airport, not \u00aatransportation nodes\u00ba generally. When new methods oftransportation develop, new methods for accommodatingthat transportation are also likely to be needed. And witheach new step, it therefore will be a new inquiry whetherthe transportation necessities are compatible with variouskinds of expressive activity. To make a category of \u00aatrans-portation nodes,\u00ba therefore, would unjusti\u00aeably elide whatmay prove to be critical differences of which we should right-fully take account. The \u00aasecurity magnet,\u00ba for example, is505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 682 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Opinion of the Court an airport commonplace that lacks a counterpart in bus terminals and train stations. And public access to air ter-minals is also not infrequently restricted\u00d0just last yearthe Federal Aviation Administration required airports fora 4-month period to limit access to areas normally publiclyaccessible. See 14 CFR 107.11(f) (1991) and U. S. Dept. ofTransportation News Release, Of\u00aece of Assistant Secretaryfor Public Affairs, Jan. 18, 1991. To blithely equate air-ports with other transportation centers, therefore, would bea mistake. The differences among such facilities are unsurprising since, as the Court of Appeals noted, airports are commercialestablishments funded by users fees and designed to make aregulated pro\u00aet, 925 F. 2d, at 581, and where nearly all whovisit do so for some travel related purpose, id.,at 578. As commercial enterprises, airports must provide services at-tractive to the marketplace. In light of this, it cannot fairlybe said that an airport terminal has as a principal purposepromoting \u00aathe free exchange of ideas.\u00ba Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800 (1985). To the contrary, the record demonstrates that PortAuthority management considers the purpose of the termi-nals to be the facilitation of passenger air travel, not thepromotion of expression. Sloane Af\u00aedavit, \u00b6 11, App. 464;Defendant's Civil Rule 3(g) Statement, \u00b6 39, App. 453. Evenif we look beyond the intent of the Port Authority to themanner in which the terminals have been operated, the ter-minals have never been dedicated (except under the threatof court order) to expression in the form sought to be exer-cised here: i. e., the solicitation of contributions and the dis- tribution of literature. The terminals here are far from atypical. Airport build- ers and managers focus their efforts on providing terminalsthat will contribute to ef\u00aecient air travel. See, e. g., R. Hor- onjeff & F. McKelvey, Planning and Design of Airports 326(3d ed. 1983) (\u00aaThe terminal is used to process passengers505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 683 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Opinion of the Court and baggage for the interface with aircraft and the ground transportation modes\u00ba). The Federal Government is in ac-cord; the Secretary of Transportation has been directed topublish a plan for airport development necessary \u00aato antici-pate and meet the needs of civil aeronautics, to meet re- quirements in support of the national defense . . . and to meet identi\u00aeed needs of the Postal Service.\u00ba 49 U. S. C. App.\u00a7 2203(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also 45 Fed. Reg. 35317(1980) (\u00aaThe purpose for which the [Dulles and National air-port] terminal[s] [were] built and maintained is to processand serve air travelers ef\u00aeciently\u00ba). Although many air- ports have expanded their function beyond merely contribut-ing to ef\u00aecient air travel, few have included among theirpurposes the designation of a forum for solicitation and dis-tribution activities. See supra, at 680\u00b1681. Thus, we think that neither by tradition nor purpose can the terminals bedescribed as satisfying the standards we have previously setout for identifying a public forum. The restrictions here challenged, therefore, need only sat- isfy a requirement of reasonableness. We reiterate what westated Kokinda: The restriction \u00aa `need only be reason- able; it need not be the most reasonable or the only reason- able limitation.' \u00ba 497 U. S., at 730 (plurality opinion) (quot-ingCornelius, supra, at 808). We have no doubt that under this standard the prohibition on solicitation passes muster. We have on many prior occasions noted the disruptive ef- fect that solicitation may have on business. \u00aaSolicitation re-quires action by those who would respond: The individualsolicited must decide whether or not to contribute (whichitself might involve reading the solicitor's literature or hear-ing his pitch), and then, having decided to do so, reach for awallet, search it for money, write a check, or produce a creditcard.\u00ba Kokinda, supra, at 734; see Heffron, 452 U. S., at 663 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Passengers who wish to avoid the solicitor may have to altertheir paths, slowing both themselves and those around them.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 684 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Opinion of the Court The result is that the normal \u00afow of traf\u00aec is impeded. Id., at 653. This is especially so in an airport, where \u00aa[a]irtravelers, who are often weighted down by cumbersome bag-g a g e...m a yb e hurrying to catch a plane or to arrange ground transportation.\u00ba 925 F. 2d, at 582. Delays may beparticularly costly in this setting, as a \u00afight missed by onlya few minutes can result in hours worth of subsequentinconvenience. In addition, face-to-face solicitation presents risks of du- ress that are an appropriate target of regulation. The skill-ful, and unprincipled, solicitor can target the most vulnera- ble, including those accompanying children or those sufferingphysical impairment and who cannot easily avoid the solicita-tion. See, e. g., International Soc. for Krishna Conscious- ness, Inc. v.Barber, 506 F. Supp. 147, 159\u00b1163 (NDNY 1980), rev'd on other grounds, 650 F. 2d 430 (CA2 1981). The unsa-vory solicitor can also commit fraud through concealment ofhis af\u00aeliation or through deliberate efforts to shortchangethose who agree to purchase. 506 F. Supp., 159\u00b1163. See45 Fed. Reg. 35314\u00b135315 (1980). Compounding this prob-lem is the fact that, in an airport, the targets of such activityfrequently are on tight schedules. This in turn makes suchvisitors unlikely to stop and formally complain to airport au-thorities. As a result, the airport faces considerable dif\u00ae-culty in achieving its legitimate interest in monitoring solici-tation activity to assure that travelers are not interferedwith unduly. The Port Authority has concluded that its interest in moni- toring the activities can best be accomplished by limiting so-licitation and distribution to the sidewalk areas outside theterminals. Sloane Supp. Af\u00aedavit, \u00b6 11, App. 514.

Thus the resulting access of those who would so-505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 685 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. licit the general public is quite complete. In turn we think it would be odd to conclude that the Port Authority's terminalregulation is unreasonable despite the Port Authority havingotherwise assured access to an area universally traveled. The inconveniences to passengers and the burdens on Port Authority of\u00aecials \u00afowing from solicitation activity mayseem small, but viewed against the fact that \u00aapedestrian con-gestion is one of the greatest problems facing the three ter-minals,\u00ba 925 F. 2d, at 582, the Port Authority could reason-ably worry that even such incremental effects would provequite disruptive. 5Moreover, \u00aa[t]he justi\u00aecation for the Rule should not be measured by the disorder that would resultfrom granting an exemption solely to ISKCON.\u00ba Heffron, supra, at 652. For if ISKCON is given access, so too must other groups. \u00aaObviously, there would be a much largerthreat to the State's interest in crowd control if all otherreligious, nonreligious, and noncommercial organizationscould likewise move freely.\u00ba 452 U. S., at 653. As a result,we conclude that the solicitation ban is reasonable. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining the ban on solicitation in Port Authorityterminals is Af\u00aermed.

I concur in the Court's opinion in No. 91\u00b1155 and agree that publicly owned airports are not public fora. Unlikepublic streets and parks, both of which our First Amendmentjurisprudence has identi\u00aeed as \u00aatraditional public fora,\u00ba air-ports do not among their purposes the \u00aafree exchangeof ideas,\u00ba Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800 (1985); they have not \u00aaby long tradi- tion or by \u00aeat . Assn. v.Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983); nor have they \u00aatime out of mind ,... been used for purposes of . . . communicating thoughts be-tween citizens, and discussing public questions,\u00ba Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939). Although most airports do not ordinarily restrictpublic access, \u00aa[p]ublicly owned or operated property doesnot become a `public forum' simply because members of thepublic are permitted to come and go at will.\u00ba United States v.Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983); see also Greer v.Spock, 424 U. S. 828, 836 (1976). \u00aa[W]hen government property isnot dedicated to open communication the government may\u00d0without further justi\u00aecation\u00d0restrict use to those who par-ticipate in the forum's of\u00aecial business.\u00ba Perry, supra, at 53. There is little doubt that airports are among those pub-licly owned facilities that could be closed to all except thosewho have legitimate business there. See Grace, supra, at 178. Public access to airports is thus not \u00aainherent in theopen nature of the locations,\u00ba as it is for most streets andparks, but is rather a \u00aamatter of grace by government of\u00ae-cials.\u00ba United States v.Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720, 743 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting). I also agree with the Court thatthe Port Authority has not expressly opened its airports tothe types of expression at issue here, see ante, at 680\u00b1681, and therefore has not created a \u00aalimited\u00ba or \u00aadesignated\u00bapublic forum relevant to this case.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT 687 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. For these reasons, the Port Authority's restrictions on solicitation and lea\u00afetting within the airport terminals donot qualify for the strict scrutiny that applies to restrictionof speech in public fora. That airports are not publicfora, however, does not mean that the government can re-strict speech in whatever way it likes. \u00aaThe Government,even when acting in its proprietary capacity, does not enjoyabsolute freedom from First Amendment constraints.\u00baKokinda, supra, at 725 (plurality opinion). For example, in Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v.Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569 (1987), we unanimously struck down a reg- ulation that prohibited \u00aaall First Amendment activities\u00ba inthe Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) without evenreaching the question whether airports were public fora.Id.,at 574\u00b1575. We found it \u00aaobvious that such a ban cannot be justi\u00aeed even if LAX were a nonpublic forum becauseno conceivable governmental interest would justify such anabsolute prohibition of speech.\u00ba Id.,at 575. Moreover, we have consistently stated that restrictions on speech in non-public fora are valid only if they are \u00aareasonable\u00ba and \u00aanot aneffort to suppress expression merely because public of\u00aecialsoppose the view.\u00ba Perry, supra, 731; Cornelius, supra, at 800; Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 303 (1974). The determina- tion that airports are not public fora thus only begins ourinquiry. \u00aaThe reasonableness of the Government's restriction [on speech in a nonpublic forum] must be assessed in light of thepurpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.\u00baCornelius, supra, at 809. \u00aa `[C]onsideration of a forum's special attributes is relevant to the constitutionality of aregulation since the signi\u00aecance of the governmental inter-est must be assessed in light of the characteristic natureand function of the particular forum involved.' \u00ba Kokinda, supra, at 732, quoting Heffron v.International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 650\u00b1651 (1981).505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 688 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. In this case, the \u00aaspecial attributes\u00ba and \u00aasurrounding cir- cumstances\u00ba of the airports operated by the Port Authorityare determinative. Not only has the Port Authority chosennot to limit access to the airports under its control, it has created a huge complex open to travelers and nontravelersalike. The airports house restaurants, cafeterias, snackbars, coffee shops, cocktail lounges, post of\u00aeces, banks, tele-graph of\u00aeces, clothing shops, drug stores, food stores, nurser-ies, barber shops, currency exchanges, art exhibits, commer-cial advertising displays, bookstores, newsstands, dentalof\u00aeces, and private clubs. See App. 183\u00b1185 (Newark); id., at 185\u00b1186 (JFK); id.,at 190\u00b1192 (La Guardia). The Inter- national Arrivals Building at JFK Airport even has twobranches of Bloomingdale's. Id.,at 185\u00b1186. We have said that a restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum is \u00aareasonable\u00ba when it is \u00aaconsistent with the [gov-ernment's] legitimate interest in `preserv[ing] the property. . . for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.' \u00ba Perry, supra, at 50\u00b151, quoting Postal Service v.Council Green- burgh Civic Assns., 453 U. S. 114, 129\u00b1130 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ordinarily, this inquiry is rela-tively straightforward, because we have almost always beenconfronted with cases where the fora at issue were discrete,single-purpose facilities. See, e. g., Kokinda, supra (dedi- cated parking lot and post of\u00aece); Corne- lius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (literature for charity drive); City Council of Los Angeles v.Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789 (1984) (utility poles); Perry, supra (interschool 385 U. S. 39 (1966) (curti- lage of jailhouse). The Port Authority urges that this caseis no different and contends that it, too, has dedicated itsairports to a single purpose\u00d0facilitating air travel\u00d0and thatthe speech it seeks to prohibit is not consistent with thatpurpose. But the wide range of activities promoted by the505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 689 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. Port Authority is no more directly related to facilitating air travel than are the types of activities in which the Interna-tional Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON),wishes to engage. See Jews for Jesus, supra, at 576 (\u00aaThe line between airport-related speech and nonairport-relatedspeech is, at best, murky\u00ba). In my view, the Port Authorityis operating a shopping mall as well as an airport. Thereasonableness inquiry, therefore, is not whether the re-strictions on speech are \u00aaconsistent with . . . preserving theproperty\u00ba for air travel, Perry, supra, at 50\u00b151 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), but whether they are reasonably related to maintaining the multipurpose environ-ment that the Port Authority has deliberately created. Applying that standard, I agree with the Court in No. 91\u00b1 155 that the ban on solicitation is reasonable. Face-to-facesolicitation is incompatible with the airport's functioning ina way that the other, permitted activities are not. We havepreviously observed that \u00aa[s]olicitation impedes the normal\u00afow of traf\u00aec [because it] requires action by those who wouldrespond: The individual solicited must decide whether or notto contribute (which itself might involve reading the solici-tor's literature or hearing his pitch), and then, having de-cided to do so, reach for a wallet, search it for money, writea check, or produce a credit card. . . . As residents of metro-politan areas know from daily experience, confrontation by aperson asking for money disrupts passage and is more intru-sive and intimidating than an encounter with a person givingout information.\u00ba Kokinda, 497 U. 739 ( Kennedy, J. concur- ring in (accepting Postal Service's judgment that,given its past experience, \u00aain-person solicitation deservesdifferent treatment from alternative forms of solicitation andexpression\u00ba); Heffron, supra, at 657 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (upholding partial restrictionon solicitation at fairgrounds because of state interest \u00aainprotecting its fairgoers from fraudulent, deceptive, and mis-505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 690 INTERNATIONAL SOC.

S., at 665 ( Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (upholding par- tial restriction on solicitation because of the \u00aacrowd controlproblems\u00ba it creates). The record in this case con\u00aerms thatthe problems of congestion and fraud that we have identi\u00aeedwith solicitation in other contexts have also proved true inthe airports' experience. See App. 67\u00b1111 (af\u00aedavits). Be-cause airport users are frequently facing time constraints,and are traveling with luggage or children, the ban on solici-tation is a reasonable means of avoiding disruption of an air-port's operation. In my view, however, the regulation banning lea\u00afetting\u00d0 or, in the Port Authority's words, the printed or written material\u00ba\u00d0cannot be upheld as reasonable on this record. I thereforeconcur in the judgment in No. 91\u00b1339, post, p. 830, striking down that prohibition. While the dif\u00aeculties posed by so-licitation in a nonpublic forum are suf\u00aeciently obvious thatits regulation may \u00aarin[g] of common-sense,\u00ba Kokinda, 497 U. S., at 734 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),the same is not necessarily true of lea\u00afetting. To the con-trary, we have expressly noted that lea\u00afetting does not en-tail the same kinds of problems presented by face-to-face so-licitation. Speci\u00aecally, \u00aa[o]ne need not ponder the contentsof a lea\u00afet or pamphlet in order mechanically to outof someone's hand . . . . `The distribution of literature doesnot require that the recipient stop in order to receive themessage the speaker wishes to convey; instead the recipientis free to read the message at a later time.' \u00ba Ibid. (plurality opinion), quoting Blackmun, J. , con- curring in part and dissenting in part). With the possibleexception of avoiding litter, see Schneider v.State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 162 (1939), it is dif\u00aecult to point to any problems intrinsic to the act of lea\u00afetting that wouldmake it naturally incompatible with a large, multipurposeforum such as those at issue here.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 691 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. We have only once before considered restrictions on speech in a nonpublic forum that sustained the kind of exten-sive, nonforum-related activity found in the Port Authorityairports, and I believe that case is instructive. In Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976), the Court held that even though certain parts of a military base were open to the public, theystill did not constitute a public forum in light of \u00aa `the histori-cally unquestioned power of [a] commanding of\u00aecer sum-marily to exclude ci vilians from the area of his command.' \u00ba Id.,at 838, quoting Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v.Mc- Elroy, 367 U. S. 886, 893 (1961). The Court then proceeded to uphold a regulation banning the distribution of literaturewithout the prior approval of the base commander. In sodoing, the Court \u00aaemphasized\u00ba that the regulation onlea\u00afetting did \u00aanot authorize the Fort Dix authorities to pro-hibit the distribution of conventional political campaign liter-ature.\u00ba Rather, the Court explained, \u00aa[t]he only publica-tions that a military commander may disapprove are thosethat he \u00aends constitute `a clear danger to [military] loyalty,discipline, morale' and that \u00aa[t]here is nothing in theConstitution that disables a military commander from actingto avert what he perceives to be a clear danger to the loyalty,discipline, or morale of troops on the base under his com-mand.\u00ba 424 U. S., at 840 (citation omitted). In contrast, theregulation at issue in this case effects an absolute prohibitionand is not supported by any independent justi\u00aecation outsideof the problems caused by the accompanying solicitation. Moreover, the Port Authority has not offered any justi\u00ae- cations or record evidence to support its ban on the distribu-tion of pamphlets alone. Its argument is focused instead onthe problems created when literature is distributed in con-junction with a solicitation plea. Although we do not \u00aare-quir[e] that . . . proof be present to justify the denial of accessto a nonpublic forum on grounds that the proposed use maydisrupt the property's intended function,\u00ba Perry, 460 U.

FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. certain speech is inconsistent with the intended use of the forum. In Kokinda, for example, we upheld a regulation banning solicitation on postal property in part because thePostal Service's 30-year history of regulation of solicitationin post of\u00aeces demonstrated that permitting solicitation in-terfered with its postal mission. 497 U. S., at 731\u00b1732 (plu-rality opinion). Similarly, in Cornelius, we held that it was reasonable to exclude political advocacy groups from a fund-raising campaign targeted at federal employees in part be-cause \u00aathe record amply support[ed] an inference\u00ba that theparticipation of those groups would have jeopardized the suc-cess of the campaign. 473 U. S., at 810. Here, the Port Au-thority has provided no independent reason for prohibitinglea\u00afetting, and the record contains no information fromwhich we can draw an inference that would support its ban. Because I cannot see how peaceful pamphleteering is incom-patible with the multipurpose environment of the Port Au-thority airports, I cannot accept that a total ban on that ac-tivity is reasonable without an explanation as to why such arestriction \u00aapreserv[es] the property\u00ba for the several usesto which it has been put. Perry, supra, at 50\u00b151 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Of course, it is still open for the Port Authority to promul- gate regulations of the time, place, and manner of lea\u00afettingwhich are \u00aacontent-neutral, are narrowly tailored to servea signi\u00aecant government interest, and leave open ample al-ternative channels of communication.\u00ba Perry, supra, at 45; Postal Service, 453 U. S., at 132. For example, during the many years that this litigation has been in progress, the PortAuthority has not banned sankirtan completely from JFK International Airport, but has restricted it to a relativelyuncongested part of the airport terminals, the same part thathouses the airport chapel.

Justice Kennedy , with whom Justice Blackmun ,Jus- tice Stevens , and Justice Souter join as to Part I, con- curring in the judgments.* While I concur in the judgments af\u00aerming in these cases, my analysis differs in substantial respects from that of theCourt. In my view the airport corridors and shopping areasoutside of the passenger security zones, areas operated bythe Port Authority, are public forums, and speech in thoseplaces is entitled to protection against all government regu-lation inconsistent with public forum principles. The PortAuthority's blanket prohibition on the distribution or sale ofliterature cannot meet those stringent standards, and I agreeit is invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.The Port Authority's rule disallowing in-person solicitationof money for immediate payment, however, is in my view anarrow and valid regulation of the time, place, and mannerof protected speech in this forum, or else is a valid regulationof the nonspeech element of expressive conduct. I wouldsustain the Port Authority's ban on solicitation and receiptof funds.

FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments forum doctrine ought not to be a jurisprudence of categories rather than ideas or convert what was once an analysis pro-tective of expression into one which grants the governmentauthority to restrict speech by \u00aeat. I believe that theCourt's public forum analysis in these cases is inconsistentwith the values underlying the Speech and Press Clauses ofthe First Amendment. Our public forum analysis has its origins in Justice Rob- erts' rather sweeping dictum in Hague v.Committee for In- dustrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939); see also ante, at 679. The doctrine was not stated with much preci- sion or elaboration, though, until our more recent decisionsinPerry Ed. Assn. v.Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37 (1983), and Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985). These cases describe a three-part analysis to designate government-owned prop-erty as either a traditional public forum, a designated publicforum, or a nonpublic forum. Perry, supra, at 45\u00b146; ante, at 678\u00b1679. The Court today holds that traditional publicforums are limited to public property which have as \u00aa `a prin-cipal purpose . . ante, J.,concurring in No. 91\u00b1339 (hereinafter opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. )); and that this purpose must be evidenced by a longstanding historicalpractice of permitting speech, ante, at 679; ante, at 686 (opin- ion of O\u0092Connor, J. ). The Court also holds that designated forums consist of property which the government intends toopen for public discourse. Ante, at 680, citing Cornelius, supra, at 802; ante, at 686 (opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. ). All other types of property are, in the Court's view, nonpublicforums (in other words, not public forums), and government-imposed restrictions of speech in these places will be upheldso long as reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Under thiscategorical view the application of public forum analysis toairport terminals seems easy. Airports are of course publicspaces of recent vintage, and so there can be no time-honored505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 695 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments tradition associated with airports of permitting free speech. Ante, at 680. And because governments have often at- tempted to restrict speech within airports, it follows a forti- oriunder the Court's analysis that they cannot be so-called \u00aadesignated\u00ba forums. Ante, at 680\u00b1681. So, the Court con- cludes, airports must be nonpublic forums, subject to mini-mal First Amendment protection. This analysis is \u00afawed at its very beginning. It leaves the government with almost unlimited authority to restrictspeech on its property by doing nothing more than articulat-ing a non-speech-related purpose for the area, and it leavesalmost no scope for the development of new public forumsabsent the rare approval of the government. The Court'serror lies in its conclusion that the public forum status ofpublic property depends on the government's de\u00aened pur-pose for the property, or on an explicit decision by the gov-ernment to dedicate the property to expressive activity. Inmy view, the inquiry must be an objective one, based on theactual, physical characteristics and uses of the property.The fact that in our public forum cases we discuss and ana-lyze these precise characteristics tends to support my posi-tion. Perry, supra, at 46\u00b148; Cornelius, supra, at 804\u00b1806; Kokinda, supra, at 727\u00b1729 (plurality opinion). The First Amendment is a limitation on government, not a grant of power. Its design is to prevent the governmentfrom contro lling speech. Yet under the Court's view the au- thority of the government to control speech on its propertyis paramount, for in almost all cases the critical step in theCourt's analysis is a classi\u00aecation of the property that turnson the government's own de\u00aenition or decision, uncon-strained by an independent duty to respect the speech itscitizens can voice there. The Court acknowledges as much,by reintroducing today into our First Amendment law astrict doctrinal line between the proprietary and regulatoryfunctions of government which I thought had been aban-doned long ago. Ante, at 678; compare Davis v.Massachu- setts, 167 U. S. Schnei-505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 696 FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments der v.State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147 (1939); and Grayned v.Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115\u00b1116 (1972). The Court's approach is contrary to the underlying pur- poses of the public forum doctrine. The liberties protectedby our doctrine derive from the Assembly, as well as theSpeech and Press Clauses of the First Amendment, and areessential to a functioning democracy. See Kalven, The Con-cept of the Public Forum: Cox v. Louisiana, 1965 S. Ct. Rev.1, 14, 19. Public places are of necessity the locus for discus-sion of public issues, as well as protest against arbitrary gov-ernment action. At the heart of our jurisprudence lies theprinciple that in a free nation citizens must have the right togather and speak with other persons in public places. Therecognition that certain government-owned property is apublic forum provides open notice to citizens that their free-doms may be exercised there without fear of a censorial gov-ernment, adding tangible reinforcement to the idea that weare a free people. A fundamental tenet of our Constitution is that the gov- ernment is subject to constraints which private persons arenot. The public forum doctrine vindicates that principle byrecognizing limits on the government's control over speechactivities on property suitable for free expression. The doc- trine focuses on the physical characteristics of the propertybecause government ownership is the source of its purportedauthority to regulate speech. The right of speech protectedby the doctrine, however, comes not from a Supreme Courtdictum but from the constitutional recognition that the gov-ernment cannot impose silence on a free people. The Court's analysis rests on an inaccurate view of history. The notion that traditional public forums are properties thathave public discourse as their principal purpose is a mostdoubtful \u00aection. The types of property that we have recog-nized as the quintessential public forums are streets, parks,and sidewalks. Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 802; Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 480\u00b1481 (1988). It would seem appar- ent that the principal purpose of streets and sidewalks, like505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 697 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments airports, is to facilitate transportation, not public discourse, and we have recognized as much. Schneider v.State, supra, at 160. Similarly, the purpose for the creation of publicparks may be as much for beauty and open space as for dis-course. Thus under the Court's analysis, even the quintes-sential public forums would appear to lack the necessary ele-ments of what the Court de\u00aenes as a public forum. The effect of the Court's narrow view of the \u00aerst category of public forums is compounded by its description of the sec-ond purported category, the so-called \u00aadesignated\u00ba forum.The requirements for such a designation are so stringentthat I cannot be certain whether the category has any con-tent left at all. In any event, it seems evident that underthe Court's analysis today few, if any, types of property otherthan those already recognized as public forums will be ac-corded that status. The Court's answer to these objections appears to be a recourse to history as justifying its recognition of streets,parks, and sidewalks, but apparently no other types of gov-ernment property, as traditional public forums. Ante, at 681. The Court ignores the fact that the purpose of the pub-lic forum doctrine is to give effect to the broad command ofthe First Amendment to protect speech from governmental interference. The jurisprudence is rooted in historic prac-tice, but it is not tied to a narrow textual command limitingthe recognition of new forums. In my view the policies un-derlying the doctrine cannot be given effect unless we recog-nize that open, public spaces and thoroughfares that are suit-able for discourse may be public forums, whatever theirhistorical pedigree and without concern for a precise classi-\u00aecation of the property. There is support in our precedentsfor such a view. See Lehman v.Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 303 (1974) (plurality opinion); Hague, 307 U. S., at 515 (speaking of \u00aastreets and public places\u00ba as forums). Withoutthis recognition our forum doctrine retains no relevance intimes of fast-changing technology and increasing insularity.In a country where most citizens travel by automobile, and505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 698 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments parks all too often become locales for crime rather than so- cial intercourse, our failure to recognize the possibility thatnew types of government property may be appropriateforums for speech will lead to a serious curtailment of ourexpressive activity. One of the places left in our mobile society that is suit- able for discourse is a metropolitan airport. It is of par-ticular importance to recognize that such spaces are publicforums because in these days an airport is one of the fewgovernment-owned spaces where many persons have exten-sive contact with other members of the public. Given that private spaces of similar character are not subject to the dic-tates of the First Amendment, see Hudgens v.NLRB, 424 U. S. 507 (1976), it is critical that we preserve these areas forprotected speech. In my view, our public forum doctrinemust recognize this reality, and allow the creation of publicforums that do not \u00aet within the narrow tradition of streets,sidewalks, and parks. We have allowed \u00afexibility in ourdoctrine to meet changing technologies in other areas of con-stitutional interpretation, see, e. g., Katz v.United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), and I believe we must do the same withthe First Amendment. I agree with the Court that government property of a type which by history and tradition has been available for speechactivity must continue to be recognized as a public forum.Ante, at 679. In my view, however, constitutional protection is not con\u00aened to these properties alone. Under the propercircumstances I would accord public forum status to otherforms of property, regardless of their ancient or contempo-rary origins and whether or not they \u00aet within a narrowhistoric tradition. If the objective, physical characteristicsof the property at issue and the actual public access and usesthat have been permitted by the government indicate thatexpressive activity would be appropriate and compatiblewith those uses, the property is a public forum. The mostimportant considerations in this analysis are whether the505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 699 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments property shares physical similarities with more traditional public forums, whether the government has permitted or ac-quiesced in broad public access to the property, and whetherexpressive activity would tend to interfere in a signi\u00aecantway with the uses to which the government has as a factualmatter dedicated the property. In conducting the last in-quiry, courts must consider the consistency of those useswith expressive activities in general, rather than the speci\u00aecsort of speech at issue in the case before it; otherwise theanalysis would be one not of classi\u00aecation but rather of case-by-case balancing, and would provide little guidance to the State regarding its discretion to regulate speech. Courtsmust also consider the availability of reasonable time, place,and manner restrictions in undertaking this compatibilityanalysis. The possibility of some theoretical inconsistencybetween expressive activities and the property's uses shouldnot bar a \u00aending of a public forum, if those inconsistenciescan be avoided through simple and permitted regulations. The second category of the Court's jurisprudence, the so- called designated forum, provides little, if any, additionalprotection for speech. Where government property doesnot satisfy the criteria of a public forum, the governmentretains the power to dedicate the property for speech,whether for all expressive activity or for limited purposesonly. See ante, at 678; Perry, 460 U. S., at 45\u00b146; Southeast- ern Promotions, Ltd. v.Conrad, 420 U. S. 546 (1975). I do not quarrel with the fact that speech must often be re-stricted on property of this kind to retain the purpose forwhich it has been designated. And I recognize that whenproperty has been designated for a particular expressive use,the government may choose to eliminate that designation.But this increases the need to protect speech in other places,where discourse may occur free of such restrictions. Insome sense the government always retains authority to closea public forum, by se lling the property, changing its physical character, or changing its principal use. Otherwise the505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 700 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments State would be prohibited from closing a park, or eliminating a street or sidewalk, which no one has understood the publicforum doctrine to require. The difference is that whenproperty is a protected public forum the State may not by\u00aeat assert broad control over speech or expressive activities;it must alter the objective physical character or uses of theproperty, and bear the attendant costs, to change the proper-ty's forum status. Under this analysis, it is evident that the public spaces of the Port Authority's airports are public forums. First, theDistrict Court made detailed \u00aendings regarding the physical similarities between the Port Authority's airports and publicstreets. 721 F. Supp. 572, 576\u00b1577 (SDNY 1989). These\u00aendings show that the public spaces in the airports arebroad, public thoroughfares full of people and lined withstores and other commercial activities. An airport corridoris of course not a street, but that is not the proper inquiry.The question is one of physical similarities, suf\u00aecient to sug-gest that the airport corridor should be a public forum forthe same reasons that streets and sidewalks have beentreated as public forums by the people who use them. Second, the airport areas involved here are open to the public without restriction. Ibid. Plaintiffs do not seek ac- cess to the secured areas of the airports, nor do I suggestthat these areas would be public forums. And while mostpeople who come to the Port Authority's airports do so fora reason related to air travel, either because they are pas-sengers or because they are picking up or dropping offpassengers, this does not distinguish an airport from streetsor sidewalks, which most people use for travel. See supra, at 696\u00b1697. Further, the group visiting the airports encom-passes a vast portion of the public: In 1986 the Authority'sthree airports served over 78 m illion passengers. It is the very breadth and extent of the public's use of airports thatmakes it imperative to protect speech rights there. Ofcourse, airport operators retain authority to restrict public505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 701 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments access when necessary, for instance to respond to special se- curity concerns. But if the Port Authority allows the usesand open access to airports that is shown on this record, itcannot argue that some vestigial power to change its prac-tices bars the conclusion that its airports are public forums,any more than the power to bulldoze a park bars a \u00aendingthat a public forum exists so long as the open use does. Third, and perhaps most important, it is apparent from the record, and from the recent history of airports, that whenadequate time, place, and manner regulations are in place,expressive activity is quite compatible with the uses of major airports. The Port Authority's primary argument to thecontrary is that the problem of congestion in its airports'corridors makes expressive activity inconsistent with theairports' primary purpose, which is to facilitate air travel.The First Amendment is often inconvenient. But that is be-side the point. Inconvenience does not absolve the govern-ment of its obligation to tolerate speech. The Authoritymakes no showing that any real impediments to the smoothfunctioning of the airports cannot be cured with reasonabletime, place, and manner regulations. In fact, the history ofthe Authority's own airports, as well as other major airportsin this country, leaves little doubt that such a solution isquite feasible. The Authority has for many years permittedexpressive activities by petitioners and others, without anyapparent interference with its ability to meet its transporta-tion purposes. App. 462, 469\u00b1470; see also ante, at 691\u00b1692 (opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. ). The Federal Aviation Admin- istration, in its operation of the airports of the Nation's capi-tal, has issued rules which allow regulated expressive activ-ity within speci\u00aeed areas, without any suggestion that thespeech would incompatible with the airports' business.14 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 159.93, 159.94 (1992). And, in fact, expressive ac-tivity has been a commonplace feature of our Nation's majorairports for many years, in part because of the wide consen-sus among the Courts of Appeals, prior to the decision in505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 702 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments these cases, that the public spaces of airports are public fo- rums. See, e. g., Chicago Area Military Project v.Chicago, 508 F. 2d 921 (CA7), S. 1124 (1982); United States Southwest Africa/Namibia Trade & Cultural Council v.United States, 228 U. S. App. D.

As theDistrict Court recognized, the logical consequence of the Port Authority's congestion argument is that the crowdedstreets and sidewalks of major cities cannot be public forums.721 F. Supp., at 578. These problems have been dealt within the past, and in other settings, through proper time, place,and manner restrictions; and the Port Authority does notmake any showing that similar regulations would not be ef-fective in its airports. The Port Authority makes a half-hearted argument that the special security concerns associ-ated with airports suggest they are not public forums; butthis position is belied by the unlimited public access the Au-thority allows to its airports. This access demonstrates thatthe Port Authority does not consider the general public topose a serious security threat, and there is no evidence inthe record that persons engaged in expressive activities areany different. The danger of allowing the government to suppress speech is shown in the cases now before us. A grant of plenarypower allows the government to tilt the dialog heard by thepublic, to exclude many, more marginal, voices. The \u00aerstchallenged Port Authority regulation establishes a \u00afat prohi-bition on \u00aa[t]he sale or distribution of \u00afyers, brochures, pam-phlets, books or any other printed or written material,\u00ba ifconducted within the airport terminal, \u00aain a continuous orrepetitive manner.\u00ba We have long recognized that the rightto distribute \u00afyers and literature lies at the heart of the lib-505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 703 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 147 (1939); Murdock v.Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943). The Port Authority's rule, which pro-hibits almost all such activity, is among the most restrictivepossible of those liberties. The regulation is in fact so broadand restrictive of speech, Justice O\u0092Connor \u00aends it void even under the standards applicable to government regula-tions in nonpublic forums. Ante, at 691\u00b1693. I have no dif- \u00aeculty deciding the regulation cannot survive the far morestringent rules applicable to regulations in public forums.The regulation is not drawn in narrow terms, and it does notleave open ample alternative channels for communication.See Ward v.Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989). The Port Authority's concerns with the problem of conges-tion can be addressed through narrow restrictions on thetime and place of expressive activity. See ante, at 692\u00b1693 (opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. ). I would strike down the regula- tion as an unconstitutional restriction of speech. II It is my view, however, that the Port Authority's ban on the \u00aasolicitation and receipt of funds\u00ba within its airport ter-minals should be upheld under the standards applicable tospeech regulations in public forums. The regulation may beupheld as either a reasonable time, place, and manner restric-tion, or as a regulation directed at the nonspeech element ofexpressive conduct. The two standards have considerableoverlap in a case like this one. It is well settled that \u00aaeven in a public forum the govern- ment may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place,or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions `arejusti\u00aeed without reference to the content of the regulatedspeech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signi\u00aecantgovernmental interest, and that they leave open ample al-ternative channels for communication of the information.' \u00ba505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 704 INTERNATIONAL SOC.

We have held further that the government in appropriate circumstancesmay regulate conduct, even if the conduct has an expressivecomponent. United States v.O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968). And in several recent cases we have recognized that thestandards for assessing time, place, and manner restrictionsare little, if any, different from the standards applicable toregulations of conduct with an expressive component.Clark, supra, at 298, and n. 8; Ward, supra, at 798; Barnes v.Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560, 566 (1991) (plurality opin- ion); see generally Kalven, 1965 S. Ct. Rev., at 23, 27 (arguingthat all speech contains elements of conduct which may beregulated). The con\u00afuence of the two tests is well demon-strated by a case like this, where the government regulationat issue can be described with equal accuracy as a regulationof the manner of expression, or as a regulation of conductwith an expressive component. I am in full agreement with the statement of the Court that solicitation is a form of protected speech. Ante, at 677; see also Riley v.National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 788\u00b1789 (1988); Schaumburg v.Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 629 (1980); Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra. If the Port Authority's solicitation regulation prohibited all speech that requested the contribu-tion of funds, I would conclude that it was a direct, content-based restriction of speech in clear violation of the FirstAmendment. The Authority's regulation does not prohibitall solicitation, however; it prohibits the \u00aasolicitation and re-ceipt of funds.\u00ba I do not understand this regulation to pro-hibit all speech that solicits funds. It reaches only personalsolicitations for immediate payment of money. Otherwise,the \u00aareceipt of funds\u00ba phrase would be written out of theprovision. The regulation does not cover, for example, thedistribution of preaddressed envelopes along with a plea tocontribute money to the distributor or his organization. As505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 705 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments I understand the restriction it is directed only at the physical exchange of money, which is an element of conduct inter-woven with otherwise expressive solicitation. In otherwords, the regulation permits expression that solicits funds,but limits the manner of that expression to forms other thanthe immediate receipt of money. So viewed, I believe the Port Authority's rule survives our test for speech restrictions in the public forum. In-personsolicitation of funds, when combined with immediate receiptof that money, creates a risk of fraud and duress that is wellrecognized, and that is different in kind from other forms of expression or conduct. Travelers who are unfamiliar withthe airport, perhaps even unfamiliar with this country, itscustoms, and its language, are an easy prey for the moneysolicitor. I agree in full with the Court's discussion of thesedangers in No. 91\u00b1155. Ante, at 683\u00b1684; ante, at 689\u00b1690 (opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. ). I would add that our precedents, as well as the actions of coordinate branches of Government,support this conclusion. We have in the past recognizedthat in-person solicitation has been associated with coerciveor fraudulent conduct. Cantwell v.Connecticut, 310 U. Heffron v.Interna- tional Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 657 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting inpart); Schaumburg, supra, at 636\u00b1638. In addition, the Fed- eral Government has adopted regulations which acknowledgeand respond to the serious problems associated with solicita-tion. The National Park Service has enacted a \u00afat ban onthe direct solicitation of money in the parks of the Nation'scapital within its control. 36 CFR \u00a7 7.96(h) ( Kennedy, J. , concurring in judgment). Also, the Federal Aviation Ad-ministration, in its administration of the airports of Wash-ington, D. C., even while permitting the solicitation of fundshas adopted special rules to prevent coercive, harassing, orrepetitious behavior. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments in the commercial sphere, the Federal Trade Commission has long held that \u00aait constitutes an unfair and deceptive act orpractice\u00ba to make a door-to-door sale without allowing thebuyer a 3-day \u00aacooling-off period\u00ba during which time he orshe may cancel the sale. 16 CFR \u00a7 429.1 (1992). All ofthese measures are based on a recognition that requests forimmediate payment of money create a strong potential forfraud or undue pressure, in part because of the lack of timefor re\u00afection. As the Court recounts, questionable prac-tices associated with solicitation can include the targeting ofvulnerable and easily coerced persons, misrepresentation ofthe solicitor's cause, and outright theft.

Because the Port Authority's solicitation ban is directed at these abusive practices and not at any particular message,idea, or form of speech, the regulation is a content-neutralrule serving a signi\u00aecant government interest. We haveheld that the content neutrality of a rule must be assessedbased on whether it is \u00aa ` justi\u00aeed without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' \u00ba Ward, 491 U. S., at 791 (quoting Clark, 468 U. S., at 293) (emphasis in original). It is apparent that the justi\u00aecation for the solicitation ban isunrelated to the content of speech or the identity of thespeaker. There can also be no doubt that the prevention offraud and duress is a signi\u00aecant government interest. Thegovernment cannot, of course, prohibit speech for the solereason that it is concerned the speech may be fraudulent.Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637. But the Port Authority's regulation does not do this. It recognizes that the risk offraud and duress is intensi\u00aeed by particular conduct, theimmediate exchange of money; and it addresses only thatconduct. We have recognized that such narrowly drawnregulations are in fact the proper means for addressing505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 707 Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments the dangers which can be associated with speech. Ibid.; Riley, supra, at 799, n. 11. To survive scrutiny, the regulation must be drawn in nar- row terms to accomplish its end and leave open ample alter-native channels for communication. Regarding the formerrequirement, we have held that to be narrowly tailored aregulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusivemeans of achieving an end. The regulation must be reason-able, and must not burden substantially more speech thannecessary. Ward, supra, at 798\u00b1800. Under this standard the solicitation ban survives with ease, because it prohibits only solicitation of money for immediate receipt. The regu-lation does not burden any broader category of speech orexpressive conduct than is the source of the evil sought tobe avoided. And in fact, the regulation is even more narrowbecause it only prohibits such behavior if conducted in a con-tinuous or repetitive manner. The Port Authority has madea reasonable judgment that this type of conduct raises themost serious concerns, and it is entitled to deference. Myconclusion is not altered by the fact that other means, forexample, the regulations adopted by the Federal AviationAdministration to govern its airports, may be available toaddress the problems associated with solicitation, becausethe existence of less intrusive means is not decisive. Ourcases do not so limit the government's regulatory \u00afexibility.See Ward, supra, at 800. I have little dif\u00aeculty in deciding that the Port Authority has left open ample alternative channels for the communica-tion of the message which is an aspect of solicitation. Asalready discussed, see supra, at 704, the Authority's rule does not prohibit all solicitation of funds: It restricts onlythe manner of the solicitation, or the conduct associated withsolicitation, to prohibit immediate receipt of the solicitedmoney. Requests for money continue to be permitted, andin the course of requesting money solicitors may explaintheir cause, or the purposes of their organization, without505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 708 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Kennedy, J., concurring in judgments violating the regulation. It is only if the solicitor accepts immediate payment that a violation occurs. Thus the solici-tor can continue to disseminate his message, for example, bydistributing preaddressed envelopes in which potential con-tributors may mail their donations. See supra, at 704. Much of what I have said about the solicitation of funds may seem to apply to the sale of literature, but the differ-ences between the two activities are of suf\u00aecient signi\u00aecanceto require they be distinguished for constitutional purposes.The Port Authority's \u00afat ban on the distribution or sale ofprinted material must, in my view, fall in its entirety. See supra, at 703. The application of our time, place, and man- ner test to the ban on sales leads to a result quite differentfrom the solicitation ban. For one, the government interestin regulating the sales of literature is not as powerful as inthe case of solicitation. The danger of a fraud arising fromsuch sales is much more limited than from pure solicitation,because in the case of a sale the nature of the exchange tendsto be clearer to both parties. Also, the Port Authority's saleregulation is not as narrowly drawn as the solicitation rule,since it does not specify the receipt of money as a criticalelement of a violation. And perhaps most important, the\u00afat ban on sales of literature leaves open fewer alternativechannels of communication than the Port Authority's morelimited prohibition on the solicitation and receipt of funds.Given the practicalities and ad hoc nature of much expressiveactivity in the public forum, sales of literature must be com-pleted in one transaction to be workable. Attempting to col-lect money at another time or place is a far less plausibleoption in the context of a sale than when soliciting donations,because the literature sought to be sold will under normalcircumstances be distributed within the forum. These dis-tinctions have been recognized by the National Park Service,which permits the sale or distribution of literature, whileprohibiting solicitation.

S. 672 (1992) Opinion of Souter, J. tical means for advocates and organizations to sell literature within the public forums which are its airports. Against all of this must be balanced the great need, recog- nized by our precedents, to give the sale of literature fullFirst Amendment protection. We have long recognized thatto prohibit distribution of literature for the mere reason thatit is sold would leave organizations seeking to spread theirmessage without funds to operate. \u00aaIt should be remem-bered that the pamphlets of Thomas Paine were not distrib-uted free of charge.\u00ba Murdock, 319 U. S., at 111; see also Schaumburg, supra, at 628\u00b1635 (discussing cases). The effect of a rule of law distinguishing between sales and dis-tribution would be to close the marketplace of ideas to lessaf\u00afuent organizations and speakers, leaving speech as thepreserve of those who are able to fund themselves. One ofthe primary purposes of the public forum is to provide per-sons who lack access to more sophisticated media the oppor-tunity to speak. A prohibition on sales forecloses that op-portunity for the very persons who need it most. And whilethe same arguments might be made regarding solicitation offunds, the answer is that the Port Authority has not prohib-ited all solicitation, but only a narrow class of conduct associ-ated with a particular manner of solicitation. For these reasons I agree that the Court of Appeals should be af\u00aermed in full in \u00aending the Port Authority's ban on thedistribution or sale of literature unconstitutional, but uphold-ing the prohibition on solicitation and immediate receipt offunds.

FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Opinion of Souter, J. Kennedy 's view of the rule that should determine what is a public forum and with his conclusion that the public areasof the airports at issue here qualify as such. The designa-tion of a given piece of public property as a traditional publicforum must not merely state a conclusion that the propertyfalls within a static category including streets, parks, side-walks, and perhaps not much more, but must represent aconclusion that the property is no different in principle fromsuch examples, which we have previously described as \u00aaar-chetypes\u00ba of property from which the government was andis powerless to exclude speech. See Frisby v.Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 480 (1988). To treat the class of such forums asclosed by their description as \u00aatraditional,\u00ba taking that wordmerely as a charter for examining the history of the particu-lar public property claimed as a forum, has no warrant in aConstitution whose values are not to be left behind in thecity streets that are no longer the only focus of our commu-nity life. If that were the line of our direction, we might aswell abandon the public forum doctrine altogether. Nor is that a Scylla without Charybdis. Public forum analysis is stulti\u00aeed not only by treating its archetypes asclosed categories, but by treating its candidates so categori-cally as to defeat their identi\u00aecation with the archetypes.We need not say that all \u00aatransportation nodes\u00ba or all air-ports are public forums in order to \u00aend that certain metro-politan airports are. Thus, the enquiry may and must relateto the particular property at issue and not necessarily tothe \u00aaprecise classi\u00aecation of the property.\u00ba See ante, at 697 (Kennedy, J. , concurring in judgment). It is true that prop- erty of some types will invariably be public forums. \u00aaNoparticularized inquiry into the precise nature of a speci\u00aecstreet is necessary; all public streets are held in the publictrust and are properly considered traditional public fora.\u00baFrisby, supra, at 481. But to \u00aend one example of a certain property type ( e. g., airports, post of\u00aeces, etc.) that is not a public forum is not to rule out all properties of that sort.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 711 Cite as: 505 U.

One can imagine a public airport of asize or design or need for extraordinary security that wouldrender expressive activity incompatible with its normal use.But that would be no reason to conclude that one of the moreusual variety of metropolitan airports is not a public forum. I also agree with Justice Kennedy 's statement of the public forum principle: We should classify as a public forumany piece of public property that is \u00aasuitable for discourse\u00bain its physical character, where expressive activity is \u00aacom-patible\u00ba with the use to which it has actually been put.

Applying this test, I have no dif\u00ae-culty concluding that the unleased public areas at airportslike the metropolitan New York airports at issue in thesecases are public forums. II From the Court's conclusion in No. 91\u00b1155, however, sus- taining the total ban on solicitation of money for immediatepayment, I respectfully dissent. \u00aaWe have held the solicita-tion of money by charities to be fully protected as the dis-semination of ideas.

It is axiomatic that, although fraudulent misrepresentation of facts can be regu-lated, the dissemination of ideas cannot be regulated to pre-vent it from being unfair or unreasonable.\u00ba Riley v.Na- tional Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 803 (1988) ( Scalia, J. , concurring in part and concurring in judg- ment) (some citations omitted). Even if I assume, arguendo, that the ban on the petition- ers' activity at issue here is both content neutral and merelya restriction on the manner of communication, the regulationmust be struck down for its failure to satisfy the require-ments of narrow tailoring to further a signi\u00aecant state in-terest, see, e. g., Clark v.Community for Creative Non- Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984), and availability of \u00aaample alternative channels for communication,\u00ba Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v.Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976). As Justice Kennedy 's opinion indicates, respondent comes closest to justifying the restriction as one furtheringthe government's interest in preventing coercion and fraud.* *Respondent also attempts to justify his regulation on the alternative basis of \u00aainterference with air travelers,\u00ba referring in particular to prob-lems of \u00aaannoyance\u00ba and \u00aacongestion.\u00ba Brief for Respondent 24\u00b125, 42\u00b144, 47. The First Amendment inevitably requires people to put up withannoyance and uninvited persuasion. Indeed, in such cases we need toscrutinize restrictions on speech with special care. In their degree ofcongestion, most of the public spaces of these airports are probably morecomparable to public streets than to the fairground as we described it inHeffron v.International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 651 (1981). Consequently, the congestion argument, which was heldthere to justify a regulation con\u00aening solicitation to a \u00aexed location, shouldhave less force here. See id.,at 650\u00b1651. Be that as it may, the conclu- sion of a majority of the Court today that the Constitution forbids the banon the sale, as well as the distribution, of lea\u00afets puts to rest respondent'sargument that congestion justi\u00aees a total ban on solicitation.

While a solicitor can be insistent, a pedestrian on the streetor airport concourse can simply walk away or walk on. Inany event, we have held in a far more coercive context thanthis one, that of a black boycott of white stores in ClaiborneCounty, Mississippi, that \u00aa[s]peech does not lose its protectedcharacte r...s i mply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.\u00ba NAACP v.Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, 910 (1982). See also Organization for a Better Austin v.Keefe, 402 U. S. 415, 419 (1971) (\u00aaThe claim that . . . expressions were intended to exercise a coerciveimpact on respondent does not remove them from the reachof the First Amendment. Petitioners plainly intended to in-\u00afuence respondent's conduct by their activities; this is notfundamentally different from the function of a newspaper\u00ba).Since there is here no evidence of any type of coercive con-duct, over and above the merely importunate character ofthe open and public solicitation, that might justify a ban, seeUnited States v.O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968); Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, at 912, the regulation cannot be sus- tained to avoid coercion. As for fraud, our cases do not provide government with plenary authority to ban solicitation just because it could befraudulent. \u00aaBroad prophylactic rules in the area of free ex-pression are suspect,\u00ba NAACP v.Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438 (1963), and more than a laudable intent to prevent fraud isrequired to sustain the present ban. See, e. g., Schaumburg v.Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 636\u00b1638 (1980) (\u00aaThe Village, consistently with the First Amendment,may not label such groups `fraudulent' and bar them fromcanvassing on the streets and house to house\u00ba); Riley, supra, at 800. The evidence of fraudulent conduct here is virtuallynonexistent. It consists of one af\u00aedavit describing eight may, of course, be congested locations where solicitation could severely compromise the ef\u00aecient \u00afow of pedestrians, the proper response wouldbe to tailor the restrictions to those choke points.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 714 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v.LEE Opinion of Souter, J. complaints, none of them substantiated, \u00aainvolving some form of fraud, deception, or larceny\u00ba over an entire 11-yearperiod between 1975 and 1986, during which the regulationat issue here was, by agreement, not enforced. See Brieffor Respondent 44; Brief for Petitioners 46. Petitionersclaim, and respondent does not dispute, that by the Port Au-thority's own calculation, there has not been a single claimof fraud or misrepresentation since 1981. Ibid. As against these facts, respondent's brief is ominous in adding that\u00aa[t]he Port Authority is also aware that members of [Interna-tional Society for Krishna Consciousness] have engaged inmisconduct elsewhere.\u00ba Brief for Respondent 44. This isprecisely the type of vague and unsubstantiated allegationthat could never support a restriction on speech. Finally,the fact that other governmental bodies have also enactedrestrictions on solicitation in other places, see, e. g., 36 CFR \u00a7 7.96(h) (1991), is not evidence of fraudulent conduct. Even assuming a governmental interest adequate to jus- tify some regulation, the present ban would fall when sub-jected to the requirement of narrow tailoring. See Riley, supra, at 800; Schaumburg, supra, at 637 (\u00aaThe Village may serve its legitimate interests, but it must do so by narrowlydrawn regulations designed to serve those interests withoutunnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms\u00ba).\u00aaPrecision of regulation must touchstone . . . .\u00ba But- Schaumburg we said: \u00aaThe Village's legitimate interest in preventing fraud can be better served by measures less intrusive than adirect prohibition on solicitation. Fraudulent misrepre-sentations can be prohibited and the penal laws used topunish such conduct directly. Efforts to promote disclo-sure of the \u00aenances of charitable organizations also mayassist in preventing fraud by informing the public of theways in which their contributions will be employed.Such measures may help make contribution decisionsmore informed, while leaving to individual choice the505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:50 PAGES OPINPGT 715 Cite as: 505 U.

Similarly, in Riley we required the State to cure its per- ceived fraud problem by more narrowly tailored means thancompe lling disclosure by professional fundraisers of the amount of collected funds that were actually turned over tocharity during the previous year: \u00aaIn contrast to the prophylactic, imprecise, and unduly burdensome rule the State has adopted to reduce its al-leged donor misperception, more benign and narrowlytailored options are available. For example, as a gen-eral rule, the State may itself publish the detailed \u00ae-nancial disclosure forms it requires professional fund-raisers to \u00aele. This procedure would communicate thedesired information to the public without burdening aspeaker with unwanted speech during the course of asolicitation. Alternatively, the State may vigorouslyenforce its antifraud laws to prohibit professional fund-raisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or bymaking false statements.\u00ba 487 U. S., at 800. Finally, I do not think the Port Authority's solicitation ban leaves open the \u00aaample\u00ba channels of communication requiredof a valid content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction.A distribution of preaddressed envelopes is unlikely to bemuch of an alternative. The practical reality of the regula-tion, which this Court can never ignore, is that it shuts off auniquely powerful avenue of communication for organiza-tions like the International Society for Krishna Conscious-ness, and may, in effect, completely prohibit unpopular andpoorly funded groups from receiving funds in response toprotected solicitation.

Argued November 13, 1991\u00d0Decided June 26, 1992* Despite this Court's decisions in Brown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483(Brown I), and Brown v.Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (Brown II), Mississippi continued its policy of de jure segregation in its public university system, maintaining \u00aeve almost completely white and threealmost exclusively black universities. Private petitioners initiated thislawsuit in 1975, and the United States intervened, charging that stateof\u00aecials had failed to satisfy their obligation under, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of theCivil Rights Act of 1964 to dismantle the dual system. In an attemptto reach a consensual resolution through voluntary dismantlement, theState Board of Trustees, in 1981, issued \u00aaMission Statements\u00ba classify-ing the three \u00afagship white institutions during the de jure period as \u00aacomprehensive\u00ba universities having the most varied programs and of-fering doctoral degrees, redesignating one of the black colleges as an\u00aaurban\u00ba university with limited research and degree functions gearedtoward its urban setting, and characterizing the rest of the colleges as\u00aaregional\u00ba institutions which functioned primarily in an undergraduaterole. When, by the mid-1980's, the student bodies at the white universi-ties were still predominantly white, and the racial composition at theblack institutions remained largely black, the suit proceeded to trial.After voluminous evidence was presented on a full range of educationalissues, the District Court entered extensive \u00aendings of fact on, amongother things, admissions requirements, institutional classi\u00aecation andmissions assignments, duplication of programs, and funding. Its conclu-sions of law included rulings that, based on its interpretation of Baze- more v.Friday, 478 U. S. 385, and other cases, the af\u00aermative duty to desegregate in the higher education context does not contemplate eitherrestricting student choice or the achievement of any degree of racialbalance; that current state policies and practices should be examined toensure that they are racially neutral, developed and implemented ingood faith, and do not substantially contribute to the racial identi\u00aeability *Together with No. 90\u00b16588, Ayers et al. v.Fordice, Governor of Missis- sippi, et al., also on the 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 718 STATES v.FORDICE institutions; and that Mississippi's current actions dem- onstrate conclusively that the State is ful\u00aelling its af\u00aermative duty todisestablish the former de jure segregated system. In af\u00aerming, the Court of Appeals left largely undisturbed the lower court's \u00aendingsand conclusions. Held: 1. The courts below did not apply the correct legal standard in ruling that Mississippi has brought itself into compliance with the Equal Pro-tection Clause. If the State perpetuates policies and practices trace-able to its prior de jure dual system that continue to have segregative effects\u00d0whether by in\u00afuencing student enrollment decisions or byfostering segregation in other facets of the university system\u00d0andsuch policies are without sound educational justi\u00aecation and can be prac-ticably eliminated, the policies violate the Clause, even though theState has abolished the legal requirement that the races be educatedseparately and has established racially neutral policies not animated bya discriminatory purpose. Bazemore v.Friday, supra, distinguished. The proper inquiry asks whether existing racial identi\u00aeability is attrib-utable to the State, see, e. g., Freeman v.Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, and exam- ines a wide range of factors to determine whether the State has perpet-uated its former segregation in any facet of its system, see, e. g., Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v.Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 250. Because the District Court's standard did not ask the appropriate ques-tions, the Court of Appeals erred in af\u00aerming the lower court's judg-ment. Pp. 727\u00b1732. 2. When the correct legal standard is applied, it becomes apparent from the District Court's undisturbed factual \u00aendings that there areseveral surviving aspects of Mississippi's prior dual system which areconstitutionally suspect; for even though such policies may be raceneutral on their face, they substantially restrict a person's choice ofwhich institution to enter and they contribute to the racial identi\u00aeabilityof the eight public universities. Mississippi must justify these policies,as well as any others that are susceptible to challenge by petitioners onremand under the proper standard, or eliminate them. Pp. 732\u00b1743. (a) Although the State's current admissions policy requiring higher minimum composite scores on the American College Testing Program(ACT) for the \u00aeve historically white institutions than for the three his-torically black universities derived from policies enacted in the 1970's toredress the problem of student unpreparedness, the policy is constitu-tionally suspect because it was originally enacted in 1963 by three ofthe white universities to discriminate against black students, who, atthe time, had an average ACT score well below the required minimum.505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 719 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Syllabus The policy also has present discriminatory effects, since a much higher percentage of white than of black high school seniors recently scoredat or above the minimum necessary to enter a white university. Thesegregative effect of this standard is especially striking in light of thedifferences in minimum required entrance scores among the white andblack regional universities and colleges with dissimilar programmaticmissions, and yet the courts below made little effort to justify thosedisparities in educational terms or to inquire whether it was practicableto eliminate them. The State's refusal to consider high school gradeperformance along with ACT scores is also constitutionally problematic,since the ACT's administering organization discourages use of ACTscores alone, the disparity between black and white students' highschool grade averages is much narrower than the gap between theiraverage ACT scores, most States use high school grades and other indi-cators along with standardized test scores, and Mississippi's approachwas not adequately justi\u00aeed or shown to be unsusceptible to eliminationwithout eroding sound educational policy. Pp. 733\u00b1738. (b) The District Court's treatment of the widespread duplication of programs at the historically black and historically white Mississippiuniversities is problematic for several reasons. First, it can hardly bedenied that such duplication represents a continuation of the \u00aaseparatebut equal\u00ba treatment required by the prior dual system, and yet thecourt's holding that petitioners could not establish a constitutional de-fect shifted the burden of proof away from the State in violation ofBrown II, supra, at 300, and its progeny. Second, implicit in the court's \u00aending of \u00aaunnecessary\u00ba duplication is the absence of any educationaljusti\u00aecation and the fact that some, if not all, duplication may be practi-cally eliminated. Finally, by treating this issue in isolation, the courtfailed to consider the combined effects of unnecessary duplication withother policies in evaluating whether the State had met its constitutionalduty. Pp. 738\u00b1739. (c) Mississippi's 1981 mission assignments scheme has as its ante- cedents the policies enacted to perpetuate racial separation during the de jure period. When combined with the differential admission prac- tices and unnecessary program duplication, it is likely that the missiondesignations interfere with student choice and tend to perpetuate thesegregated system.

In 1954, this Court held that the concept of \u00aa `separate but equal' \u00ba has no place in the \u00aeeld of public education. Brown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495 (Brown I) . The following year, the Court ordered an end to segregated pub-lic education \u00aawith all deliberate speed.\u00ba Brown v.Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 (1955) (Brown II). Since these decisions, the Court has had many occasions to evalu-ate whether a public school district has met its af\u00aermativeobligation to dismantle its prior de jure segregated system in elementary and secondary schools. In these cases we de-cide what standards to apply in determining whether theState of Mississippi has met this obligation in the univer-sity context. I Mississippi launched its public university system in 1848 by establishing the University of Mississippi, an institutiondedicated to the higher education exclusively of white per-sons. In succeeding decades, the State erected additionalpostsecondary, single-race educational facilities. AlcornState University opened its doors in 1871 as \u00aaan agriculturalcollege for the Supp. 1523, 1527 (ND 1987). Creation of four more exclusively white institutions followed:Mississippi State University (1880), Mississippi Universityfor Women (1885), University of Southern Mississippi (1912),and Delta State University (1925). The State added twomore solely black institutions in 1940 and 1950: in the formeryear, Jackson State University, which was charged withtraining \u00aablack teachers for the black public schools,\u00ba id.,at 1528; and in the latter year, Mississippi Valley State Univer- Murphy; and for Charles E. \u00aaBuddy\u00ba Roemer III, Governor of the State of Louisiana, et al. by John N.

Tatel \u00aeled a brief of amicus PAGES OPINPGT 722 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court sity, whose functions were to educate teachers primarily for rural and elementary schools and to provide vocational in-struction to black students. Despite this Court's decisions in Brown I and Brown II, Mississippi's policy of de jure segregation continued. The \u00aerst black student was not admitted to the University of Mis-sissippi until 1962, and then only by court order. See Mere- dith v.Fair, 306 828, enf'd, 313 F. 2d 532 (1962) (en banc) (per curiam). For the next 12 years the segregated public university system in theState remained largely intact. Mississippi State University,Mississippi University for Women, University of SouthernMississippi, and Delta State University each admitted atleast one black student during these years, but the studentcomposition of these institutions was still almost completelywhite. During this period, Jackson State and MississippiValley State were exclusively black; Alcorn State had ad-mitted \u00aeve white students by 1968. In 1969, the United States Department of Health, Educa- tion and Welfare (HEW) initiated efforts to enforce Title VIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000d. 1HEW requested that the State devise a plan to disestablish the for- merly de jure segregated university system. In June 1973, the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learn-ing (Board) submitted a plan of compliance, which expressedthe aims of improving educational opportunities for all Mis-sissippi citizens by setting numerical goals on the enrollmentof other-race students at state universities, hiring other-racefaculty members, and instituting remedial programs and spe-cial recruitment efforts to achieve those goals. App. 898\u00b1900. HEW rejected this Plan as fa iling to comply with Title VI because it did not go far enough in the areas of student 1This provision states: \u00aaNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in,be denied the bene\u00aets of, or be subjected to discrimination under anyprogram or activity receiving Federal \u00aenancial assistance.\u00ba505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 723 Cite as: 505 U.

The Board reluctantly offered amend- ments, prefacing its reform pledge to HEW with this state-ment: \u00aaWith deference, it is the position of the Board ofTrustees . . . that the Mississippi system of higher educationis in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of1964.\u00ba Id., at 898. At this time, the racial composition of the State's universities had changed only marginally fromthe levels of 1968, which were almost exclusively single race. 2 Though HEW refused to accept the modi\u00aeed Plan, the Boardadopted it anyway. 674 F. Supp., at 1530. But even thelimited effects of this Plan in disestablishing the prior de jure segregated system were substantially constricted by the state legislature, which refused to fund it until \u00aescal year1978, and even then at well under half the amount sought bythe Board. App. 896\u00b1897, 1444\u00b11445, 1448\u00b11449. 3 Private petitioners initiated this lawsuit in 1975. They complained that Mississippi had maintained the racially seg-regative effects of its prior dual system of postsecondary ed-ucation in violation of the Fifth, Ninth, Thirteenth, andFourteenth Amendments, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, andTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000d. 2For the 1974\u00b11975 school year, black students comprised 4.1 percent of the full-time undergraduate enrollments at University of Mississippi; atMississippi State University, 7.5 percent; at University of Southern Missis-sippi, 8.0 percent; at Delta State University, 12.6 percent; at MississippiUniversity for Women, 13.0 percent. At Jackson State, Alcorn State, andMississippi Valley State, the percentages of black students were 96.6percent, 99.9 percent, and 100 percent, respectively. Brief for UnitedStates 7. 3According to counsel for respondents, it was in this time period\u00d0the mid- to late-1970's\u00d0that the State came into full \u00aacompliance with thelaw\u00ba as having taken the necessary af\u00aermative steps to dismantle its priorde jure system. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 724 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court Shortly thereafter, the United States \u00aeled its complaint in intervention, charging that state of\u00aecials had failed to satisfytheir obligation under the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment and Title VI to dismantle Mississip-pi's dual system of higher education. After this lawsuit was \u00aeled, the parties attempted for 12 years to achieve a consensual resolution of their differencesthrough voluntary dismantlement by the State of its priorseparated system. The board of trustees implemented re-views of existing curricula and program \u00aamission\u00ba at eachinstitution. In 1981, the Board issued \u00aaMission Statements\u00ba that identi\u00aeed the extant purpose of each public university.These \u00aamissions\u00ba were clustered into three categories: com-prehensive, urban, and regional. \u00aaComprehensive\u00ba univer-sities were classi\u00aeed as those with the greatest existing re-sources and program offerings. All three such institutions(University of Mississippi, Mississippi State, and SouthernMississippi) were exclusively white under the prior de jure segregated system. The Board authorized each to continueoffering doctoral degrees and to assert leadership in certaindisciplines. Jackson State, the sole urban university, wasassigned a more limited research and degree mission, withboth functions geared toward its urban setting. It was ex-clusively black at its inception. The \u00aaregional\u00ba designationwas something of a misnomer, as the Board envisioned thoseinstitutions primarily in an undergraduate role, rather thana \u00aaregional\u00ba one in the geographical sense of serving just thelocalities in which they were based. Only the universitiesclassi\u00aeed as \u00aaregional\u00ba included institutions that, prior todesegregation, had been either exclusively white\u00d0DeltaState and Mississippi University for Women\u00d0or exclusivelyblack\u00d0Alcorn State and Mississippi Valley State. By the mid-1980's, 30 years after Brown, more than 99 percent of Mississippi's white students were enrolled at Uni-versity of Mississippi, Mississippi State, Southern Missis-sippi, Delta State, and Mississippi University for Women.505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 725 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court The student bodies at these universities remained predomi- nantly white, averaging between 80 and 91 percent whitestudents. Seventy-one percent of the State's black studentsattended Jackson State, Alcorn State, and Mississippi ValleyState, where the racial composition ranged from 92 to 99 per-cent black. Ayers v.Allain, 893 F. 2d 732, 734\u00b1735 (CA5 1990) (panel decision). II By 1987, the parties concluded that they could not agree on whether the State had taken the requisite af\u00aermativesteps to dismantle its prior de jure segregated system. They proceeded to trial. Both sides presented voluminousevidence on a full range of educational issues spanningadmissions standards, faculty and administrative staff re-cruitment, program duplication, on-campus discrimination,institutional funding disparities, and satellite campuses.Petitioners argued that in various ways the State continuedto reinforce historic, race-based distinctions among the uni-versities. Respondents argued generally that the State hadful\u00aelled its duty to disestablish its state-imposed segregativesystem by implementing and maintaining good-faith, non-discriminatory race-neutral policies and practices in studentadmission, faculty hiring, and operations. Moreover, theysuggested, the State had attracted signi\u00aecant numbers ofquali\u00aeed black students to those universities composedmostly of white persons. Respondents averred that themere continued existence of racially identi\u00aeable universitieswas not unlawful given the freedom of students to choosewhich institution to attend and the varying objectives andfeatures of the State's universities. At trial's end, based on the testimony of 71 witnesses and 56,700 pages of exhibits, the District Court entered exten-sive \u00aendings of fact. The court \u00aerst offered a historicaloverview of the higher education institutions in Mississippiand the developments in the system between 1954 and the\u00aeling of this suit in 1975. 674 F. Supp., at It505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 726 UNITED v.FORDICE Court then made speci\u00aec \u00aendings recounting post-1975 develop- ments, including a description at the time of trial, in thoseareas of the higher education system under attack by plain-tiffs: admission requirements and recruitment; institutionalclassi\u00aecation and assignment of missions; duplication of pro-grams; \u00aenance; the and staff; and governance. Id.,at 1530\u00b11550. The court's conclusions of law followed. As an overview, the court outlined the common ground in the action: \u00aaWherea state has previously maintained a racially dual system ofpublic education established by law, it assumes an `af\u00aerma- tive duty' to reform those policies and practices which re-quired or contributed to the separation of races.\u00ba Id., at 1551. Noting that courts unanimously hold that the af\u00aerm-ative duty to dismantle a racially dual structure in elemen-tary and secondary schools also governs in the higher educa-tion context, the court observed that there was disagreementwhether Green v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), applied in all of its aspects to formerly dual sys-tems of higher education, i. e., whether \u00aasome level of racial mixture at previously segregated institutions of higherlearning is not only desirable but necessary to `effectively'desegregate the system.\u00ba 674 F. Supp., at 1552. Relyingon a court decision, Alabama State Teachers Assn. (ASTA) v.Alabama Public School and Col- lege Authority, 289 Supp. 784 (MD Ala. 1968), our per curiam af\u00aermance of that case, 393 U. S. 400 (1969), and its understanding of our later decision in Bazemore v.Friday, 478 U. S. 385 (1986), the court concluded that in the highereducation context, \u00aathe af\u00aermative duty to desegregate doesnot contemplate either restricting choice or the achievementof any degree of racial balance.\u00ba 674 F. Supp., at 1553.Thus, the court stated: \u00aaWhile student enrollment and fac-ulty and staff hiring patterns are to be examined, greateremphasis should instead be placed on current state highereducation policies and practices in order to insure that such505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 727 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court policies and practices are racially neutral, developed and im- plemented in good faith, and do not substantially contributeto the continued racial identi\u00aeability of individual institu-tions.\u00ba Id.,at 1554. When it addressed the same aspects of the university sys- tem covered by the \u00aendings of fact in light of the foregoingstandard, the court found no violation of federal law in anyof them. \u00aaIn summary, the court \u00aends that current actionson the part of the defendants demonstrate conclusively thatthe defendants are ful \u00aelling their af\u00aermative duty to dises- tablish the former segregated system of higher edu- cation.\u00ba Id.,at 1564. The Court of Appeals reheard the action en banc and af- \u00aermed the decision of the District Court. Ayers v.Allain, 914 F. 2d 676 (CA5 1990). With a single exception, seeinfra, at 741, it did not disturb the District Court's \u00aendings of fact or conclusions of law. The en banc majority agreedthat \u00aaMississippi was . . . constitutionally required to elimi-nate racial distinctions and dismantle its dual sys-tem.\u00ba Id.,at 682. That duty, the court held, had been dis- charged since \u00aathe record makes clear that Mississippi hasadopted and implemented race neutral policies for operatingits colleges and universities and that all students have realfreedom of choice to attend the college or university theyw i s h.... \u00ba Id.,at 678. We granted the respective writs of certiorari \u00aeled by the United States and the private petitioners. 499 U. S. 958(1991). III The District Court, the Court of Appeals, and respondents recognize and acknowledge that the State of Mississippi hadthe constitutional duty to dismantle the dual school systemthat its laws once mandated. Nor is there any dispute thatthis obligation applies to its higher education system. If theState has not discharged this duty, it remains in violation ofthe Fourteenth Amendment. Brown v.Board of Education505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 728 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court and its progeny clearly mandate this observation. Thus, the primary issue in these cases is whether the State has metits af\u00aermative duty to dismantle its prior dual universitysystem. Our decisions establish that a State does not discharge its constitutional obligations until it eradicates policies and prac-tices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster segregation. Thus we have consistently askedwhether existing racial identi\u00aeability is attributable to theState, see, e. g., Freeman v.Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 496 (1992); Bazemore v.Friday, 407 ( White, J., concurring); Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v.Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 434 (1976); Gilmore v.City of Montgomery, 417 U. S. 556, 566\u00b1 567 (1974); and examined a wide range of factors to deter-mine whether the State has perpetuated its formerly de jure segregation in any facet of its institutional system. See,e. g., Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 250 (1991); Swann v.Charlotte- Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 18 (1971); Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County, supra, at 435\u00b1438. The Court of Appeals concluded that the State had ful\u00aelled its af\u00aermative obligation to disestablish its prior de jure seg- regated system by adopting and implementing race-neutralpolicies governing its college and university system. Be-cause students seeking higher education had \u00aareal freedom\u00bato choose the institution of their choice, the State need do nomore. Even though neutral policies and free choice werenot enough to dismantle a dual system of primary or second-ary schools, Green v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), the Court of Appeals thought that universi-ties \u00aadiffer in character fundamentally\u00ba from lower levels ofschools, 914 F. 2d, at so that our decision inBazemore v.Friday, supra, justi\u00aeed the conclusion that the State had dismantled its former dual system. Like the United States, we do not disagree with the Court of Appeals' observation that a state university system is505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 729 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court quite different in very relevant respects from primary and secondary schools. Unlike attendance at the lower levelschools, a student's decision to seek higher education hasbeen a matter of choice. The State historically has not as-signed university students to a particular institution. More-over, like public universities throughout the country, Missis-sippi's institutions of higher learning are not fungible\u00d0theyhave been designated to perform certain missions. Stu-dents who qualify for admission enjoy a range of choices ofwhich institution to attend. Thus, as the Court of Appealsstated, \u00aa[i]t hardly needs mention that remedies common to public school desegregation, such as pupil assignments, bus-ing, attendance quotas, and zoning, are unavailable whenpersons may freely choose whether to pursue an advancededucation and, when the choice is made, which of severaluniversities to attend.\u00ba 914 F. 2d, at 687. We do not agree with the Court of Appeals or the District Court, however, that the adoption and implementation ofrace-neutral policies alone suf\u00aece to demonstrate that theState has completely abandoned its prior dual system. Thatcollege attendance is by choice and not by assignment doesnot mean that a race-neutral admissions policy cures the con-stitutional violation of a dual system. In a system basedon choice, student attendance is determined not simply byadmissions policies, but also by many other factors. Al-though some of these factors clearly cannot be attributed tostate policies, many can be. Thus, even after a State dis-mantles its segregative admissions policy, there may still be state action that is traceable to the State's prior de jure segregation and that continues to foster segregation. TheEqual Protection Clause is offended by \u00aasophisticated as wellas simple-minded modes of discrimination.\u00ba Lane v.Wil- son, 307 U. S. 268, 275 (1939). If policies traceable to the de jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed to the extent practicableand consistent with sound educational practices.

S. 413, 414 (1956) (per curiam).4We also disagree with respondents that the Court of Appeals and District Courtproperly relied on our decision in Bazemore v.Friday, 478 U. S. 385 (1986). Bazemore neither requires nor justi\u00aees the conclusions reached by the two courts below. 5 4To the extent we understand private petitioners to urge us to focus on present discriminatory effects without addressing whether such conse-quences \u00afow from policies rooted in the prior system, we reject this posi-tion. Private petitioners contend that the State must not only cease itslegally authorized discrimination, it must also \u00aaeliminate its continuingeffects insofar as practicable.\u00ba Brief for Petitioners in No. 90\u00b16588, p. 44.Though they seem to disavow as radical a remedy as student reassignmentin the university setting, id.,at 66, their focus on \u00aastudent enrollment, faculty and staff employment patterns, [and] black citizens' college-goingand degree-granting rates,\u00ba id.,at 63, would seemingly compel remedies akin to those upheld in Green v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), were we to adopt their legal standard. As will become clear, however, the inappropriateness of remedies adopted in Green by no means suggests that the racial identi\u00aeability of the institutions in a universitysystem is irrelevant to deciding whether a State such as Mississippi hassatisfactorily dismantled its prior de jure dual system or that the State need not take additional steps to ameliorate such identi\u00aeability. 5Similarly, reliance on our per curiam af\u00aermance in Alabama State Teachers Assn. v.Alabama Public School and College Authority, 289 F. Supp. 784 (MD Ala. 1968) (ASTA), aff'd, 393 U. S. 400 (1969) (per cu- riam), is misplaced. In ASTA, the state teachers association sought to enjoin construction of an extension campus of Auburn University in Mont-gomery, Alabama. The three-judge District Court rejected the allegationthat such a facility would perpetuate the State's dual system. It foundthat the State had educationally justi\u00aeable reasons for this new campusand that it had acted in good faith in the \u00aeelds of admissions, faculty, andstaff. 289 F. Supp., at 789. The court also noted that it was \u00aareasonableto conclude that a new institution will not be a white school or a Negro school, but just a school.\u00ba Ibid. Respondents are incorrect to suppose that ASTA validates policies traceable to the de jure system regardless of whether or not they are educationally justi\u00aeable or can be practicablyaltered to reduce Cite as: S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court Bazemore raised the issue whether the \u00aenancing and oper- ational assistance provided by a state university's extensionservice to voluntary 4\u00b1H and Homemaker Clubs was incon-sistent with the Equal Protection Clause because of the ex-istence of numerous all-white and all-black clubs. Thoughprior to 1965 the clubs were supported on a segregated basis, the District Court had found that the policy of segregationhad been completely abandoned and that no evidence existedof any lingering discrimination in either services or member-ship; any racial imbalance resulted from the wholly voluntaryand unfettered choice of private individuals. Bazemore, supra, at 407 ( White , J., concurring). In this context, we held inapplicable the Green Court's judgment that a volun- tary choice program was insuf\u00aecient to dismantle a de jure dual system in public primary and secondary schools, butonly after satisfying ourselves that the State had not fos-tered segregation by playing a part in the decision of whichclub an individual chose to join. Bazemore plainly does not excuse inquiry into whether Mississippi has left in place certain aspects of its prior dualsystem that perpetuate the racially segregated higher educa-tion system. If the State perpetuates policies and practicestraceable to its prior system that continue to have segre-gative effects\u00d0whether by in\u00afuencing student enrollmentdecisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of theuniversity system\u00d0and such policies are without sound edu-cational justi\u00aecation and can be practicably eliminated, theState has not satis\u00aeed its burden of proving that it has dis-mantled its prior system. Such policies run afoul of theEqual Protection Clause, even though the State has abol-ished the legal requirement that whites and blacks be edu-cated separately and has established racially neutral policies505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 732 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court not animated by a discriminatory purpose.6Because the standard applied by the District Court did not make theseinquiries, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in af\u00aerm-ing the District Court's ruling that the State had broughtitself into compliance with the Equal Protection Clause inthe operation of its higher education system. 7 IV Had the Court of Appeals applied the correct legal stand- ard, it would have been apparent from the undisturbed fac- 6Of course, if challenged policies are not rooted in the prior dual system, the question becomes whether the fact of racial separation establishes anew violation of the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles.Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v.Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 250\u00b1251 (1991); Arlington Heights v.Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977). 7The Court of Appeals also misanalyzed the Title VI claim. The court stated that \u00aawe are not prepared to say the defendants have failed to meetthe duties outlined in the regulations.\u00ba 914 F. 2d 676, 687\u00b1688, n. 11 (CA51990). The court added that it need not \u00aadiscuss the scope of Mississippi'sduty under the regulations\u00ba because \u00aathe duty outlined by the SupremeCourt in Bazemore controls in Title VI cases.\u00ba Ibid. It will be recalled, however, that the relevant agency and the courts had speci\u00aecally found noviolation of the regulation in Bazemore v.Friday, 478 U. S. 385, 409 (1986) (White, J. , concurring). Insofar as it failed to perform the same factual inquiry and application as the courts in Bazemore had made, therefore, the Court of Appeals' reliance on Bazemore toavoid conducting a similar analysis in these cases was inappropriate. Private petitioners reiterate in this Court their assertion that the state system also violates Title VI, citing a regulation to that statute whichrequires States to \u00aatake af\u00aermative action to overcome the effects of priordiscrimination.\u00ba 34 CFR \u00a7 100.3(b)(6)(i) (1991).

S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court tual \u00aendings of the District Court that there are several sur- viving aspects of Mississippi's prior dual system which areconstitutionally suspect; for even though such policies maybe race neutral on their face, they substantially restrict aperson's choice of which institution to enter, and they con-tribute to the racial identi\u00aeability of the eight public univer- sities. Mississippi must justify these policies or eliminatethem. It is important to state at the outset that we make no effort to identify an exclusive list of unconstitutional rem-nants of Mississippi's prior de jure system. In highlighting, as we do below, certain remnants of the prior system thatare readily apparent from the \u00aendings of fact made by theDistrict Court and af\u00aermed by the Court of Appeals, 8we by no means suggest that the Court of Appeals need not ex-amine, in light of the proper standard, each of the other poli-cies now governing the State's university system that havebeen challenged or that are challenged on remand in light ofthe standard that we articulate today. With this caveat inmind, we address four policies of the present system: admis-sions standards, program duplication, institutional missionassignments, and continued operation of all eight publicuniversities. We deal \u00aerst with the current admissions policies of Mis- sissippi's public universities. As the District Court found,the three \u00afagship historically white universities in the sys- 8In this sense, it is important to reiterate that we do not disturb the \u00aendings of no discriminatory purpose in the many instances in whichthe courts below made such conclusions. The private petitioners and theUnited States, however, need not show such discriminatory intent to es-tablish a constitutional violation for the perpetuation of policies traceableto the prior de jure segregative regime which have continuing discrimi- natory effects. As for present policies that do not have such historicalantecedents, a claim of violation of the Fourteenth Amendment cannotbe made out without a showing of discriminatory purpose. See supra, at 732, n. 6.505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 734 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court tem\u00d0University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and University of Southern Mississippi\u00d0enacted policies in1963 requiring all entrants to achieve a minimum compositescore of 15 on the test administered by the American CollegeTesting Program (ACT). 674 F. Supp., at 1531. The courtdescribed the \u00aadiscriminatory taint\u00ba of this policy, id., at 1557, an obvious reference to the fact that, at the time, theaverage ACT score for white students was 18 and the aver-age score for blacks was 7. 893 F. 2d, at 735. The DistrictCourt concluded, and the en banc Court of Appeals agreed,that present admissions standards derived from policies en- acted in the 1970's to redress the problem of student unpre-paredness. 914 F. 2d, at justi\u00aecation perpetuating a policyenacted originally to discriminate against black studentsdoes not make the present admissions standards any lessconstitutionally suspect. The present admissions standards are not only traceable to the de jure system and were originally adopted for a dis- criminatory purpose, but they also have present discrimina-tory effects. Every Mississippi resident under 21 seekingadmission to the university system must take the ACT test.Any applicant who scores at least 15 quali\u00aees for automaticadmission to any of the \u00aeve historically white institutionsexcept Mississippi University for Women, which requires ascore of 18 for automatic admission unless the student has a3.0 high school grade average. Those scoring less than 15but at least 13 automatically qualify to enter Jackson StateUniversity, Alcorn State University, and Mississippi ValleyState University. Without doubt, these requirements re-strict the range of choices of entering students as to whichinstitution they may attend in a way that perpetuates segre-gation. Those scoring 13 or 14, with some exceptions, areexcluded from the \u00aeve historically white universities and ifthey want a higher education must go to one of the histori-cally black institutions or attend junior college with the hope505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 735 Cite as: 505 U.

App.1524\u00b11525. It is not surprising then that Mississippi's uni-versities remain predominantly identi\u00aeable by race. The segregative effect of this automatic entrance standard is especially striking in light of the differences in minimumautomatic entrance scores among the regional universitiesin Mississippi's system. The minimum score for automaticadmission to Mississippi University for Women is 18; it is 13for the historically black universities. Yet Mississippi Uni-versity for Women is assigned the same institutional missionas two other regional universities, Alcorn State and Missis-sippi Valley State\u00d0that of providing quality undergraduateeducation. The effects of the policy fall disproportionatelyon black students who might wish to attend Mississippi Uni-versity for Women; and though the disparate impact is not as great, the same is true of the minimum standard ACTscore of 15 at Delta State University\u00d0the other \u00aaregional\u00bauniversity\u00d0as compared to the historically black \u00aaregional\u00bauniversities where a score of 13 suf\u00aeces for automatic admis-sion. The courts below made little, if any, effort to justifyin educational terms those particular disparities in entrancerequirements or to inquire whether it was practicable toeliminate them. 9The District Court's \u00aending that \u00aa[v]ery few black students, if any, are actually denied admission to a Mississippi university as a \u00aerst-time fresh-man for failure to achieve the minimal v.Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1535 (ND Miss. ignores inherent self-selectionthat accompanies public announcement of \u00aaautomatic\u00ba admissions stand-ards. It is logical to think that some percentage of black students whofail to score 15 do not seek admission to one of the historically white universities because of this automatic admissions standard.505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 736 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court We also \u00aend inadequately justi\u00aeed by the courts below or by the record before us the differential admissions require-ments between universities with dissimilar programmaticmissions. We do not suggest that absent a discriminatorypurpose different programmatic missions accompanied bydifferent admissions standards would be constitutionally sus-pect simply because one or more schools are racially identi-\u00aeable. But here the differential admissions standards areremnants of the dual system with a continuing discrimina-tory effect, and the mission assignments \u00aato some degreefollow the historical racial assignments,\u00ba 914 F. 2d, at 692. Moreover, the District Court did not justify the differing ad-missions standards based on the different mission assign-ments. It observed only that in the 1970's, the board oftrustees justi\u00aeed a minimum ACT score of 15 because toomany students with lower scores were not prepared for thehistorically white institutions and that imposing the 15 scorerequirement on admissions to the historically black institu-tions would decimate attendance at those universities. TheDistrict Court also stated that the mission of the regionaluniversities had the more modest function of providing qual-ity undergraduate education. Certainly the comprehensiveuniversities are also, among other things, educating under-graduates. But we think the 15 ACT test score for auto-matic admission to the comprehensive universities, as com-pared with a score of 13 for the regionals, requires furtherjusti\u00aecation in terms of sound educational policy. Another constitutionally problematic aspect of the State's use of the ACT test scores is its policy of denying automaticadmission if an applicant fails to earn the minimum ACTscore speci\u00aeed for the particular institution, without also re-sorting to the applicant's high school grades as an additionalfactor in predicting college performance. The United Statesproduced evidence that the American College Testing Pro-gram (ACTP), the administering organization of the ACT,discourages use of ACT scores as the sole admissions crite-505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 737 Cite as: 505 U.

One ACTP report presented intoevidence suggests that \u00aait would be foolish\u00ba to substitute a3- or 4-hour test in place of a student's high school gradesas a means of predicting college performance. Id., at 193. The record also indicated that the disparity between blackand white students' high school grade averages was muchnarrower than the gap between their average ACT scores,thereby suggesting that an admissions formula which in-cluded grades would increase the number of black studentseligible for automatic admission to all of Mississippi's publicuniversities. 10 The United States insists that the State's refusal to con- sider information which would better predict college per-formance than ACT scores alone is irrational in light of mostStates' use of high school grades and other indicators alongwith standardized test scores. The District Court observedthat the board of trustees was concerned with grade in\u00afationand the lack of comparability in grading practices and courseofferings among the State's diverse high schools. Both theDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals found this concernample justi\u00aecation for the failure to consider high schoolgrade performance along with ACT scores. In our view,such justi\u00aecation is inadequate because the ACT require-ment was originally adopted for discriminatory purposes, the 10In 1985, 72 percent of white students in Mississippi scored 15 or better on the ACT test, whereas only 30 percent of black students achieved thatmark, a difference of nearly 2 1/2times. By contrast, the disparity among grade averages was not nearly so wide. 43.8 percent of white high schoolstudents and 30.5 percent of black students averaged at least a 3.0, and62.2 percent of whites and 49.2 percent of blacks earned at least a 2.5grade point average. App. 1524\u00b11525. Though it failed to make speci\u00aecfact\u00aendings on this point, this evidence, which the State does not dispute,is fairly encompassed within the District Court's statement that \u00aa[b]lackstudents on the average score somewhat lower [than white Supp., 738 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court current requirement is traceable to that decision and seem- ingly continues to have segregative effects, and the Statehas so far failed to show that the \u00aaACT-only\u00ba admissionsstandard is not susceptible to elimination without erodingsound educational policy. A second aspect of the present system that necessitates further inquiry is the widespread duplication of programs.\u00aaUnnecessary\u00ba duplication refers, under the District Court'sde\u00aenition, \u00aato those instances where two or more institutionsoffer the same nonessential or noncore program. Under thisde\u00aenition, all duplication at the bachelor's level of nonbasic liberal arts and sciences course work and all duplication atthe master's level and above are considered to be unneces-sary.\u00ba 674 F. Supp., at 1540. The District Court found that34.6 percent of the 29 undergraduate programs at historicallyblack institutions are \u00aaunnecessarily duplicated\u00ba by the his-torically white universities, and that 90 percent of the gradu-ate programs at the historically black institutions are un-necessarily duplicated at the historically white institutions.Id.,at 1541. In its conclusions of law on this point, the Dis- trict Court nevertheless determined that \u00aathere is no proof\u00bathat such duplication \u00aais directly associated with the racialidenti\u00aeability of institutions,\u00ba and that \u00aathere is no proof thatthe elimination of unnecessary program duplication would bejusti\u00aeable from an educational standpoint or that its elimina-tion would have a substantial effect on student choice.\u00ba Id., at 1561. The District Court's treatment of this issue is problematic from several different perspectives. First, the court ap-peared to impose the burden of proof on the plaintiffs to meeta legal standard the court itself acknowledged was not yetformulated. It can hardly be denied that such duplicationwas part and parcel of the prior dual system of higher educa-tion\u00d0the whole notion of \u00aaseparate but equal\u00ba required du-plicative programs in two sets of schools\u00d0and that the pres-ent unnecessary duplication is a continuation practice.505US3113N 06-12-96 PAGES OPINPGT 739 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court Brown and its progeny, however, established that the burden of proof falls on the State, and not the aggrieved plaintiffs, to establish that it has dismantled its prior de jure segregated system. Brown II, 349 U. S., at 300. The court's holding that petitioners could not establish the constitutional defectof unnecessary duplication, therefore, improperly shifted theburden away from the State. Second, implicit in the Dis-trict Court's \u00aending of \u00aaunnecessary\u00ba duplication is the ab-sence of any educational justi\u00aecation and the fact that some,if not all, duplication may be practicably eliminated. In-deed, the District Court observed that such duplication \u00aacan- not be justi\u00aeed economically or in terms of providing qualityeducation.\u00ba 674 F. Supp., at 1541. Yet by stating that\u00aathere is no proof\u00ba that elimination of unnecessary duplica-tion would decrease institutional racial identi\u00aeability, affectstudent choice, and promote educationally sound policies, thecourt did not make clear whether it had directed the partiesto develop evidence on these points, and if so, what that evi-dence revealed. See id.,at 1561. Finally, by treating this issue in isolation, the court failed to consider the combinedeffects of unnecessary program duplication with other poli-cies, such as differential admissions standards, in evaluatingwhether the State had met its duty to dismantle its prior de jure segregated system. We next address Mississippi's scheme of institutional mis- sion classi\u00aecation, and whether it perpetuates the State's for-merly de jure dual system. The District Court found that, throughout the period of de jure segregation, University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and University ofSouthern Mississippi were the \u00afagship institutions in thestate system. They received the most funds, initiated themost advanced and specialized programs, and developed thewidest range of curricular functions. At their inception,each was restricted for the education solely of white persons.Id.,at 1526\u00b11528. The missions of Mississippi University for Women and Delta State University, by contrast, were more505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 740 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court limited than their other all-white counterparts during the period of legalized segregation. Mississippi University forWomen and Delta State University were each established toprovide undergraduate education solely for white studentsin the liberal arts and such other \u00aeelds as music, art, educa-tion, and home economics. Id., at 1527\u00b11528. When they were founded, the three exclusively black universities weremore limited in their assigned academic missions than the\u00aeve all-white institutions. Alcorn State, for example, wasdesignated to serve as \u00aaan agricultural college for the educa-tion of Mississippi's black youth.\u00ba Id., at 1527. Jackson State and Mississippi Valley State were established to trainblack teachers. Id., at 1528. Though the District Court's \u00aendings do not make this point explicit, it is reasonable toinfer that state funding and curriculum decisions throughoutthe period of de jure segregation were based on the purposes for which these institutions were established. In 1981, the State assigned certain missions to Mississip- pi's public universities as they then existed. It classi\u00aeedUniversity of Mississippi, Mississippi State, and SouthernMississippi as \u00aacomprehensive\u00ba universities having the mostvaried programs and offering graduate degrees. Two of thehistorically white institutions, Delta State University andMississippi University for Women, along with two of the his-torically black institutions, Alcorn State University and Mis-sissippi Valley State University, were designated as \u00aare-gional\u00ba universities with more limited programs and devotedprimarily to undergraduate education. Jackson State Uni-versity was classi\u00aeed as an \u00aaurban\u00ba university whose missionwas de\u00aened by its urban location. The institutional mission designations adopted in 1981 have as their antecedents the policies enacted to perpetuateracial separation during the de jure segregated regime. The Court of Appeals expressly disagreed with the DistrictCourt by recognizing that the \u00aainequalities among the insti-tutions largely follow the mission designations, and the mis-505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 741 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of the Court sion designations to some degree follow the historical racial assignments.\u00ba 914 F. 2d, at 692. It nevertheless upheldthis facet of the system as constitutionally acceptable basedon the existence of good-faith racially neutral policies andprocedures. That different missions are assigned to the uni-versities surely limits to some extent an entering student'schoice as to which university to seek admittance. While thecourts below both agreed that the classi\u00aecation and missionassignments were made without discriminatory purpose, theCourt of Appeals found that the record \u00aasupports the plain-tiffs' argument that the mission designations had the effect of maintaining the more limited program scope at the histori-cally black universities.\u00ba Id., at 690. We do not suggest that absent discriminatory purpose the assignment of differ-ent missions to various institutions in a State's higher educa-tion system would raise an equal protection issue where oneor more of the institutions become or remain predominantlyblack or white. But here the issue is whether the State hassuf\u00aeciently dismantled its prior dual system; and when com-bined with the differential admission practices and unneces-sary program duplication, it is likely that the mission desig-nations interfere with student choice and tend to perpetuatethe segregated system. On remand, the court should in-quire whether it would be practicable and consistent withsound educational practices to eliminate any such discrim-inatory effects of the State's present policy of missionassignments. Fourth, the State attempted to bring itself into compliance with the Constitution by continuing to maintain and operateall eight higher educational institutions. The existence ofeight instead of some lesser number was undoubtedly occa-sioned by state laws forbidding the mingling of the races.And as the District Court recognized, continuing to maintainall eight universities in Mississippi is wasteful and irrational.The District Court pointed especially to the facts that DeltaState and Mississippi Valley State are only 35 miles apart505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 742 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of the Court and that only 20 miles separate Mississippi State and Missis- sippi University for Women. 674 F. Supp., at 1563\u00b11564. Itwas evident to the District Court that \u00aathe defendants un-dertake to fund more institutions of higher learning than arejusti\u00aeed by the amount of \u00aenancial resources available to thestate,\u00ba id.,at 1564, but the court concluded that such \u00aescal irresponsibility was a policy choice of the legislature ratherthan a feature of a system subject to constitutional scrutiny. Unquestionably, a larger rather than a smaller number of institutions from which to choose in itself makes for differentchoices, particularly when examined in the light of otherfactors present in the operation of the system, such asadmissions, program duplication, and institutional missiondesignations. Though certainly closure of one or moreinstitutions would decrease the discriminatory effects of thepresent system, see, e. g., United States v.Louisiana, 718 F. Supp. 499, 514 (ED La. 1989), based on the present record we are unable to say whether such action is constitutionallyrequired. 11Elimination of program duplication and revision of admissions criteria may make institutional closure unnec-essary. However, on remand this issue should be carefullyexplored by inquiring and determining whether retention ofall eight institutions itself affects student choice and perpet-uates the segregated higher education system, whethermaintenance of each of the universities is educationally justi-\u00aeable, and whether one or more of them can be practicablyclosed or merged with other existing institutions. Because the former de jure segregated system of public universities in Mississippi impeded the free choice of pro- 11It should be noted that in correspondence with the board of trustees in 1973, an HEW of\u00aecial expressed the \u00aaoverall objective\u00ba of the Plan tobe \u00aathat a student's choice of institution or campus, henceforth, will be based on other than racial criteria.\u00ba App. 205. The letter added thatclosure of a formerly de jure black institution \u00aawould create a presumption that a greater burden is being placed upon the black students and facultyin Mississippi.\u00ba Id.,at 206.505US3113N 06-12-96 717 (1992) O\u0092Connor, J., concurring spective students, the State in dismantling that system must take the necessary steps to ensure that this choice now istruly free. The full range of policies and practices must beexamined with this duty in mind. That an institution is pre-dominantly white or black does not in itself make out a con-stitutional violation. But surely the State may not leave inplace policies rooted in its prior of\u00aecially segregated systemthat serve to maintain the racial identi\u00aeability of its universi-ties if those policies can practicably be eliminated withouteroding sound educational policies. If we understand private petitioners to press us to order the upgrading of Jackson State, Alcorn State, and MississippiValley State solely so that they may be publicly \u00aenanced, exclusively black enclaves by private choice, we reject that request. The State provides these facilities for allits citi- zens and it has not met its burden under Brown to take af- \u00aermative steps to dismantle its prior de jure system when it perpetuates a separate, but \u00aamore equal\u00ba one. Whethersuch an increase in funding is necessary to achieve a fulldismantlement under the standards we have outlined, how-ever, is a different question, and one that must be addressedon remand. Because the District Court and the Court of Appeals failed to consider the State's duties in their proper light, the casesmust be remanded. To the extent that the State has notmet its af\u00aermative obligation to dismantle its prior dual sys-tem, it shall be adjudged in violation of the Constitution andTitle VI and remedial proceedings shall be conducted. Thedecision of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the casesare remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion. It is so ordered. Justice O\u0092Connor , concurring. I join the opinion of the Court, which requires public uni- versities, like public elementary and secondary schools, to505US3113N 06-12-96 OPINPGT 744 UNITED STATES concurring af\u00aermatively dismantle their prior de jure segregation in order to create an environment free of racial discriminationand to make aggrieved individuals whole. See Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 299 (1955); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 746 (1974). I write separately to em- phasize that it is Mississippi's burden to prove that it hasundone its prior segregation, and that the circumstances inwhich a State may maintain a policy or practice traceable tode jure segregation that has segregative effects are narrow. In light of the State's long history of discrimination, and thelost educational and career opportunities and stigmaticharms caused by discriminatory educational systems, seeBrown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, Regents for Higher Ed., 339 U. S. 637, 640\u00b1641 (1950), the courts below must carefully examine Mis-sissippi's proffered justi\u00aecations for maintaining a remnantofde jure segregation to ensure that such rationales do not merely mask the perpetuation of discriminatory practices.Where the State can accomplish legitimate educational ob-jectives through less segregative means, the courts mayinfer lack of good faith; \u00aaat the least it places a heavy burdenupon the [State] to explain its preference for an apparentlyless effective method.\u00ba Green v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430, 439 (1968). In my view, it also follows from the State's obligation to prove that it has \u00aatake[n] allsteps\u00ba to eliminate policies and practices traceable to de jure segregation, Freeman v.Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 485 (1992), that if the State shows that maintenance of certain remnants ofits prior system is essential to accomplish its legitimategoals, then it still must prove that it has counteracted andminimized the segregative impact of such policies to the ex-tent possible. Only by eliminating a remnant that unneces-sarily continues to foster segregation or by negating insofaras possible its segregative impact can the State satisfy its505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 745 Cite as: 505 U.

We must repudiate this unbearable assumption of the right to killinstitutions unless they conform to one narrow standard.\u00baDu Bois, Schools, 13 The Crisis 111, 112 (1917). I agree with the Court that a State does not satisfy its obligation to dismantle a dual system of higher educationmerely by adopting race-neutral policies for the future ad-ministration of that system. Today, we hold that \u00aa[i]f poli-cies traceable to the de jure system are still in force and have discriminatory effects, those policies too must be reformed tothe extent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices.\u00ba Ante, at 729. I agree that this statement de- \u00aenes the appropriate standard to apply in the higher educa-tion context. I write separately to emphasize that thisstandard is far different from the one adopted to govern thegrade-school context in Green v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968), and its progeny. In particular, because it does not compel the elimination of all observedracial imbalance, it portends neither the destruction of his-torically black colleges nor the severing of those institutionsfrom their distinctive histories and traditions. InGreen, we held that the adoption of a freedom-of-choice plan does not satisfy the obligations of a formerly de jure grade-school system should the plan fail to decrease, if noteliminate, the racial imbalance within that system. See id., at 441. Although racial imbalance does not itself establisha violation of the Constitution, our decisions following Green indulged the presumption, often irrebuttable in practice, thata presently observed imbalance has been proximately causedby intentional state action during the prior de jure era. See, e. g., Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.Brinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 537 (1979); Keyes v.School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U. 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 746 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Thomas, J., concurring 211 (1973). As a result, we have repeatedly authorized the district courts to reassign students, despite the operation offacially neutral assignment policies, in order to eliminate ordecrease observed racial imbalances. See, e. g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 22\u00b131 (1971); Green, supra, at 442, n. 6. Whatever the merit of this approach in the grade-school context, it is quite plainly not the approach that we adopttoday to govern the higher education context. We explicitlyreject the use of remedies as \u00aaradical\u00ba as student reassign-ment\u00d0 i. e., \u00aaremedies akin to those upheld in Green. \u00ba Ante, at 730, n. 4; see also ante, at 728\u00b1729. Of necessity, then, we focus on the speci\u00aec policies alleged to produce ra- cial imbalance, rather than on the imbalance itself. Thus, a plaintiff cannot obtain relief merely by identifying a persist-ent racial imbalance, because the district court cannot pro-vide a reassignment remedy designed to eliminate that im-balance directly. Plaintiffs are likely to be able to identify,as these plaintiffs have identi\u00aeed, speci\u00aec policies traceableto the de jure era that continue to produce a current racial imbalance. As a practical matter, then, the district courtsadministering our standard will spend their time determin-ing whether such policies have been adequately justi\u00aeed\u00d0 a far narrower, more manageable task than that imposedunder Green. A challenged policy does not survive under the standard we announce today if it began during the prior de jure era, produces adverse impacts, and persists without sound educa-tional justi\u00aecation. When each of these elements has beenmet, I believe, we are justi\u00aeed in not requiring proof of apresent speci\u00aec intent to discriminate. It is safe to assumethat a policy adopted during the de jure era, if it produces segregative effects, re\u00afects a discriminatory intent. Aslong as that intent remains, of course, such a policy cannotcontinue. And given an initially tainted policy, it is emi-nently reasonable to make the State bear the risk of nonper-suasion with respect to intent at some future time, both be-505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 747 Cite as: 505 U.

In particular, we do not foreclose the possibility that there exists \u00aasound educational justi\u00aecation\u00ba for maintaining his-torically black colleges as such. Despite the shameful his- tory of state-enforced segregation, these institutions havesurvived and \u00afourished. Indeed, they have expanded as op-portunities for blacks to enter historically white institutionshave expanded. Between 1954 and 1980, for example, en-rollment at historically black colleges increased from 70,000to 200,000 students, while degrees awarded increased from13,000 to 32,000. See S. Hill, National Center for EducationStatistics, The Traditionally Black Institutions of Higher Ed-ucation 1860 to 1982, pp. xiv\u00b1xv (1985). These accomplish-ments have not gone unnoticed: \u00aaThe colleges founded for Negroes are both a source of pride to blacks who have attended them and a source ofhope to black families who want the bene\u00aets of higherlearning for their children. They have exercised lead-ership in developing educational opportunities for youngblacks at all levels of instruction, and, especially in theSouth, they are still regarded as key institutions for en-hancing the general quality of the lives of black Ameri-cans.\u00ba Carnegie Commission on Higher Education,From Isolation to Mainstream: Problems of the CollegesFounded for Negroes 11 (1971).

Obviously, aState cannot maintain such traditions by closing particularinstitutions, historically white or historically black, to partic-ular racial groups. Nonetheless, it hardly follows that a505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 749 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. State cannot operate a diverse assortment of institutions\u00d0 including historically black institutions\u00d0open to all on arace-neutral basis, but with established traditions and pro-grams that might disproportionately appeal to one race oranother. No one, I imagine, would argue that such institu-tional diversity is without \u00aasound educational justi\u00aecation,\u00ba or that it is even remotely akin to program duplication, which is designed to separate the races for the sake of sepa-rating the races. The Court at least hints at the importanceof this value when it distinguishes Green in part on the ground that colleges and universities \u00aaare not fungible.\u00baAnte, at 729. Although I agree that a State is not constitu- tionally required to maintain its historically black institu- tions as such, see ante, at 743, I do not understand our opinion to hold that a State is forbidden to do so. It would be ironic, to say the least, if the institutions that sustainedblacks during segregation were themselves destroyed in aneffort to combat its vestiges. Justice Scalia , concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. With some of what the Court says today, I agree. I agree, of course, that the Constitution compels Mississippi to re-move all discriminatory barriers to its state-funded universi-ties. Brown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (Brown I). I agree that the Constitution does not compel Mississippi to remedy funding disparities between its histori-cally black institutions (HBI's) and historically white institu-tions (HWI's). And I agree that Mississippi's American Col-lege Testing Program (ACT) requirements need furtherreview. I reject, however, the effectively unsustainableburden the Court imposes on Mississippi, and all States thatformerly operated segregated universities, to demonstratecompliance with Brown I. That requirement, which resem- bles what we prescribed for primary and secondary schoolsinGreen v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 750 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of Scalia, J. (1968), has no proper application in the context of higher edu- cation, provides no genuine guidance to States and lowercourts, and is as likely to subvert as to promote the inter-ests of those citizens on whose behalf the present suit wasbrought. I Before evaluating the Court's handiwork, it is no small task simply to comprehend it. The Court sets forth not one,but seemingly two different tests for ascertaining compli-ance with Brown I \u00d0though in the last analysis they come to the same. The Court initially announces the following test,in Part III of its opinion: All policies (i) \u00aatraceable to [theState's] prior effects\u00d0whether by in\u00afuencing student enroll-ment decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets ofthe university system\u00d0\u00ba must be eliminated (iii) to the ex- tent \u00aapracticabl[e]\u00ba and (iv) consistent with \u00aasound educa-tional\u00ba practices. Ante, at 731. When the Court comes to applying its test, however, in Part IV of the opinion, \u00aain\u00afu-encing student enrollment decisions\u00ba is not merely one exam-ple of a \u00aasegregative effec[t],\u00ba but is elevated to an independ-ent and essential requirement of its own. The policies thatmust be eliminated are those that (i) are legacies of the dualsystem, (ii) \u00aacontribute to the racial identi\u00aeability\u00ba of theState's universities (the same as (i) and (ii) in Part III), and,in addition, (iii) do so in a way that \u00aasubstantially restrict[s] a person's choice of which institution to enter.\u00ba Ante, at 733 (emphasis added). See also ante, at 734\u00b1735, 738\u00b1739, 741\u00b1743. What the Court means by \u00aasubstantially restrict[ing] a person's choice of which institution to enter\u00ba is not clear.During the course of the discussion in Part IV the require-ment changes from one of strong coercion (\u00aasubstantially re-strict,\u00ba ante, at 733, \u00aainterfere,\u00ba ante, at 741), to one of mid- dling pressure (\u00aarestrict,\u00ba ante, at 734, \u00aalimi[t],\u00ba ante, at 741), to one of slight inducement (\u00aainherent[ly] self-selec[t],\u00ba ante, at 735, n. 9, \u00aaaffect,\u00ba ante, at If Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. meaning, in this last stage of decrepitude the requirement is so frail that almost anything will overcome it. Even anopen-admissions policy would fall short of ensuring that stu-dent choice is un affected by state action. The Court's re- sults also suggest that the \u00aarestricting choice\u00ba requirementis toothless. Nothing else would explain how it could be metby Mississippi's mission designations, program duplication,and operation of all eight formerly de jure colleges. Only a test aimed at state action that \u00aaaffects\u00ba student choice couldimplicate policies such as these, which in no way restrict the decision where to attend college. (Indeed, program dupli-cation and continuation of the eight schools have quite theopposite effect; they multiply, rather than restrict, limit, or impede the available choices.) At the end of the day, then,the Court dilutes this potentially useful concept to the pointof such insigni\u00aecance that it adds nothing to the Court's testexcept confusion. It will be a fertile source of litigation. Almost as inscrutable in its operation as the \u00aarestricting choice\u00ba requirement is the requirement that challenged statepractices perpetuate de facto segregation. That is \u00aalikely\u00ba met, the Court says, by Mississippi's mission designations.Ante, at 741. Yet surely it is apparent that by designating three colleges of the same prior disposition (HWI's) as the only comprehensive schools, Mississippi encouraged integra- tion; and that the suggested alternative of elevating an HBIto comprehensive status (so that blacks could go there in-stead of to the HWI's) would have been an invitation to con-tinuing segregation. See Ayers v.Allain, all col-lege students attending four-year colleges in the state attendone of the comprehensive universities\u00ba). It appears, more-over, that even if a particular practice does not, in isolation,rise to the minimal level of fostering segregation, it can beaggregated with other ones, and the composite condemned. See ante, at 739\u00b1740 (\u00aaby treating [the] issue [of program duplication] in isolation, the [district] court failed to considerthe combined effects of unnecessary program duplication505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 752 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of Scalia, J. with other policies, such as differential admissions stand- ards\u00ba); ante, at 741 (\u00aa[W]hen combined with the differential admission practices and unnecessary program duplication, itis likely that the mission designations . . . tend to perpetuatethe segregated system\u00ba). It is interesting to speculate howuniversity administrators are going to guess which practicesa district judge will choose to aggregate; or how districtjudges are going to guess when disaggregation is lawful. The Court appears to suggest that a practice that has been aggregated and condemned may be disaggregated and ap-proved so long as it does not itself \u00aaperpetuat[e] the segre- gated higher education system,\u00ba ante, at 742\u00d0which seems, of course, to negate the whole purpose of aggregating in the\u00aerst place. The Court says: \u00aaElimination of program duplication and revision of admissions make institutional closureunnecessary. . . . [O]n remand this issue should be care-fully explored by inquiring and determining whether re-tention of all eight institutions itself . . . perpetuates thesegregated higher education system, whether mainte-nance of each of the universities is educationally justi\u00ae-able, and whether one or more of them can be practica-bly closed or merged with other existing institutions.\u00baIbid. Perhaps the Court means, however, that even if retention of all eight institutions is found by itself not to \u00aaperpetuat[e] the segregated higher education system,\u00ba it must still be found that such retention is \u00aaeducationally justi\u00aeable,\u00ba orthat none of the institutions can be \u00aapracticably closed or merged.\u00ba It is unclear. Besides the ambiguities inherent in the \u00aarestricting choice\u00ba requirement and the requirement that the challengedstate practice or practices perpetuate segregation, I am notsanguine that there will be comprehensible content to theto-be-de\u00aened-later (and, make no mistake about it, outcome-505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 753 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. determinative) notions of \u00aasound educational justi\u00aecation\u00ba and \u00aaimpracticable elimination.\u00ba In short, except for the re-sults that it produces in the present litigation (which arewhat they are because the Court says so), I have not theslightest idea how to apply the Court's analysis\u00d0and I doubtwhether anyone else will. Whether one consults the Court's description of what it purports to be doing, in Part III, ante, at 727\u00b1732, or what the Court actually does, in Part IV , ante, at 732\u00b1743, one must conclude that the Court is essentially applying touniversities the amorphous standard adopted for primary and secondary schools in Green v.School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430 (1968). Like that case, today's deci- sion places upon the State the ordinarily unsustainable bur-den of proving the negative proposition that itis not respon- sible for extant racial disparity in enrollment. See ante, at 728. Green requires school boards to prove that racially identi\u00aeable schools are not the consequence of past or present discriminatory state action, Swann v.Charlotte- Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 26 (1971); today's opin- ion requires state university administrators to prove thatracially identi\u00aeable schools are not the consequence of any practice or practices (in such impromptu \u00aaaggregation\u00ba asmight strike the fancy of a district judge) held over from theprior de jure regime. This will imperil virtually any prac- tice or program plaintiffs decide to challenge\u00d0just as Green has\u00d0so long as racial imbalance remains. And just as underGreen, so also under today's decision, the only practicable way of disproving that \u00aaexisting racial identi\u00aeability is at-tributable to the State,\u00ba ante, at 728, is to eliminate extant segregation, i. e., to assure racial prop ortionality in the schools. Failing that, the State's only defense will be to es- tablish an excuse for each challenged practice\u00d0either im-practicability of elimination, which is also a theoretical ex-cuse under the Green regime, see Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools v.Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 249\u00b1250 (1991),505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 754 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of Scalia, J. or sound educational value, which (presumably) is not much different from the \u00aaimportant and legitimate ends\u00ba excuseavailable under Green, seeDayton Bd. of Ed. v.Brinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 538 (1979). II Application of the standard (or standards) announced today has no justi\u00aecation in precedent, and in fact runs con- trary to a case decided six years ago, see Bazemore v.Fri- day, 478 U. S. 385 (1986). The Court relies primarily upon citations of Green and other primary and secondary school cases. But those decisions left open the question whetherGreen merits application in the distinct context of higher ed- ucation. Beyond that, the Court relies on Brown I, Florida ex rel. Hawkins v.Board of Control of Fla., 350 U. S. 413 (1956) (per curiam), and Gilmore v.City of Montgomery, 417 U. S. 556 (1974). That reliance also is mistaken. The constitutional evil of the \u00aaseparate but equal\u00ba regime that we confronted in Brown I was that blacks were told to go to one set of schools, whites to another. See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896). What made this \u00aaeven- handed\u00ba racial partitioning offensive to equal protection wasits implicit stigmatization of minority students: \u00aaTo separate[black students] from others of similar age and quali\u00aecationssolely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiorityas to their status in the community that may affect theirhearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.\u00baBrown I, 347 U. S., at 494. In the context of higher educa- tion, a context in which students decide whether to attendschool and if so where, the only unconstitutional derivationsof that bygone system are those that limit access on discrimi-natory bases; for only they have the potential to generatethe harm Brown I condemned, and only they have the poten- tial to deny students equal access to the best public educa-tion a State has to offer. Legacies of the dual system thatpermit (or even incidentally facilitate) free choice of racially505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 755 Cite as: 505 U. S. 717 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. identi\u00aeable schools\u00d0while still assuring each individual stu- dent the right to attend whatever school he wishes\u00d0do not have these consequences. Our decisions immediately following Brown I also fail to sustain the Court's approach. They, too, suggest that for-mer de jure States have one duty: to eliminate discrimina- tory obstacles to admission. Brown v.Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (1955) (Brown II), requires States \u00aato achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on anonracial basis,\u00ba id.,at 300\u00b1301, as do other cases of that era, see, e. g., Cooper v.Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 7 (1958); Goss v.Board of Ed. of Knoxville, 373 U. S. 683, 687 (1963). Nor do Hawkins orGilmore support what the Court has done. Hawkins involved a segregated graduate school, to be sure. But our one-paragraph per curiam opinion sup- ports nothing more than what I have said: The duty todismantle means the duty to establish nondiscriminatory ad-missions criteria. See 350 U. S., at 414 (\u00aaHe is entitled toprompt admission under the rules and regulations applicableto other quali\u00aeed candidates\u00ba). Establishment of neutraladmissions standards, not the eradication of all \u00aapoliciestraceable to the de jure system . . . hav[ing] discriminatory effects,\u00ba ante, at 729, is what Hawkins is about. Finally, Gilmore, quite simply, is inapposite. All that we did there was uphold an order enjoining a city from granting exclusiveaccess to its parks and recreational facilities to segregatedprivate schools and to groups af\u00aeliated with such schools.417 U. S., at 569. Notably, in the one case that does bearproximately on today's decision, Bazemore, supra, we de- clined to at 408 (White, J. , concurring) (\u00aaOur cases requiring parks and the like to be desegregated lend no support for requiring morethan what has been done in this case\u00ba). If we are looking to precedent to guide us in the context of higher education, we need not go back 38 years to Brown I,read between the lines of Hawkins, or conjure authority505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:20 PAGES OPINPGT 756 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of Scalia, J. (Gilmore) that does not exist. In Bazemore v.Friday, supra, we addressed a dispute parallel in all relevant re- spects to this one. At issue there was state \u00aenancing of 4\u00b1Hand Homemaker youth clubs by the North Carolina Agricul-tural Extension Service, a division of North Carolina StateUniversity. In the Plessy era, club af\u00aeliations had been dic- tated by race; after 1964, they were governed by neutralcriteria. Yet \u00aathere were a great many all-white and all-black clubs\u00ba at the time suit was \u00aeled. 478 U. S., at 407.We nonetheless declined to adopt Green' s requirement that [be taken] to segregated- institutions. 478 U. S.,at 408. We con\u00aened Green to primary and secondary public schools, where \u00aaschoolchildren must go to school\u00ba and where\u00aaschool boards customarily have the power to create schoolattendance areas and otherwise designate the school thatparticular students may attend.\u00ba 478 U. S, at 408. \u00aa[T]hiscase,\u00ba we said, \u00aapresents no current violation of the Four-teenth Amendment since the Service has discontinued itsprior discriminatory practices and has adopted a whollyneutral admissions policy. The mere continued existenceof single-race clubs does not make out a constitutional vio-lation.\u00ba Ibid. The Court asserts that we reached the result we did in Bazemore \u00aaonly after satisfying ourselves that the State had not fostered segregation by playing a part in the decision ofwhich club an individual chose to join,\u00ba ante, at 731\u00d0imply- ing that we assured ourselves there, as the Court insists wemust do here, that none of the State's practices carried overfrom de jure days incidentally played a part in the decision of which club an individual chose to join. We did no suchthing. An accurate description of Bazemore was set forth inRichmond v.J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989): \u00aamere existence of single-race club s... cannot create a duty to integrate,\u00ba we said Bazemore held, \u00aain absence of evidence of exclusion by race, \u00ba 488 U.

S., at 407\u00d0which does not mean theState \u00aaplay[ed] [no] part in the decision of which club an indi-vidual chose to join,\u00ba however much the Court may mush theconcepts together today. It is, on the face of things, entirelyunbelievable that the previously established characteristicsof the various all-white and all-black 4\u00b1H Clubs (where eachof them met, for example) did not even play a part in young people's decisions of which club to join. Bazemore' s standard for dismantling a dual system ought to control here: discontinuation of discriminatory practicesand adoption of a neutral admissions policy. To use Green nomenclature, modern racial imbalance remains a \u00aavestige\u00baof past segregative practices in Mississippi's universities, inthat the previously mandated racial identi\u00aecation continuesto affect where students choose to enroll\u00d0just as it surelyaffected which clubs students chose to join in Bazemore. We tolerated this vestigial effect in Bazemore, squarely re- jecting the view that the State was obliged to correct \u00aatheracial segregation resulting from [its prior] practice[s].\u00ba 478U. S., at 417 (Brennan, J., dissenting in part). And we de-clined to require the State, as the Court has today, to provethat no holdover practices of the de jure system, e. g., pro- gram offerings in the different clubs, played a role in thestudents' decisions of which clubs to join. If that analysiswas correct six years ago in Bazemore, and I think it was, it must govern here as well. Like the club attendance inBazemore (and unlike the school attendance in Green ), at- tending college is voluntary, not a legal obligation, and whichinstitution particular students attend is determined by theirown choice, not by \u00aaschool boards [who] customarily have thepower to create school attendance areas and otherwise desig-nate the school that particular students may attend.\u00ba Baze-505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:21 PAGES OPINPGT 758 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of Scalia, J. more, supra, at 408. Indeed, Bazemore was a more appeal- ing case than these for adhering to the Green approach, since the 4\u00b1H Clubs served students similar in age to those inGreen, and had been \u00aaorganized in the public schools\u00ba until the early 1960's. 478 U. S., at 417. It is my view that the requirement of compelled integra- tion (whether by student assignment, as in Green itself, or by elimination of nonintegrated options, as the Court todayeffectively decrees) does not apply to higher education.Only one aspect of a historically segregated university sys-tem need be eliminated: discriminatory admissions stand- ards. The burden is upon the formerly de jure system to show that that has been achieved. Once that has been done,however, it is not just unprecedented, but illogical as well, toestablish that former de jure States continue to deny equal protection of the law to students whose choices among publicuniversity offerings are unimpeded by discriminatory barri-ers. Unless one takes the position that Brown I required States not only to provide equal access to their universitiesbut also to correct lingering disparities between them, thatis, to remedy institutional noncompliance with the \u00aaequal\u00barequirement of Plessy, a State is in compliance with Brown Ionce it establishes that it has dismantled all discriminatory barriers to its public universities. Having done that, a Stateis free to govern its public institutions of higher learning asit will, unless it is convicted of discriminating anew\u00d0whichrequires both discriminatory intent and discriminatory cau-sation. See Washington v.Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976). That analysis brings me to agree with the judgment that the Court of Appeals must be reversed in part\u00d0for the rea-son (quite different from the Court's) that Mississippi has notborne the burden of demonstrating that intentionally dis-criminatory admissions standards have been eliminated. Ithas been established that Mississippi originally adopted ACTassessments as an admissions criterion because that was aneffective means of excluding blacks from the HWI's. See505US3113N 06-12-96 PAGES OPINPGT 759 Cite as: 505 717 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. Ayers v.Allain, 674 F. Supp., at 1555; Ayers v.Allain, 914 F. 690 (CA5 1990) (en banc). Given that \u00aending, theDistrict Court should have required Mississippi to prove thatits continued use of ACT requirements does not have a ra-cially exclusionary purpose and effect\u00d0a not insubstantialtask, see Freeman v.Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 503 ( Scalia, J., concurring). III I must add a few words about the unanticipated conse- quences of today's decision. Among petitioners' contentionsis the claim that the Constitution requires Mississippi to cor-rect funding disparities between its HBI's and HWI's. TheCourt rejects that, see ante, at 743\u00d0as I think it should, since it is students and not colleges that are guaranteedequal protection of the laws. See Sweatt v.Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 635 (1950); Missouri ex rel. Gaines v.Canada, 305 U. S. 337, 351 (1938). But to say that the Constitution doesnotrequire equal funding is not to say that the Constitution prohibits it. The citizens of a State may conclude that if certain of their public educational institutions are used pre-dominantly by whites and others predominantly by blacks, itis desirable to fund those institutions more or less equally. Ironically enough, however, today's decision seems to pre- vent adoption of such a conscious policy. What the Courtsays about duplicate programs is as true of equal funding:The requirement \u00aawas part and parcel of the prior dual sys-tem.\u00ba Ante, at 738. Moreover, equal funding, like program duplication, facilitates continued segregation\u00d0enabling stu-dents to attend schools where their own race predominateswithout paying a penalty in the quality of education. Norcould such an equal-funding policy be saved on the basis thatit serves what the Court calls a \u00aasound educational justi\u00aeca-tion.\u00ba The only conceivable educational value it furthers is that of fostering schools in which blacks receive their educa-tion in a \u00aamajority\u00ba setting; but to acknowledge that as would contradict the compulsory-integration philoso-505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:21 PAGES OPINPGT 760 UNITED STATES v.FORDICE Opinion of Scalia, J. phy that underlies Green. Just as vulnerable, of course, would be all other programs that have the effect of facilitat-ing the continued existence of predominantly black institu-tions: elevating an HBI to comprehensive status (but seeante, at 740\u00b1741, where the Court inexplicably suggests that this action may be required); offering a so-called Afrocentriccurriculum, as has been done recently on an experimentalbasis in some secondary and primary schools, see Jarvis,Brown and the Afrocentric Curriculum, 101 Yale L. J. 1285, 1287, and n. 12 (1992); preserving eight separate universities,see ante, at 741\u00b1742, which is perhaps Mississippi's single policy most segregative in effect; or providing funding forHBI's as HBI's, see 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1060\u00b11063c, which doesjust that. But this predictable impairment of HBI's should come as no surprise: for incidentally facilitating\u00d0indeed, even toler-ating\u00d0the continued existence of HBI's is not what theCourt's test is about, and has never been what Green is about. See Green, 391 U. S., at 442 (\u00aaThe Board must be required to formulate a new plan an d... fashion steps which promise realistically to convert promptly to a system withouta `white' school and a `Negro' school\u00ba) (footnote omitted).What the Court's test is designed to achieve is the elimina-tion of predominantly black institutions. While that may begood social policy, the present petitioners, I suspect, wouldnot agree; and there is much to be said for the Court of Ap-peals' perception in Ayers, 914 F. 2d, at 687, that \u00aaif no [state] authority exists to deny [the student] the right to attend theinstitution of his choice, he is done a severe disservice byremedies which, in seeking to maximize integration, mini-mize diversity and vitiate his choices.\u00ba But whether or notthe Court's antagonism to unintegrated schooling is good pol-icy, it is assuredly not good constitutional law. There isnothing unconstitutional about a \u00aablack\u00ba school in the sense,not of a school that blacks must attend and that whites can- not, but of a school that, as a consequence of private choice505US3113N 06-12-96 19:43:21 PAGES OPINPGT 761 Cite as: 505 U.

In a perverse way, in fact, the insistence, whether explicit or implicit, that suchinstitutions not be permitted to endure perpetuates the verystigma of black inferiority that Brown I sought to destroy. Not only Mississippi, but Congress itself, seems out of stepwith the drum that the Court beats today, judging by itspassage of an Act entitled \u00aaStrengthening Historically BlackColleges and Universities,\u00ba which authorizes the EducationDepartment to provide money grants to historically blackcolleges. 20 U.

That question required us to choose between the standardsestablished in Green and Bazemore, both of which involved (as, for the most part, this does) free-choice plans that failedto end de facto segregation. Once the confusion engendered by the Court's something-for-all, guidance-to-none opinionhas been dissipated, compare ante, concurring), with ante, at 747\u00b1749 ( Thomas ,J., concurring), it will become apparent that, essentially, the Court hasadopted Green.

What I do predict is a number ofyears of litigation-driven confusion and destab ilization in the university systems of all the formerly de jure States, that will bene\u00aet neither blacks nor whites, neither predominantlyblack institutions nor predominantly white ones. Nothinggood will come of this judicially ordained turmoil, except thepublic recognition that any court that would knowingly im-pose it must hate segregation.

Argued April 21, 1992\u00d0Decided June 26, 1992 Respondent, the operator of a chain of Mexican restaurants, sued peti- tioner, a similar chain, for trade dress infringement under \u00a7 43(a) of theTrademark Act of 1946 \u00aa[a]ny personwho . . . use[s] in connection with any goods or service s...a n yf a l s e description or representation . . . shall be liable to . . .damaged by [such] use.\u00ba The District Court instructed the jury, inter alia, that respondent's trade dress was protected if it either was inher- ently distinctive\u00d0 i. e., was not merely descriptive\u00d0or had acquired a secondary meaning\u00d0 i. e., had come through use to be uniquely associ- ated with a speci\u00aec source. The court entered judgment for respondentafter the jury found, among other things, that respondent's trade dressis inherently distinctive but has not acquired a secondary meaning. Inaf\u00aerming, the Court of Appeals ruled that the instructions adequatelystated the applicable law, held that the evidence supported the jury's\u00aendings, and rejected petitioner's argument that a \u00aending of no second-ary meaning contradicted a \u00aending of inherent distinctiveness. Held: Trade that is inherently distinctive is protectable under \u00a7 43(a) without a showing that it has acquired secondary meaning, since suchtrade dress itself is capable of identifying products or services as comingfrom a speci\u00aec source. This is the rule generally applicable to trade-marks, see, e. g., Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 13, pp. 37\u00b138, and the protection of trademarks and of trade dress under\u00a7 43(a) serves the same statutory purpose of preventing deception andunfair competition. There is no textual basis for applying different anal-ysis to the two. Section 43(a) mentions neither and does not contain theconcept of secondary meaning, and that concept, where it does appear in the Lanham Act, is a requirement that applies only to merely descrip- tive marks and not to inherently distinctive ones. Engrafting a second-ary meaning requirement onto \u00a7 43(a) also would make more dif\u00aecult theidenti\u00aecation of a producer with its product and thereby undermine theLanham Act's purposes of securing to a mark's owner the good will of his business and protecting consumers' ability to distinguish among com-peting producers.

I Respondent Taco Cabana, Inc., operates a chain of fast- food restaurants in Texas. The restaurants serve Mexicanfood. The \u00aerst Taco Cabana restaurant was opened in SanAntonio in September 1978, and \u00aeve more restaurants hadbeen opened in San Antonio by 1985. Taco Cabana de-scribes its Mexican trade dress as \u00aaa festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paint-ings and murals. The patio includes interior and exte-rior areas with the interior patio capable of being sealedoff from the outside patio by overhead garage doors.The stepped exterior of the building is a festive andvivid color scheme using top border paint and neonstripes. Bright awnings and umbrellas continue thetheme.\u00ba 932 F. 2d 1113, 1117 (CA5 1991). In December 1985, a Two Pesos, Inc., restaurant was opened in Houston. Two Pesos adopted a motif very similarto the foregoing description of Taco Cabana's trade dress.Two Pesos restaurants expanded rapidly in Houston andother markets, but did not enter San Antonio. In 1986, TacoCabana entered the Houston and Austin markets and ex-panded into other Texas cities, including Dallas and El Pasowhere Two Pesos was also doing business. In 1987, Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas for tradedress infringement under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15U. S. C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1982 ed.), theft of trade secrets 2Section 43(a) provides: \u00aaAny person who shall af\u00aex, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or contain-ers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description orrepresentation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to de-505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 766 TWO PESOS, INC. v.TACO CABANA, INC. Opinion of the Court under Texas common law. The case was tried to a jury, which was instructed to return its verdict in the form ofanswers to \u00aeve questions propounded by the trial judge.The jury's answers were: Taco Cabana has a trade dress;taken as a whole, the trade dress is nonfunctional; the tradedress is inherently distinctive; 3the trade dress has not ac- quired a secondary meaning4in the Texas market; and the alleged infringement creates a likelihood of confusion on thepart of ordinary customers as to the source or association ofthe restaurant's goods or services. Because, as the jury wastold, Taco Cabana's trade dress was protected if it either wasinherently distinctive or had acquired a secondary meaning,judgment was entered awarding damages to Taco Cabana.In the course of calculating damages, the trial court held thatTwo Pesos had intentionally and deliberately infringed TacoCabana's trade dress. 5 scribe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and any person who shall with knowledge of thefalsity of such designation of origin or description or representation causeor procure the same to be transported or used in commerce or deliver thesame to any carrier to be transported or used, shall be liable to a civilaction by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as thatof origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any personwho believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any suchfalse description or representation.\u00ba 60 Stat. 441. This provision has been superseded by \u00a7 132 of the Trademark Law Re- vision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3946, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1121. 3The instructions were that, to be found inherently distinctive, the trade dress must not be descriptive. 4Secondary meaning is used generally to indicate that a mark or dress \u00aahas come through use to be uniquely associated with a speci\u00aec source.\u00baRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 13, Comment e(Tent.

S. 763 (1992) Opinion of the Court The Court of Appeals ruled that the instructions ade- quately stated the applicable law and that the evidencesupported the jury's \u00aendings. In particular, the Court ofAppeals rejected petitioner's argument that a \u00aending ofno secondary meaning contradicted a \u00aending of inherentdistinctiveness. In so holding, the court below followed precedent in the Fifth Circuit. In Chevron Chemical Co. v.Voluntary Pur- chasing Groups, Inc., 659 F. 2d 695, 702 (CA5 1981), the court noted that trademark law requires a demonstration of sec-ondary meaning only when the claimed trademark is not suf-\u00aeciently distinctive of itself to identify the producer; thecourt held that the same principles should apply to protec-tion of trade dresses. The Court of Appeals noted that thisapproach con\u00aficts with decisions of other courts, particularlythe holding of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit inVibrant Sales, Inc. v.New Body B outique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.

We did not grant certiorari on the second question presentedby the petition, which challenged the Court of Appeals' acceptance of thejury's \u00aending that Taco Cabana's trade dress was not functional. 7The Lanham Act, including the provisions at issue here, has been sub- stantially amended since the present suit was brought.

S. 844, 858 (1982), but it is common ground that \u00a7 43(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks and thatthe general principles qualifying a mark for registrationunder \u00a7 2 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicablein determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled toprotection under \u00a7 43(a). See A. J. Can\u00aeeld Co. v.Honick- 808 F. 2d 291, 299, n. 9 (CA3 1986); Thompson Medical Co.v.P\u00aezer Inc., 753 F. 2d 208, 215\u00b1216 (CA2 1985). A trademark is de\u00aened in 15 U. S.

Marks are oftenclassi\u00aeed in categories of generally increasing distinctive-ness; following the classic formulation set out by JudgeFriendly, they may be (1) generic; (2) descriptive; (3) sugges-tive; (4) arbitrary; or (5) fanciful. See Abercrombie & Fitch Co.v.Hunting World, Inc., 537 F. 2d 4, 9 (CA2 1976). The Court of Appeals followed this classi\u00aecation and petitioneraccepts it. Brief for Petitioner 11\u00b115. The latter three cat-egories of marks, because their intrinsic nature serves toidentify a particular source of a product, are deemed inher-ently distinctive and are entitled to protection.

S. 763 (1992) Opinion of the Court Marks which are merely descriptive of a product are not inherently distinctive. When used to describe a product,they do not inherently identify a particular source, and hencecannot be protected. However, descriptive marks may ac-quire the distinctiveness which will allow them to be pro-tected under the Act. Section 2 of the Lanham Act providesthat a descriptive mark that otherwise could not be regis-tered under the Act may be registered if it \u00aahas become dis-tinctive of the applicant's goods (f),15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1052(e), (f). See Park 'N Fly, supra, at 194, 196. This acquired distinctiveness is generally called \u00aasec-ondary meaning.\u00ba See ibid.; Inwood Laboratories, supra, at 851, n. 11; Kellogg Co. v.National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S. 111, 118 (1938). The concept of secondary meaning has beenapplied to actions under \u00a7 43(a). See, e. g., University of Georgia Athletic Assn. v.Laite, 756 F. 2d 1535 (CA11 1985); Thompson Medical Co. v.P\u00aezer Inc., supra. The general rule regarding distinctiveness is clear: An identifying mark is distinctive and capable of being protectedif it either (1) is inherently distinctive or(2) has acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning. Restatement(Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 13, pp. 37\u00b138, and Commenta(Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990). Cf. Park 'N Fly, supra, at 194. It is also clear that eligibility for protection under\u00a7 43(a) depends on nonfunctionality. See, e. g., Inwood at 863 ( White, J. , concurring in result); see also, e. g., Brunswick Corp. v.Spinit Reel Co., 832 F. 2d 513, 517 (CA10 1987); First Brands Corp. 1381 (CA9 Clime 2d 971, 974 (CA2 1987); Ambrit, Inc. 1535 (CA11 1986); American F. 2d 1136, 1141 (CA3 1986). It is, of course, also undisputed that liabil-ity under \u00a7 43(a) requires proof of the likelihood of confusion.See, e. g., Brunswick Corp., supra, at 516\u00b1517; INC. Opinion of the Court supra, 1535; Brands, supra, at 1381; at 974; American Greetings, supra, at 1141. The Court of Appeals determined that the District Court's instructions were consistent with the foregoing principlesand that the evidence supported the jury's verdict. Bothcourts thus ruled that Taco Cabana's trade dress was notdescriptive but rather inherently distinctive, and that it wasnot functional. None of these rulings is before us in thiscase, and for present purposes we assume, without deciding,that each of them is correct. In going on to af\u00aerm the judg-ment for respondent, the Court of Appeals, following itsprior decision in Chevron, held that Taco Cabana's inherently distinctive trade dress was entitled to protection despite thelack of proof of secondary meaning. It is this issue that isbefore us for decision, and we agree with its resolution bythe Court of Appeals. There is no persuasive reason toapply to trade dress a general requirement of secondarymeaning which is at odds with the principles generally appli-cable to infringement suits under \u00a7 43(a). Petitioner devotesmuch of its brie\u00aeng to arguing issues that are not before us,and we address only its arguments relevant to whether proofof secondary meaning is essential to qualify an inherentlydistinctive trade dress for protection under \u00a7 43(a). Petitioner argues that the jury's \u00aending that the trade dress has not acquired a secondary meaning shows conclu-sively that the trade dress is not inherently distinctive.Brief for Petitioner 9. The Court of Appeals' disposition was sound: \u00aaTwo Pesos' argument\u00d0that the jury \u00aending of inherent distinctiveness contradicts its \u00aending of no secondarymeaning in the Texas market\u00d0ignores the law in thiscircuit. While the necessarily imperfect (and often pro-hibitively dif\u00aecult) methods for assessing secondarymeaning address the empirical question of current con-sumer association, the legal recognition of an inherentlydistinctive trademark or trade dress acknowledges the505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 771 Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992) Opinion of the Court owner's legitimate proprietary interest in its unique and valuable informational device, regardless of whethersubstantial consumer association yet bestows the addi- tional empirical protection of secondary meaning.\u00ba 932F. 2d, at 1120, n. 7. Although petitioner makes the above argument, it appears to concede elsewhere in its brief that it is possible for a tradedress, even a restaurant trade dress, to be inherently distinc-tive and thus eligible for protection under \u00a7 43(a). Brief forPetitioner 10\u00b111, 17\u00b118; Reply Brief for Petitioner that a general requirement of secondary mean-ing imposes \u00aaan unfair prospect of theft [or] \u00aenancial loss\u00ba onthe developer of fanciful or arbitrary trade dress at the out-set of its use, petitioner suggests that such trade dressshould receive limited protection without proof of secondarymeaning. Id.,at 10. Petitioner argues that such protection should be only temporary and subject to defeasance whenover time the dress has failed to acquire a secondary mean-ing. This approach is also vulnerable for the reasons givenby the Court of Appeals. If temporary protection is avail-able from the earliest use of the trade dress, it must bebecause it is neither functional nor descriptive, but an inher-ently distinctive dress that is capable of identifying a partic-ular source of the product. Such a trade dress, or mark, isnot subject to copying by concerns that have an equal oppor-tunity to choose their own inherently distinctive trade dress.To terminate protection for failure to gain secondary mean-ing over some unspeci\u00aeed time could not be based on thefailure of the dress to retain its fanciful, arbitrary, or sugges-tive nature, but on the failure of the user of the dress to besuccessful enough in the marketplace. This is not a validbasis to \u00aend a dress or mark ineligible for protection. Theuser of such a trade dress should be able to maintain whatcompetitive position it has and continue to seek wider identi-\u00aecation among potential customers.505US3114D INC. v.TACO CABANA, INC. Opinion of the Court This brings us to the line of decisions by the Court of Ap- peals for the Second Circuit that would \u00aend protection fortrade dress unavailable absent proof of secondary meaning,a position that petitioner concedes would have to be modi\u00aeedif the temporary protection that it suggests is to be recog-nized. Brief for Petitioner 10\u00b114. In Vibrant Sales, Inc. v. New Body B outique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299 (1981), the plaintiff claimed protection under \u00a7 43(a) for a product whose featuresthe defendant had allegedly copied. The Court of Appealsheld that unregistered marks did not enjoy the \u00aapresumptivesource association\u00ba enjoyed by registered marks and hence could not qualify for protection under \u00a7 43(a) without proof ofsecondary meaning. Id.,at 303, 304. The court's rationale seemingly denied protection for unregistered, but inherentlydistinctive, marks of all kinds, whether the claimed markused distinctive words or symbols or distinctive product de-sign. The court thus did not accept the arguments that anunregistered mark was capable of identifying a source andthat copying such a mark could be making any kind of a falsestatement or representation under \u00a7 43(a). This holding is in considerable tension with the provisions of the Lanham Act. If a verbal or symbolic mark or thefeatures of a product design may be registered under \u00a7 2, itnecessarily is a mark \u00aaby which the goods of the applicantmay be distinguished from the goods of others,\u00ba 60 Stat. 428,and must be registered unless otherwise disquali\u00aeed. Since\u00a7 2 requires secondary meaning only as a condition to regis-tering descriptive marks, there are plainly marks that areregistrable without showing secondary meaning. Thesesame marks, even if not registered, remain inherently capa-ble of distinguishing the goods of the users of these marks.Furthermore, the copier of such a mark may be seen asfalsely claiming that his products may for some reason bethought of as originating from the plaintiff. Some years after Vibrant, the Second Circuit announced inThompson Medical Co. v.P\u00aezer Inc., 753 F. 773 Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992) Opinion of the Court that in deciding whether an unregistered mark is eligible for protection under \u00a7 43(a), it would follow the classi\u00aecation ofmarks set out by Judge Friendly in Abercrombie & Fitch, 537 F. 2d, at 9. Hence, if an unregistered mark is deemedmerely descriptive, which the verbal mark before the courtproved to be, proof of secondary meaning is required; how-ever, \u00aa[s]uggestive marks are eligible for protection withoutany proof of secondary meaning, since the connection be-tween the mark and the source is presumed.\u00ba 753 F. 2d, at216. The Second Circuit has nevertheless continued to denyprotection for trade dress under \u00a7 43(a) absent proof of sec- ondary meaning, despite the fact that \u00a7 43(a) provides nobasis for distinguishing between trademark and trade dress.See, e. g., Stormy Clime Ltd. v.ProGroup, Inc., 809 F. 2d, at 974; Union Mfg. Co. v.Han Baek Trading F. 42, 48 (1985); r p . , 754 F. 2d 71, 75 (1985). The Fifth Circuit was quite right in Chevron, and in this case, to follow the Abercrombie classi\u00aecations consistently and to inquire whether trade dress for which protection isclaimed under \u00a7 43(a) is inherently distinctive. If it is, it iscapable of identifying products or services as coming from aspeci\u00aec source and secondary meaning is not required. Thisis the rule generally applicable to trademarks, and the pro-tection of trademarks and trade dress under \u00a7 43(a) servesthe same statutory purpose of preventing deception and un-fair competition. There is no persuasive reason to apply dif-ferent analysis to the two. The \u00aaproposition that secondarymeaning must be shown even if the trade dress is a distinc-tive, identifying mark, [is] wrong, for the reasons explainedby Judge Rubin for the Fifth Circuit in Chevron. \u00baBlau Plumbing, Inc. v.S. O. S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F. 2d 604, 608 (CA7 1986). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit alsofollows Chevron, Ambrit, Inc. v.Kraft, Inc., 805 F. 2d 974, 979 (1986), and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitappears to think that proof of secondary meaning is super-505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:24 PAGES OPINPGT 774 TWO PESOS, INC. v.TACO CABANA, INC. Opinion of the Court \u00afuous if a trade dress is inherently distinctive, Fuddruckers, Inc. v.Doc's B. R. Others, Inc., 826 F. 2d 837, 843 (1987). It would be a different matter if there were textual basis in \u00a7 43(a) for treating inherently distinctive verbal or sym-bolic trademarks differently from inherently distinctivetrade dress. But there is none. The section does not men-tion trademarks or trade dress, whether they be called ge-neric, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, fanciful, or func-tional. Nor does the concept of secondary meaning appearin the text of \u00a7 43(a). Where secondary meaning doesappear in the statute, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1052 (1982 ed.), it is arequirement that applies only to merely descriptive marksand not to inherently distinctive ones. We see no basis forrequiring secondary meaning for inherently distinctive tradedress protection under \u00a7 43(a) but not for other distinctivewords, symbols, or devices capable of identifying a produc-er's product. Engrafting onto \u00a7 43(a) a requirement of secondary mean- ing for inherently distinctive trade dress also would under-mine the purposes of the Lanham Act. Protection of tradedress, no less than of trademarks, serves the Act's purposeto \u00aasecure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his busi-ness and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguishamong competing producers. National protection of trade-marks is desirable, Congress concluded, because trademarksfoster competition and the maintenance of quality by secur-ing to the producer the bene\u00aets of good reputation.\u00ba Park 'N Fly, 469 U. S., at 198, citing S. Rep. No. 1333, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3\u00b15 (1946) (citations omitted). By making moredif\u00aecult the identi\u00aecation of a producer with its product, asecondary meaning requirement for a nondescriptive tradedress would hinder improving or maintaining the producer'scompetitive position. Suggestions that under the Fifth Circuit's law, the initial user of any shape or design would cut off competition from505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT 775 Cite as: 505 U. S. 763 (1992) Opinion of the Court products of like design and shape are not persuasive. Only nonfunctional, distinctive trade dress is protected under\u00a7 43(a). The Fifth Circuit holds that a design is legally func-tional, and thus unprotectible, if it is one of a limited numberof equally ef\u00aecient options available to competitors and freecompetition would be unduly hindered by according the de-sign trademark protection. See Sicilia Di R. Biebow & Co. v.Cox, 732 F. 2d 417, 426 (1984). This serves to assure that competition will not be sti\u00afed by the exhaustion of a limitednumber of trade dresses. On the other hand, adding a secondary meaning require- ment could have anticompetitive effects, creating particularburdens on the startup of small companies. It would pre-sent special dif\u00aeculties for a business, such as respondent,that seeks to start a new product in a limited area and thenexpand into new markets. Denying protection for inher-ently distinctive nonfunctional trade dress until after second-ary meaning has been established would allow a competitor,which has not adopted a distinctive trade dress of its own,to appropriate the originator's dress in other markets and todeter the originator from expanding into and competing inthese areas. As noted above, petitioner concedes that protecting an in- herently distinctive trade dress from its inception may becritical to new entrants to the market and that withholdingprotection until secondary meaning has been establishedwould be contrary to the goals of the Lanham Act. Peti-tioner speci\u00aecally suggests, however, that the solution is todispense with the requirement of secondary meaning for areasonable, but brief, period at the outset of the use of atrade dress. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11\u00b112. If \u00a7 43(a)does not require secondary meaning at the outset of a busi-ness' adoption of trade dress, there is no basis in the statuteto support the suggestion that such a requirement comes intobeing after some unspeci\u00aeed time.505US3114D CABANA, INC. Stevens, J., concurring in judgment III We agree with the Court of Appeals that proof of second- ary meaning is not required to prevail on a claim under\u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act where the trade dress at issue isinherently distinctive, and accordingly the judgment of thatcourt is af\u00aermed. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia , concurring. I write separately to note my complete agreement with Justice Thomas 's explanation as to how the language of \u00a7 43(a) and its common-law derivation are broad enough toembrace inherently distinctive trade dress. Nevertheless,because I \u00aend that analysis to be complementary to (andnot inconsistent with) the Court's opinion, I concur in thelatter. Justice Stevens , concurring in the judgment. As the Court notes in its opinion, the text of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1982 ed.), \u00aadoes not men-tion trademarks or trade dress.\u00ba Ante, at 774. Neverthe- less, the Court interprets this section as having created afederal cause of action for infringement of an unregisteredtrademark or trade dress and concludes that such a mark ordress should receive essentially the same protection as thosethat are registered. Although I agree with the Court's con-clusion, I think it is important to recognize that the meaningof the text has been transformed by the federal courts overthe past few decades. I agree with this transformation,even though it marks a departure from the original text, be-cause it is consistent with the purposes of the statute andhas recently been endorsed by Congress.505US3114D 07-09-96 12:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT 777 Cite as: 505 U.

Section 43(a)2provides a federal remedy for using either \u00aaa false designation of origin\u00ba or a \u00aafalse description or representa-tion\u00ba in connection with any goods or services. The full textof the section makes it clear that the word \u00aaorigin\u00ba refers tothe geographic location in which the goods originated, andin fact, the phrase \u00aafalse designation of origin\u00ba was under-stood to be limited to false advertising of geographic origin.For example, the \u00aafalse designation of origin\u00ba language con- 1The text that we consider today is \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act prior to the 1988 amendments; it provides: \u00aaAny person who shall af\u00aex, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or containers for goods, a falsedesignation of origin, or any false description or representation, includingwords or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same,and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, and anyperson who shall with knowledge of the falsity of such designation of ori-gin or description or representation cause or procure the same to be trans-ported or used in commerce or deliver the same to any carrier to be trans-ported or used, shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing businessin the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in whichsaid locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or islikely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or represen-tation.\u00ba 15 U.

Section 3 was destined foroblivion largely because it referred only to false designation of origin, waslimited to articles of merchandise, thus excluding services, and required ashowing that the use of the false designation of origin occurred \u00aa willfully and with intent to deceive.\u00ba Ibid.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment tained in the statute makes it unlawful to represent that Cal- ifornia oranges came from Florida, or vice versa.3 For a number of years after the 1946 enactment of the Lanham Act, a \u00aafalse description or representation,\u00ba like \u00aaafalse designation of origin,\u00ba was construed narrowly. Thephrase encompassed two kinds of wrongs: false advertis-ing 4and the common-law tort of \u00aapassing off.\u00ba5False ad- vertising meant representing that goods or services pos-sessed characteristics that they did not actually have andpassing off meant representing one's goods as those of an-other. Neither \u00aasecondary meaning\u00ba nor \u00aainherent distinc-tiveness\u00ba had anything to do with false advertising, but proofof secondary meaning was an element of the common-law 3This is clear from the fact that the cause of action created by this section is available only to a person doing business in the locality falselyindicated as that of origin. See n. 1, supra. 4The deleterious effects of false advertising were described by one com- mentator as follows: \u00aa[A] campaign of false advertising may completelydiscredit the product of an industry, destroy the con\u00aedence of consumersand impair a communal or trade good will. Less tangible but neverthe- less real is the injury suffered by the honest dealer who \u00aends it necessaryto meet the price competition of inferior goods, glamorously misdescribedby the unscrupulous merchant. The competition of a liar is always dan-gerous even though the exact injury may not be susceptible of preciseproof.\u00ba Handler, Unfair Competition, 21 Iowa L. Rev. 175, 193 (1936). 5The common-law tort of passing off has been described as follows: \u00aaBeginning in about 1803, English and American common law slowly developed an offshoot of the tort of fraud and deceit and called it `passingoff' or `palming off.' Simply stated, passing off as a tort consists of onepassing off his goods as the goods of another. In 1842 Lord Langdalewrote: \u00aa `I think that the principle on which both the courts of law and equity proceed is very well understood. A man is not to sell his own goods underthe pretence that they are the goods of another man .... ' \u00aaIn 19th century cases, trademark infringement embodied much of the elements of fraud and deceit from which trademark protection developed.That is, the element of fraudulent intent was emphasized over the objec-tive facts of consumer confusion.\u00ba 1 J.

See, e. g., Crescent Tool Co. v.Kilborn & Bishop Co., 247 F. 299 (1917). To my knowledge, however, the Second Circuit has not explained why \u00aainherent distinctive-ness\u00ba is not an appropriate substitute for proof of secondary meaning in atrade dress case. Most of the cases in which the Second Circuit has saidthat secondary meaning is required did not involve \u00aendings of inherentdistinctiveness. For example, in Vibrant Sales, Inc. v.New Body Bou- tique, Inc., 652 F. 2d 299 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.

One way of accomplishing thesedual goals was by creating uniform legal rights and remediesthat were appropriate for a national economy. Although theprotection of trademarks had once been \u00aaentirely a Statematter,\u00ba the result of such a piecemeal approach was thatthere were almost \u00aaas many different varieties of commonlaw as there are States\u00ba so that a person's right to a trade-mark \u00aain one State may differ widely from the rights which[that person] enjoys in another.\u00ba H. R. Rep. No. 944, 76thCong., 1st Sess., 4 (1939). The House Committee on Trade-marks and Patents, recognizing that \u00aatrade is no longer local,b u t... national,\u00ba saw the need for \u00aanational legislation along national lines [to] secur[e] to the owners of trademarks ininterstate commerce de\u00aenite rights.\u00ba Ibid. 16 15The Senate Report elaborated on these two goals: \u00aaThe purpose underlying any trade-mark statute is twofold. One is to protect the public so it may be con\u00aedent that, in purchasing a productbearing a particular trade-mark which it favorably knows, it will get the product which it asks for and wants to get. Secondly, where the ownerof a trade-mark has spent energy, time, and money in presenting to thepublic the product, he is protected in his investment from its misappropria-tion by pirates and cheats. This is the well-established rule of law pro-tecting both the public and the trade-mark owner.\u00ba S. Rep. No. 1333,79th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1946). By protecting trademarks, Congress hoped \u00aato protect the public from deceit, to foster fair competition, and to secure to the business communitythe advantages of reputation and good will by pre venting their diversion from those who have created them to those who have not. This is theend to which this bill is directed.\u00ba Id.,at 4. 16Forty years later, the USTA Trademark Review Commission assessed the state of trademark law. The conclusion that it reached serves as atestimonial to the success of the Act in achieving its goal of uniformity:\u00aaThe federal courts now decide, under federal law, all but a few trademarkdisputes.

Recently, for example, in the Trade-mark Law Revision Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 3935, Congresscodi\u00aeed the judicial interpretation of \u00a7 43(a), giving its im- primatur to a growing body of case law from the Circuits that had expanded the section beyond its original language. Although Congress has not speci\u00aecally addressed the question whether secondary meaning is required under\u00a7 43(a), the steps it has taken in this subsequent legislationsuggest that secondary meaning is not required if inherent distinctiveness has been established. 17First, Congress broadened the language of \u00a7 43(a) to make explicit that theprovision prohibits \u00aaany word, term, name, symbol, or de-vice, or any combination thereof\u00ba that is \u00aalikely to cause con-fusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the af\u00aeliation,connection, or association of such person with another per-son, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his orher goods, services, or commercial activities by another per-son.\u00ba 15 U. S. C. \u00a7 1125(a). That language makes clear thata confusingly similar trade dress is actionable under \u00a7 43(a),without necessary reference to \u00aafalsity.\u00ba Second, Congressapproved and con\u00aermed the extensive judicial developmentunder the provision, including its application to trade dressthat the federal courts had come to apply. 18Third, the legis- 17\u00aaWhen several acts of Congress are passed touching the same subject- matter, subsequent legislation may be considered to assist in the interpre-tation of prior legislation upon the same subject.\u00ba Tiger v.Western In- vestment Co. , 221 U.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment lative history of the 1988 amendments reaf\u00aerms Congress' goals of protecting both businesses and consumers with theLanham Act. 19And fourth, Congress explicitly extended to any violation of \u00a7 43(a) the basic Lanham Act remedial provi-sions whose text previously covered only registered trade-marks. 20The aim of the amendments was to apply the same protections to unregistered marks as were already affordedto registered marks. See S. Rep. No. 100\u00b1515, p. 40 (1988).These steps buttress the conclusion that \u00a7 43(a) is properlyunderstood to provide protection in accordance with thestandards for registration in \u00a7 2. These aspects of the 1988legislation bolster the claim that an inherently distinctivetrade dress may be protected under \u00a7 43(a) without proof ofsecondary meaning. IV In light of the consensus among the Courts of Appeals that have actually addressed the question, and the stepson the part of Congress to codify that consensus, stare decisis concerns persuade me to join the Court's conclusion that secondary meaning is not required to establish a tradedress violation under \u00a7 43(a) once inherent distinctiveness tition law, the committee expects the courts to continue to interpret the section. \u00aaAs written, Section 43(a) appears to deal only with false descriptions or representations and false designations of geographic origin. Since itsenactment in 1946, however, it has been widely interpreted as creating, inessence, a federal law of unfair competition. For example, it has beenapplied to cases involving the infringement of unregistered marks, viola-tions of trade dress and certain nonfunctional con\u00aegurations of goods andactionable false advertising claims.\u00ba S. Rep. No. 100\u00b1515, p. 40 (1988). 19\u00aaTrademark protection is important to both consumers and producers. Trademark law protects the public by making consumers con\u00aedent thatthey can identify brands they prefer and can purchase those brands with-out being confused or misled. Trademark laws also protec[t] trademarkowners. When the owner of a trademark has spent conside[r]able timeand money bringing a product to the marketplace, trademark law protectsthe producer from pirates and counterfeiters.\u00ba Id.,a OPINPGT 785 U. S. 763 (1992) Thomas, J., concurring in judgment has been established. Accordingly, I concur in the judg- ment, but not in the opinion, of the Court. Justice Thomas , concurring in the judgment. Both the Court and Justice Stevens decide today that the principles that qualify a mark for registration under \u00a7 2 of the Lanham Act apply as well to determining whether anunregistered mark is entitled to protection under \u00a7 43(a).The Court terms that view \u00aacommon ground,\u00ba though it failsto explain why that might be so, and Justice Stevens de- cides that the view among the Courts of Appeals is textuallyinsupportable, but worthy nonetheless of adherence. Seeante, at 768 (opinion of the Ste- vens, J. , concurring in judgment). I see no need in answer- ing the question presented either to move back and forthamong the different sections of the Lanham Act or to adoptwhat may or may not be a misconstruction of the statute forreasons akin to stare decisis. I would rely, instead, on the language of \u00a7 43(a). Section 43(a) made actionable (before being amended) \u00aaany false description or representation, including words or othersymbols tending falsely to describe or represent,\u00ba when\u00aause[d] in connection with any goods or services.\u00ba 15U. S. C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1982 ed.). This language codi\u00aeed, amongother things, the related common-law torts of technicaltrademark infringement and passing off, see Inwood Labora- tories, Inc. v.Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 861, n. 2 (1982) ( White, J. , concurring in result); Chevron Chemical F. 2d 695, 701 (CA5 1981), cert. denied, 457 U. S. 1126 (1982), which werecauses of action for false descriptions or representations con-cerning a good's or service's source of production, see, e. g., Yale Electric Corp. v.Robertson, 26 F. 2d 972, 973 (CA2 1928); American Washboard INC. Thomas, J., concurring in judgment At common law, words or symbols that were arbitrary, fan- ciful, or suggestive (called \u00aainherently distinctive\u00ba words orsymbols, or \u00aatrademarks\u00ba) were presumed to represent thesource of a product, and the \u00aerst user of a trademark couldsue to protect it without having to show that the word orsymbol represented the product's source in fact. See, e. g., Heublein v.Adams, 125 F. 782, 784 (CC Mass. 1903). That presumption did not attach to personal or geographic namesor to words or symbols that only described a product (called\u00aatrade names\u00ba), and the user of a personal or geographicname or of a descriptive word or symbol could obtain relief only if he \u00aerst showed that his trade name did in fact repre-sent not just the product, but a producer (that the good orservice had developed \u00aasecondary meaning\u00ba). See, e. g., Florence Mfg. Co. v.J. C. Dowd & Co., 178 F. 73, 74\u00b175 (CA2 1910). Trade dress, which consists not of words or symbols,but of a product's packaging (or \u00aaimage,\u00ba more broadly),seems at common law to have been thought incapable everof being inherently distinctive, perhaps on the theory thatthe number of ways to package a product is \u00aenite. Thus, auser of trade dress would always have had to show secondarymeaning in order to obtain protection. See, e. g., Crescent Tool Co. v.Kilborn & Bishop Co., 247 F. 299, 300\u00b1301 (CA2 1917); Flagg Mfg. Co. v.Holway, 178 Mass. 83, 91, 59 N. E. 667 (1901); Philadelphia Novelty Mfg. Co. v.Rouss, 40 F. 585, 587 (CC SDNY 1889); see also J. Hopkins, Law of Trade-marks, and Unfair Competition \u00a7 54, pp. 140\u00b1141(3d ofUnfair Competition \u00a7 16, Comment b(Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990) (hereinafter Third Restatement). Over time, judges have come to conclude that packages or images may be as arbitrary, fanciful, or suggestive as wordsor symbols, their numbers limited only by the human imagi-nation. See, e. g., AmBrit, Inc. v.Kraft, Inc., 812 S. 763 (1992) Thomas, J., concurring in judgment ture, polar bear and sunburst images\u00ba of the package of the \u00aaKlondike\u00ba ice cream bar held inherently distinctive), cert.denied, 481 U. S. 1041 (1987); see also Third Restatement\u00a7\u00a7 13, 16. A particular trade dress, then, is now consideredas fully capable as a particular trademark of serving as a\u00aarepresentation or designation\u00ba of source under \u00a7 43(a). Asa result, the \u00aerst user of an arbitrary package, like the \u00aerstuser of an arbitrary word, should be entitled to the presump-tion that his package represents him without having to showthat it does so in fact. This rule follows, in my view, fromthe language of \u00a7 43(a), and this rule applies under that sec-tion without regard to the rules that apply under the sec-tions of the Lanham Act that deal with registration. Because the Court reaches the same conclusion for differ- ent reasons, I join its judgment.505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT 788 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus FRANKLIN, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE, et al. v.

For only the second time since 1900, theCensus Bureau (Bureau) allocated the Department of Defense's overseasemployees to particular States for reapportionment purposes in the 1990census, using an allocation method that it determined most closely re-sembled \u00aausual residence,\u00ba its standard measure of state af\u00aeliation. Ap-pellees Massachusetts and two of its registered voters \u00aeled an actionagainst, inter alios, the President and the Secretary of Commerce, alleg- ing, among other things, that the decision to allocate federal overseasemployees is inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)and the Constitution. In particular, they alleged that the allocation ofoverseas military personnel resulted in the shift of a Representativefrom Massachusetts to Washington State. The District Court, inter alia, held that the Secretary's decision to allocate such employees to the States was arbitrary and capricious under APA standards, directed theSecretary to eliminate them from the apportionment count, and directedthe President to recalculate the number of Representatives and submitthe new calculation to Congress. Held: The judgment is reversed. 785 F. Supp. 230, reversed. Justice O\u0092Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV , concluding that: 1.

S. 788 (1992) Syllabus to a particular number of Representatives and has a direct effect on the reapportionment is the President's statement to Congress. He isnot required to transmit the Secretary's report directly to Congress.Rather, he uses the data from the \u00aadecennial census\u00ba in making hisstatement, and, even after he receives the Secretary's report, he is notprohibited from instructing the Secretary to reform the census. Thestatutory structure here differs from those statutes under which anagency action automatically triggers a course of action regardless of anydiscretionary action taken by the President. Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, distinguished. Contrary to ap- pellees' argument, the President's action here is not ceremonial or minis-terial. Apportionment is not foreordained by the time the Secretarygives the President the report, and the fact that the \u00aenal action is thePresident's is important to the integrity of the process. Pp. 796\u00b1800. (b) The President's actions are not reviewable under the APA. He is not speci\u00aecally included in the APA's purview, and respect for theseparation of powers and the President's unique constitutional posi-tion makes textual silence insuf\u00aecient to subject him to its provisions.Pp. 800\u00b1801. 2. The Secretary's allocation of overseas federal employees to their home States is consistent with the constitutional language and goal ofequal representation. It is compatible with the standard of \u00aausual resi-dence,\u00ba which was the gloss given the constitutional phrase \u00aain eachState\u00ba by the \u00aerst enumeration Act and which has been used by theBureau ever since to allocate persons to their home States. The phrasemay mean more than mere physical presence, and has been used to in-clude some element of allegiance or enduring tie to a place. The \u00aerstenumeration Act also used \u00aausual place of abode,\u00ba \u00aausual resident,\u00ba and\u00aainhabitant\u00ba to describe the required tie. And \u00aaInhabitant,\u00ba in the re-lated context of congressional residence quali\u00aecations, Art. I, \u00a7 2, hasbeen interpreted to include persons occasionally absent for a consider-able time on public or private business. \u00aaUsual residence\u00ba has contin-ued to hold broad connotations up to the present day. The Secretary'sjudgment does not hamper the underlying constitutional goal of equalrepresentation, but, assuming that overseas employees have retainedties to their home States, actually promotes equality.

Because the Bureau found that military personnel were likely to designate a \u00aahome ofrecord\u00ba with low or no income taxes instead of their truehome State\u00d0even though home of record does not determine state taxation\u00d0the Bureau did not allocate overseas employ-ees to particular States in the 1980 census. App. 180. Initially, the Bureau took the position that overseas federal employees would not be included in the 1990 stateenumerations either. There were, however, stirrings inCongress in favor of including overseas federal employees,especially overseas military, in the state population counts.Several bills requiring the Secretary to include overseas mil-itary were introduced but not passed in the 100th and 101stCongresses. See H. R. 3814, 100th Sess. (1989); S. 290, 101stCong., 1st Sess. (1989). In July 1989, nine months beforethe census taking was to begin, then-Secretary of CommerceRobert Mosbacher agreed to allocate overseas federal em-ployees to their home States for purposes of congressionalapportionment. App. 182. His decision memorandum citesboth the growing congressional support for including over-seas employees and the Department of Defense's belief that\u00aaits employees should not be excluded from apportionmentcounts because of temporary and involuntary residence over-seas.\u00ba Id., at 120. Another factor explaining the Secre-505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT 794 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of the Court tary's shift was that the Department of Defense, the largest federal overseas employer, planned to poll its employees todetermine, among other things, which State they consideredtheir permanent home. Id., at 184. In December 1989, however, the Defense Department canceled its plans to con-duct the survey due to a lack of funds. Ibid. As an alter- native, the Defense Department suggested that it could pro-vide data on its employees' last six months of residence inthe United States, information that would be more completeand up-to-date than the home of record data already in thepersonnel \u00aeles. This possibility also failed to materialize when the Defense Department informed the Census Bureauthat it was not able to assemble the information after all.Ibid. In the meantime, two more bills were introduced in Con- gress, but not passed, which would have required the CensusBureau to apportion members of the overseas military totheir home States using the \u00aahome of record\u00ba data alreadyin their personnel \u00aeles. (1990). In July1990, six months before the census count was due to be re-ported to the President, the Census Bureau decided to allo-cate the Department of Defense's overseas employees to theStates based on their \u00aahome of record.\u00ba App. 185.

Legal residence was thought less accurate becausethe choice of legal residence may have been affected by statetaxation. Indeed, the Congressional Research Servicefound that in 1990 \u00aathe nine States with either no incometaxes, or those which tax only interest and dividend income,have approximately 9 percent more of the overseas militarypersonnel claiming the States for tax purposes, than thosesame States receive using home of record. \u00ba Congressional505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT 795 Cite as: 505 U.

For similar rea- sons, last duty station was rejected because it would provideonly a work address, and the employee's last home addressmight have been in a different State, as with those, for ex-ample, who worked in the District of Columbia but lived inVirginia or Maryland. 3 Record 925.

Of those, only 30 actually submitted counts, and only 20 agencies included dependents in their enumeration. Fourof the agencies could not provide a home State for all of theiroverseas employees.

The District Court nonethe-less held that, on the administrative record before it, the Sec-retary's decision to allocate the employees and to use home505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT 796 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of the Court of record data was arbitrary and capricious under the stand- ards of the APA. Id.,at 264\u00b1266. II Appellees raise claims under both the APA and the Consti- tution. We address \u00aerst the statutory basis for our jurisdic-tion under the APA. See Blum v.Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137 (1982); Burton v.United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295 (1905). The APA sets forth the procedures by which federal agen- cies are accountable to the public and their actions subjectto review by the courts. The Secretary's report to the Pres-ident is an unusual candidate for \u00aaagency action\u00ba within themeaning of the APA, because it is not promulgated to thepublic in the Federal Register, no of\u00aecial administrative rec-ord is generated, and its effect on reapportionment is feltonly after the President makes the necessary calculationsand reports the result to the Congress. Contrast 2 U. S. C.\u00a7 441a(e) (requiring Secretary to publish each year in theFederal Register an estimate of the voting age population).Only after the President reports to Congress do the Stateshave an entitlement to a particular number of Represen-tatives. See \u00a7 2a(b) (\u00aaEach State shall be entitle d...t o the number of Representatives shown in the [President's]statement\u00ba). The APA provides for judicial review of \u00aa\u00aenal agency ac- tion for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u00ba5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. At issue in this case is whether the \u00aa\u00aenal\u00baaction that appellees have challenged is that of an \u00aaagency\u00basuch that the federal courts may exercise their powers ofreview under the APA. We hold that the \u00aenal action com-plained of is that of the President, and the President is not anagency within the meaning of the Act. Accordingly, thereis no \u00aenal agency action that may be reviewed under theAPA standards. To determine when an agency action is \u00aenal, we have looked to, among other things, whether its impact \u00aais suf\u00ae-505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT 797 Cite as: 505 U.

An agency action is not \u00aenal if it isonly \u00aathe ruling of a subordinate of\u00aecial,\u00ba or \u00aatentative.\u00baId., at 151. The core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process, and whether the re-sult of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.In this case, the action that creates an entitlement to a par-ticular number of Representatives and has a direct effect onthe reapportionment is the President's statement to Con-gress, not the Secretary's report to the President. Unlike other statutes that expressly require the President to transmit an agency's report directly to Congress, \u00a7 2a doesnot. Compare, e. g., 20 U. S. C. \u00a7 1017(d) (\u00aaThe President shall transmit each such report [of the National AdvisoryCouncil on Continuing Education] to the Congress with hiscomments and recommendations\u00ba); 30 U. S.

After receiving theSecretary's report, the President is to \u00aatransmit to the Con-gress a statement showing the whole number of persons ineach 2a(a). Section 2a does notexpressly require the President to use the data in the Secre-tary's report, but, rather, the data from the \u00aadecennial cen-sus.\u00ba There is no statute forbidding amendment of the \u00aade-cennial census\u00ba itself after the Secretary submits the reportto the President. For potential litigants, therefore, the \u00aade-cennial census\u00ba still presents a moving target, even after theSecretary reports to the President. In this case, the De-partment of Commerce, in its press release issued the daythe Secretary submitted the report to the President, wasexplicit that the data presented to the President was stillsubject to correction. See United States Department ofCommerce News, Bureau of Census, 1990 Census Populationfor the United is OPINPGT 798 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of the Court Shift 19 Seats in the U. S. House of Representatives 2 (Dec. 26, 1990) (\u00aaThe population counts set forth herein are subjectto possible correction for undercount and overcount. TheUnited States Department of Commerce is consideringwhether to correct these counts and will publish correctedcounts, if any, not later than July 15, 1991\u00ba). 1Moreover, there is no statute that rules out an instruction by the Presi-dent to the Secretary to reform the census, even after thedata are submitted to him. It is not until the President sub-mits the information to Congress that the target stops mov-ing, because only then are the States entitled by \u00a7 2a to aparticular number of Representatives. Because the Secre-tary's report to the President carries no direct consequencesfor the reapportionment, it serves more like a tentative rec-ommendation than a \u00aenal and binding determination. It is,like \u00aathe ruling of a subordinate of\u00aecial,\u00ba Abbott Labora- tories v.Gardner, supra, at 151, not \u00aenal and therefore not subject to review. Cf. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 109 (1948); United States v.George S. Bush & Co. , 310 U. S. 371, 379 (1940). The statutory structure in this case differs from that at issue in Japan Whaling Assn. v.American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221 (1986), in which we held that the Secretary ofCommerce's certi\u00aecation to the President that another coun-try was endangering \u00aesheries was \u00aa\u00aenal agency action.\u00baId., at 231, n. 4. In that case, the Secretary's certi\u00aecation 1Justice Stevens suggests that the \u00aadecennial census\u00ba is a single count, determined solely by the Secretary, that is used for many purposesother than reapportionment of Representatives. Therefore, he reasons,it cannot be within the control of the President. However, the Presidentmay be involved in the policymaking tasks of his Cabinet members,whether or not his involvement is explicitly required by statute. Thequestion here is whether the census count is \u00aenal before the Presidentacts. It seems clear that it is not. The tabulations used for purposes ofstate redistricting, which include counts of persons in each state district,are not required by statute to be completed until April 1, months afterthe President's report to Congress. 13 U.

Brief for Appellees 86. They cite the Sen-ate Report for the bill that became 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 2a, whichstates that the President is to report \u00aaupon a problem inmathematics which is standard, and for which rigid speci\u00ae-cations are provided by Congress itself, and to which therecan be but one mathematical answer.\u00ba S. Rep. No. 2, 71stCong., 1st Sess., at 4\u00b15. The admittedly ministerial nature of the apportionment calculation itself does not answer the question whether theapportionment is foreordained by the time the Secretarygives her report to the President. To reiterate, \u00a7 2a doesnot curtail the President's authority to direct the Secretaryin making policy judgments that result in \u00aathe decennial cen-sus\u00ba; he is not expressly required to adhere to the policydecisions re\u00afected in the Secretary's report. Because it isthe President's personal transmittal of the report to Con-gress that settles the apportionment, until he acts there isno determinate agency action to challenge. The President,not the Secretary, takes the \u00aenal action that affects theStates. Indeed, it is clear that Congress thought it was important to involve a constitutional of\u00aecer in the apportionment proc-ess. Congress originally considered a bill requiring theSecretary to report the apportionment calculation directly505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:41 PAGES OPINPGT 800 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of the Court to Congress. See S. Rep. No. 1446, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1929). The bill was later amended to require the participa-tion of the President: \u00aaAnother objection to the previous billwas that the Secretary of Commerce should not be intrustedwith the \u00aenal responsibility for making so important a reportto Congress. The new and pending bill recognizes this ob-jection to the extent that the President is substituted for theSecretary of Commerce so that this function may be servedby a constitutional of\u00aecer. This makes for greater perma-nence, which is one of the major virtues to be desired in sucha statute.\u00ba S. Rep. No. 2, supra, at 5. It is hard to imagine a purpose for involving the President if he is to be preventedfrom exercising his accustomed supervisory powers over hisexecutive of\u00aecers. Certainly no purpose to alter the Presi-dent's usual superintendent role is evident from the text ofthe statute. As enacted, 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 2a provides that the Secretary can- not act alone; she must send her results to the President,who makes the calculations and sends the \u00aenal apportion-ment to Congress. That the \u00aenal act is that of the Presidentis important to the integrity of the process and bolsters ourconclusion that his duties are not merely ceremonial or min-isterial. Thus, we can only review the APA claims here ifthe President, not the Secretary of Commerce, is an \u00aaagency\u00bawithin the meaning of the Act. The APA de\u00aenes \u00aaagency\u00ba as \u00aaeach authority of the Gov- ernment of the United States, whether or not it is within orsubject to review by another agency, but does not include\u00d0(A) the Congress; (B) the courts of the United States; (C) thegovernments of the territories or possessions of the UnitedStates; (D) the government of the District of Columbia.\u00ba 5U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 701(b)(1), 551(1). The President is not explicitlyexcluded from the APA's purview, but he is not explicitlyincluded, either. Out of respect for the separation of powersand the unique constitutional position of the President, we\u00aend that textual silence is not enough to subject the Presi-505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 801 Cite as: 505 U. S. 788 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, J. dent to the provisions of the APA. We would require an express statement by Congress before assuming it intendedthe President's performance of his statutory duties to be re-viewed for abuse of discretion. Cf. Nixon v.Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 748, n. 27 (1982) (Court would require an explicitstatement by Congress before assuming Congress had cre-ated a damages action against the President). As the APAdoes not expressly allow review of the President's actions,we must presume that his actions are not subject to its re-quirements. Although the President's actions may still bereviewed for constitutionality, see Youngs town Sheet & Tube Co.v.Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952); Panama Re\u00aening Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), we hold that they are not review- able for abuse of discretion under the APA, see Armstrong v.Bush, 288 U. S. App. D. C. 38, 45, 924 F. 2d 282, 289 (1991). The District Court erred in proceeding to determine themerits of the APA claims. III Although the reapportionment determination is not sub- ject to review under the standards of the APA, that does notdispose of appellees' constitutional claims. See Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603\u00b1605 (1988). Constitutional chal- lenges to apportionment are justiciable. See Department of Commerce v.Montana, 503 U. S. 442 (1992). We \u00aerst address standing. 2To invoke the constitutional power of the federal courts to adjudicate a case or contro-versy under Article III, appellees here must allege andprove an injury \u00aafairly traceable to the [appellants'] allegedlyunlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requestedrelief.\u00ba Allen v.Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984). 2While appellants asserted below that the courts have no subject- matter jurisdiction over this case because it involves a \u00aapolitical question,\u00bawe recently rejected a similar argument in Department of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S., at 456\u00b1459, and appellants now concede the issue. Brief for Appellants 21.505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 802 FRANKLIN O\u0092Connor, J. To determine whether appellees suf\u00aeciently allege and prove causation requires separating out appellees' claims:Appellees claim both that the Secretary erred in deciding toallocate overseas employees to various States and that theSecretary erred in using inaccurate data to do so. Appelleeshave shown that Massachusetts would have had an additionalRepresentative if overseas employees had not been allocatedat all. App. 183. They have neither alleged nor shown,however, that Massachusetts would have had an additionalRepresentative if the allocation had been done using someother source of \u00aamore accurate\u00ba data. Consequently, even ifappellees have standing to challenge the Secretary's decisionto allocate, they do not have standing to challenge the accu-racy of the data used in making that allocation. We need,then, review only the decision to include overseas federalemployees in the state population counts, not the Secretary'schoice of information sources. The thornier standing question is whether the injury is redressable by the relief sought. Tracking the statutoryprogress of the census data from the Census Bureau, throughthe President, and to the States, the District Court enteredan injunction against the Secretary of Commerce, the Presi-dent, and the Clerk of the House. 785 F. Supp., at 268.While injunctive relief against executive of\u00aecials like theSecretary of Commerce is within the courts' power, seeYoungs town Sheet & Tube Co. v.Sawyer, supra, the District Court's grant of injunctive relief against the President him-self is extraordinary, and should have raised judicial eye-brows. We have left open the question whether the Presi-dent might be subject to a judicial injunction requiring theperformance of a purely \u00aaministerial\u00ba duty, Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 498\u00b1499 (1867), and we have held that the President may be subject to a subpoena to provide infor-mation relevant to an ongoing criminal prosecution, United States v.Nixon, 418 U.

S. 788 (1992) Opinion of the Court court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his of\u00aecial duties.\u00ba Mississippi v.John- son, supra, at 501. At the threshold, the District Court should have evaluated whether injunctive relief against thePresident was available, and, if not, whether appellees' inju-ries were nonetheless redressable. For purposes of establishing standing, however, we need not decide whether injunctive relief against the Presidentwas appropriate, because we conclude that the injury allegedis likely to be redressed by declaratory relief against theSecretary alone. See Duke Power Co. v.Carolina Environ- mental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 75, n. 20 (1978); Allen v.Wright, supra, at 752. The Secretary certainly has an interest in defending her policy determinations concerningthe census; even though she cannot herself change the reap-portionment, she has an interest in litigating its accuracy.And, as the Solicitor General has not contended to the con-trary, we may assume it is substantially likely that the Presi-dent and other executive and congressional of\u00aecials wouldabide by an authoritative interpretation of the censusstatute and constitutional provision by the District Court,even though they would not be directly bound by such adetermination. IV On the merits, appellees argue that the Secretary's alloca- tion of overseas federal employees to the States violated thecommand of Article I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3, that the number of Repre-sentatives per State be determined by an \u00aaactual Enumera-tion\u00ba of \u00aatheir respective Numbers,\u00ba that is, a count of thepersons \u00aain\u00ba each State. Appellees point out that the \u00aerstcensus conducted in 1790 required that persons be allocated to their place of \u00aausual residence.\u00ba Brief for Appellees 77.See Act of Mar. 1, 1790, \u00a7 5, 1 Stat. 103.

S. 714, 723\u00b1724 (1986), ap- pellees argue that the Secretary should have allocated theoverseas employees to their overseas stations, because thosewere their usual residences. The appellants respond, on the other hand, that the alloca- tion of employees temporarily stationed overseas to theirhome States is fully compatible with the standard of \u00aausualresidence\u00ba used in the early censuses. We review the dis-pute to the extent of determining whether the Secretary'sinterpretation is consistent with the constitutional languageand the constitutional goal of equal representation. See De- partment of Commerce v.Montana, 503 U. S., at 459. \u00aaUsual residence\u00ba was the gloss given the constitutional phrase \u00aain each State\u00ba by the \u00aerst enumeration Act and hasbeen used by the Census Bureau ever since to allocate per-sons to their home States. App. 173\u00b1174. The term canmean more than mere physical presence, and has been usedbroadly enough to include some element of allegiance or en-during tie to a place. The \u00aerst enumeration Act itself pro-vided that \u00aaevery person occasionally absent at the time ofthe enumeration [shall be counted] as belonging to that placein which he usually resides in the United States.\u00ba Act ofMar. 1, 1790, \u00a7 5, 1 Stat. 103. The Act placed no limit onthe duration of the absence, which, considering the modes oftransportation available at the time, may have been quitelengthy. For example, during the 36-week enumeration pe-riod of the 1790 census, President George Washington spent16 weeks traveling through the States, 15 weeks at the seatof Government, and only 10 weeks at his home in MountVernon. He was, however, counted as a resident of Virginia.T. Clemence, Place of Abode, reproduced in App. 83. The \u00aerst enumeration Act uses other words as well to de- scribe the required tie to the State: \u00aausual place of abode,\u00ba\u00aainhabitant,\u00ba \u00aausual reside[nt].\u00ba Act 1790, \u00a7 5, 1Stat. 103. The \u00aerst draft of Article I, \u00a7 2, also used the word\u00aainhabitant,\u00ba which was omitted by the Committee of Style505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 805 Cite as: 505 U.

This understanding was applied in 1824, whena question was raised about the residency quali\u00aecations ofwould-be Representative John Forsyth, of Georgia. Mr. Forsyth had been living in Spain during his election, servingas minister plenipotentiary from the United States. Hisquali\u00aecation for of\u00aece was challenged on the ground that hewas not \u00aaan inhabitant of the State in which he [was] cho-sen.\u00ba U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The House Committeeof Elections disagreed, reporting: \u00aaThere is nothing in Mr.Forsyth's case which disquali\u00aees him from holding a seat inthis House. The capacity in which he acted, excludes theidea that, by the performance of his duty abroad, he ceasedto be an inhabitant of the United States; and, if so, inasmuchas he had no inhabitancy in any other part of the Union thanGeorgia, he must be considered as in the same situation asbefore the acceptance of the appointment.\u00ba M. Clarke &D. Hall, Cases of Contested Elections in Congress 497\u00b1498(1834). Representative Bailey, supporting the quali\u00aecationof Mr. Forsyth, pointed out that if \u00aathe mere living in a placeconstituted inhabitancy,\u00ba it would \u00aaexclude sitting membersof this House.\u00ba Id., at 497 (emphasis deleted). Up to the present day, \u00aausual residence\u00ba has continued to hold broad connotations. For example, up until 1950, college 3As submitted to the Committee of Style, the provision read: \u00aa[T]he Legislature shall . . . regulate the number representatives by the num-ber of inhabitants.\u00ba 2 M.

Even today, high school students away at board-ing school are allocated to their parents' home State, notthe location of the school. Id., at 220. Members of Con- gress may choose whether to be counted in the Washington,D. C., area or in their home States. Id.,at 218. Those per- sons who are institutionalized in out-of-state hospitals orjails for short terms are also counted in their home States.Id., at 225. In this case, the Secretary of Commerce made a judgment, consonant with, though not dictated by, the text and historyof the Constitution, that many federal employees temporar-ily stationed overseas had retained their ties to the Statesand could and should be counted toward their States' repre- sentation in Congress: \u00aaMany, if not most, of these militaryoverseas consider themselves to be usual residents of theUnited States, even though they are temporarily assignedoverseas.\u00ba Id.,at 120. The Secretary's judgment does not hamper the underlying constitutional goal of equal represen-tation, but, assuming that employees temporarily stationedabroad have indeed retained their ties to their home States,actually promotes equality. If some persons sharing inWashington's fate had not been properly counted, the votesof all those who reside in Washington State would not havebeen weighted equally to votes of those who reside in otherStates. Certainly, appellees have not demonstrated thateliminating overseas employees entirely from the statecounts will make representation in Congress more equal.Cf.Karcher v.Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 730\u00b1731 (1983) (parties challenging state apportionment legislation bear burden ofproving disparate representation). We conclude that appel-lees' constitutional challenge fails on the merits. The District Court's judgment is Reversed.505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 807 Cite as: 505 U.

C. \u00a7 701 et seq. I am persuaded, however, that the Sec- retary complied with the Census Act and with the Constitu-tion in the preparation of the 1990 census and that, underthe standard of deference appropriate here, the Secretary'sactions were not arbitrary or capricious. I therefore agreethat the judgment of the District Court must be reversed. I During the decade after 1980 the population of Massachu- setts increased less rapidly than the population of the entireNation. In the apportionment following the 1990 census, itreceived only 10 of the 435 seats in the House of Representa-tives whereas formerly it had 11. In the District Court, appellees, who are the Common- wealth of Massachusetts and two of its registered voters,made two separate attacks on the process that reduced thesize of Massachusetts' congressional delegation. They chal- lenged the Secretary's conduct of the census, and they challenged the method of apportioning congressional seatsbased on the census report. The District Court rejectedthe challenge to the constitutionality of the method of appor-tionment prescribed in the Apportionment Act of 1941, 55Stat. 761\u00b1762. Commonwealth v.Mosbacher, 785 F.

S. 442 (1992), and is no longer in dispute. Pursuant to the judicial review provi-sions of the APA, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706(2), the District Court alsoexamined the decision of the Secretary of Commerce to in-clude overseas federal employees in the census count. The505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 808 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of Stevens, J. court concluded that the Secretary's decision was \u00aaarbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\u00ba 785 F. Supp.,at 267. In a rather surprising development, this Court reverses because it concludes that the census report is not \u00aa\u00aenalagency action,\u00ba 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 704. The reason the Court givesfor this conclusion is that the President\u00d0who is not himselfa part of the agency that prepared the census and who hasno statutory responsibilities under the Census Act\u00d0mightrevise that report in some way when he is performing hisresponsibilities under an entirely separate statute, the Ap- portionment Act. The logic of the Court's opinion escapesme, and apparently was not obvious to the Solicitor General,for he advanced no such novel claim in his argument seekingreversal. The Court's conclusion is erroneous for severalreasons. II Article I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution, as modi\u00aeed by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that Members of theHouse of Representatives \u00aashall be apportioned among theseveral States according to their respective numbers, count-ing the whole number of persons in each State . . . .\u00ba Toensure that the apportionment remains representative of thecurrent population, the Constitution further requires that acensus be taken at least every 10 years. 1 Beginning in 1790, Congress ful\u00aelled the constitutional command by passing a Census Act every 10 years. Underthe early census statutes, marshals would transmit the col-lected information to the Secretary of State.

After the 1920 cen-sus, however, Congress failed to pass a reapportionment Act.This congressional deadlock provided the impetus for the1929 Act that established a self-executing apportionment inthe case of congressional inaction. See S. Rep. No. 2, 71stCong., 1st Sess., 2\u00b14 (1929). The bill produced an automaticreapportionment through the application of a mathematicalformula to the census. The automatic connection betweenthe census and the reapportionment was the key innovationof the Act. 5 In its original version, the bill directed the Secretary of Commerce to apply a mathematical formula to the census \u00aegures and to transmit the resulting apportionment calcula-tions to Congress. A later version made the President re-sponsible for performing the mathematical computations andreporting the result. From the legislative history, it is clearthat this change in the designated of\u00aecial was intended tohave no substantive signi\u00aecance. 6There is no indication 2See C.

The Secretary reports the collected in-formation to the President, see \u00a7 141(b), who is directed to\u00aatransmit to the Congress\u00ba a statement showing the popula-tion of each State \u00aaas ascertained under ( a ) . The plain language of the statute demonstrates that thePresident has no substantive role in the computation of thecensus. The Secretary takes the \u00aadecennial census,\u00ba andthe President performs the apportionment calculations andtransmits the census \u00aegures and apportionment results toCongress. In the face of this clear statutory mandate, the Court must fall back on an argument based on statutory silence. TheCourt insists that there is no law prohibiting the President from changing the census \u00aegures after he receives them fromthe Secretary. The Court asserts: \u00aaSection 2a does not ex-pressly require the President to use the data in the Secre- tary's report, but, rather, the data from the ` decennial cen- sus.'\u00baAnte, at 797 (emphasis added). This statement is dif\u00aecult to comprehend, for it purports to contrast two termsthat the statute equates. The \u00aadecennial census\u00ba is thename the statute gives to the information collected by the better to name a constitutional of\u00aecer rather than a statutory of\u00aecer. I have quite no pride of opinion at that point and I think it makes quite nodifference, because everybody will get the same answer when we under- take to do that problem in arithmetic.\u00ba 71 Cong. 1613 (1929).505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 811 Cite as: 505 U.

The Court's argu- ment cannot be harmonized with a statutory scheme thatdirects the Secretary to take the \u00aadecennial census\u00ba and thePresident view that the statute endows the Presidentwith discretion to modify the census results reported bythe Secretary. The legislative record, moreover, establishes that the Executive involvement in the process is to be wholly min-isterial. 7The question of the discretion allowed to the President was discussed on the \u00afoor of the Senate, and thesponsor of the bill, Senator Vandenberg of Michigan, statedunequivocally that the President exercised no discretionwhatsoever: \u00aaI believe as a matter of indisputable fact, that function served by the President is as purely and completelya ministerial function as any function on earth could be.\u00ba 71Cong. Rec. 1858 (1929). 8In a colloquy 7The Senate Report, for example, states: \u00aaThe objection that this is an improper `delegation of power' to the Department of Commerce (which takes the census) and to the President(who reports the arithmetic) is answered by an examination of the facts.No power whatever is delegated. The Department of Commerce countsthe people (as it always has done) and the President reports upon a prob-lem in mathematics which is standard, and for which rigid speci\u00aecationsare provided by Congress itself, and to which there can be but one mathe-matical answer.\u00ba S. Rep. No. 2, 71st Cong., 1st (1929). 8At another point, Senator Vandenberg explained: \u00aaThe bill calls upon the President to report the result of a census to the Congress. We have always depended upon somebody to report the resultof a census to us. The bill calls upon the President, when he reports theresult of the census, also to report the result of a problem in arithmetic.If the President did not present the answer to that problem in arithmetic,somebody else would have to do the problem in arithmetic, because nomatter what method is embraced for purposes of apportionment, there isinevitably needed a formula which, like a chemical formula, may in itselfbe somewhat inscrutable, and yet which always reaches the same conclu-sion.\u00ba 71 Cong.

Is that the view of the Senatorfrom Michigan? ..... \u00aaMr. V ANDENBERG: My answer is that the Senator from Montana is entirely correct.

He considered such a possibility a recipe for tyranny. See71 Cong. Rec. 1612 (1929).505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 813 Cite as: 505 U.

Nor did the Solicitor General advance that argument in this litigation.10As a matter of practice, the President has consistently and faithfully per-formed the ministerial duty described by Senator Vanden-berg. The Court's suggestion today that the statute giveshim discretion to do otherwise is plainly incorrect. 11 10While asserting that the President has authority to direct the Secre- tary's performance of the census, the Solicitor General acknowledged thatthe statute does not authorize the President to deviate from the Secre-tary's report: \u00aaMR. ROBERTS: The law directs [the President] to apply, of course, a particular mathematical formula to the population \u00aegures he receives, butI don't think there is a limit on his exercise of authority to direct theSecretary of Commerce to conduct the census in a particular manner. Itwould be unlawful, maybe not subject to judicial review, but unlawful justto say, these are the \u00aegures, they are right, but I am going to submit adifferent statement. But he can certainly direct the Secretary in theconduct of the census. \u00aaQUESTION: But would he have to remand it in effect to the Secretary or could he say, well, I have had somebody over at the FBI making somechecks for me and they tell me there are really more people in Massachu-setts, so I am going to give them extra seats. \u00aaMR. ROBERTS: I think under the law he is supposed to base his calcula- tion on the \u00aegures submitted by the Secretary.\u00ba Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u00b113. 11The Court confuses two duties of the President: (1) the general duty to supervise the actions of the Secretary of Commerce, and (2) the statu-tory duty to transmit the census report and the apportionment calcula-tions to Congress. This confusion is evident from the Court's statement,\u00aaIt is hard to imagine a purpose for involving the President if he is to beprevented from exercising his accustomed supervisory powers over hisexecutive of\u00aecers.\u00ba Ante, at 800. It may be true that the statute does not purport to limit the President's \u00aaaccustomed supervisory powers\u00ba overthe Secretary of Commerce. The President would enjoy these \u00aaaccus-tomed powers,\u00ba however, whether or not he was responsible for transmit-ting the census and apportionment calculations to Congress. These \u00aaac-customed powers,\u00ba therefore, cannot be relevant in deciding whetheragency action is \u00aenal for the purposes of the APA, or else no action of anExecutive department would ever be \u00aenal. The Court's argument thendepends on construing the statute to grant discretion to the President that505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 814 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of Stevens, J. Because the Census Act directs that the tabulation of the total population by States shall be \u00aareported by the Secre-tary to the President,\u00ba the Court suggests that it is \u00aalike atentative recommendation\u00ba to the President, ante, at 798. This suggestion is misleading because, unlike the typical\u00aatentative recommendation,\u00ba the census report is a publicdocument. It is released to the public at the same time thatit is transmitted to the President. 12By law, the census re- port is distributed to federal and state agencies because itprovides the basis for the allocation of various bene\u00aets andburdens among the States under a variety of federal pro- grams. The Secretary also transmits the census \u00aegures di-rectly to the States to assist them in redistricting. See 13U. S. C. \u00a7 141(c). This wide distribution provides further evidence that the statute does not contemplate the President's changing theSecretary's report. If the President modi\u00aeed the census\u00aegures after he received them from the Secretary, the Fed-eral Government and the States would rely on different cen-sus results. The Secretary has made clear that the exist-ence of varying \u00aaof\u00aecial\u00ba population \u00aegures is not acceptable. he would not otherwise enjoy. Such additional grants of authority were implicated in the cases on which the Court relies. See Chicago & South- ern Air Lines, Inc. v.Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948); United States v.George S. Bush & Co., 310 U. S. 371 (1940). The statutory language here will not bear this interpretation. Moreover, whatever purpose the Court wishes to \u00aaimagine\u00ba for the statute's designating thePresident as the of\u00aecial responsible for performing the apportionment cal-culations, the legislative record makes it absolutely clear that the purposewas not to give the President any new discretionary authority over the census.

In setting forth guidelines for possible adjustment of the census results,13the Secretary stated: \u00aaThe resulting counts must be of suf\u00aecient quality and level of detail to be usable for Congressional reappor-tionment and legislative redistricting, and for all otherpurposes and at all levels for which census counts arepublished .... \u00aa[T]here can be, for the population at all geographic levels at any one point in time, only one set of of\u00aecialgovernment population \u00aegures.\u00ba 55 Fed. Reg. 9840\u00b19841 (1990). To ensure uniformity, the Secretary's count must establish the \u00aenal census \u00aegures. 14 13The Court asserts that the possibility of census adjustments prior to the President's report to Congress supports its interpretation of the stat-ute. See ante, at 797\u00b1798. On the contrary, the evidence the Court cites undermines its argument. The President's statement accompanying thetransmittal of the 1990 census and apportionment \u00aegures to Congress ex-plains, \u00aaThe Department of Commerce is considering whether to correctthese counts and will publish corrected counts, if any, not later than July 15, 1991.\u00ba H. R. Doc. No. 102\u00b118, p. 1 (1991). The statement underscoresthat it is the Secretary, not the President who determines the \u00aenal census \u00aegures. That the Secretary will \u00aapublish\u00ba the corrected results also dem- onstrates that the Court is mistaken in likening the Secretary's report toa \u00aatentative recommendation.\u00ba Ante, at 798. The possibility that the Secretary may modify the census \u00aegures, of course, cannot support the Court's view that the President's interventiondeprives the Secretary's action of \u00aenality. The possibility of correctionwould mean, at most, that appellees' challenge was not ripe until the Sec-retary's eventual announcement that he would not adjust the census. See56 Fed. Reg. 33582 (1991). Similarly, even if it were the President's re-port to Congress that signaled the end of a census-adjustment process,that would be relevant only in determining when a challenge is ripe, notwhether the Secretary's report is \u00aa\u00aenal agency action.\u00ba 14Even in the Court's view, the Secretary's report of census information to recipients other than the President would certainly constitute \u00aa\u00aenalagency action.\u00ba The Court's decision thus appears to amount to a plead-ing requirement. To avoid the bar to APA review that the Court imposes505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 816 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of Stevens, J. In light of the statutory language, the legislative history, and the consistent Executive practice, the Court's conclusionthat the census report is not \u00aa\u00aenal agency action\u00ba is as insup-portable as it is surprising. 15 III In view of my conclusion that the census report prepared by the Secretary constitutes \u00aenal agency action, I must con-sider the Secretary's contention that judicial review is notavailable because the conduct of the census is \u00aacommitted toagency discretion by law.\u00ba 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). As we have frequently recognized, the \u00aastrong presump- tion that Congress intends judicial review of administrativeaction,\u00ba see, e. g., Bowen v.Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670 (1986), cannot be overcome without \u00aa `clear and convincing evidence' \u00ba of a contrary legis-lative intent, Abbott Laboratories v.Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 141 (1967) (quoting Rusk v.Cort, 369 U. S. 367, 380 (1962)). No such evidence appears here. The current version of the statute provides that \u00aa[t]he Sec- retary shall . . . take a decennial \u00aerst day of April . . . in content as [s]hemay . .\u00ba 13 U. S. C. \u00a7 141(a). 16The Secretary today, litigants need only join their apportionment challenges to other census-related claims. Notwithstanding the Court's novel reading of thestatute, in view of the Secretary's insistence on unitary census data, reliefon any census claim would yield relief on all other claims. 15My conclusion that the Secretary's action was reviewable makes it unnecessary for me to consider whether the President is an \u00aaagency\u00bawithin the meaning of the APA. 16Moreover, this language appeared only recently in the statute. The Act passed in 1929 stated: \u00aaThat a census of populatio n...s h a l lb et aken by the Director of the Census in the year 1930 and every ten years there-after.\u00ba 46 Stat. 21. Before the 1976 amendment, the Act provided: \u00aaTheSecretary shall, in the year 1960 and every ten years thereafter, take acensus of population . . . .\u00ba 71 Stat. 483. It was not until 1976 that Con-gress added the language, \u00aain such form and content as [s]he may deter-mine.\u00ba To the extent that the argument for depends on505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 817 Cite as: 505 U. S. 788 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. asserts that the discretion afforded by the statute is at least as broad as that allowed the Director of Central Intelligencein the statute we considered in Webster v.Doe, 486 U. S. 592 (1988). That assertion cannot withstand scrutiny. Thestatute at issue in Doe provided that \u00aathe Director of Central Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the employ-ment of any of\u00aecer or employee of the Agency whenever heshall deem such termination necessary or advisable in theinterests of the United States . . . .\u00ba 50 U. S. C. \u00a7 403(c). Inconcluding that employment discharge decisions were com-mitted to agency discretion, we emphasized the language of\u00aadeem . . . advisable,\u00ba which we found to provide no meaning-ful standard of review. We also relied on the overall statu-tory structure of the National Security Act. No language equivalent to \u00aadeem . . . advisable\u00ba exists in the census statute. There is no indication that Congress in-tended the Secretary's own mental processes, rather than other more objective factors, to provide the standard forgauging the Secretary's exercise of discretion. Moreover, it this phrase, it requires the conclusion that when Congress amended the statute in 1976, it intended to effect a new, unreviewable commitment toagency discretion. There is no support for this position whatsoever. Themain purpose of the 1976 amendment was to provide for a mid-decadecensus to be used for various purposes (not including apportionment).See S. Rep. No. 94\u00b11256, pp. 2\u00b13 (1976). The legislative history evidencesno intention to expand the scope of the Secretary's discretion. The Senate Report on the new language in 13 U. S. C. \u00a7 141(a) reads in its entirety: \u00aaSubsection (a) of section 141 essentially rewords the existing subsec- tion, adding the term `decennial census of population' so as to distinguishthis census, to be taken in 1980 and every ten years thereafter, from themid-decade census, which is to be taken in 1985 and every ten years there-after. New language is added at the end of the subsection to encouragethe use of sampling and surveys in the taking of the decennial census.\u00baS. Rep. No. 94\u00b11256, at 4. Indeed, other portions of the Act limited the Secretary's authority by requiring, if feasible, the use of sampling in the nonapportionment census.90 Stat. 2464, 13 U. S. 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 818 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of Stevens, J. is dif\u00aecult to imagine two statutory schemes more dissimilar than the National Security Act and the Census Act. Thoughthey both relate to the gathering of information, the similar-ity ends there. Doe raises the possibility that, except for constitutional claims, the Director of Central Intelligencemay enjoy unreviewable discretion to discharge employees.This conclusion accords with the principle of judicial defer-ence that pervades the area of national security. See ,e .g . , Department of Navy v.Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 530 (1988); CIA v.Sims, 471 U. S. 159, 180\u00b1181 (1985). While the operations of a secret intelligence agency may provide an exception tothe norm of reviewability, 17the taking of the census does not. The open nature of the census enterprise and the public dis-semination of the information collected are closely connectedwith our commitment to a democratic form of government. 18 The reviewability of decisions relating to the conduct of thecensus bolsters public con\u00aedence in the integrity of the proc- ess and helps strengthen this mainstay of our democracy. More generally, the Court has limited the exception to ju- dicial review provided by 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) to cases in-volving national security, such as Webster v.Doe and Depart- m e n to fN a v y v.Egan, or those seeking review of refusal to pursue enforcement actions, see Heckler v.Chaney, 470 U. S. 17Indeed, it was asserted in Webster v.Doe, 486 U. S. 592 (1988), that the statute should be construed to preclude review even of constitutionalclaims. See id.,at 605\u00b1606 ( O\u0092Connor 621 ( Scalia , J., dissenting) (describing Court's refusal to preclude constitutional review as creating \u00aathe world's only secret intel-ligence agency that must litigate the dismissal of its agents\u00ba). 18See 3 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 296 (reprinted in Subcom- mittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services of the Sen-ate Committee on Governmental Affairs, The Decennial Print Thetradition of course, relates to the tabulated information.

These are areas in which courts have long been hesitant tointrude.

C. \u00a7 2a demonstrates that the Secretary'sdiscretion is constrained by the requirement that she produce a tabulation of the \u00aawhole number of persons in eachState.\u00ba 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 2a(a). 20This statutory command also 19The great weight of authority supports the view that the conduct of the census is not \u00aacommitted to agency discretion by law.\u00ba See ,e . F.

J. 1978). 20The Census Act provides various other rules, as well, that limit the Secretary's discretion. For example, the statute requires the Secretaryto take a decennial census of population \u00aaas of the \u00aerst day of April\u00ba inevery 10th year. 13 U. S. C. \u00a7 141(a). Thus, persons who die in Februaryor March, or who are not born until May or June, are not to be counted.The fact that the statute gives the Secretary broad discretion with respectto the \u00aaform and content\u00ba of the census surely does not mean that shecould lawfully count persons who predeceased the census date or who were505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 820 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of Stevens, J. embodies a duty to conduct a census that is accurate and that fairly accounts for the crucial representational rights thatdepend on the census and the apportionment. The \u00aausualresidence\u00ba policy that has guided the census since 1790 pro-vides a further standard by which to evaluate the Secretary'sexercise of discretion. See generally Heckler v.Chaney, 470 U. S., at 836; Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v.State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 41\u00b143 (1983); Padula v.Webster, 822 F. 2d 97, 100, 261 U. S. App. D. C. 365, 368 (1987). The District Court was clearlycorrect in concluding that the statutory framework and thelong-held administrative tradition provide a judicially admin-istrable standard of review. 21 IV For the reasons stated in Part IV of the Court's opinion, I agree that the inclusion of overseas employees in state cen-sus totals does not violate the Constitution. 22I turn now to born thereafter. Similarly, it would be plain error to count as Massachu- setts residents a family that moved from New York to Boston on June 1. 21Nothing in the language of the statute or in the overall statutory scheme supports the Secretary's alternative argument that this is aninstance in which the relevant \u00aastatutes preclude judicial review.\u00ba 5U. S. C. \u00a7 701(a)(1). In the absence of express statutory language, wehave generally reserved that exception for cases in which the existence ofan alternative review procedure provided \u00aaclear and convincing evidence,\u00baBowen v.Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 671 (1986) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), of a legislativeintent to preclude judicial review. See , e. g., Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 530\u00b1533 (1988); NLRB v.Food & Commercial 130\u00b1133 (1987); Block v.Community Nutrition Insti- tute, 467 U. S. 340, 346\u00b1348 (1984). No such alternative scheme appears here. The ability of Congress, itself, to resolve apportionment issues byenacting new laws does not provide any evidence of an intent to precludejudicial review. 22I believe that appellees' challenge to the use of \u00aahome of record\u00ba data also merits brief consideration. The contention that overseas personnel may have little connection with their \u00aahome of record\u00ba clearly has some force. A person designates a505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 821 Cite as: 505 U. S. 788 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. appellees' contention that the Secretary's decision to include overseas federal employees was arbitrary and capricious andshould have been set aside under the APA. With the exception of the census conducted in 1900, over- seas federal employees were not included in state census to-tals before 1970. 23In the census conducted in 1970, during the Vietnam War, overseas military personnel were assignedto States for apportionment purposes based on the \u00aahomeof record\u00ba appearing in their personnel \u00aeles. 24The Bureau reverted to its previous policy of excluding overseas employ-ees from apportionment totals in the 1980 census. In ex-plaining this decision, one of the reasons cited by Bureauof\u00aecials was the \u00aaunknown reliability\u00ba of the data relied onto determine the \u00aahome State\u00ba of overseas personnel. App.55. In discussions with the Bureau and in testimony beforeCongress, of\u00aecials of the Defense Department agreed that\u00aahome of record\u00ba data had a high \u00aaerror rate\u00ba and mighthave little correlation with an employee's true feelings ofaf\u00aeliation. See id.,at 124, 183. In July 1989, then-Secretary Mosbacher decided to include overseas employees in state population \u00aegures in the 1990 \u00aahome of record\u00ba when entering the service and is not permitted to change it thereafter. See App. 147, n. 5. This information may therefore bequite stale, implicating the constitutional requirements of accuracy anddecenniality. The special problems of including overseas personnel in the census, though, necessitate dif\u00aecult judgments about the best data to use. Inview of the discretion available to the Secretary in formulating residencerules, the adoption of the \u00aahome of record\u00ba principle cannot be said totransgress any constitutional command. Accuracy in this context isclearly a comparative concept, and appellees have not demonstrated thatthe constitutional requirement of accuracy dictates a different method ofdetermining residence. Like the District Court, I also conclude that the Secretary's decision did not violate any speci\u00aec provision of the Census Act. See 785 F. Supp., Opinion of Stevens, J. census.25The decision memorandum approved by the Sec- retary described several reasons for this conclusion, includ-ing \u00aagrowing bipartisan concern of the Congress\u00ba and thebelief of the Defense Department that its employees shouldbe included in apportionment calculations because they con-sidered themselves to be \u00aausual residents\u00ba of the UnitedStates.

The prospect of more accurate data than previously available also contributed to the decision.The memorandum stated that the Defense Department'splans to conduct an enumeration of its employees provided a\u00aasigni\u00aecant reason\u00ba for the decision. Id.,at 121; see also id., at 184. In December 1989, however, a lack of funds led theDefense Department to cancel the survey. Ibid. The Sec- retary nevertheless adhered to the decision to include over-seas personnel. In reaching the ultimate decision to allocate overseas fed- eral employees to States, the Secretary had an obligation to \u00aaexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactoryexplanation for [the] action including a `rational connectionbetween the facts found and the choice made.' \u00ba State Farm, 463 U. S., at 43 (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168 (1962)). The District Court was properly concerned by the scant evidence that theSecretary reconsidered the apportionment policy followingthe cancellation of the Defense Department survey. If thejusti\u00aecation for the decision no longer obtained, the refusalto reconsider would be quite capricious. The District Courtwas certainly correct in concluding that \u00aa[i]nertia cannotsupply the necessary rationality\u00ba for the Secretary's deci-sion. 785 F. Supp., at 265. While the question is a close one, two factors in particular lead me to conclude that the decision to include overseas em-ployees ultimately rested on more than inertia. First, theSecretary received assurances from the Defense Department 25Id.,at 182.505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 823 Cite as: 505 U.

Moreover, while the anticipated Defense Depart-ment survey played an important role in the Secretary's ini-tial decision, other factors cited in the memorandum contin-ued to support the Secretary's choice to include overseaspersonnel. The record could be more robust. However, the basis for the agency's decision need not appear with \u00aaideal clarity,\u00baBowman Transportation, Inc. v.Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 286 (1974), as long as it is reason- ably discernible. As the Court explains, see ante, Part IV , the Secretary had discretion to include overseas personnelin the census count. Although the hopes for more accuratedata were not fully realized, the record discloses that thedecision to include overseas personnel continued to besupported by valid considerations. I therefore concludethat the decision of the Secretary was not arbitrary orcapricious. 26 For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment, but only in Part IV of its opinion.

I agree with the Court that appellees had no cause of action under the judicial-review provisions of the Admin-istrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S.

Appellees have also challenged the constitutionality of the allocation methods used by the Secretary of Commerce inconducting the census. The Court concludes that they have 26The record indicates that the Secretary considered the alternative methods of allocating overseas employees to States and that the choice of\u00aahome of record\u00ba data was certainly not arbitrary or capricious.

Ourcases have established that there are three elements to the\u00aairreducible constitutional minimum of standing\u00ba requiredby Article III: (1) the plaintiffs must establish that they havesuffered \u00aainjury in fact\u00ba; (2) they must show causation be-tween the challenged action and the injury; and (3) they mustestablish that it is likely that the injury will be redressed bya decision in their favor. Lujan v.Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). Appellees have clearly satis\u00aeedthe \u00aerst two requirements, but I think they founder on thethird. The plurality concludes that declaratory relief directed at the Secretary alone would be suf\u00aecient to redress appellees'injury. Ante, at 803. I do not agree. Ordering the Sec- retary to recalculate the \u00aenal census totals will not redressappellees' injury unless the President accepts the new num-bers, changes his calculations accordingly, and issues a newreapportionment statement to Congress, and the Clerk ofthe House then submits new certi\u00aecates to the States. 13U. S. C. \u00a7 141(b); 2 U. S. C. \u00a7 2a. I agree that, in light of theClerk's purely ministerial role, we can properly assume thatinsofar as his participation is concerned the sequence of events will occur. But as the Court correctly notes, ante, at 797\u00b1800, the President's role in the reapportionment processisnotpurely ministerial; he is not \u00aarequired to adhere to the policy decisions re\u00afected in the Secretary's report,\u00ba ante, at 799. I do not think that for purposes of the Article III re-dressability requirement we are ever entitled to assume, no matter how objectively reasonable the assumption may be,that the President (or, for that matter, any of\u00aecial of the Ex- 1Although only a plurality of the Court joins that portion of Justice O\u0092Connor 's opinion which \u00aends standing (Part III), I must conclude that theCourt \u00aends standing since eight Justices join Part IV of the Court's opinion discussing the merits of appellees' constitutional claims.505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 825 Cite as: 505 U.

The decision is by Constitution or law con-ferred upon him, and I think we are precluded from sayingthat it is, in practical effect, the decision of someone else.Indeed, judicial inquiry into or speculation about the proba-bility of such \u00aapractical\u00ba subservience\u00d0never mind actingupon the outcome of such inquiry or speculation\u00d0seems tome disrespectful of a coordinate branch. On such a theoryof redressability, suit would lie (assuming injury-in-fact couldbe shown) against the members of the President's Cabinet, or even the members of his personal staff, for the almost-sure-to-be-followed advice they give him in their respectiveareas of expertise. The plurality, however, has a different theory of redress- ability. In its view, it suf\u00aeces that the \u00aaauthoritative inter-pretation of the census statute and constitutional provision\u00barendered by the District Court will induce the President tosubmit a new reapportionment that is consistent with whatthe District Court judgment orders the Secretary to submit.Ante, at 803. It seems to me this bootstrap argument eliminates, rather than resolves, the redressability question.If courts may simply assume that everyone (including thosewho are not proper parties to an action) will honor the legalrationales that underlie their decrees, then redressabilitywill always exist. Redressability requires that the court be able to afford relief through the exercise of its p ower, not through the persuasive or even awe-inspiring effect of theopinion explaining the exercise of its power. It is the Court's judgment, in other words, its injunction to the Secretary of Commerce, that must provide appelleesrelief\u00d0not its accompanying excursus on the meaning ofthe Constitution. Though the Court does not rely upon it, the judgment sought here did run against the President of the United States. The District Court's order expressly required, not505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 826 FRANKLIN v.MASSACHUSETTS Opinion of Scalia, J. only that a new census tabulation be prepared, but also that the President issue a new certi\u00aecation and that the Clerk ofthe House forward the new apportionment to the 50 Gover-nors. It is a commentary upon the level to which judicialunderstanding\u00d0indeed, even judicial awareness\u00d0of the doc-trine of separation of powers has fallen, that the DistrictCourt entered this order against the President withoutblinking an eye. I think it clear that no court has authorityto direct the President to take an of\u00aecial act. We have long recognized that the scope of Presidential im- munity from judicial process differs signi\u00aecantly from that ofCabinet or inferior of\u00aecers. Compare Nixon v.Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 750 (1982) (\u00aaThe President's unique statusunder the Constitution distinguishes him from other execu-tive of\u00aecials\u00ba), with Harlow v.Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 811, n. 17 (1982) (\u00aaSuits against other of\u00aecials\u00d0including Presi-dential aides\u00d0generally do not invoke separation-of-powersconsiderations to the same extent as suits against the Presi-dent himself\u00ba). Although we held in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974), that the President is not abso- lutely immune from judicial process, see also United States v.Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.) (upholding subpoena directed to President Jefferson),the order upheld there merely required the President to pro-vide information relevant to an ongoing criminal prosecution,which is what any citizen might do; it did not require himto exercise the \u00aaexecutive Power\u00ba in a judicially prescribedfashion. We have similarly held that Members of Congresscan be subpoenaed as witnesses, see Gravel v.United States, 408 U. S. 606, 615 (1972), citing United States v.Cooper, 4 Dall. 341 (CC Pa. 1800) (Chase, J., sitting on Circuit), thoughthere is no doubt that we cannot direct them in the perform- ance of their constitutionally prescribed duties, see Eastland v.United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U. S. 491 (1975) (re- fusing to enjoin the issuance of a congressional subpoena).505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 827 Cite as: 505 U. S. 788 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. I am aware of only one instance in which we were speci\u00ae- cally asked to issue an injunction requiring the Presidentto take speci\u00aeed executive acts: to enjoin President AndrewJohnson from enforcing the Reconstruction Acts. As theplurality notes, ante, at 802\u00b1803, we emphatically disclaimed the authority to do so, stating that \u00aa `this court has no juris-diction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performanceof his of\u00aecial duties.' \u00ba Mississippi v.Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 501 (1867). See also C. Burdick, The Law of the AmericanConstitution \u00a7 50, pp. 126\u00b1127 (1922); C. Pyle & R. Pious, The President, Congress, and the Constitution 170 (1984) (\u00aaNocourt has ever issued an injunction against the presidenthimself or held him in contempt of court\u00ba). The apparentlyunbroken historical tradition supports the view, which Ithink implicit in the separation of powers established by theConstitution, that the principals in whom the executive andlegislative powers are ultimately vested\u00d0viz., the Presidentand the Congress (as opposed to their agents)\u00d0may not beordered to perform particular executive or legislative acts atthe behest of the Judiciary. 2 For similar reasons, I think we cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President. It is incompatible with hisconstitutional position that he be compelled personally to de-fend his executive actions before a court. Many of the rea-sons we gave in Nixon v.Fitzgerald, supra, for acknowledg- ing an absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages forof\u00aecial acts apply with equal, if not greater, force to requestsfor declaratory or injunctive relief in of\u00aecial-capacity suitsthat challenge the President's performance of executive func-tions: The President's immunity from such judicial relief is 2InMississippi v.Johnson, 4 Wall. 475 (1867), we left open the question whether the President might be subject to a judicial injunction requiringthe performance of a purely \u00aaministerial\u00ba duty, see id., at 498\u00b1499; cf. Kendall v.United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524 (1838) (Postmaster General); Marbury v.Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803) (Secretary of State).

S. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 3, but, as moreand more disgruntled plaintiffs add his name to their com-plaints, would produce needless head-on confrontations be-tween district judges and the Chief Executive. (If of\u00aecial-action suits against the President had been contemplated,surely they would have been placed within this Court's origi-nal jurisdiction.) It is noteworthy that in the last substan-tive section of Nixon v.Fitzgerald where we explain why \u00aa[a] rule of absolute immunity for the President will not leavethe Nation without suf\u00aecient protection against misconducton the part of the Chief Executive,\u00ba 457 U. S., at 757, becauseof \u00aa[t]he existence of alternative remedies and deterrents,\u00baid.,at 758, injunctive or declaratory relief against the Presi- dent is not mentioned. None of these conclusions, of course, in any way suggests that Presidential action is unreviewable. Review of the le- gality of Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in asuit seeking to enjoin the of\u00aecers who attempt to enforce thePresident's directive, see, e. g., Youngs town Sheet & Tube Co. v.Sawyer, 343 U.

Accordingly, nothing in the case suggests that declaratory relief may be awarded for actions protected by congres-sional (or Presidential) immunity.505us3115K 06-15-96 20:51:42 PAGES OPINPGT 829 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 486, 503\u00b1506 (1969); U. S. 82 (1967); v.Thompson, 103 U. S. 168 (1881), but by enjoining those congressional (or ex-ecutive) agents who carry out Congress's directive. Unlessthe other branches are to be entirely subordinated to theJudiciary, we cannot direct the President to take a speci\u00aeedexecutive act or the Congress to perform particular legisla-tive duties. In sum, we cannot remedy appellees' asserted injury with- out ordering declaratory or injunctive relief against appel-lant President Bush, and since we have no power to do that, Ibelieve appellees' constitutional claims should be dismissed. 4 Since I agree with the Court's conclusion that appellees' con-stitutional claims do not provide an alternative ground thatwould support the judgment below, I concur in its judgmentreversing the District Court. 4A contrary conclusion is not required by the fact that in Department of Commerce v.Montana, 503 U.

Chief Justice Rehnquist , with whom Justice White , Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting. Lea\u00afetting presents risks of congestion similar to those posed by solicitation. It presents, in addition, some risksunique to lea\u00afetting. And of course, as with solicitation,these risks must be evaluated against a backdrop of the sub-stantial congestion problem facing the Port Authority andwith an eye to the cumulative impact that will result if allgroups are permitted terminal access. Viewed in this light,I conclude that the distribution ban, no less than the solicita-tion ban, is reasonable. I therefore dissent from the Court'sholding striking the distribution ban. I will not trouble to repeat in detail all that has been stated in No. 91\u00b1155, International Soc. for Krishna Con- sciousness, Inc. v.Lee, ante, at 683\u00b1685, describing the risks and burdens \u00afowing to travelers and the Port Authorityfrom permitting solicitation in airport terminals.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting to avoid the delays generated by having literature foisted upon him than he does to avoid delays from a \u00aenancial solici-tation. And while a busy passenger perhaps may succeedin fending off a lea\u00afetter with minimal disruption to himselfby agreeing simply to take the proffered material, this doesnot completely ameliorate the dangers of congestion \u00afowingfrom such lea\u00afetting. Others may choose not simply to ac-cept the material but also to stop and engage the lea\u00afetterin debate, obstructing those who follow. Moreover, thosewho accept material may often simply drop it on the \u00afooronce out of the lea\u00afetter's range, creating an eyesore, asafety hazard, and additional cleanup work for airport staff.See City Council of Los Angeles v.Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 816\u00b1817 (1984) (esthetic interests may providebasis for restricting speech); Sloane Supplemental Af\u00aedavit\u00b6 10, App. 514 (noting increased maintenance problems thatresult from solicitation and distribution). In addition, a differential ban that permits lea\u00afetting but prohibits solicitation, while giving the impression of permit-ting the Port Authority at least half of what it seeks, may infact prove for the Port Authority to be a much more Pyrrhicvictory. Under the regime that is today sustained, the PortAuthority is obliged to permit lea\u00afetting. But monitoringlea\u00afetting activity in order to ensure that it is only lea\u00afett- ing that occurs, and not also soliciting, may prove little lessburdensome than the monitoring that would be required ifsolicitation were permitted. At a minimum, therefore, Ithink it remains open whether at some future date the PortAuthority may be able to reimpose a complete ban, havingdeveloped evidence that enforcement of a differential banis overly burdensome. Until now it has had no reason ormeans to do this, since it is only today that such a require-ment has been announced. For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons stated in the opinion in No. 91\u00b1155, ante, p. 672, I respectfully dissent.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 833 OCTOBER TERM, 1991 Syllabus PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYL V ANIA et al. v.CASEY, GOVERNOR OF PENNSYL V ANIA, et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit No. 91\u00b1744.

The District Court held all the provisions unconstitutional andpermanently enjoined their enforcement.

S. 833 (1992) Syllabus (d) Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven unworkable, representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which astate law is unenforceable. P. 855. (e) The Roe rule's limitation on state power could not be repudiated without serious inequity to people who, for two decades of economic andsocial developments, have organized intimate relationships and madechoices that de\u00aene their views of themselves and their places in society,in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraceptionshould fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economicand social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to con-trol their reproductive lives. The Constitution serves human values,and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain costs of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.Pp. 855\u00b1856. (f) No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's central rule a doc- trinal anachronism discounted by society. If Roe is placed among the cases exempli\u00aeed by Griswold, supra, it is clearly in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developments have neither disturbed, nor dothey threaten to diminish, the liberty recognized in such cases. Simi-larly, if Roe is seen as stating a rule of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, akin to cases recognizing limits on governmental power tomandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection, this Court's post- Roe decisions accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual libertyclaims. See, e. g., Cruzan v.Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278. Finally, if Roe is classi\u00aeed as sui generis, there clearly has been no erosion of its central determination. It was expressly reaf-\u00aermed in Akron v.Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (Akron I), and Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetri- cians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747; and, in Webster v.Reproduc tive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, a majority either voted to reaf\u00aerm or declined to address the constitutional validity of Roe's central holding. Pp. 857\u00b1859. (g) No change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central hold- ing obsolete, and none supports an argument for its overruling. Al-though subsequent maternal health care advances allow for laterabortions safe to the pregnant woman, and post- Roe neonatal care de- velopments have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier, thesefacts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competinginterests. Thus, any later divergences from the factual premises ofRoe have no bearing on the validity of its central holding, that via- bility marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 836 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Syllabus life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nonthera- peutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutionaljudgment in no sense turns on when viability occurs. Whenever itmay occur, its attainment will continue to serve as the critical fact. P. 860. (h) A comparison between Roe and two decisional lines of comparable signi\u00aecance\u00d0the line identi\u00aeed with Lochner v.New York, 198 U. S. 45, and the line that began with Plessy v.Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537\u00d0con\u00aerms the result reached here. Those lines were overruled\u00d0by, respectively,West Coast Hotel Co. v.Parrish, 300 U. S. 379, and Brown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483\u00d0on the basis of facts, or an understanding of facts, changed from those which furnished the claimed justi\u00aecations forthe earlier constitutional resolutions. The overruling decisions werecomprehensible to the Nation, and defensible, as the Court's responsesto changed circumstances. In contrast, because neither the factual un-derpinnings of Roe's central holding nor this Court's understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedenthas been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining Roe with any justi\u00aecation beyond a present doctrinal disposition to comeout differently from the Roe Court. That is an inadequate basis for overruling a prior case. Pp. 861\u00b1864. (i) Overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjusti- \u00aeable result under stare decisis principles, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as theSupreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law. Where theCourt acts to resolve the sort of unique, intensely divisive controversyre\u00afected in Roe, its decision has a dimension not present in normal cases and is entitled to rare precedential force to counter the inevitable effortsto overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Only the most con-vincing justi\u00aecation under accepted standards of precedent could suf\u00aeceto demonstrate that a later decision overruling the \u00aerst was anythingbut a surrender to political pressure and an unjusti\u00aeed repudiation ofthe principle on which the Court staked its authority in the \u00aerst in-stance. Moreover, the country's loss of con\u00aedence in the Judiciarywould be underscored by condemnation for the Court's failure to keepfaith with those who support the decision at a cost to themselves. Adecision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circum- stances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both pro-found and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy and to the Na-tion's commitment to the rule of law. Pp. 864\u00b1869. Justice O\u0092Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter con- cluded in Part IV that an examination of Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 837 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Syllabus subsequent cases, reveals a number of guiding principles that should control the assessment of the Pennsylvania statute: (a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, seeid.,at 162, the undue burden standard should be employed. An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purposeor effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seekingan abortion before the fetus attains viability. (b)Roe's rigid trimester framework is rejected. To promote the State's interest in potential life throughout pregnancy, the State maytake measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed. Meas-ures designed to advance this interest should not be invalidated if theirpurpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.These measures must not be an undue burden on the right. (c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion, but maynot impose unnecessary health regulations that present a substantialobstacle to a woman seeking an abortion. (d) Adoption of the undue burden standard does not disturb Roe's holding that regardless of whether exceptions are made for particularcircumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making theultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability. (e)Roe's holding that \u00aasubsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate,and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriatemedical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of themother\u00ba is also reaf\u00aermed. Id.,at 164\u00b1165. Pp. Kennedy, and Justice Souter deliv- ered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts V\u00b1A and V\u00b1C, con-cluding that: 1. As construed by the Court of Appeals, \u00a7 3203's medical emergency de\u00aenition is intended to assure that compliance with the State's abortionregulations would not in any way pose a signi\u00aecant threat to a woman's life or health, and thus does not violate the essential holding of Roe, supra, at 164. Although the de\u00aenition could be interpreted in an uncon- stitutional manner, this Court defers to lower federal court interpreta-tions of state law unless they amount to \u00aaplain\u00ba error. Pp. 879\u00b1880. 2. Section 3209's husband noti\u00aecation provision constitutes an undue burden and is therefore invalid. A signi\u00aecant number of women will likely be prevented from obtaining an abortion just as surely as if Penn-sylvania had outlawed the procedure entirely. The fact that \u00a7 3209 mayaffect fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions does not saveit from facial invalidity, since the proper focus of constitutional inquiry505us3117z 05-19-99 10:05:54 PAGES OPINPGT 838 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Syllabus is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom it is irrelevant. Furthermore, it cannot be claimed that the father'sinterest in the fetus' welfare is equal to the mother's protected liberty,since it is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with re-spect to the fetus will have a far greater impact on the pregnant woman's bodily integrity than it will on the husband. Section 3209 em- bodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status ofmarried women but repugnant to this Court's present understanding ofmarriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution.See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 69. Pp. 887\u00b1898. Justice O\u0092Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter, joined byJustice Stevens, concluded in Part V\u00b1E that all of the statute's recordkeeping and reporting requirements, except that relating tospousal notice, are constitutional. The reporting provision relating tothe reasons a married woman has not noti\u00aeed her husband that sheintends to have an abortion must be invalidated because it places anundue burden on a woman's choice. Pp. 900\u00b1901. Justice O\u0092Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter con- cluded in Parts V\u00b1B and V\u00b1D that: 1. Section 3205's informed consent provision is not an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to decide to terminate a pregnancy.To the extent Akron I, 462 U. S., at 444, and Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 762, \u00aend a constitutional violation when the government requires, as itdoes here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about thenature of the abortion procedure, the attendant health risks and thoseof childbirth, and the \u00aaprobable gestational age\u00ba of the fetus, those casesare inconsistent with Roe's acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life, and are overruled. Requiring that the woman be in-formed of the availability of information relating to the consequences tothe fetus does not interfere with a constitutional right of privacy be-tween a pregnant woman and her physician, since the doctor-patientrelation is derivative of the woman's position, and does not underlie or override the abortion right. Moreover, the physician's First Amend-ment rights not to speak are implicated only as part of the practice ofmedicine, which is licensed and regulated by the State. There is noevidence here that requiring a doctor to give the required informationwould amount to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.The premise behind Akron I 's invalidation of a waiting period between the provision of the information deemed necessary to informed consentand the performance of an abortion, 462 U. S., at 450, is also wrong.Although \u00a7 3205's 24-hour waiting period may make some abortionsmore expensive and less convenient, it cannot be said that it is invalid505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 839 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Syllabus on the present record and in the context of this facial challenge. Pp. 881\u00b1887. 2. Section 3206's one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass procedure are constitutional. See, e. g., Ohio v.Akron Center for Re- produc tive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 510\u00b1519. Pp. 899\u00b1900. Justice Blackmun concluded that application of the strict scrutiny standard of review required by this Court's abortion precedents resultsin the invalidation of all the challenged provisions in the Pennsylvaniastatute, including the reporting requirements, and therefore concurredin the judgment that the requirement that a pregnant woman reporther reasons for failing to provide spousal notice is unconstitutional.Pp. 930, 934\u00b1936. The Chief Justice, joined by Justice White, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas, concluded that: 1. Although Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113, is not directly implicated by the Pennsylvania statute, which simply regulates and does not prohibitabortion, a reexamination of the \u00aafundamental right\u00ba Roe accorded to a woman's decision to abort a fetus, with the concomitant requirementthat any state regulation of abortion survive \u00aastrict scrutiny,\u00ba id.,at 154\u00b1156, is warranted by the confusing and uncertain state of thisCourt's post- Roe decisional law. A review of post- Roe cases demon- strates both that they have expanded upon Roe in imposing increasingly greater restrictions on the States, see Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), and that the Court has become increasingly more divided,none of the last three such decisions having commanded a majority opin-ion, see Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, 417; Webster v.Reproduc tive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490. This confusion and uncertainty complicated the task of the Court of Appeals, which concluded that the \u00aaundue burden\u00bastandard adopted by Justice O\u0092Connor inWebster and Hodgson gov- erns the present cases. Pp. 944\u00b1951. 2. The Roe Court reached too far when it analogized the right to abort a fetus to the rights involved in Pierce v.Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510; Meyer v.Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390; Loving v.Virginia, 388 U. S. 1; and Griswold v.Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, and thereby deemed the right to abortion to be \u00aafundamental.\u00ba None of these decisions en-dorsed an all-encompassing \u00aaright of privacy,\u00ba as Roe, supra, at 152\u00b1153, claimed. Because abortion involves the purposeful termination of po-tential life, the abortion decision must be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the rights protected in the earlier cases under therubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy. And the historicaltraditions of the American people\u00d0as evidenced by the English common505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 840 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Syllabus law and by the American abortion statutes in existence both at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption and Roe's issuance\u00d0do not support the view that the right to terminate one's pregnancy is \u00aafunda-mental.\u00ba Thus, enactments abridging that right need not be subjectedto strict scrutiny. Pp. 951\u00b1953. 3. The undue burden standard adopted by the joint opinion of Jus- tices O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter has no basis in constitutional law and will not result in the sort of simple limitation, easily applied, which the opinion anticipates. To evaluate abortion regulations underthat standard, judges will have to make the subjective, unguided deter- mination whether the regulations place \u00aasubstantial obstacles\u00ba in thepath of a woman seeking an abortion, undoubtedly engendering a vari-ety of con\u00aficting views. The standard presents nothing more workablethan the trimester framework the joint opinion discards, and will allow the Court, under the guise of the Constitution, to continue to impartits own preferences on the States in the form of a complex abortioncode. Pp. 964\u00b1966. 4. The correct analysis is that set forth by the plurality opinion in Webster, supra: A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, but States may regulateabortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state in-terest. P. 966. 5. Section 3205's requirements are rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in assuring that a woman's consent to an abortionbe fully informed. The requirement that a physician disclose certaininformation about the abortion procedure and its risks and alternativesis not a large burden and is clearly related to maternal health and theState's interest in informed consent. In addition, a State may ration-ally decide that physicians are better quali\u00aeed than counselors to impartthis information and answer questions about the abortion alternatives'medical aspects. The requirement that information be provided aboutthe availability of paternal child support and state-funded alternativesis also related to the State's informed consent interest and furthers the State's interest in preserving unborn life. That such information mightcreate some uncertainty and persuade some women to forgo abortionsonly demonstrates that it might make a difference and is therefore rele-vant to a woman's informed choice. In light of this plurality's rejectionofRoe's \u00aafundamental right\u00ba approach to this subject, the Court's con- trary holding in Thornburgh is not controlling here. For the same rea- son, this Court's previous holding invalidating a State's 24-hour manda-tory waiting period should not be followed. The waiting period helpsensure that a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, andrationally furthers the State's legitimate interest in and505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 841 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Syllabus in unborn life. It may delay, but does not prohibit, abortions; and both it and the informed consent provisions do not apply in medical emergen-cies. Pp. 966\u00b1970. 6. The statute's parental consent provision is entirely consistent with this Court's previous decisions involving such requirements. See, e. g., Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476. It is reasonably designed to further the State's importantand legitimate interest \u00aain the welfare of its young citizens, whose im-maturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impairtheir ability to exercise their rights wisely.\u00ba Hodgson, supra, at 444. Pp. 970\u00b1971. 7. Section 3214(a)'s requirement that abortion facilities \u00aele a report on each abortion is constitutional because it rationally furthers the State'slegitimate interests in advancing the state of medical knowledge con-cerning maternal health and prenatal life, in gathering statistical infor-mation with respect to patients, and in ensuring compliance with otherprovisions of the Act, while keeping the reports completely con\u00aedential.Public disclosure of other reports made by facilities receiving publicfunds\u00d0those identifying the facilities and any parent, subsidiary, or af-\u00aeliated organizations, \u00a7 3207(b), and those revealing the total number ofabortions performed, broken down by trimester, \u00a7 3214(f)\u00d0are ration-ally related to the State's legitimate interest in informing taxpayers asto who is bene\u00aeting from public funds and what services the funds aresupporting; and records relating to the expenditure of public funds aregenerally available to the public under Pennsylvania law. Pp. 976\u00b1977. Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice Thomas, concluded that a woman's decision to abort her unborn child is not a constitutionally protected \u00aaliberty\u00ba because (1) the Consti-tution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding tradi-tions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.See, e. g., Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 520 ( Scalia, J., concurring). The Pennsylvania statute should be up- held in its entirety under the rational basis test. Pp. 979\u00b1981.

I Liberty \u00aends no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects awoman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that de\u00aenition of liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae, the United States, as it has done in \u00aeve other cases in thelast decade, again asks us to overrule Roe. See Brief for Respondents 104\u00b1117; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8. At issue in these cases are \u00aeve provisions of the Penn- sylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, as amended in 1988and 1989. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3203\u00b13220 (1990). Relevantportions of the Act are set forth in the Appendix. Infra, at 902. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortiongive her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure,and speci\u00aees that she be provided with certain informationat least 24 hours before the abortion is performed. \u00a7 3205.For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the in-formed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judi-cial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannotobtain a parent's consent. \u00a7 3206. Another provision of theAct requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a marriedwoman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicatingthat she has noti\u00aeed her husband of her intended abortion.\u00a7 3209. The Act exempts compliance with these three re-quirements in the event of a \u00aamedical emergency,\u00ba which isde\u00aened \u00a7\u00a7 3203, 3205(a), 3206(a),3209(c). In addition to the above provisions regulating theperformance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reportingrequirements on facilities that provide abortion services.\u00a7\u00a7 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Before any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners, who are \u00aeve abortion clinics and one physician representinghimself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortionservices, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctiverelief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional onits face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunc-tion against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here uncon-stitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsyl-vania's enforcement of them. 744 F. Supp. 1323 (ED Pa.1990). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit af\u00aermed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulationsexcept for the husband noti\u00aecation requirement. 947 F. 2d682 (1991). We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 1056 (1992). The Court of Appeals found it necessary to follow an elabo- rate course of reasoning even to identify the \u00aerst premise touse to determine whether the statute enacted by Pennsylva-nia meets constitutional standards. See 947 F. 2d, at 687\u00b1698. And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney forthe parties challenging the statute took the position thatnone of the enactments can be upheld without overrulingRoe v.Wade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\u00b16. We disagree with that analysis; but we acknowledge that our decisions after Roe cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Fur-ther, The Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the central holding of Roe and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. See post, at 944, 966. State and federal courts as well as legislaturesthroughout the Union must have guidance as they seek toaddress this subject in conformance with the Constitution.Given these premises, we \u00aend it imperative to review oncemore the principles that de\u00aene the rights of the woman andthe legitimate authority of the State respecting the termina-tion of pregnancies by abortion procedures. After considering the fundamental constitutional ques- tions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity,505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 846 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v.Wade should be retained and once again reaf\u00aermed. It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe's essential holding, the holding we reaf\u00aerm, has three parts.First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose tohave an abortion before viability and to obtain it withoutundue interference from the State. Before viability, theState's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibi-tion of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle tothe woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Secondis a con\u00aermation of the State's power to restrict abortionsafter fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for preg-nancies which endanger the woman's life or health. Andthird is the principle that the State has legitimate interestsfrom the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health ofthe woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.These principles do not contradict one another; and we ad-here to each. II Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to termi- nate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that no State shall\u00aadeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without dueprocess of law.\u00ba The contro lling word in the cases before us is \u00aaliberty.\u00ba Although a literal reading of the Clause mightsuggest that it governs only the procedures by which a Statemay deprive persons of liberty, for at least 105 years, sinceMugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 660\u00b1661 (1887), the Clause has been understood to contain a substantive component aswell, one \u00aabarring certain government actions regardless ofthe fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u00baDaniels v.Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986). As Justice Brandeis (joined by Justice Holmes) observed, \u00aa[d]espite ar-guments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive,it is settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 847 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Amendment applies to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. Thus all fundamental rights com-prised within the term liberty are protected by the FederalConstitution from invasion by the States.\u00ba Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927) (concurring opinion). \u00aa[T]he guaranties of usurpation and tyranny,'have in `become bulwarks also against arbitrarylegislation.' \u00ba Poe v.Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Har- lan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds) (quoting Hurtado v.California, 110 U. S. 516, 532 (1884)). The most familiar of the substantive liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are those recognized by the Billof Rights. We have held that the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment incorporates most of the Bill ofRights against the States. See, e. g., Duncan v.Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 147\u00b1148 (1968). It is tempting, as a means ofcurbing the discretion of federal judges, to suppose that lib-erty encompasses no more than those rights already guar-anteed to the individual against federal interference by theexpress provisions of the \u00aerst eight Amendments to theConstitution. See Adamson v.California, 332 U. S. 46, 68\u00b192 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting). But of course this Courthas never accepted that view. It is also tempting, for the same reason, to suppose that the Due Process Clause protects only those practices, de\u00aenedat the most speci\u00aec level, that were protected against gov-ernment interference by other rules of law when the Four-teenth Amendment was rati\u00aeed. See Michael H. v.Gerald D.,491 U. S. 110, 127\u00b1128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J. ). But such a view would be inconsistent with our law. It is apromise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personalliberty which the government may not enter. We have vin-dicated this principle before. Marriage is mentioned no-where in the Bill of Rights and interracial marriage was ille-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 848 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court gal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in \u00aending it to be an aspect of liberty protectedagainst state interference by the substantive component ofthe Due Process Clause in Loving v.Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967) (relying, in an opinion for eight Justices, on the DueProcess Clause). Similar examples may be found in Turner v.Sa\u00afey, 482 U. S. 78, 94\u00b199 (1987); in Carey v.Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 684\u00b1686 (1977); in Griswold v.Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481\u00b1482 (1965), as well as in the separate opinions of a majority of the Membersof the Court in that case, id.,at 486\u00b1488 (Goldberg, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Brennan, J., concurring) (expressly rely-ing on due process), id.,at J., (same), J. , concurring in judgment) (same); in Pierce v.Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534\u00b1535 (1925); and in Meyer v.Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399\u00b1403 (1923). Neither the Bill of Rights nor the speci\u00aec practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amend-ment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of lib-erty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U. S.Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: \u00aa[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the pre-cise terms of the speci\u00aec guarantees elsewhere providedin the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of iso-lated points pricked out in terms of the taking of prop-erty; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; theright to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreason-able searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rationalcontinuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedomfrom all substantial arbitrary impositions and purpose-less restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what areasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain in-terests require particularly careful scrutiny of the stateneeds asserted to justify their abridgment.\u00ba Poe v.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 849 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Ullman, supra, at 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds). Justice Harlan wrote these words in addressing an issue the full Court did not reach in Poe v.Ullman, but the Court adopted his position four Terms later in Griswold v.Connect- icut, supra. InGriswold, we held that the Constitution does not permit a State to forbid a married couple to usecontraceptives. That same freedom was later guaranteed,under the Equal Protection Clause, for unmarried couples.SeeEisenstadt v.Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972). Constitutional protection was extended to the sale and distribution of con-traceptives in Carey v.Population Services International, supra. It is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v.Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic deci-sions about family and parenthood, see Carey v.Population Services International, supra; Moore Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v.Nebraska, supra, as well as bodily integrity, see, e. g., Washington v.Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 221\u00b1222 (1990); Winston v.Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985); Rochin v.California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting theConstitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradi-tion courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Itsboundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policychoices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permitus to shrink from the duties of our of\u00aece. As Justice Har-lan observed: \u00aaDue process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 850 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court's decisions it has represented the balancewhich our Nation, built upon postulates of respect forthe liberty of the individual, has struck between thatliberty and the demands of organized society. If thesupplying of content to this Constitutional concept hasof necessity been a rational process, it certainly has notbeen one where judges have felt free to roam where un-guided speculation might take them. The balance ofwhich I speak is the balance struck by this country, hav-ing regard to what history teaches are the traditionsfrom which it developed as well as the traditions fromwhich it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A de-cision of this Court which radically departs from it couldnot long survive, while a decision which builds on whathas survived is likely to be sound. No formula couldserve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and re-straint.\u00ba Poe v.Ullman, 367 U. S., at 542 (opinion dis- senting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds). See also Rochin v.California, supra, at 171\u00b1172 (Frank- furter, J., writing for the Court) (\u00aaTo believe that this judicialexercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing `due proc-ess of law' at some \u00aexed stage of time or thought is to sug-gest that the most important aspect of constitutional adjudi-cation is a function for inanimate machines and not forjudges\u00ba). Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profoundmoral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy,even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals \u00aendabortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality,but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is tode\u00aene the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.The underlying constitutional issue is whether the State canresolve these philosophic questions in such a de\u00aenitive waythat a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 851 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rapeor incest. It is conventional constitutional doctrine that where rea- sonable people disagree the government can adopt one posi-tion or the other. See, e. g., Ferguson v.Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726 (1963); Williamson v.Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). That theorem, however, assumes a state of af-fairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protectedliberty. Thus, while some people might disagree aboutwhether or not the \u00afag should be saluted, or disagree aboutthe proposition that it may not be de\u00aeled, we have ruled thata State may not compel or enforce one view or the other.See West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943); Texas v.Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989). Our law affords constitutional protection to personal deci- sions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, familyrelationships, child rearing, and education. Carey v.Popu- lation Services International, 431 U. S., at 685. Our cases recognize \u00aathe right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into mat-ters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decisionwhether to bear or beget a child.\u00ba Eisenstadt v.Baird, supra, at 453 (emphasis in original). Our precedents \u00aahave respected the private realm of family life which the statecannot enter.\u00ba Prince v.Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944). These matters, involving the most intimate and per-sonal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices centralto personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the libertyprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart ofliberty is the right to de\u00aene one's own concept of existence,of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of humanlife. Beliefs about these matters could not de\u00aene the attri-butes of personhood were they formed under compulsion ofthe State.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 852 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's in- terest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, forthis reason: though the abortion decision may originatewithin the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than aphilosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an actfraught with consequences for others: for the woman whomust live with the implications of her decision; for the per-sons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse,family, and society which must confront the knowledge thatthese procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing shortof an act of violence against innocent human life; and, de-pending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that isaborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow thatthe State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That isbecause the liberty of the woman is at stake in a senseunique to the human condition and so unique to the law.The mother who carries a child to full term is subject toanxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she mustbear. That these sacri\u00aeces have from the beginning of thehuman race been endured by woman with a pride that enno-bles her in the eyes of others and gives to the infant a bondof love cannot alone be grounds for the State to insist shemake the sacri\u00aece. Her suffering is too intimate and per-sonal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vi-sion of the woman's role, however dominant that vision hasbeen in the course of our history and our culture. The des-tiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on herown conception of her spiritual imperatives and her placein society. It should be recognized, moreover, that in some critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character as thedecision to use contraception, to which Griswold v.Connecti- cut, Eisenstadt v.Baird, and Carey v.Population Services International afford constitutional protection. We have no doubt as to the correctness of those decisions. They support505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 853 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court the reasoning in Roe relating to the woman's liberty because they involve personal decisions concerning not only themeaning of procreation but also human responsibility and re-spect for it. As with abortion, reasonable people will havedifferences of opinion about these matters. One view isbased on such reverence for the wonder of creation that anypregnancy ought to be welcomed and carried to full term nomatter how dif\u00aecult it will be to provide for the child andensure its well-being. Another is that the inability to pro-vide for the nurture and care of the infant is a cruelty to thechild and an anguish to the parent. These are intimateviews with in\u00aenite variations, and their deep, personal char-acter underlay our decisions in Griswold, Eisenstadt, and Carey. The same concerns are present when the woman confronts the reality that, perhaps despite her attempts toavoid it, she has become pregnant. It was this dimension of personal liberty that Roe sought to protect, and its holding invoked the reasoning and thetradition of the precedents we have discussed, granting pro-tection to substantive liberties of the person. Roe was, of course, an extension of those cases and, as the decision itselfindicated, the separate States could act in some degree tofurther their own legitimate interests in protecting prenatallife. The extent to which the legislatures of the Statesmight act to outweigh the interests of the woman in choosingto terminate her pregnancy was a subject of debate both inRoe itself and in decisions following it. While we appreciate the weight of the arguments made on behalf of the State in the cases before us, arguments whichin their ultimate formulation conclude that Roe should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaf-\u00aerming the central holding of Roe are outweighed by the explication of individual liberty we have given combinedwith the force of stare decisis. We turn now to that doctrine.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 854 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court III A The obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity, and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit. With Car-dozo, we recognize that no judicial system could do society'swork if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it.See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149(1921). Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underly-ing our own Constitution requires such continuity over timethat a respect for precedent is, by de\u00aenition, indispensable.See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 1991 Jour-nal of Supreme Court History 13, 16. At the other extreme,a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicialruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that itsenforcement was for that very reason doomed. Even when the decision to overrule a prior case is not, as in the rare, latter instance, virtually foreordained, it is com-mon wisdom that the rule of stare decisis is not an \u00aainexora- ble command,\u00ba and certainly it is not such in every constitu-tional case, see Burnet v.Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405\u00b1411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). See alsoPayne v.Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 842 (1991) ( Souter, J. , joined by Kennedy, J. , concurring); Arizona v.Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984). Rather, when this Court reexaminesa prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by aseries of prudential and pragmatic considerations designedto test the consistency of overruling a prior decision withthe ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costsof reaf\u00aerming and overruling a prior case. Thus, for exam-ple, we may ask whether the rule has proven to be intolera-ble simply in defying practical workability, Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); whether the rule is sub- ject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardshipto the consequences of overruling and add inequity to thecost of repudiation, e. g., United States v.Title Ins. & Trust505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 855 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Co., 265 U. S. 472, 486 (1924); whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule nomore than a remnant of abandoned doctrine, see Patterson v.McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173\u00b1174 (1989); or whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differ-ently, as to have robbed the old rule of signi\u00aecant applicationor justi\u00aecation, e. g., Burnet, supra, at 412 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). So in this case we may enquire whether Roe's central rule has been found unworkable; whether the rule's limitation onstate power could be removed without serious inequity tothose who have relied upon it or signi\u00aecant damage to thestability of the society governed by it; whether the law'sgrowth in the intervening years has left Roe's central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society; and whetherRoe's premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevantor unjusti\u00aeable in dealing with the issue it addressed. 1 Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven \u00aaunworkable,\u00ba see Garcia v.San Antonio Metropoli- tan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985), represent- ing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state lawis unenforceable. While Roe has, of course, required judicial assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choiceguaranteed against government infringement, and althoughthe need for such review will remain as a consequence oftoday's decision, the required determinations fall within judi-cial competence. 2 The inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule's repudi- ation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably onthe rule's continued application. Since the classic case forweighing reliance heavily in favor of following the earlierrule occurs in the commercial context, see Payne v.Tennes-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 856 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court see, supra, at 828, where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity, it is no cause for surprise thatsome would \u00aend no reliance worthy of consideration in sup-port of Roe. While neither respondents nor their amici in so many words deny that the abortion right invites some relianceprior to its actual exercise, one can readily imagine an argu-ment stressing the dissimilarity of this case to one involvingproperty or contract. Abortion is customarily chosen as anunplanned response to the consequence of unplanned activityor to the failure of conventional birth control, and except onthe assumption that no intercourse would have occurred butforRoe's holding, such behavior may appear to justify no reliance claim. Even if reliance could be claimed on thatunrealistic assumption, the argument might run, any reliance interest would be de minimis. This argument would be premised on the hypothesis that reproductive planning couldtake virtually immediate account of any sudden restorationof state authority to ban abortions. To eliminate the issue of reliance that easily, however, one would need to limit cognizable reliance to speci\u00aec instancesof sexual activity. But to do this would be simply to refuseto face the fact that for two decades of economic and socialdevelopments, people have organized intimate relationshipsand made choices that de\u00aene their views of themselves andtheir places in society, in reliance on the availability of abor-tion in the event that contraception should fail. The abilityof women to participate equally in the economic and sociallife of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to con-trol their reproductive lives. See, e. g., R. Petchesky, Abor- tion and Woman's Choice 109, 133, n. 7 (rev. ed. 1990). TheConstitution serves human values, and while the effect ofreliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 857 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court 3 No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's doctrinal foot- ings weaker than they were in 1973. No development ofconstitutional law since the case was decided has implicitlyor explicitly left Roe behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking. It will be recognized, of course, that Roe stands at an in- tersection of two lines of decisions, but in whichever doc-trinal category one reads the case, the result for present pur-poses will be the same. The Roe Court itself placed its holding in the succession of cases most prominently exempli-\u00aeed by Griswold v.Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See Roe, 410 U. S., at 152\u00b1153. When it is so seen, Roe is clearly in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developmentshave neither disturbed, nor do they threaten to diminish, thescope of recognized protection accorded to the liberty relat-ing to intimate relationships, the family, and decisions aboutwhether or not to beget or bear a child. See, e. g., Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678 (1977); Moore v.East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977). Roe, however, may be seen not only as an exemplar of Griswold liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal af\u00aen-ity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power tomandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. If so,our cases since Roe accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying anyplenary override of individual liberty claims. Cruzan v.Di- rector, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278 (1990); cf., e. g., Riggins v.Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 135 (1992); Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990); see also, e. g., Rochin v.Califor- nia, 342 U. S. 165 (1952); Jacobson v.Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 24\u00b130 (1905). Finally, one could classify Roe assui generis. If the case is so viewed, then there clearly has been no erosion of itscentral determination.

See Webster, 492 U. S., at 521 ( Rehnquist, C. J. , joined by White and Kennedy, JJ. );id.,at 525\u00b1526 (O\u0092Connor, , concurring in part id., 537, 553 ( Blackmun, J. , joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part);id.,at 561\u00b1563 ( Stevens, J. , concurring in part and dissent- ing in part). Nor will courts building upon Roe be likely to hand down erroneous decisions as a consequence. Even on the assump-tion that the central holding of Roe was in error, that error would go only to the strength of the state interest in fetalprotection, not to the recognition afforded by the Constitu-tion to the woman's liberty. The latter aspect of the decision\u00aets comfortably within the framework of the Court's priordecisions, including Skinner v.Oklahoma ex rel. William- son, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); Griswold, supra; Loving v.Vir- ginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Eisenstadt v.Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972), the holdings of which are \u00aanot a series of isolatedpoints,\u00ba but mark a \u00aarational continuum.\u00ba Poe v.Ullman, 367 U. S., at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting). As we described in505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 859 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Carey v.Population Services International, supra, the lib- erty which encompasses those decisions \u00aaincludes `the interest in independence in making cer- tain kinds of important decisions.' While the outer lim-its of this aspect of [protected liberty] have not beenmarked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisionsthat an individual may make without unjusti\u00aeed gov-ernment interference are personal decisions `relatingto marriage, procreation, contraception, family relation-ships, and child rearing and education.' \u00ba 431 U. S., at684\u00b1685 (citations omitted). The soundness of this prong of the Roe analysis is apparent from a consideration of the alternative. If indeed the wom-an's interest in deciding whether to bear and beget a childhad not been recognized as in Roe, the State might as readily restrict a woman's right to choose to carry a pregnancy toterm as to terminate it, to further asserted state interestsin population control, or eugenics, for example. Yet Roe has been sensibly relied upon to counter any such suggestions.E. g., Arnold v.Board of Education of Escambia County, Ala., 880 F. 2d 305, 311 (CA11 1989) (relying upon Roe and concluding that government of\u00aecials violate the Constitutionby coercing a minor to have an abortion); Avery v.County of Burke, 660 F. 2d 111, 115 (CA4 1981) (county agency inducing teenage girl to undergo unwanted ster ilization on the basis of misrepresentation that she had sickle cell trait); see alsoIn re Quinlan, 70 N. J. 10, 355 A. 2d 647 (relying on Roe in \u00aending a right to terminate medical treatment), cert. deniedsub nom. Garger v.New Jersey, 429 U. S. 922 (1976)). In any event, because Roe's scope is con\u00aened by the fact of its concern with postconception potential life, a concern other-wise likely to be implicated only by some forms of contracep-tion protected independently under Griswold and later cases, any error in Roe is unlikely to have serious rami\u00aeca- tions in future cases.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 860 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court 4 We have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe's fac- tual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow forabortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than wastrue in 1973, see Akron I, supra, at 429, n. 11, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhatearlier. Compare Roe, 410 U. S., at 160, with Webster, supra, at 515\u00b1516 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. ); see Akron I,462 U. S., at 457, and n. 5 ( O\u0092Connor, J. , dissenting). But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the real-ization of competing interests, and the divergences from thefactual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity ofRoe's central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionallyadequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abor-tions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutionaljudgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs atapproximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some mo-ment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetalrespiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may con-tinue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done sinceRoe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, andnone supports an argument for overruling it. 5 The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it hasnot been unworkable. An entire generation has come of agefree to assume Roe's concept of liberty in de\u00aening the capac- ity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive deci-sions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal au-tonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant;505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 861 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of facthave rendered viability more or less appropriate as the pointat which the balance of interests tips. Within the bounds ofnormal stare decisis analysis, then, and subject to the consid- erations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argu-ment is for af\u00aerming Roe's central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not foroverruling it. B In a less signi\u00aecant case, stare decisis analysis could, and would, stop at the point we have reached. But the sustainedand widespread debate Roe has provoked calls for some com- parison between that case and others of comparable dimen-sion that have responded to national controversies and takenon the impress of the controversies addressed. Only twosuch decisional lines from the past century present them-selves for examination, and in each instance the resultreached by the Court accorded with the principles we applytoday. The \u00aerst example is that line of cases identi\u00aeed with Lochner v.New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), which imposed sub- stantive limitations on legislation limiting economic auton-omy in favor of health and welfare regulation, adopting, inJustice Holmes's view, the theory of laissez-faire. Id.,at 75 (dissenting opinion). The Lochner decisions were exempli- \u00aeed by Adkins v.Children's Hospital of District of Colum- bia, 261 U. S. 525 (1923), in which this Court held it to be an infringement of constitutionally protected liberty of contractto require the employers of adult women to satisfy minimumwage standards. Fourteen years later, West Coast Hotel Co. v.Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), signaled the demise of Lochner by overruling Adkins. In the meantime, the De- pression had come and, with it, the lesson that seemed un-mistakable to most people by 1937, that the interpretation ofcontractual freedom protected in Adkins rested on funda-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 862 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court mentally false factual assumptions about the capacity of a relatively unregulated market to satisfy minimal levels ofhuman welfare. See West Coast Hotel Co., supra, at 399. As Justice Jackson wrote of the constitutional crisis of 1937shortly before he came on the bench: \u00aaThe older world oflaissez faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead.\u00ba The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941).The facts upon which the earlier case had premised a consti-tutional resolution of social controversy had proven to be un-true, and history's demonstration of their untruth not onlyjusti\u00aeed but required the new choice of constitutional princi- ple that West Coast Hotel announced. Of course, it was true that the Court lost something by its misperception, or itslack of prescience, and the Court-packing crisis only magni-\u00aeed the loss; but the clear demonstration that the facts ofeconomic life were different from those previously assumedwarranted the repudiation of the old law. The second comparison that 20th century history invites is with the cases employing the separate-but-equal rulefor applying the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protectionguarantee. They began with Plessy v.Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), holding that legislatively mandated racial segre-gation in public transportation works no denial of equal pro-tection, rejecting the argument that racial separation en-forced by the legal machinery of American society treats theblack race as inferior. The Plessy Court considered \u00aathe underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist inthe assumption that the enforced separation of the two racesstamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If thisbe so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, butsolely because the colored race chooses to put that construc-tion upon it.\u00ba Id.,at 551. Whether, as a matter of histori- cal fact, the Justices in the Plessy majority believed this or not, see id.,at 557, 562 (Harlan, J., dissenting), this under- standing of the implication of segregation was the stated jus-ti\u00aecation for the Court's opinion. But this understanding of505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 863 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court the facts and the rule it was stated to justify were repudi- ated in Brown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (Brown I). As one commentator observed, the question be- fore the Court in Brown was \u00aawhether discrimination in- heres in that segregation which is imposed by law in thetwentieth century in certain speci\u00aec states in the AmericanUnion. And that question has meaning and can \u00aend an an-swer only on the ground of history and of common knowledgeabout the facts of life in the times and places aforesaid.\u00baBlack, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 YaleL. J. 421, 427 (1960). The Court in Brown addressed these facts of life by ob- serving that whatever may have been the understanding inPlessy 's time of the power of segregation to stigmatize those who were segregated with a \u00aabadge of inferiority,\u00ba itwas clear by 1954 that legally sanctioned segregation hadjust such an effect, to the point that racially separate publiceducational facilities were deemed inherently unequal. 347U. S., at 494\u00b1495. Society's understanding of the facts uponwhich a constitutional ruling was sought in 1954 was thusfundamentally different from the basis claimed for the deci-sion in 1896. While we think Plessy was wrong the day it was decided, see Plessy, supra, at 552\u00b1564 (Harlan, J., dis- senting), we must also recognize that the Plessy Court's ex- planation for its decision was so clearly at odds with the factsapparent to the Court in 1954 that the decision to reexaminePlessy was on this ground alone not only justi\u00aeed but required. West Coast Hotel and Brown each rested on facts, or an understanding of facts, changed from those which furnishedthe claimed justi\u00aecations for the earlier constitutional resolu-tions. Each case was comprehensible as the Court's re-sponse to facts that the country could understand, or hadcome to understand already, but which the Court of an ear-lier day, as its own declarations disclosed, had not been ableto perceive. As the decisions were thus comprehensible505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 864 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court they were also defensible, not merely as the victories of one doctrinal school over another by dint of numbers (victoriesthough they were), but as applications of constitutional prin-ciple to facts as they had not been seen by the Court before.In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changedcircumstances may impose new obligations, and the thought-ful part of the Nation could accept each decision to overrulea prior case as a response to the Court's constitutional duty. Because the cases before us present no such occasion it could be seen as no such response. Because neither the fac-tual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor our under- standing of it has changed (and because no other indicationof weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could notpretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justi\u00aeca-tion beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out dif-ferently from the Court of 1973. To overrule prior law forno other reason than that would run counter to the viewrepeated in our cases, that a decision to overrule should reston some special reason over and above the belief that a priorcase was wrongly decided. See , e. g., Mitchell v.W. T. G ran t Co., 416 U. S. 600, 636 (1974) (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\u00aaA basic change in the law upon a ground no \u00aermer than achange in our membership invites the popular misconceptionthat this institution is little different from the two politicalbranches of the Government. No misconception could domore lasting injury to this Court and to the system of lawwhich it is our abiding mission to serve\u00ba); Mapp v.Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 677 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). C The examination of the conditions justifying the repudia- tion of Adkins byWest Coast Hotel and Plessy byBrown is enough to suggest the terrible price that would have beenpaid if the Court had not overruled as it did. In the presentcases, however, as our analysis to this point makes clear, theterrible price would be paid for overruling. Our analysis505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 865 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court would not be complete, however, without explaining why overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an un- justi\u00aeable result under principles of stare decisis, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicialpower and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nationdedicated to the rule of law. To understand why this wouldbe so it is necessary to understand the source of this Court'sauthority, the conditions necessary for its preservation, andits relationship to the country's understanding of itself as aconstitutional Republic. The root of American governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by theConstitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and spe-ci\u00aecally upon this Court. As Americans of each succeedinggeneration are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support forits decisions by spending money and, except to a minor de-gree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees.The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product ofsubstance and perception that shows itself in the people'sacceptance of the Judiciary as \u00aet to determine what the Na-tion's law means and to declare what it demands. The underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution andthe lesser sources of legal principle on which the Courtdraws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions,and our contemporary understanding is such that a decisionwithout principled justi\u00aecation would be no judicial act at all. But even when justi\u00aecation is furnished by apposite legal principle, something more is required. Because notevery conscientious claim of principled justi\u00aecation will beaccepted as such, the justi\u00aecation claimed must be beyonddispute. The Court must take care to speak and act in waysthat allow people to accept its decisions on the terms theCourt claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not ascompromises with social and political pressures having, assuch, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 866 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court obliged to make. Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances inwhich their principled character is suf\u00aeciently plausible to beaccepted by the Nation. The need for principled action to be perceived as such is implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appel-late court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, ofcourse, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactoryexplanation in most cases. People understand that some ofthe Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that theCourt's Justices are sometimes able to perceive signi\u00aecant facts or to understand principles of law that eluded theirpredecessors and that justify departures from existing deci-sions. However upsetting it may be to those most directlyaffected when one judicially derived rule replaces another,the country can accept some correction of error without nec-essarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court. In two circumstances, however, the Court would almost certainly fail to receive the bene\u00aet of the doubt in overrulingprior cases. There is, \u00aerst, a point beyond which frequentoverruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court'sgood faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may informand justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that sucha decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as,at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong.There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly beimputed to prior Courts. If that limit should be exceeded,disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence thatjusti\u00aeable reexamination of principle had given way to drivesfor particular results in the short term. The legitimacy ofthe Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation. That \u00aerst circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the per-formance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case insuch a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive contro-versy re\u00afected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 867 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present wheneverthe Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the con-tending sides of a national controversy to end their nationaldivision by accepting a common mandate rooted in theConstitution. The Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus addressed the Nation only twice in our lifetime, in the deci-sions of Brown and Roe. But when the Court does act in this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedentialforce to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may bemere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceedfrom principles worthy of profound respect. But whateverthe premises of opposition may be, only the most convincingjusti\u00aecation under accepted standards of precedent could suf-\u00aece to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the \u00aerstwas anything but a surrender to political pressure, and anunjusti\u00aeed repudiation of the principle on which the Courtstaked its authority in the \u00aerst instance. So to overruleunder \u00aere in the absence of the most compe lling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court'slegitimacy beyond any serious question. Cf. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955) (Brown II) (\u00aa[I]t should go without saying that the vitality of th[e] con-stitutional principles [announced in Brown I, ] cannot be al- lowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them\u00ba). The country's loss of con\u00aedence in the Judiciary would be underscored by an equally certain and equally reasonablecondemnation for another fa iling in overruling unnecessarily and under pressure. Some cost will be paid by anyone whoapproves or implements a constitutional decision where it isunpopular, or who refuses to work to undermine the decisionor to force its reversal. The price may be criticism or ostra-cism, or it may be violence. An extra price will be paid bythose who themselves disapprove of the decision's results505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 868 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court when viewed outside of constitutional terms, but who never- theless struggle to accept it, because they respect the ruleof law. To all those who will be so tested by following, theCourt implicitly undertakes to remain steadfast, lest in theend a price be paid for nothing. The promise of constancy,once given, binds its maker for as long as the power to standby the decision survives and the understanding of the issuehas not changed so fundamentally as to render the commit-ment obsolete. From the obligation of this promise thisCourt cannot and should not assume any exemption whenduty requires it to decide a case in conformance with theConstitution. A w illing breach of it would be nothing less than a breach of faith, and no Court that broke its faith withthe people could sensibly expect credit for principle in thedecision by which it did that. It is true that diminished legitimacy may be restored, but only slowly. Unlike the political branches, a Court thusweakened could not seek to regain its position with a newmandate from the voters, and even if the Court could some-how go to the polls, the loss of its principled character couldnot be retrieved by the casting of so many votes. Like thecharacter of an individual, the legitimacy of the Court mustbe earned over time. So, indeed, must be the character ofa Nation of people who aspire to live according to the ruleof law. Their belief in themselves as such a people is notreadily separable from their understanding of the Court in-vested with the authority to decide their constitutional casesand speak before all others for their constitutional ideals. Ifthe Court's legitimacy should be undermined, then, so wouldthe country be in its very ability to see itself through itsconstitutional ideals. The Court's concern with legitimacyis not for the sake of the Court, but for the sake of the Nationto which it is responsible. The Court's duty in the present cases is clear. In 1973, it confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 869 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it pro- vided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteedby the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new so-cial consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness isno less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the deci-sion, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense.A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the ex- isting circumstances would address error, if error there was,at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to theCourt's legitimacy, and to the Nation's commitment to therule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the es-sence of Roe's original decision, and we do so today. IV From what we have said so far it follows that it is a consti- tutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to termi-nate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision inRoe was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited,however, that from the outset the State cannot show its con-cern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetaldevelopment the State's interest in life has suf\u00aecient force sothat the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy canbe restricted. That brings us, of course, to the point where much criti- cism has been directed at Roe, a criticism that always inheres when the Court draws a speci\u00aec rule from what in the Con-stitution is but a general standard. We conclude, however,that the urgent claims of the woman to retain the ultimatecontrol over her destiny and her body, claims implicit in themeaning of liberty, require us to perform that function. Lib- erty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear.And it falls to us to give some real substance to the woman'sliberty to determine whether to carry her pregnancy to fullterm.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 870 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that before that time the woman has a right to choose to termi-nate her pregnancy. We adhere to this principle for tworeasons. First, as we have said, is the doctrine of stare deci- sis. Any judicial act of line-drawing may seem somewhat arbitrary, but Roe was a reasoned statement, elaborated with great care. We have twice reaf\u00aermed it in the face of greatopposition. See Thornburgh v.American College of Obste- tricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 759; Akron I , 462 U. S., at 419\u00b1420. Although we must overrule those parts ofThornburgh and Akron I which, in our view, are inconsistent with Roe's statement that the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn, seeinfra, at 882\u00b1883, the central premise of those cases repre- sents an unbroken commitment by this Court to the essentialholding of Roe. It is that premise which we reaf\u00aerm today. The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibil- ity of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, sothat the independent existence of the second life can in rea-son and all fairness be the object of state protection that nowoverrides the rights of the woman. See Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S., at 163. Consistent with other constitutional norms,legislatures may draw lines which appear arbitrary withoutthe necessity of offering a justi\u00aecation. But courts may not.We must justify the lines we draw. And there is no lineother than viability which is more workable. To be sure, aswe have said, there may be some medical developments thataffect the precise point of viability, see supra, at 860, but this is an imprecision within tolerable limits given that themedical community and all those who must apply its discov-eries will continue to explore the matter. The viability linealso has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. Insome broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails toact before viability has consented to the State's interventionon behalf of the developing child.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 871 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before via- bility is the most central principle of Roe v.Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce. On the other side of the equation is the interest of the State in the protection of potential life. The Roe Court rec- ognized the State's \u00aaimportant and legitimate interest inprotecting the potentiality of human life.\u00ba Roe, supra, at 162. The weight to be given this state interest, not thestrength of the woman's interest, was the dif\u00aecult questionfaced in Roe. We do not need to say whether each of us, had we been Members of the Court when the valuation of the state interest came before it as an original matter, wouldhave concluded, as the Roe Court did, that its weight is insuf- \u00aecient to justify a ban on abortions prior to viability evenwhen it is subject to certain exceptions. The matter is notbefore us in the \u00aerst instance, and coming as it does afternearly 20 years of litigation in Roe's wake we are satis\u00aeed that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that mustbe accorded to its holding. And we have concluded that theessential holding of Roe should be reaf\u00aermed. Yet it must be remembered that Roe v.Wade speaks with clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but alsothe State's \u00aaimportant and legitimate interest in potentiallife.\u00ba Roe, supra, at 163. That portion of the decision in Roe has been given too little acknowledgment and implemen- tation by the Court in its subsequent cases. Those casesdecided that any regulation touching upon the abortion deci-sion must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only ifdrawn in narrow terms to further a compe lling state i nter- est. See, e. g., Akron I, supra, at 427. Not all of the cases decided under that formulation can be reconciled with theholding in Roe itself that the State has legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potentiallife within her. In resolving this tension, we choose to relyupon Roe, as against the later cases.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:02 PAGES OPINPGT 872 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. Roe established a trimester framework to govern abortion regulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct, al-most no regulation at all is permitted during the \u00aerst trimes-ter of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect the wom-an's health, but not to further the State's interest in potentiallife, are permitted during the second trimester; and duringthe third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions arepermitted provided the life or health of the mother is not atstake. Roe, supra, at 163\u00b1166. Most of our cases since Roe have involved the application of rules derived from the tri-mester framework. See, e. g., Thornburgh v.American Col- lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra; Akron I,supra. The trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinateto the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choiceexists in theory but not in fact. We do not agree, however,that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish thisobjective. A framework of this rigidity was unnecessaryand in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted theState's permissible exercise of its powers. Though the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at allfollow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to en-sure that this choice is thoughtful and informed. Even inthe earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rulesand regulations designed to encourage her to know thatthere are philosophic and social arguments of great weightthat can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the preg-nancy to full term and that there are procedures and institu-tions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as acertain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses toraise the child herself. \u00aa `[T]he Constitution does not forbida State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from ex-pressing a preference for normal childbirth.' \u00ba Webster v.

It follows that States are free to enact laws to provide areasonable framework for a woman to make a decision thathas such profound and lasting meaning. This, too, we \u00aendconsistent with Roe's central premises, and indeed the inevi- table consequence of our holding that the State has an inter-est in protecting the life of the unborn. We reject the trimester framework, which we do not con- sider to be part of the essential holding of Roe. See Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 518 (opinion of C. J. );id.,at 529 ( O\u0092Connor, J. , concurring in in judgment) (describing the trimesterframework as \u00aaproblematic\u00ba). Measures aimed at ensuringthat a woman's choice contemplates the consequences for thefetus do not necessarily interfere with the right recognized inRoe, although those measures have been found to be incon- sistent with the rigid trimester framework announced in thatcase. A logical reading of the central holding in Roe itself, and a necessary reconciliation of the liberty of the womanand the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life, re-quire, in our view, that we abandon the trimester frameworkas a rigid prohibition on all previability regulation aimed atthe protection of fetal life. The trimester framework suf-fers from these basic \u00afaws: in its formulation it misconceivesthe nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in practiceit undervalues the State's interest in potential life, as recog-nized in Roe. As our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized, not every law which makes a rightmore dif\u00aecult to exercise is, ipso facto, an infringement of that right. An example clari\u00aees the point. We have heldthat not every ballot access limitation amounts to an in-fringement of the right to vote. Rather, the States aregranted substantial \u00afexibility in establishing the frameworkwithin which voters choose the candidates for whom they505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 874 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. wish to vote. Anderson v.Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983); Norman v.Reed, 502 U. S. 279 (1992). The abortion right is similar. Numerous forms of state regulation might have the incidental effect of increasing thecost or decreasing the availability of medical care, whetherfor abortion or any other medical procedure. The fact thata law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed tostrike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of makingit more dif\u00aecult or more expensive to procure an abortioncannot be enough to invalidate it. Only where state regula-tion imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heartof the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. SeeHodgson v.Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417, 458\u00b1459 (1990) J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U.

For the most part, the Court's early abortion cases ad- hered to this view. In Maher v.Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473\u00b1474 (1977), the Court explained: \u00aa Roe did not declare an unquali- \u00aeed `constitutional right to an abortion,' as the DistrictCourt seemed to think. Rather, the right protects thewoman from unduly burdensome interference with her free-dom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy.\u00ba See505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 875 Cite as: 505 U.

These considerations of the nature of the abortion right illustrate that it is an overstatement to describe it as a rightto decide whether to have an abortion \u00aawithout interferencefrom the State.\u00ba Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976). All abortion regulations interfere to some degree with a woman's ability to decidewhether to terminate her pregnancy. It is, as a conse-quence, not surprising that despite the protestations con-tained in the original Roe opinion to the effect that the Court was not recognizing an absolute right, 410 U. S., at 154\u00b1155,the Court's experience applying the trimester frameworkhas led to the striking down of some abortion regulationswhich in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate deci-sion. Those decisions went too far because the right recog-nized by Roe is a right \u00aato be free from unwarranted govern- mental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting aperson as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\u00baEisenstadt v.Baird, 405 U. S., at 453. Not all governmental intrusion is of necessity unwarranted; and that brings us tothe other basic \u00afaw in the trimester framework: even inRoe's terms, in practice it undervalues the State's interest in the potential life within the woman. Roe v.Wade was express in its recognition of the State's \u00aaimportant and legitimate interest[s] in preserving and pro-505us3u117 07-09-96 PAGES OPINPGT 876 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. tecting the health of the pregnant woman [and] in protecting the potentiality of human life.\u00ba 410 U. S., at 162. The tri-mester framework, however, does not ful\u00aell Roe's own prom- ise that the State has an interest in protecting fetal life orpotential life. Roe began the contradiction by using the tri- mester framework to forbid any regulation of abortion de-signed to advance that interest before viability. Id.,at 163. Before viability, Roe and subsequent cases treat all govern- mental attempts to in\u00afuence a woman's decision on behalf ofthe potential life within her as unwarranted. This treat-ment is, in our judgment, incompatible with the recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential lifethroughout pregnancy. Cf. Webster, 492 U. S., at 519 (opin- ion of Rehnquist, C. J. );Akron I, supra, at 461 ( O\u0092Connor, J., dissenting). The very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regula-tions must be deemed unwarranted. Not all burdens on theright to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy will beundue. In our view, the undue burden standard is the ap-propriate means of reconc iling the St ate's interest with the woman's constitutionally protected liberty. The concept of an undue burden has been ut ilized by the Court as well as individual Members of the Court, includingtwo of us, in ways that could be considered inconsistent.See, e. g., Hodgson v.Minnesota, supra, at 459\u00b1461 in judgment); Akron II, at 519\u00b1520 (opinion of v.Roe, supra, at 473; Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S. 438, 446 (1977); Bellotti I, supra, at 147. Be- cause we set forth a standard of general application to whichwe intend to adhere, it is important to clarify what is meantby an undue burden.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 877 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. A \u00aending of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclu- sion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of plac-ing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking anabortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purposeis invalid because the means chosen by the State to furtherthe interest in potential life must be calculated to inform thewoman's free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which,while furthering the interest in potential life or some othervalid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantialobstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considereda permissible means of serving its legitimate ends. To the extent that the opinions of the Court or of individual Justicesuse the undue burden standard in a manner that is inconsist-ent with this analysis, we set out what in our view should bethe contro lling st andard. Cf. McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991) (attempting \u00aato de\u00aene the doctrine of abuseof the writ with more precision\u00ba after acknowledging tensionamong earlier cases). In our considered judgment, an undueburden is an unconstitutional burden. See Akron II, 497 U. S., at 519\u00b1520 (opinion of Kennedy , J.). Understood an- other way, we answer the question, left open in previousopinions discussing the undue burden formulation, whethera law designed to further the State's interest in fetal lifewhich imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision be-fore fetal viability could be constitutional. See, e. g., Akron I,462 U. S., at 462\u00b1463 ( O\u0092Connor, J. , dissenting). The answer is no. Some guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not aright to be insulated from all others in doing so. Regula-tions which do no more than create a structural mechanismby which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor,may express profound respect for the life of the unborn arepermitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the wom-an's exercise of the right to choose. See infra, at 899\u00b1900 (addressing Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement).505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 878 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state meas- ure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abor-tion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal. Regula-tions designed to foster the health of a woman seeking anabortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden. Even when jurists reason from shared premises, some dis- agreement is inevitable. Compare Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 482\u00b1497 ( Kennedy, J. , concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), with id.,at 458\u00b1460 ( O\u0092Connor, J. , con- curring in part and concurring in judgment in part). Thatis to be expected in the application of any legal standardwhich must accommodate life's complexity. We do not ex-pect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burdenstandard. We give this summary: (a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe v.Wade while at the same time accommodating the State's profoundinterest in potential life, we will employ the undue burdenanalysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden ex-ists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purposeor effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of awoman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. (b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the State's profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the State may take measures toensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measuresdesigned to advance this interest will not be invalidated aslong as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choosechildbirth over abortion. These measures must not be anundue burden on the right. (c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seek-ing an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that havethe purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle toa woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden onthe right.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 879 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court (d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of Roe v.Wade, and we reaf\u00aerm that holding. Regardless of whether exceptions are madefor particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit anywoman from making the ultimate decision to terminate herpregnancy before viability. (e) We also reaf\u00aerm Roe's holding that \u00aasubsequent to via- bility, the State in promoting its interest in the potentialityof human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe,abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medicaljudgment, for the preservation of the life or health of themother.\u00ba Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S., at 164\u00b1165. These principles control our assessment of the Pennsylva- nia statute, and we now turn to the issue of the validity ofits challenged provisions. V The Court of Appeals applied what it believed to be the undue burden standard and upheld each of the provisionsexcept for the husband noti\u00aecation requirement. We agree generally with this conclusion, but re\u00aene the undue burdenanalysis in accordance with the principles articulated above.We now consider the separate statutory sections at issue. A Because it is central to the operation of various other re- quirements, we begin with the statute's de\u00aenition of medicalemergency. Under the statute, a medical emergency is \u00aa[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medicalcondition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the im-mediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death orfor which a delay will create serious risk of substantialand irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\u00ba18 \u00a7 3203 (1990).505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 880 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court Petitioners argue that the de\u00aenition is too narrow, con- tending that it forecloses the possibility of an immediateabortion despite some signi\u00aecant health risks. If the con-tention were correct, we would be required to invalidate therestrictive operation of the provision, for the essential hold-ing of Roe forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her preg-nancy would constitute a threat to her health. 410 U. S.,at 164. See also Harris v.McRae, 448 U. S., at 316. The District Court found that there were three serious conditions which would not be covered by the statute: pre- eclampsia, inevitable abortion, and premature rupturedmembrane. 744 F. Supp., at 1378. Yet, as the Court of Ap-peals observed, 947 F. 2d, at 700\u00b1701, it is undisputed thatunder some circumstances each of these conditions could leadto an illness with substantial and irreversible consequences.While the de\u00aenition could be interpreted in an unconstitu-tional manner, the Court of Appeals construed the phrase\u00aaserious risk\u00ba to include those circumstances. Id., at 701. It stated: \u00aa[W]e read the medical emergency exception asintended by the Pennsylvania legislature to assure that com-pliance with its abortion regulations would not in any waypose a signi\u00aecant threat to the life or health of a woman.\u00baIbid. As we said in Brockett v.Spokane Arcades, Inc., S. 491, . . . we defer to theconstruction of a state statute given it by the lower federalcourts.\u00ba Indeed, we have said that we will defer to lowercourt interpretations of state law unless they amount to\u00aaplain\u00ba error. Palmer v.Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 118 (1943). This \u00aa `re\u00afect[s] our belief that district courts and courts ofappeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret thelaws of their respective States.' \u00ba Frisby v.Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 482 (1988) (citation omitted). We adhere to thatcourse today, and conclude that, as construed by the Court ofAppeals, the medical emergency de\u00aenition imposes no undueburden on a abortion right.505us3u117 07-09-96 PAGES OPINPGT 881 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. B We next consider the informed consent requirement. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3205 (1990). Except in a medical emer-gency, the statute requires that at least 24 hours before per-forming an abortion a physician inform the woman of thenature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion andof childbirth, and the \u00aaprobable gestational age of the unbornchild.\u00ba The physician or a quali\u00aeed nonphysician must in-form the woman of the availability of printed materials pub-lished by the State describing the fetus and providing infor-mation about medical assistance for childbirth, informationabout child support from the father, and a list of agencieswhich provide adoption and other services as alternativesto abortion. An abortion may not be performed unless thewoman certi\u00aees in writing that she has been informed of theavailability of these printed materials and has been providedthem if she chooses to view them. Our prior decisions establish that as with any medical pro- cedure, the State may require a woman to give her writteninformed consent to an abortion. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67. In this respect, the statute is unexceptional. Petitioners challenge the stat-ute's de\u00aenition of informed consent because it includes theprovision of speci\u00aec information by the doctor and the man-datory 24-hour waiting period. The conclusions reached bya majority of the Justices in the separate opinions \u00aeled todayand the undue burden standard adopted in this opinion re-quire us to overrule in part some of the Court's past deci-sions, decisions driven by the trimester framework's prohibi-tion of all previability regulations designed to further theState's interest in fetal life. InAkron I, 462 U. S. 416 (1983), we invalidated an ordi- nance which required that a woman seeking an abortion beprovided by her physician with speci\u00aec information \u00aade-signed to in\u00afuence the woman's informed choice described505us3u117 07-09-96 PAGES OPINPGT 882 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. theAkron I holding in Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 762, there were two purported \u00afaws in the Akron ordinance: the infor-mation was designed to dissuade the woman from having anabortion and the ordinance imposed \u00aaa rigid requirementthat a speci\u00aec body of information be given in all cases, irre-spective of the particular needs of the patient . . . .\u00ba Ibid. To the extent Akron I and Thornburgh \u00aend a constitu- tional violation when the government requires, as it doeshere, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information aboutthe nature of the procedure, the attendant health risks and those of childbirth, and the \u00aaprobable gestational age\u00ba of thefetus, those cases go too far, are inconsistent with Roe's ac- knowledgment of an important interest in potential life, andare overruled. This is clear even on the very terms ofAkron I and Thornburgh. Those decisions, along with Dan- forth, recognize a substantial government interest justifying a requirement that a woman be apprised of the health risksof abortion and childbirth. E. g., Danforth, supra, at 66\u00b167. It cannot be questioned that psychological well-being is afacet of health. Nor can it be doubted that most womenconsidering an abortion would deem the impact on the fetusrelevant, if not dispositive, to the decision. In attemptingto ensure that a woman apprehend the full consequences ofher decision, the State furthers the legitimate purpose ofreducing the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, onlyto discover later, with devastating psychological conse-quences, that her decision was not fully informed. If theinformation the State requires to be made available to thewoman is truthful and not misleading, the requirement maybe permissible. We also see no reason why the State may not require doc- tors to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the availabil-ity of materials relating to the consequences to the fetus,even when those consequences have no direct relation to herhealth. An example illustrates the point. We would think505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 883 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. it constitutional for the State to require that in order for there to be informed consent to a kidney transplant opera-tion the recipient must be supplied with information aboutrisks to the donor as well as risks to himself or herself. Arequirement that the physician make available informationsimilar to that mandated by the statute here was describedinThornburgh as \u00aaan outright attempt to wedge the Com- monwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacyof the informed-consent dialogue between the woman andher physician.\u00ba 476 U. S., at 762. We conclude, however,that informed choice need not be de\u00aened in such narrow terms that all considerations of the effect on the fetus aremade irrelevant. As we have made clear, we depart fromthe holdings of Akron I and Thornburgh to the extent that we permit a State to further its legitimate goal of protectingthe life of the unborn by enacting legislation aimed at ensur-ing a decision that is mature and informed, even when in sodoing the State expresses a preference for childbirth overabortion. In short, requiring that the woman be informedof the availability of information relating to fetal develop-ment and the assistance available should she decide to carrythe pregnancy to full term is a reasonable measure to ensurean informed choice, one which might cause the woman tochoose childbirth over abortion. This requirement cannotbe considered a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion,and, it follows, there is no undue burden. Our prior cases also suggest that the \u00aastraitjacket,\u00ba Thornburgh, supra, at 762 (quoting Danforth, supra, at 67, n. 8), of particular information which must be given in eachcase interferes with a constitutional right of privacy betweena pregnant woman and her physician. As a preliminarymatter, it is worth noting that the statute now before us doesnot require a physician to comply with the informed consentprovisions \u00aaif he or she can demonstrate by a preponderanceof the evidence, that he or she reasonably believed that fur-nishing the information would have resulted in a severely505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 884 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the pa- tient.\u00ba 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3205 (1990). In this respect, thestatute does not prevent the physician from exercising his orher medical judgment. Whatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter, in the present context it isderivative of the woman's position. The doctor-patient rela-tion does not underlie or override the two more generalrights under which the abortion right is justi\u00aeed: the rightto make family decisions and the right to physical autonomy.On its own, the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts. Thus, arequirement that a doctor give a woman certain informationas part of obtaining her consent to an abortion is, for consti-tutional purposes, no different from a requirement that adoctor give certain speci\u00aec information about any medicalprocedure. All that is left of petitioners' argument is an asserted First Amendment right of a physician not to provide informationabout the risks of abortion, and childbirth, in a mannermandated by the State. To be sure, the physician's FirstAmendment rights not to speak are implicated, see Wooley v.Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977), but only as part of the practice of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and reg-ulation by the State, cf. Whalen v.Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 603 (1977). We see no constitutional in\u00aermity in the require-ment that the physician provide the information mandatedby the State here. The Pennsylvania statute also requires us to reconsider the holding in Akron I that the State may not require that a physician, as opposed to a quali\u00aeed assistant, provide infor-mation relevant to a woman's informed consent. 462 U. S.,at 448. Since there is no evidence on this record that requir-ing a doctor to give the information as provided by the stat-ute would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacleto a woman seeking an abortion, we conclude that it is not505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 885 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. an undue burden. Our cases re\u00afect the fact that the Consti- tution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particu-lar functions may be performed only by licensed profession-als, even if an objective assessment might suggest that thosesame tasks could be performed by others. See Williamson v.Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). Thus, we uphold the provision as a reasonable means to ensure thatthe woman's consent is informed. Our analysis of Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period be- tween the provision of the information deemed necessary toinformed consent and the performance of an abortion under the undue burden standard requires us to reconsider thepremise behind the decision in Akron I invalidating a paral- lel requirement. In Akron I we said: \u00aaNor are we convinced that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decisionbe informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hourdelay as a matter of course.\u00ba 462 U. S., at 450. We considerthat conclusion to be wrong. The idea that important deci-sions will be more informed and deliberate if they followsome period of re\u00afection does not strike us as unreasonable,particularly where the statute directs that important infor-mation become part of the background of the decision. Thestatute, as construed by the Court of Appeals, permits avoid-ance of the waiting period in the event of a medical emer-gency and the record evidence shows that in the vast major-ity of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciablehealth risk. In theory, at least, the waiting period is a rea-sonable measure to implement the State's interest in protect-ing the life of the unborn, a measure that does not amountto an undue burden. Whether the mandatory 24-hour waiting period is nonethe- less invalid because in practice it is a substantial obstacleto a woman's choice to terminate her pregnancy is a closerquestion. The \u00aendings of fact by the District Court indicatethat because of the distances many women must travel toreach an abortion provider, the practical effect will often be505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 886 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. a delay of much more than a day because the waiting period requires that a woman seeking an abortion make at least twovisits to the doctor. The District Court also found that inmany instances this will increase the exposure of womenseeking abortions to \u00aathe harassment and hostility of anti-abortion protestors demonstrating outside a clinic.\u00ba 744 F.Supp., at 1351. As a result, the District Court found thatfor those women who have the fewest \u00aenancial resources,those who must travel long distances, and those who havedif\u00aeculty explaining their whereabouts to husbands, employ-ers, or others, the 24-hour waiting period will be \u00aaparticu- larly burdensome.\u00ba Id.,at 1352. These \u00aendings are troubling in some respects, but they do not demonstrate that the waiting period constitutes anundue burden. We do not doubt that, as the District Courtheld, the waiting period has the effect of \u00aaincreasing the costand risk of delay of abortions,\u00ba id.,at 1378, but the District Court did not conclude that the increased costs and potentialdelays amount to substantial obstacles. Rather, applyingthe trimester framework's strict prohibition of all regulationdesigned to promote the State's interest in potential life be-fore viability, see id.,at 1374, the District Court concluded that the waiting period does not further the state \u00aainterestin maternal health\u00ba and \u00aainfringes the physician's discretionto exercise sound medical judgment,\u00ba id.,at 1378. Yet, as we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State ispermitted to enact persuasive measures which favor child-birth over abortion, even if those measures do not further ahealth interest. And while the waiting period does limit aphysician's discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason toinvalidate it. In light of the construction given the statute'sde\u00aenition of medical emergency by the Court of Appeals, andthe District Court's \u00aendings, we cannot say that the waitingperiod imposes a real health risk. We also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the \u00aaparticularly burdensome\u00ba effects of the waiting period505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 887 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court on some women require its invalidation. A particular bur- den is not of necessity a substantial obstacle. Whether aburden falls on a particular group is a distinct inquiry fromwhether it is a substantial obstacle even as to the women inthat group. And the District Court did not conclude thatthe waiting period is such an obstacle even for the womenwho are most burdened by it. Hence, on the record beforeus, and in the context of this facial challenge, we are notconvinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes anundue burden. We are left with the argument that the various aspects of the informed consent requirement are unconstitutional be-cause they place barriers in the way of abortion on demand.Even the broadest reading of Roe, however, has not sug- gested that there is a constitutional right to abortion on de-mand. See, e. g., Doe v.Bolton, 410 U. S., at 189. Rather, the right protected by Roe is a right to decide to terminate a pregnancy free of undue interference by the State. Be-cause the informed consent requirement facilitates the wiseexercise of that right, it cannot be classi\u00aeed as an interfer-ence with the right Roe protects. The informed consent re- quirement is not an undue burden on that right. C Section 3209 of Pennsylvania's abortion law provides, ex- cept in cases of medical emergency, that no physician shallperform an abortion on a married woman without receivinga signed statement from the woman that she has noti\u00aeed herspouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. Thewoman has the option of providing an alternative signedstatement certifying that her husband is not the man whoimpregnated her; that her husband could not be located; thatthe pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault whichshe has reported; or that the woman believes that notifyingher husband will cause him or someone else to in\u00afict bodilyinjury upon her.

The American Medical Association (AMA) has pub-lished a summary of the recent research in this \u00aeeld, whichindicates that in an average 12-month period in this country,approximately two m illion women are the victims of severe assaults by their male partners. In a 1985 survey, womenreported that nearly one of every eight husbands had as-saulted their wives during the past year. The AMA viewsthese \u00aegures as \u00aamarked underestimates,\u00ba because the na-ture of these incidents discourages women from reportingthem, and because surveys typically exclude the very poor,those who do not speak English well, and women who arehomeless or in institutions or hospitals when the survey isconducted. According to the AMA, \u00aa[r]esearchers on familyviolence agree that the true incidence of partner violence isprobably double the above estimates; or four m illion se verely assaulted women per year. Studies on prevalence suggestthat from one-\u00aefth to one-third of all women will be physi-cally assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their life-time.\u00ba AMA Council on Scienti\u00aec Affairs, Violence AgainstWomen 7 (1991) (emphasis in original). Thus on an averageday in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severelyassaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidentsinvolve sexual assault.

The limited research that has been conducted with respect to notifying one's husband about an abortion, although in-volving samples too small to be representative, also supportsthe District Court's \u00aendings of fact. The vast majority ofwomen notify their male partners of their decision to obtainan abortion. In many cases in which married women do notnotify their husbands, the pregnancy is the result of an ex-tramarital affair. Where the husband is the father, the pri-mary reason women do not notify their husbands is that thehusband and wife are experiencing marital dif\u00aeculties, oftenaccompanied by incidents of violence.

S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court functioning marriages, spouses discuss important intimate decisions such as whether to bear a child. But there aremillions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and psychological abuse at the hands oftheir husbands. Should these women become pregnant,they may have very good reasons for not wishing to informtheir husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion. Manymay have justi\u00aeable fears of physical abuse, but may be noless fearful of the consequences of reporting prior abuse tothe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Many may have a rea-sonable fear that notifying their husbands will provoke fur- ther instances of child abuse; these women are not exemptfrom \u00a7 3209's noti\u00aecation requirement. Many may fear dev-astating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands,including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, thedestruction of possessions, physical con\u00aenement to the home,the withdrawal of \u00aenancial support, or the disclosure of theabortion to family and friends. These methods of psycholog-ical abuse may act as even more of a deterrent to noti\u00aecationthan the possibility of physical violence, but women who arethe victims of the abuse are not exempt from \u00a7 3209's noti\u00ae-cation requirement. And many women who are pregnant asa result of sexual assaults by their husbands will be unable toavail themselves of the exception for spousal sexual assault,\u00a7 3209(b)(3), because the exception requires that the womanhave noti\u00aeed law enforcement authorities within 90 days ofthe assault, and her husband will be noti\u00aeed of her reportonce an investigation begins, \u00a7 3128(c). If anything in this\u00aeeld is certain, it is that victims of spousal sexual assault areextremely reluctant to report the abuse to the government;hence, a great many spousal rape victims will not be exemptfrom the noti\u00aecation requirement imposed by \u00a7 3209. The spousal noti\u00aecation requirement is thus likely to pre- vent a signi\u00aecant number of women from obtaining an abor-tion. It does not merely make abortions a little more dif\u00ae-cult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will impose505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 894 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that the signi\u00aecant number of women who fear for theirsafety and the safety of their children are likely to be de-terred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the Com-monwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases. Respondents attempt to avoid the conclusion that \u00a7 3209 is invalid by pointing out that it imposes almost no burden atall for the vast majority of women seeking abortions. Theybegin by noting that only about 20 percent of the womenwho obtain abortions are married. They then note that ofthese women about 95 percent notify their husbands of their own volition. Thus, respondents argue, the effects of \u00a7 3209are felt by only one percent of the women who obtain abor-tions. Respondents argue that since some of these womenwill be able to notify their husbands without adverse conse-quences or will qualify for one of the exceptions, the statuteaffects fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions.For this reason, it is asserted, the statute cannot be invalidon its face. See Brief for Respondents 83\u00b186. We disagreewith respondents' basic method of analysis. The analysis does not end with the one percent of women upon whom the statute operates; it begins there. Legisla-tion is measured for consistency with the Constitution by itsimpact on those whose conduct it affects. For example, wewould not say that a law which requires a newspaper to printa candidate's reply to an unfavorable editorial is valid on itsface because most newspapers would adopt the policy evenabsent the law. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.Tor- nillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974). The proper focus of constitu- tional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction,not the group for whom the law is irrelevant. Respondents' argument itself gives implicit recognition to this principle, at one of its critical points. Respondentsspeak of the one percent of women seeking abortions whoare married and would choose not to notify their husbandsof their plans. By selecting as the contro lling class women505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 895 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court who wish to obtain abortions, rather than all women or all pregnant women, respondents in effect concede that \u00a7 3209must be judged by reference to those for whom it is an actualrather than an irrelevant restriction. Of course, as we havesaid, \u00a7 3209's real target is narrower even than the class ofwomen seeking abortions identi\u00aeed by the State: it is mar-ried women seeking abortions who do not wish to notify theirhusbands of their intentions and who do not qualify for oneof the statutory exceptions to the notice requirement. Theunfortunate yet persisting conditions we document abovewill mean that in a large fraction of the cases in which \u00a7 3209 is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a wom-an's choice to undergo an abortion. It is an undue burden,and therefore invalid. This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with our decisions upholding parental noti\u00aecation or consent requirements.See, e. g., Akron II, 497 U. S., at 510\u00b1519; Bellotti v.Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979) (Bellotti II); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S., at 74. Those enact- ments, and our judgment that they are constitutional, arebased on the quite reasonable assumption that minors willbene\u00aet from consultation with their parents and that chil-dren will often not realize that their parents have their bestinterests at heart. We cannot adopt a parallel assumptionabout adult women. We recognize that a husband has a \u00aadeep and proper con- cern and interes t...i nh i sw i f e ' s pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying.\u00ba Dan- forth, supra, at 69. With regard to the children he has fa- thered and raised, the Court has recognized his \u00aacognizableand substantial\u00ba interest in their custody. Stanley v.Illi- nois, 405 S. 645, 651\u00b1652 (1972); see cott, 434 U. S. 380 (1979); Lehr v.Robertson, 463 U. S. 248 (1983). If these cases concerned a State's ability to require the mother to notifythe father before taking some action with respect to a living505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 896 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court child raised by both, therefore, it would be reasonable to con- clude as a general matter that the father's interest in thewelfare of the child and the mother's interest are equal. Before birth, however, the issue takes on a very different cast. It is an inescapable biological fact that state regula- tion with respect to the child a woman is carrying will havea far greater impact on the mother's liberty than on the fa-ther's. The effect of state regulation on a woman's pro-tected liberty is doubly deserving of scrutiny in such a case,as the State has touched not only upon the private sphere ofthe family but upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnantwoman. Cf. Cruzan v.Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S., at 281. The Court has held that \u00aawhen the wife andthe husband disagree on this decision, the view of only oneof the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it isthe woman who physically bears the child and who is themore directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, asbetween the two, the balance weighs in her favor.\u00ba Dan- forth, supra, at 71. This conclusion rests upon the basic na- ture of marriage and the nature of our Constitution: \u00aa[T]hemarital couple is not an independent entity with a mind andheart of its own, but an association of two individuals eachwith a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If theright of privacy means anything, it is the right of the indi- vidual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted gov- ernmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affectinga person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\u00baEisenstadt v.Baird, 405 U. S., at 453 (emphasis in original). The Constitution protects individuals, men and women alike,from unjusti\u00aeed state interference, even when that interfer-ence is enacted into law for the bene\u00aet of their spouses. There was a time, not so long ago, when a different under- standing of the family and of the Constitution prevailed. InBradwell v.State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), three PAGES OPINPGT 897 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court Court reaf\u00aermed the common-law principle that \u00aaa woman had no legal existence separate from her husband, who wasregarded as her head and representative in the social state;and, notwithstanding some recent modi\u00aecations of this civilstatus, many of the special rules of law \u00afowing from and dependent upon this cardinal principle still exist in full forcein most States.\u00ba Id., at 141 (Bradley, J., joined by Swayne and Field, JJ., concurring in judgment). Only one genera-tion has passed since this Court observed that \u00aawoman isstill regarded as the center of home and family life,\u00ba withattendant \u00aaspecial responsibilities\u00ba that precluded full andindependent legal status under the Constitution. Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). These views, of course, are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family,the individual, or the Constitution. In keeping with our rejection of the common-law under- standing of a woman's role within the family, the Court heldinDanforth that the Constitution does not permit a State to require a married woman to obtain her husband's consentbefore undergoing an abortion. 428 U. S., at 69. The prin-ciples that guided the Court in Danforth should be our guides today. For the great many women who are victimsof abuse in\u00aficted by their husbands, or whose children arethe victims of such abuse, a spousal notice requirement en-ables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife'sdecision. Whether the prospect of noti\u00aecation itself deterssuch women from seeking abortions, or whether the hus-band, through physical force or psychological pressure oreconomic coercion, prevents his wife from obtaining an abor-tion until it is too late, the notice requirement will often betantamount to the veto found unconstitutional in Danforth. The women most affected by this law\u00d0those who most rea-sonably fear the consequences of notifying their husbandsthat they are pregnant\u00d0are in the gravest danger.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 898 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of the Court The husband's interest in the life of the child his wife is carrying does not permit the State to empower him with thistroubling degree of authority over his wife. The contraryview leads to consequences reminiscent of the common law.A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to ad-vise him before she exercises her personal choices. If a hus-band's interest in the potential life of the child outweighs awife's liberty, the State could require a married woman tonotify her husband before she uses a postfert ilization contra- ceptive. Perhaps next in line would be a statute requiringpregnant married women to notify their husbands beforeengaging in conduct causing risks to the fetus. After all, ifthe husband's interest in the fetus' safety is a suf\u00aecient predi-cate for state regulation, the State could reasonably concludethat pregnant wives should notify their husbands beforedrinking alcohol or smoking. Perhaps married womenshould notify their husbands before using contraceptives orbefore undergoing any type of surgery that may have compli-cations affecting the husband's interest in his wife's repro-ductive organs. And if a husband's interest justi\u00aees noticein any of these cases, one might reasonably argue that itjusti\u00aees exactly what the Danforth Court held it did not justify\u00d0a requirement of the husband's consent as well. AState may not give to a man the kind of dominion over hiswife that parents exercise over their children. Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of married women but repugnant toour present understanding of marriage and of the nature ofthe rights secured by the Constitution. Women do not losetheir constitutionally protected liberty when they marry.The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female,married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmentalpower, even where that power is employed for the supposedbene\u00aet of a member of the individual's family. These consid-erations our OPINPGT 899 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. D We next consider the parental consent provision. Except in a medical emergency, an unemancipated young womanunder 18 may not obtain an abortion unless she and one ofher parents (or guardian) provides informed consent as de-\u00aened above. If neither a parent nor a guardian providesconsent, a court may authorize the performance of an abor-tion upon a determination that the young woman is matureand capable of giving informed consent and has in fact givenher informed consent, or that an abortion would be in herbest interests. We have been over most of this ground before. Our cases establish, and we reaf\u00aerm today, that a State may require aminor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parentor guardian, provided that there is an adequate judicial by-pass procedure. See, e. g., Akron II, 497 U. S., at 510\u00b1519; Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 461 ( O\u0092Connor, J., ( Ken- nedy, concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Akron I, 462 U. S., at 440; Bellotti II, 443 U. S., at 643\u00b1644 (plurality opinion). Under these precedents, in ourview, the one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypassprocedure are constitutional. The only argument made by petitioners respecting this provision and to which our prior decisions do not speak is thecontention that the parental consent requirement is invalid because it requires informed parental consent. For themost part, petitioners' argument is a reprise of their argu-ment with respect to the informed consent requirement ingeneral, and we reject it for the reasons given above. In-deed, some of the provisions regarding informed consenthave particular force with respect to minors: the waiting pe-riod, for example, may provide the parent or parents of apregnant young woman the opportunity to consult with herin private, and to discuss the consequences of her decision in505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 900 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ. the context of the values and moral or religious principles of their family. See Hodgson, supra, at 448\u00b1449 (opinion of Stevens, J. ). E Under the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the statute, every facility which performs abortions is re-quired to \u00aele a report stating its name and address as wellas the name and address of any related entity, such as a con-trolling or subsidiary organization. In the case of state- funded institutions, the information becomes public. For each abortion performed, a report must be \u00aeled identi- fying: the physician (and the second physician where re-quired); the facility; the referring physician or agency; thewoman's age; the number of prior pregnancies and priorabortions she has had; gestational age; the type of abortionprocedure; the date of the abortion; whether there were anypre-existing medical conditions which would complicatepregnancy; medical complications with the abortion; whereapplicable, the basis for the determination that the abortionwas medically necessary; the weight of the aborted fetus;and whether the woman was married, and if so, whether no-tice was provided or the basis for the failure to give notice.Every abortion facility must also \u00aele quarterly reports show-ing the number of abortions performed broken down by tri-mester. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3207, 3214 (1990). In allevents, the identity of each woman who has had an abortionremains con\u00aedential. InDanforth, 428 U. S., at 80, we held that recordkeeping and reporting provisions \u00aathat are reasonably directed to thepreservation of maternal health and that properly respect apatient's con\u00aedentiality and privacy are permissible.\u00ba Wethink that under this standard, all the provisions at issuehere, except that relating to spousal notice, are constitu-tional. Although they do not relate to the State's interestin informing the woman's choice, they do relate to health.The collection of information with respect to actual patients505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:03 PAGES OPINPGT 901 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of the Court is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than tomake abortions more dif\u00aecult. Nor do we \u00aend that the re-quirements impose a substantial obstacle to a woman'schoice. At most they might increase the cost of some abor-tions by a slight amount. While at some point increasedcost could become a substantial obstacle, there is no suchshowing on the record before us. Subsection (12) of the reporting provision requires the re- porting of, among other things, a married woman's \u00aareasonfor failure to provide notice\u00ba to her husband. \u00a7 3214(a)(12).This provision in effect requires women, as a condition ofobtaining an abortion, to provide the Commonwealth withthe precise information we have already recognized thatmany women have pressing reasons not to reveal. Like thespousal notice requirement itself, this provision places anundue burden on a woman's choice, and must be invalidatedfor that reason. VI Our Constitution is a covenant running from the \u00aerst gen- eration of Americans to us and then to future generations.It is a coherent succession. Each generation must learnanew that the Constitution's written terms embody ideas andaspirations that must survive more ages than one. We ac-cept our responsibility not to retreat from interpreting thefull meaning of the covenant in light of all of our precedents.We invoke it once again to de\u00aene the freedom guaranteed bythe Constitution's own promise, the promise of liberty. *** The judgment in No. 91\u00b1902 is af\u00aermed.

I The Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of stare decisis has contro lling signi \u00aecance in a case of this kind, notwithstanding an individual Justice's concernsabout the merits. 1The central holding of Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), has been a \u00aapart of our law\u00ba for almost twodecades. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 101 (1976) ( Stevens, J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part). It was a natural sequel to the protec-tion of individual liberty established in Griswold v.Con- necticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See also Carey v.Popula- tion Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 687, 702 (1977) (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in result). The societal costs of overruling Roe at this late date would be enormous. Roe is an integral part of a correct under- standing of both the concept of liberty and the basic equalityof men and women. Stare decisis also provides a suf\u00aecient basis for my agree- ment with the joint opinion's reaf\u00aermation of Roe's post- viability analysis. Speci\u00aecally, I accept the proposition that\u00aa[i]f the State is interested in protecting fetal life after via-bility, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during thatperiod, except when it is necessary to preserve the life orhealth of the mother.\u00ba 410 U. S., at 163\u00b1164; see ante, at 879. I also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis, namely, a reaf\u00aermation of Roe's explanation of why the State's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother 1It is sometimes useful to view the issue of stare decisis from a histori- cal perspective. In the last 19 years, 15 Justices have confronted the basicissue presented in Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Of those, 11 have voted as the majority does today: Chief Justice Burger, Justices Doug-las, Brennan, Stewart, Marshall, and Powell, and Justices Blackmun, O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and myself. Only four\u00d0all of whom hap- pen to be on the Court today\u00d0have reached the opposite conclusion.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 913 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. must take precedence over any duty to the unborn. The Court in Roe carefully considered, and rejected, the State's argument \u00aathat the fetus is a `person' within the languageand meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u00ba 410 U. S., at156. After analyzing the usage of \u00aaperson\u00ba in the Constitu-tion, the Court concluded that that word \u00aahas applicationonly postnatally.\u00ba Id.,at 157. Commenting on the contin- gent property interests of the unborn that are generally rep-resented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: \u00aaPerfectionof the interests involved, again, has generally been contin-gent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never beenrecognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\u00ba Id., at 162. Accordingly, an abortion is not \u00aathe termination oflife entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\u00ba Id.,at 159. From this holding, there was no dissent, see id.,at 173; indeed, no Member of the Court has ever questioned thisfundamental proposition. Thus, as a matter of federal con-stitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a \u00aaper-son\u00ba does not have what is sometimes described as a \u00aarightto life.\u00ba 2This has been and, by the Court's holding today, 2Professor Dworkin has made this comment on the issue: \u00aaThe suggestion that states are free to declare a fetus a person .... assumes that a state can curtail some persons' constitutional rights byadding new persons to the constitutional population. The constitutionalrights of one citizen are of course very much affected by who or what elsealso has constitutional rights, because the rights of others may competeor con\u00afict with his. So any power to increase the constitutional popula-tion by unilateral decision would be, in effect, a power to decrease rightsthe national Constitution grants to others. \u00aa ...I fas t a t ec o u l d declare trees to be persons with a constitutional right to life, it could prohibit publishing newspapers or books in spiteof the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, which could not beunderstood as a license to kill.... Once we understand that the suggestion we are considering has that implication, we must reject it. If a fetus isnot part of the constitutional population, under the national constitutionalarrangement, then states have no power to overrule that national arrange-ment by themselves declaring that fetuses have rights competitive with505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 914 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Stevens, J. remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional law governing reproductive autonomy. II My disagreement with the joint opinion begins with its understanding of the trimester framework established inRoe. Contrary to the suggestion of the joint opinion, ante, at 876, it is not a \u00aacontradiction\u00ba to recognize that the Statemay have a legitimate interest in potential human life and,at the same time, to conclude that that interest does notjustify the regulation of abortion before viability (althoughother interests, such as maternal health, may). The factthat the State's interest is legitimate does not tell us when,if ever, that interest outweighs the pregnant woman's inter-est in personal liberty. It is appropriate, therefore, to con-sider more carefully the nature of the interests at stake. First, it is clear that, in order to be legitimate, the State's interest must be secular; consistent with the First Amend-ment the State may not promote a theological or sectarianinterest. See Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetri- cians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) ( Stevens, J., concurring); see generally Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 563\u00b1572 (1989) ( Stevens, J., concur- ring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, as discussedabove, the state interest in potential human life is not aninterest in loco parentis, for the fetus is not a person. Identifying the State's interests\u00d0which the States rarely articulate with any precision\u00d0makes clear that the interestin protecting potential life is not grounded in the Constitu-tion. It is, instead, an indirect interest supported by bothhumanitarian and pragmatic concerns. Many of our citizensbelieve that any abortion re\u00afects an unacceptable disrespectfor potential human life and that the performance of more the constitutional rights of pregnant women.\u00ba Unenumerated Rights: Whether and How Roe Should be Overruled, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 381, 400\u00b1 401 (1992).505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 915 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. than a m illion abortions each year is intolerable; many \u00aend third-trimester abortions performed when the fetus is ap-proaching personhood particularly offensive. The State hasa legitimate interest in minimizing such offense. The Statemay also have a broader interest in expanding the popula-tion, 3believing society would bene\u00aet from the services of additional productive citizens\u00d0or that the potential humanlives might include the occasional Mozart or Curie. Theseare the kinds of concerns that comprise the State's interestin potential human life. In counterpoise is the woman's constitutional interest in liberty. One aspect of this liberty is a right to bodily integ-rity, a right to control one's person. See, e. g., Rochin v.Cal- ifornia, 342 U. S. 165 (1952); Skinner v.Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942). This right is neutral on the question of abortion: The Constitution would be equallyoffended by an absolute requirement that all women undergoabortions as by an absolute prohibition on abortions. \u00aaOurwhole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of givinggovernment the power to control men's minds.\u00ba Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 565 (1969). The same holds true for the power to control women's bodies. The woman's constitutional liberty interest also involves her freedom to decide matters of the highest privacy andthe most personal nature. Cf. Whalen v.Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 3The state interest in protecting potential life may be compared to the state interest in protecting those who seek to immigrate to this country.A contemporary example is provided by the Haitians who have risked theperils of the sea in a desperate attempt to become \u00aapersons\u00ba protected byour laws. Humanitarian and practical concerns would support a state pol-icy allowing those persons unrestricted entry; countervailing interests inpopulation control support a policy of limiting the entry of these potentialcitizens. While the state i nterest in population control might be suf\u00aecient to justify strict enforcement of the immigration laws, that interest wouldnot be suf\u00aecient to overcome a woman's liberty interest. Thus, a stateinterest in population control could not justify a state-imposed limit onfamily size or, for that matter, state-mandated abortions.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 916 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Stevens, J. 598\u00b1600 (1977). A woman considering abortion faces \u00aaa dif- \u00aecult choice having serious and personal consequences ofmajor importance to her own future\u00d0perhaps to the salva-tion of her own immortal soul.\u00ba Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 781. The authority to make such traumatic and yet empow-ering decisions is an element of basic human dignity. As thejoint opinion so eloquently demonstrates, a woman's decisionto terminate her pregnancy is nothing less than a matterof conscience. Weighing the State's interest in potential life and the woman's liberty interest, I agree with the joint opinion that the State may \u00aa ` \u00aaexpres[s] a preference for normal child-birth,\u00ba ' \u00ba that the State may take steps to ensure that awoman's choice \u00aais thoughtful and informed,\u00ba and that\u00aaStates are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable frame-work for a woman to make a decision that has such profoundand lasting meaning.\u00ba Ante, at 872\u00b1873. Serious questions arise, however, when a State attempts to \u00aapersuade thewoman to choose childbirth over abortion.\u00ba Ante, at 878. Decisional autonomy must limit the State's power to injectinto a woman's most personal deliberations its own views ofwhat is best. The State may promote its preferencesby funding childbirth, by creating and maintaining alterna-tives to abortion, and by espousing the virtues of family; butit must respect the individual's freedom to make suchjudgments. This theme runs throughout our decisions concerning re- productive freedom. In general, Roe's requirement that re- strictions on abortions before viability be justi\u00aeed by theState's interest in maternal health has prevented States from interjecting regulations designed to in\u00afuence a wom-an's decision. Thus, we have upheld regulations of abortionthat are not efforts to sway or direct a woman's choice, butrather are efforts to enhance the deliberative quality of thatdecision or are neutral regulations on the health aspects ofher decision. We have, for example, upheld regulations re-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 917 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 52 (1976); limited rec- ordkeeping and reporting, see ibid.; and pathology reports, seePlanned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983); as well as various licensing and quali\u00aecation provisions, see, e. g., Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Simopoulos v.Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983). Conversely, we have consistently rejected state efforts to prejudice awoman's choice, either by limiting the information availableto her, see Bigelow v.Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), or by \u00aarequir[ing] the delivery of information designed `to in\u00afu- ence the woman's informed choice between abortion or child-birth.' \u00ba Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 760; see also Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 442\u00b1449 (1983). In my opinion, the principles established in this long line of cases and the wisdom re\u00afected in Justice Powell's opinionfor the Court in Akron (and followed by the Court just six years ago in Thornburgh ) should govern our decision today. Under these principles, Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)\u00b1 (iii) (1990) of the Pennsylvania statute are unconstitutional.Those sections require a physician or counselor to providethe woman with a range of materials clearly designed to per-suade her to choose not to undergo the abortion. While theCommonwealth is free, pursuant to \u00a7 3208 of the Pennsylva-nia law, to produce and disseminate such material, the Com-monwealth may not inject such information into the woman'sdeliberations just as she is weighing such an importantchoice. Under this same analysis, \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Pennsylvania statute are constitutional. Those sections,which require the physician to inform a woman of the natureand risks of the abortion procedure and the medical risks ofcarrying to term, are neutral requirements comparable tothose imposed in other medical procedures. Those sectionsindicate no effort by the Commonwealth to in\u00afuence the505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 918 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Stevens, J. woman's choice in any way. If anything, such requirements enhance, rather than skew, the woman's decisionmaking. III The 24-hour waiting period required by \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(1)\u00b1(2) of the Pennsylvania statute raises even more serious concerns.Such a requirement arguably furthers the Commonwealth'sinterests in two ways, neither of which is constitutionallypermissible. First, it may be argued that the 24-hour delay is justi\u00aeed by the mere fact that it is likely to reduce the number ofabortions, thus furthering the Commonwealth's interest inpotential life. But such an argument would justify any formof coercion that placed an obstacle in the woman's path. TheCommonwealth cannot further its interests by simply wear-ing down the ability of the pregnant woman to exercise herconstitutional right. Second, it can more reasonably be argued that the 24-hour delay furthers the Commonwealth's interest in ensuring thatthe woman's decision is informed and thoughtful. But thereis no evidence that the mandated delay bene\u00aets women orthat it is necessary to enable the physician to convey anyrelevant information to the patient. The mandatory delaythus appears to rest on outmoded and unacceptable assump-tions about the decisionmaking capacity of women. Whilethere are well-established and consistently maintained rea-sons for the Commonwealth to view with skepticism the abil-ity of minors to make decisions, see Hodgson v.Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417, 449 (1990), 4none of those reasons applies to an 4As we noted in that opinion, the State's \u00aalegitimate interest in protect- ing minor women from their own immaturity\u00ba distinguished that case fromAkron v.Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), which involved \u00aaa provision that required that mature women, capableof consenting to an abortion, wait 24 hours after giving consent beforeundergoing an abortion.\u00ba Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 07-09-96 PAGES OPINPGT 919 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. adult woman's decisionmaking ability. Just as we have left behind the belief that a woman must consult her husbandbefore undertaking serious matters, see ante, at 895\u00b1898, so we must reject the notion that a woman is less capable ofdeciding matters of gravity. Cf. Reed v.Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971). In the alternative, the delay requirement may be premised on the belief that the decision to terminate a pregnancy ispresumptively wrong. This premise is illegitimate. Those who disagree vehemently about the legality and morality ofabortion agree about one thing: The decision to terminate apregnancy is profound and dif\u00aecult. No person undertakessuch a decision lightly\u00d0and States may not presume that awoman has failed to re\u00afect adequately merely because herconclusion differs from the State's preference. A womanwho has, in the privacy of her thoughts and conscience,weighed the options and made her decision cannot be forcedto reconsider all, simply because the State believes she hascome to the wrong conclusion. 5 5The joint opinion's reliance on the indirect effects of the regulation of constitutionally protected activity, see ante, at 873\u00b1874, is misplaced; what matters is not only the effect of a regulation but also the reason for theregulation. As I explained in Hodgson: \u00aaIn cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or the right to marry, the identi\u00aecation of the constitutionally protected in-terest is merely the beginning of the analysis. State regulation of traveland of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may notcategorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, Shapiro v.Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 631 (1969), or deny prisoners the right to marry, Turner v. Sa\u00afey, 482 U. S. 78, 94\u00b199 (1987). But the regulation of constitutionally protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he orshe shall marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns otherthan disagreement with the choice the individual has made. Cf. Turner v.Sa\u00afey, supra; Loving v.Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967). In the abortion area, a State may have no obligation to spend its own money, or use itsown facilities, to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions for minors or adults.See, e. g., Maher v.Roe, 432 U. S. 464 (1977); cf. Webster v.Reproduc tive505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 920 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Stevens, J. Part of the constitutional liberty to choose is the equal dignity to which each of us is entitled. A woman who de-cides to terminate her pregnancy is entitled to the same re-spect as a woman who decides to carry the fetus to term.The mandatory waiting period denies women that equalrespect. IV In my opinion, a correct application of the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard leads to the same conclusion concerning the consti-tutionality of these requirements. A state-imposed burdenon the exercise of a constitutional right is measured both by its effects and by its character: A burden may be \u00aaundue\u00baeither because the burden is too severe or because it lacks alegitimate, rational justi\u00aecation. 6 The 24-hour delay requirement fails both parts of this test. The \u00aendings of the District Court establish the severity of Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 508\u00b1511 (1989); judgment). A State's value judg- ment favoring childbirth over abortion may provide adequate support fordecisions involving such allocation of public funds, but not for simply sub-stituting a state decision for an individual decision that a woman has aright to make for herself. Otherwise, the interest in liberty protected bythe Due Process Clause would be a nullity. A state policy favoring child-birth over abortion is not in itself a suf\u00aecient justi\u00aecation for overridingthe woman's decision or for placing pregnant woman's path to an abortion.' \u00ba 497 U. S., at 435. 6The meaning of any legal standard can only be understood by review- ing the actual cases in which it is applied. For that reason, I discountboth Justice Scalia 's comments on past descriptions of the standard, see post, at 988\u00b1990 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and the attempt to give it crystal clarity in the joint opinion. Theseveral opinions supporting the judgment in Griswold v.Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), are less illuminating than the central holding of the case,which appears to have passed the test of time. The future may also dem-onstrate that a standard that analyzes both the severity of a regulatoryburden and the legitimacy of its justi\u00aecation will provide a fully adequate framework for the review of abortion legislation even if the contours ofthe standard are not authoritatively articulated in 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 921 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Stevens, J. the burden that the 24-hour delay imposes on many pregnant women. Yet even in those cases in which the delay is notespecially onerous, it is, in my opinion, \u00aaundue\u00ba becausethere is no evidence that such a delay serves a useful andlegitimate purpose. As indicated above, there is no legiti-mate reason to require a woman who has agonized over herdecision to leave the clinic or hospital and return again an-other day. While a general requirement that a physician no-tify her patients about the risks of a proposed medical proce-dure is appropriate, a rigid requirement that all patients wait24 hours or (what is true in practice) much longer to evaluatethe signi\u00aecance of information that is either common knowl-edge or irrelevant is an irrational and, therefore, \u00aaundue\u00baburden. The counseling provisions are similarly in\u00aerm. Whenever government commands private citizens to speak or to listen,careful review of the justi\u00aecation for that command is partic-ularly appropriate. In these cases, the Pennsylvania statutedirects that counselors provide women seeking abortionswith information concerning alternatives to abortion, theavailability of medical assistance bene\u00aets, and the possibilityof child-support payments. \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)\u00b1 (iii). The stat- ute requires that this information be given to allwomen seeking abortions, including those for whom such informa-tion is clearly useless, such as those who are married, thosewho have undergone the procedure in the past and are fullyaware of the options, and those who are fully convinced thatabortion is their only reasonable option. Moreover, thestatute requires physicians to inform all of their patientsof \u00aa[t]he probable gestational age of the unborn child.\u00ba\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(ii). This information is of little decisional valuein most cases, because 90% of all abortions are performedduring the \u00aerst trimester 7when fetal age has less relevance than when the fetus nears viability. Nor can the informa- 7U. S.

Accordingly, while I disagree with Parts IV , V\u00b1B, and V\u00b1D of the joint opinion, 8I join the remainder of the Court's opinion. Justice Blackmun , concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part. I join Parts I, II, III, V\u00b1A, V\u00b1C, and VI of the joint opin- ion of Justices O\u0092Connor ,Kennedy , and Souter ,ante. Three years ago, in Webster v.Reproductive Health Serv- ices, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), four Members of this Court ap- peared poised to \u00aacas[t] into darkness the hopes and visionsof every woman in this country\u00ba who had come to believethat the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproduc-tive choice. Id.,at 557 ( Blackmun, J. , dissenting). See id., at 499 (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. , joined by White and Kennedy, JJ. );id.,at 532 ( Scalia, J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment). All that remained be-tween the promise of Roe and the darkness of the plurality was a single, \u00afickering \u00afame. Decisions since Webster gave little reason to hope that this \u00afame would cast much light.See, e. g., Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 524 (1990) ( Blackmun, J. , dissenting). But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the \u00afamehas grown bright. 8Although I agree that a parental-consent requirement (with the appro- priate bypass) is constitutional, I do not join Part V\u00b1D of the joint opinionbecause its approval of Pennsylvania's informed parental-consent require-ment is based on the reasons given in Part V\u00b1B, with which I disagree.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 923 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. I do not underestimate the signi\u00aecance of today's joint opinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the rightto reproductive choice is entitled to the full protectionafforded by this Court before Webster. And I fear for the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single votenecessary to extinguish the light. I Make no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O\u0092Connor , Kennedy , and Souter is an act of personal courage and constitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions inwhich Justices O\u0092Connor and Kennedy postponed recon- sideration of Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the authors of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me in concluding that \u00aathe essential holding of Roe v.Wade should be retained and once again reaf\u00aermed.\u00ba Ante, at 846. In brief, \u00aeve Members of this Court today recognize that \u00aatheConstitution protects a woman's right to terminate her preg-nancy in its early stages.\u00ba Ante, at 844. A fervent view of individual liberty and the force of stare decisis have led the Court to this conclusion. Ante, at 853. Today a majority reaf\u00aerms that the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment establishes \u00aaa realm of personalliberty which the government may not enter,\u00ba ante, at 847\u00d0 a realm whose outer limits cannot be determined by inter-pretations of the Constitution that focus only on the speci\u00aecpractices of States at the time the Fourteenth Amendmentwas adopted. See ante, at 848\u00b1849. Included within this realm of liberty is \u00aa `the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusioninto matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the deci-sion whether to bear or beget a child.' \u00ba Ante, at 851, quot- ingEisenstadt v.Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972) (emphasis in original). \u00aaThese matters, involving the most intimateand personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choicescentral to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 924 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u00ba Ante, at 851 (emphasis added). Finally, the Court today recognizesthat in the case of abortion, \u00aathe liberty of the woman is atstake in a sense unique to the human condition and so uniqueto the law. The mother who carries a child to full term issubject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that onlyshe must bear.\u00ba Ante, at 852. The Court's reaf\u00aermation of Roe's central holding is also based on the force of stare decisis. \u00aa[N]o erosion of prin- ciple going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no devel- opments at odds with other precedent for the analysis ofpersonal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viabil-ity more or less appropriate as the point at which the balanceof interests tips.\u00ba Ante, at 860\u00b1861. Indeed, the Court ac- knowledges that Roe's limitation on state power could not be removed \u00aawithout serious inequity to those who have reliedupon it or signi\u00aecant damage to the stability of the societygoverned by it.\u00ba Ante, at 855. In the 19 years since Roe was decided, that case has shaped more than reproductiveplanning\u00d0\u00aa[a]n entire generation has come of age free to as-sume Roe's concept of liberty in de\u00aening the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions.\u00baAnte, at 860. The Court understands that, having \u00aacall[ed] the contending sides . . . to end their national division byaccepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\u00baante, at 867, a decision to overrule Roe \u00aawould seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial powerand to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicatedto the rule of law.\u00ba Ante, at 865. What has happened today should serve as a model for future Justices and a warn-ing to all who have tried to turn this Court into yet anotherpolitical branch. In striking down the Pennsylvania statute's spousal noti- \u00aecation requirement, the Court has 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 925 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. for evaluating abortion regulations that responds to the so- cial context of women facing issues of reproductive choice.1 In determining the burden imposed by the challenged regu-lation, the Court inquires whether the regulation's \u00aa purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viabil-ity.\u00ba Ante, at 878 (emphasis added). The Court reaf\u00aerms: \u00aaThe proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group forwhom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\u00ba Ante, at 894. Looking at this group, the Court inquires, based on expert testimony, empirical studies,and common sense, whether \u00aain a large fraction of the casesin which [the restriction] is relevant, it will operate as a sub-stantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abor-tion.\u00ba Ante, at 895. \u00aaA statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the inter-est in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman'sfree choice, not hinder it.\u00ba Ante, at 877. And in applying its test, the Court remains sensitive to the unique role ofwomen in the decisionmaking process. Whatever may havebeen the practice when the Fourteenth Amendment wasadopted, the Court observes, \u00aa[w]omen do not lose their con-stitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Con-stitution protects all individuals, male or female, married orunmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, evenwhere that power is employed for the supposed bene\u00aet of amember of the individual's family.\u00ba Ante, at 898. 2 1As I shall explain, the joint opinion and I disagree on the appropriate standard of review for abortion regulations. I do agree, however, thatthe reasons advanced by the joint opinion suf\u00aece to invalidate the spousalnoti\u00aecation requirement under a strict scrutiny standard. 2I also join the Court's decision to uphold the medical emergency pro- vision. As the Court notes, its interpretation is consistent with the es-sential holding of Roe that \u00aaforbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 926 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. Lastly, while I believe that the joint opinion errs in fa iling to invalidate the other regulations, I am pleased that thejoint opinion has not ruled out the possibility that these reg-ulations may be shown to impose an unconstitutional burden.The joint opinion makes clear that its speci\u00aec holdings arebased on the insuf\u00aeciency of the record before it. See, e. g., ante, at 885\u00b1886. I am con\u00aedent that in the future evidence will be produced to show that \u00aain a large fraction of the casesin which [these regulations are] relevant, [they] will operateas a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo anabortion.\u00ba Ante, at 895. II Today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and deci- sions of this Court require that a State's abortion restric-tions be subjected to the strictest judicial scrutiny. Ourprecedents and the joint opinion's principles require us tosubject all non- de-minimis abortion regulations to strict scrutiny. Under this standard, the Pennsylvania statute'sprovisions requiring content-based counseling, a 24-hourdelay, informed parental consent, and reporting of abortion-related information must be invalidated. A The Court today reaf\u00aerms the long recognized rights of privacy and bodily integrity. As early as 1891, the Courtheld, \u00aa[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefullyguarded by the common law, than the right of every individ-ual to the possession and control of his own person, free fromall restraint or interference of others . . . .\u00ba Union Paci\u00aec R. Co. v.Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891). Throughout this century, this Court also has held that the fundamentalright of privacy protects citizens against governmental in- would constitute a threat to her health.\u00ba Ante, at 880. As is apparent in my analysis below, however, this exception does not render constitu-tional the provisions which I conclude do not survive strict scrutiny.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 927 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. trusion in such intimate family matters as procreation, child- rearing, marriage, and contraceptive choice. See ante, at 847\u00b1849. These cases embody the principle that personaldecisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity, identity,and destiny should be largely beyond the reach of govern-ment. Eisenstadt, 405 U. S., at 453. In Roe v.Wade, this Court correctly applied these principles to a woman's rightto choose abortion. State restrictions on abortion violate a woman's right of privacy in two ways. First, compelled continuation of apregnancy infringes upon a woman's right to bodily integrityby imposing substantial physical intrusions and signi\u00aecantrisks of physical harm. During pregnancy, women experi-ence dramatic physical changes and a wide range of healthconsequences. Labor and delivery pose additional healthrisks and physical demands. In short, restrictive abortionlaws force women to endure physical invasions far more sub- stantial than those this Court has held to violate the consti-tutional principle of bodily integrity in other contexts. See,e. g., Winston v.Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985) (invalidating surgi- cal removal of bullet from murder suspect); Rochin v.Cali- fornia, 342 U. S. 165 (1952) (invalidating stomach pumping). 3 Further, when the State restricts a woman's right to ter- minate her pregnancy, it deprives a woman of the right tomake her own decision about reproduction and family plan-ning\u00d0critical life choices that this Court long has deemedcentral to the right to privacy. The decision to terminate orcontinue a pregnancy has no less an impact on a woman's lifethan decisions about contraception or marriage. 410 U. S., 3As the joint opinion acknowledges, ante, at 857, this Court has recog- nized the vital liberty interest of persons in refusing unwanted medicaltreatment. Cruzan v.Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261 (1990). Just as the Due Process Clause protects the deeply personal decision ofthe individual to refuse medical treatment, it also must protect the deeply personal decision to obtain medical treatment, including a woman's deci- sion to terminate a pregnancy.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 928 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. at 153. Because motherhood has a dramatic impact on a woman's educational prospects, employment opportunities,and self-determination, restrictive abortion laws deprive herof basic control over her life. For these reasons, \u00aathe deci-sion whether or not to beget or bear a child\u00ba lies at \u00aathe veryheart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices.\u00baCarey v.Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 685 (1977). A State's restrictions on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy also implicate constitutional guarantees of genderequality. State restrictions on abortion compel women tocontinue pregnancies they otherwise might terminate. Byrestricting the right to terminate pregnancies, the State con-scripts women's bodies into its service, forcing women to con-tinue their pregnancies, suffer the pains of childbirth, and inmost instances, provide years of maternal care. The Statedoes not compensate women for their services; instead, itassumes that they owe this duty as a matter of course. Thisassumption\u00d0that women can simply be forced to accept the\u00aanatural\u00ba status and incidents of motherhood\u00d0appears torest upon a conception of women's role that has triggeredthe protection of the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g., Mississippi Univ. for Women v.Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724\u00b1 726 (1982); Craig v.Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198\u00b1199 (1976). 4 The joint opinion recognizes that these assumptions about women's place in society \u00aaare no longer consistent with our 4A growing number of commentators are recognizing this point. See, e. g., L.

Griswold v.Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 485 (1965). We have applied this principle speci\u00aecally in thecontext of abortion regulations. Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S., at 155. 5 Roe implemented these principles through a framework that was designed \u00aato ensure that the woman's right tochoose not become so subordinate to the State's interest inpromoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but notin fact,\u00ba ante, at 872. Roe identi\u00aeed two relevant state in- terests: \u00aaan interest in preserving and protecting the healthof the pregnant woman\u00ba and an interest in \u00aaprotecting thepotentiality of human life.\u00ba 410 U. S., at 162. With respectto the State's interest in the health of the mother, \u00aathe `com-pelling' point . . . is at approximately the end of the \u00aerst trimester,\u00ba because it is at that point that the mortality ratein abortion approaches that in childbirth. Id.,at 163. With respect to the State's interest in potential life, \u00aathe `compel-ling' point is at viability,\u00ba because it is at that point that the 5To say that restrictions on a right are subject to strict scrutiny is not to say that the right is absolute. Regulations can be upheld if they haveno signi\u00aecant impact on the woman's exercise of her right and are justi\u00aeedby important state health objectives. See, e. g., Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 65\u00b167, 79\u00b181 (1976) (upholding re- quirements of a woman's written consent and recordkeeping). But theCourt today reaf\u00aerms the essential principle of Roe that a woman has the right \u00aato choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it with-out undue interference from the State.\u00ba Ante, at 846. Under Roe, any more than de minimis interference is undue.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 930 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. fetus \u00aapresumably has the capability of meaningful life out- side the mother's womb.\u00ba Ibid. In order to ful\u00aell the re- quirement of narrow tailoring, \u00aathe State is obligated tomake a reasonable effort to limit the effect of its regulationsto the period in the trimester during which its health inter-est will be furthered.\u00ba Akron v.Akron Center for Repro- ductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 434 (1983). In my view, application of this analytical framework is no less warranted than when it was approved by seven Mem-bers of this Court in Roe. Strict scrutiny of state limita- tions on reproductive choice still offers the most secure pro-tection of the woman's right to make her own reproductivedecisions, free from state coercion. No majority of thisCourt has ever agreed upon an alternative approach. Thefactual premises of the trimester framework have not beenundermined, see Webster, 492 U. S., at 553 ( Blackmun, J. , dissenting), and the Roe framework is far more administra- ble, and far less manipulable, than the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba stand-ard adopted by the joint opinion. Nonetheless, three criticisms of the trimester framework continue to be uttered. First, the trimester framework isattacked because its key elements do not appear in the textof the Constitution. My response to this attack remains thesame as it was in Webster: \u00aaWere this a true concern, we would have to abandon most of our constitutional jurisprudence. [T]he `criticalelements' of countless constitutional doctrines nowhereappear . . . . The example, of the First Amend-ment's `actual malice' standard for proving certain libels,seeNew York Times Co. v.Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964). . . . Similarly, the Constitution makes no mention of therational-basis test, or the speci\u00aec verbal formulations ofintermediate and strict scrutiny by which this Courtevaluates claims under the Equal Protection Clause.The reason is simple. Like the Roe framework, these505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 931 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be, rights protected by the Constitution. Rather, they arejudge-made methods for evaluating and measuring thestrength and scope of constitutional rights or for balanc-ing the constitutional rights of individuals against thecompeting interests of government.\u00ba Id.,at 548. The second criticism is that the framework more closely resembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutionaldoctrine. Again, my answer remains the same as inWebster: \u00aa[I]f this were a true and genuine concern, we would have to abandon vast areas of our constitutionaljurisprudence. . . . Are [the any \u00aener, or more `regulatory,'than the distinctions we have often drawn in our FirstAmendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we haveheld that a `release time' program permitting public-school students to leave school grounds during schoolhours to receive religious instruction does not violatethe Establishment Clause, even though a release-timeprogram permitting religious instruction on schoolgrounds does violate the Clause? Compare Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 (1952), with Illinois ex rel. Mc- Collum v.Board of Education of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign County, 333 U. S. 203 (1948) ....S i m i l a r l y , in a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that al-though an overnight ban on attorney-client communica-tion violated the constitutionally guaranteed right tocounsel, Geders v.United States, 425 U. S. 80 (1976), that right was not violated when a trial judge separated adefendant from his lawyer during a 15-minute recessafter the defendant's direct testimony. Perry v.Leeke, 488 U. S. 272 (1989). \u00aaThat numerous constitutional doctrines result in nar- row differentiations between similar circumstances does505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 932 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. not mean that this Court has abandoned adjudication in favor of regulation.\u00ba Id.,at 549\u00b1550. The \u00aenal, and more genuine, criticism of the trimester framework is that it fails to \u00aend the State's interest in poten-tial human life compe lling throughout pregnancy. No Mem- ber of this Court\u00d0nor for that matter, the Solicitor General,see Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\u00d0has ever questioned our holding inRoe that an abortion is not \u00aathe termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\u00ba 410 U. S., at 159.Accordingly, a State's interest in protecting fetal life is notgrounded in the Constitution. Nor, consistent with our Es-tablishment Clause, can it be a theological or sectarian inter-est. See Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) ( Stevens, J. , concurring). It is, instead, a legitimate interest grounded inhumanitarian or pragmatic concerns. See ante, at 914\u00b1915 (Stevens, J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part). But while a State has \u00aalegitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman andthe life of the fetus that may become a child,\u00ba ante, at 846, legitimate interests are not enough. To overcome the bur-den of strict scrutiny, the interests must be compe lling. The question then is how best to accommodate the State's inter-est in potential human life with the constitutional libertiesof pregnant women. Again, I stand by the views I ex-pressed in Webster: \u00aaI remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court 16 years ago were convinced, that the Roe framework, and the viability standard in particular, fairly, sensibly, and effectively functions to safeguard the constitutionalliberties of pregnant women while recognizing and ac-commodating the State's interest in potential human life.The viability line re\u00afects the biological facts and truthsof fetal development; it marks that threshold momentprior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 933 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. woman and cannot reasonably and objectively be re- garded as a subject of rights or interests distinct from,or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At thesame time, the viability standard takes account of theundeniable fact that as the fetus evolves into its postna-tal form, and as it loses its dependence on the uterineenvironment, the State's interest in the fetus' potentialhuman life, and in fostering a regard for human life ingeneral, becomes compe lling. As a practical matter, be- cause viability follows `quickening'\u00d0the point at whicha woman feels movement in her womb\u00d0and because via-bility occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, itestablishes an easily applicable standard for regulatingabortion while providing a pregnant woman ample timeto exercise her fundamental right with her responsiblephysician to terminate her pregnancy.\u00ba 492 U. S., at553\u00b1554. 6 Roe's trimester framework does not ignore the State's in- terest in prenatal life. Like Justice Stevens ,ante, at 916, I agree that the State may take steps to ensure that a wom-an's choice \u00aais thoughtful and informed,\u00ba ante, at 872, and that \u00aaStates are free to enact laws to provide a reasonableframework for a woman to make a decision that has suchprofound and lasting meaning.\u00ba Ante, at 873. But \u00aa[s]erious questions aris e... when a State attempts to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.Ante, at 878.

The Statemay promote its preferences by funding childbirth, bycreating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, andby espousing the virtues of family; but it must respect 6The joint opinion agrees with Roe's conclusion that viability occurs at 23 or 24 weeks at the earliest. Compare ante, at 860, with Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 160 (1973).505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 934 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. the individual's freedom to make such judgments.\u00ba Ante, at 916 ( Stevens, J. , concurring in part and dis- senting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the joint opinion recognizes, \u00aathe means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calcu-lated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.\u00baAnte, at 877. In sum, Roe's requirement of strict scrutiny as imple- mented through a trimester framework should not be dis-turbed. No other approach has gained a majority, and noother is more protective of the woman's fundamental right.Lastly, no other approach properly accommodates the wom-an's constitutional right with the State's legitimate interests. C Application of the strict scrutiny standard results in the invalidation of all the challenged provisions. Indeed, as thisCourt has invalidated virtually identical provisions in priorcases, stare decisis requires that we again strike them down. This Court has upheld informed- and written-consent re- quirements only where the State has demonstrated that theygenuinely further important health-related state concerns.See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 65\u00b167 (1976). A State may not, under the guise ofsecuring informed consent, \u00aarequire the delivery of informa-tion `designed to the woman's informed choice be-tween abortion or childbirth.' \u00ba Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 760, quoting Akron, 462 U. S., at 443\u00b1444. Rigid require- ments that a speci\u00aec body of information be imparted to awoman in all cases, regardless of the needs of the patient,improperly intrude upon the discretion of the pregnantwoman's physician and thereby impose an \u00aa `undesired anduncomfortable straitjacket.' \u00ba Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 762, quoting Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67, n. 8. Measured against these principles, some aspects of the Pennsylvania informed-consent scheme are unconstitutional.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 935 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. While it is unobjectionable for the Commonwealth to require that the patient be informed of the nature of the procedure,the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and theprobable gestational age of the unborn child, compare Pa.Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(i)\u00b1 (iii) (1990) with Akron, 462 U. S., at 446, n. 37, I remain unconvinced that there is a vital stateneed for insisting that the information be provided by a phy-sician rather than a counselor. Id., at 448. The District Court found that the physician-only requirement necessarilywould increase costs to the plaintiff clinics, costs that un-doubtedly would be passed on to patients. And becausetrained women counselors are often more understandingthan physicians, and generally have more time to spend withpatients, see App. 366\u00b1387, the physician-only disclosure re-quirement is not narrowly tailored to serve the Common-wealth's interest in protecting maternal health. Sections 3205(a)(2)(i)\u00b1 (iii) of the Act fur ther requires that the physician or a quali\u00aeed nonphysician inform the womanthat printed materials are available from the Commonwealththat describe the fetus and provide information about medi-cal assistance for childbirth, information about child supportfrom the father, and a list of agencies offering adoption andother services as alternatives to abortion. Thornburgh in- validated biased patient-counseling requirements virtuallyidentical to the one at issue here. What we said of thoserequirements fully applies in these cases: \u00aa[T]he listing of agencies in the printed Pennsylvania form presents serious problems; it contains names ofagencies that well may be out of step with the needs ofthe particular woman and thus places the physician inan awkward position and infringes upon his or herprofessional responsibilities. Forcing the physician orcounselor to present the materials and the list to thewoman makes him or her in effect an agent of the Statein treating the woman and places his or her imprimaturupon both the materials and the list. All this is, or505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 936 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. comes close to being, state medicine imposed upon the woman, not the professional medical guidance she seeks,and it of\u00aecially structures\u00d0as it obviously was intendedto do\u00d0the and herphysician. \u00aaThe requirements . . . that the woman be advised that medical assistance bene\u00aets may be available, andthat the father is responsible for \u00aenancial assistance inthe support of the child similarly are poorly disguisedelements of discouragement for the abortion decision.Much of this . . . , for many patients, would be irrelevantand inappropriate. For a patient with a life-threateningpregnancy, the `information' in its very rendition maybe cruel as well as destructive of the physician-patientrelationship.

For example, the joint opinion concludes that the \u00aainforma-tion the State requires to be made available to the woman\u00ba must be\u00aatruthful and not misleading.\u00ba Ante, at 882.

The 24-hour waiting period following the provision of the foregoing information is also clearly unconstitutional. TheDistrict Court found that the mandatory 24-hour delay couldlead to delays in excess of 24 hours, thus increasing healthrisks, and that it would require two visits to the abortion provider, thereby increasing travel time, exposure to furtherharassment, and \u00aenancial cost. Finally, the District Courtfound that the requirement would pose especially signi\u00aecantburdens on women living in rural areas and those womenthat have dif\u00aeculty explaining their whereabouts. 744 F.Supp. 1323, 1378\u00b11379 (ED Pa. 1990). In Akron this Court invalidated a similarly arbitrary or in\u00afexible waiting periodbecause, as here, it furthered no legitimate state interest. 8 AsJustice Stevens insightfully concludes, the manda- tory delay rests either on outmoded or unacceptable as-sumptions about the decisionmaking capacity of women orthe belief that the decision to terminate the pregnancy is it,\u00baante, at 877, the measures must be designed to ensure that a woman's choice is \u00aamature and informed,\u00ba ante, at 883, not intimidated, imposed, or impelled.

This, for example, wouldappear to preclude a State from requiring a woman to view graphic litera-ture or \u00aelms detailing the performance of an abortion operation. Just asa visual preview of an operation to remove an appendix plays no part in aphysician's securing informed consent to an appendectomy, a preview ofscenes appurtenant to any major medical intrusion into the human bodydoes not constructively inform the decision of a woman of the State's inter-est in the preservation of the woman's health or demonstrate the State's\u00aaprofound respect for the life of the unborn.\u00ba Ante, at 877. 8The Court's decision in Hodgson v.Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990), validating a 48-hour waiting period for minors seeking an abortion to per-mit parental involvement does not alter this conclusion. Here the 24-hourdelay is imposed on an adult woman. See id.,at 449\u00b1450, n. 35; Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, Inc., 497 U. S. 502 (1990). More- over, the statute in Hodgson did not require any delay once the minor obtained the af\u00aermative consent of either a parent or the court.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 938 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. presumptively wrong. Ante, at 918\u00b1919. The requirement that women consider this obvious and slanted information foran additional 24 hours contained in these provisions will onlyin\u00afuence the woman's decision in improper ways. The vastmajority of women will know this information\u00d0of the fewthat do not, it is less likely that their minds will be changedby this information than it will be either by the realizationthat the State opposes their choice or the need once again toendure abuse and harassment on return to the clinic. 9 Except in the case of a medical emergency, \u00a7 3206 requires a physician to obtain the informed consent of a parent orguardian before performing an abortion on an unemanci-pated minor or an incompetent woman. Based on evidencein the record, the District Court concluded that, in order toful\u00aell the informed-consent requirement, generally acceptedmedical principles would require an in-person visit by theparent to the facility. 744 F. Supp., at 1382. Although theCourt \u00aahas recognized that the State has somewhat broaderauthority to regulate the activities of children than ofadults,\u00ba the State nevertheless must demonstrate that therei sa\u00aa signi\u00aecant state interest in conditioning an abortio n... that is not present in the case of an adult.\u00ba Danforth, 428 U. S., at 74\u00b175 (emphasis added). The requirement of an in-person visit would carry with it the risk of a delay of severaldays or possibly weeks, even where the parent is w illing to consent. While the State has an interest in encouraging pa-rental involvement in the minor's abortion decision, \u00a7 3206 isnot narrowly drawn to serve that interest. 10 9Because this information is so widely known, I am con\u00aedent that a developed record can be made to show that the 24-hour delay, \u00aain a largefraction of the cases in which [the restriction] is relevant, . . . will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\u00baAnte, at 895. 10The judicial-bypass provision does not cure this violation. Hodgson is distinguishable, since these cases involve more than parental involvementor approval\u00d0rather, the Pennsylvania law requires that the parent receiveinformation designed to discourage abortion in a face-to-face meeting with505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:04 PAGES OPINPGT 939 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Blackmun, J. Finally, the Pennsylvania statute requires every facility performing abortions to report its activities to the Common-wealth. Pennsylvania contends that this requirement isvalid under Danforth, in which this Court held that record- keeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably di-rected to the preservation of maternal health and that prop-erly respect a patient's con\u00aedentiality are permissible. Id., at 79\u00b181. The Commonwealth attempts to justify its re-quired reports on the ground that the public has a right toknow how its tax dollars are spent. A regulation designedto inform the public about public expenditures does not fur-ther the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternalhealth. Accordingly, such a regulation cannot justify a le-gally signi\u00aecant burden on a woman's right to obtain anabortion. The con\u00aedential reports concerning the identities and medical judgment of physicians involved in abortions at \u00aerstglance may seem valid, given the Commonwealth's interestin maternal health and enforcement of the Act. The DistrictCourt found, however, that, notwithstanding the con\u00aeden-tiality protections, many physicians, particularly those whohave previously discontinued performing abortions becauseof harassment, would refuse to refer patients to abortionclinics if their names were to appear on these reports. 744F. Supp., at 1392. The Commonwealth has failed to showthat the name of the referring physician either adds to thepool of scienti\u00aec knowledge concerning abortion or is reason-ably related to the Commonwealth's interest in maternalhealth. I therefore agree with the District Court's conclu-sion that the con\u00aedential reporting requirements are uncon- the physician. The bypass procedure cannot ensure that the parent would obtain the information, since in many instances, the parent would not evenattend the hearing. A State may not place any restriction on a youngwoman's right to an abortion, however irrational, simply because it hasprovided a judicial bypass.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 940 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Blackmun, J. stitutional insofar as they require the name of the referring physician and the basis for his or her medical judgment. In sum, I would af\u00aerm the judgment in No. 91\u00b1902 and reverse the judgment in No. 91\u00b1744 and remand the casesfor further proceedings. III At long last, The Chief Justice and those who have joined him admit it. Gone are the contentions that the issueneed not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the \u00aerstpage, for all to see, is what was expected: \u00aaWe believe thatRoe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be over- ruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare de- cisis in constitutional cases.\u00ba Post, at 944. If there is much reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opiniontoday, there is far more to fear from The Chief Justice 's opinion. The Chief Justice 's criticism of Roe follows from his stunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizingthat the Due Process Clause protects more than simple phys-ical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court's personal-liberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particularrights, rather than a principled account of how these particu-lar rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy.Post, at 951. This constricted view is reinforced by The Chief Justice 's exclusive reliance on tradition as a source of fundamental rights. He argues that the record in favorof a right to abortion is no stronger than the record in Mi- chael H. v.Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110 (1989), where the plural- ity found no fundamental right to visitation privileges by anadulterous father, or in Bowers v.Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), where the Court found no fundamental right to en-gage in homosexual sodomy, or in a case involving the \u00aa `\u00aer-i n g[ o f ]ag u n...i o another person's body.' \u00ba Post, at 951\u00b1952.

Even more shocking than The Chief Justice 's cramped notion of individual liberty is his complete omission of anydiscussion of the effects that compelled childbirth and moth-erhood have on women's lives. The only expression of con-cern with women's health is purely instrumental\u00d0for The Chief Justice , only women's psychological health is a con- cern, and only to the extent that he assumes that everywoman who decides to have an abortion does so without seri-ous consideration of the moral implications of her decision.Post, at 967\u00b1968. In short, The Chief Justice 's view of the State's compe lling i nterest in maternal health has less to do with health than it does with compe lling women to be maternal. Nor does The Chief Justice give any serious consider- ation to the doctrine of stare decisis. For The Chief Jus- tice , the facts that gave rise to Roe are surprisingly simple: \u00aawomen become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, de-pending on medical technology, where a fetus becomes via-ble, and women give birth to children.\u00ba Post, at 955. This characterization of the issue thus allows The Chief Justice quickly to discard the joint opinion's reliance argument byasserting that \u00aareproductive planning could take virtuallyimmediate account of\u00ba a decision overruling Roe. Post, at 956 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Chief Justice 's narrow conception of individual lib- erty and stare decisis leads him to propose the same stand- ard of review proposed by the plurality in Webster. \u00aaStates may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally relatedto a legitimate state interest.

S., at 514. In short, in his view, petitioners must provethat the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to anyone. Finally, in applying his standard to the spousal-noti\u00aecationprovision, The Chief Justice contends that the record lacks any \u00aahard evidence\u00ba to support the joint opinion's con-tention that a \u00aalarge fraction\u00ba of women who prefer not tonotify their husbands involve situations of battered womenand unreported spousal assault. Post, at 974, n. 2. Yet throughout the explication of his standard, The Chief Jus- tice never explains what hard evidence is, how large a frac- tion is required, or how a battered woman is supposed topursue an as-applied challenge. Under his standard, States can ban abortion if that ban is rationally related to a legitimate state interest\u00d0a standardwhich the United States calls \u00aadeferential, but not tooth-less.\u00ba Yet when pressed at oral argument to describe theteeth, the best protection that the Solicitor General couldoffer to women was that a prohibition, enforced by criminalpenalties, with no exception for the life of the mother, \u00aacould raise very serious questions.\u00ba Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.

State's prohibiting the sins of the father from being visited upon his offspring?12 But, we are reassured, there is always the protection of the democratic process. While there is much to be praisedabout our democracy, our country since its founding has rec-ognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that arenot to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's rightto reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties.Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballotbox. IV In one sense, the Court's approach is worlds apart from that of The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia . And yet, in another sense, the distance between the two approachesis short\u00d0the distance is but a single vote. I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the con\u00aermation process for mysuccessor well may focus on the issue before us today. That,I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the twoworlds will be made. 12Justice Scalia urges the Court to \u00aaget out of this area,\u00ba post, at 1002, and leave questions regarding abortion entirely to the States, post, at 999\u00b11000. Putting aside the fact that what he advocates is nothingshort of an abdication by the Court of its constitutional responsibilities,Justice Scalia is uncharacteristically naive if he thinks that overruling Roe and holding that restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion are subject only to rational-basis review will enable the Court henceforth to avoid reviewing abortion-related issues. State efforts to regulate andprohibit abortion in a post- Roe world undoubtedly would raise a host of distinct and important constitutional questions meriting review by thisCourt. For example, does the Eighth Amendment impose any limits onthe degree or kind of punishment a State can in\u00afict upon physicians whoperform, or women who undergo, abortions? What effect would differ-ences among States in their approaches to abortion have on a woman'sright to engage in interstate travel? Does the First Amendment permitStates that choose not to criminalize abortion to ban all advertising pro-viding information about where and how to obtain abortions?505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 944 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. Chief Justice Rehnquist , with whom Justice White, Justice Scalia , and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. The joint opinion, following its newly minted variation on stare decisis, retains the outer shell of Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), but beats a wholesale retreat from the substanceof that case. We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with ourtraditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases. We would adopt the approach of the plurality in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), and up- hold the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute intheir entirety. I In ruling on this litigation below, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \u00aerst observed that \u00aathis appeal does notdirectly implicate Roe; this case involves the regulation of abortions rather than their outright prohibition.\u00ba 947 F. 2d682, 687 (1991). Accordingly, the court directed its attentionto the question of the standard of review for abortion regula-tions. In attempting to settle on the correct standard, how-ever, the court confronted the confused state of this Court'sabortion jurisprudence. After considering the several opin-ions in Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, supra, and Hodgson v.Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990), the Court of Ap- peals concluded that Justice O\u0092Connor 's \u00aaundue burden\u00ba test was contro lling, as that was the narrowest ground on which we had upheld recent abortion regulations. 947 F. 2d,at 693\u00b1697 (\u00aaWhen a fragmented court decides a case and nosingle rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of\u00aeve Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as thatposition taken by those Members who concurred in the judg-ments on the narrowest grounds\u00ba (quoting Marks v.United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted))). Applying this standard, the Court of Appealsupheld all of the challenged regulations except the one505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 945 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. requiring a woman to notify her spouse of an intended abortion. In arguing that this Court should invalidate each of the provisions at issue, petitioners insist that we reaf\u00aerm ourdecision in Roe v.Wade, supra, in which we held unconstitu- tional a Texas statute making it a crime to procure an abor-tion except to save the life of the mother. 1We agree with the Court of Appeals that our decision in Roe is not directly implicated by the Pennsylvania statute, which does not pro-hibit, but simply regulates, abortion. But, as the Court ofAppeals found, the state of our post- Roe decisional law deal- ing with the regulation of abortion is confusing and uncer-tain, indicating that a reexamination of that line of cases is inorder. Unfortunately for those who must apply this Court'sdecisions, the reexamination undertaken today leaves theCourt no less divided than beforehand. Although they re-ject the trimester framework that formed the underpinningofRoe, Justices O\u0092Connor, Kennedy , and Souter adopt a revised undue burden standard to analyze the challengedregulations. We conclude, however, that such an outcome isan unjusti\u00aeed constitutional compromise, one which leavesthe Court in a position to closely scrutinize all types of abor-tion regulations despite the fact that it lacks the power todo so under the Constitution. InRoe, the Court opined that the State \u00aadoes have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protect-ing the health of the pregnant woman, . . . and that it hasstill another important and legitimate interest in protecting 1Two years after Roe, the West German constitutional court, by con- trast, struck down a law liberalizing access to abortion on the groundsthat life developing within the womb is constitutionally protected.

S., at 162 (emphasis omitted). In the companion case of Doe v.Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), the Court referred to its conclusion in Roe \u00aathat a pregnant woman does not have an absolute constitutionalright to an abortion on her demand.\u00ba 410 U. S., at 189. Butwhile the language and holdings of these cases appeared toleave States free to regulate abortion procedures in a varietyof ways, later decisions based on them have found consider-ably less latitude for such regulations than might have beenexpected. For example, after Roe, many States have sought to pro- tect their young citizens by requiring that a minor seekingan abortion involve her parents in the decision. SomeStates have simply required noti\u00aecation of the parents, whileothers have required a minor to obtain the consent of herparents. In a number of decisions, however, the Court hassubstantially limited the States in their ability to imposesuch requirements. With regard to parental notice require- ments, we initially held that a State could require a minorto notify her parents before proceeding with an abortion.H. L. v.Matheson, 450 U. S. 398, 407\u00b1410 (1981). Recently, however, we indicated that a State's ability to impose a no-tice requirement actually depends on whether it requires no-tice of one or both parents. We concluded that although theConstitution might allow a State to demand that notice begiven to one parent prior to an abortion, it may not requirethat similar notice be given to two parents, unless the State incorporates a judicial bypass procedure in that two-parentrequirement. Hodgson v.Minnesota, supra. We have treated parental consent provisions even more harshly. Three years after Roe, we invalidated a Missouri regulation requiring that an unmarried woman under the ageof 18 obtain the consent of one of her parents before proceedingwith an abortion. We held that our abortion jurisprudenceprohibited the State from imposing such a \u00aablanket provision. . . requiring the consent of a Parenthood505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 947 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976). In Bel- lotti v.Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979), the Court struck down a similar Massachusetts parental consent statute. A majorityof the Court indicated, however, that a State could constitu-tionally require parental consent, if it alternatively alloweda pregnant minor to obtain an abortion without parental con-sent by showing either that she was mature enough to makeher own decision, or that the abortion would be in her bestinterests. See id.,at 643\u00b1644 (plurality opinion); id.,at 656\u00b1 J. , dissenting). In light of Bellotti, we have upheld one parental consent regulation which incorporated a judicial bypass option we viewed as suf\u00aecient, see Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983), but have invalidated another because of ourbelief that the judicial procedure did not satisfy the dictatesofBellotti, see Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 439\u00b1442 (1983). We have never had occasion, as we have in the parental notice context, tofurther parse our parental consent jurisprudence into one-parent and two-parent components. InRoe, the Court observed that certain States recognized the right of the father to participate in the abortion decisionin certain circumstances. Because neither Roe nor Doe in- volved the assertion of any paternal right, the Court ex-pressly stated that the case did not disturb the validity ofregulations that protected such a right. Roe v.Wade, supra, at 165, n. 67. But three years later, in Danforth, the Court extended its abortion jurisprudence and held that a Statecould not require that a woman obtain the consent of herspouse before proceeding with an abortion. Planned Par- enthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S., at 69\u00b171. States have also regularly tried to ensure that a woman's decision to have an abortion is an informed and well-considered one. In Danforth, we upheld a requirement that a woman sign a consent form prior to her abortion, and ob-served that \u00aait is desirable and imperative that [the decision]505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 948 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. be made with full knowledge of its nature and conse- quences.\u00ba Id., at 67. Since that case, however, we have twice invalidated state statutes designed to impart suchknowledge to a woman seeking an abortion. In Akron, we held unconstitutional a regulation requiring a physician toinform a woman seeking an abortion of the status of herpregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possibleviability, the complications that could result from an abor-tion, and the availability of agencies providing assistance andinformation with respect to adoption and childbirth. Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 442\u00b1445. More recently, in Thornburgh v.American College of Obste- tricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986), we struck down a more limited Pennsylvania regulation requiring thata woman be informed of the risks associated with the abor-tion procedure and the assistance available to her if she de-cided to proceed with her pregnancy, because we saw thecompelled information as \u00aathe antithesis of informed con-sent.\u00ba Id., at 764. Even when a State has sought only to provide information that, in our view, was consistent withtheRoe framework, we concluded that the State could not require that a physician furnish the information, but insteadhad to alternatively allow nonphysician counselors to provideit. Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U. S., at 448\u00b1449. In Akron as well, we went further and held that a State may not require a physician to wait 24hours to perform an abortion after receiving the consent ofa woman. Although the State sought to ensure that thewoman's decision was carefully considered, the Court con-cluded that the Constitution forbade the State to impose anysort of delay. Id.,at 449\u00b1451. We have not allowed States much leeway to regulate even the actual abortion procedure. Although a State can re-quire that second-trimester abortions be performed in outpa-tient clinics, see Simopoulos v.Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983), we concluded in Akron and Ashcroft that a State could not505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 949 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. require that such abortions be performed only in hospitals. See Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 437\u00b1439; Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.Ashcroft, supra, at 481\u00b1482. Despite the fact that Roe expressly allowed regulation after the \u00aerst trimester in furtherance of maternal health, \u00aa `present medical knowl-edge,' \u00ba in our view, could not justify such a hospitalizationrequirement under the trimester framework. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 437 (quot- ingRoe v.Wade, supra, at 163). And in Danforth, the Court held that Missouri could not outlaw the saline amniocentesis method of abortion, concluding that the Missouri Legislaturehad \u00aafailed to appreciate and to consider several signi\u00aecantfacts\u00ba in making its decision. 428 U. S., at 77. Although Roe allowed state regulation after the point of viability to protect the potential life of the fetus, the Courtsubsequently rejected attempts to regulate in this manner.InColautti v.Franklin, 439 U. S. 379 (1979), the Court struck down a statute that governed the determination ofviability. Id., at 390\u00b1397. In the process, we made clear that the trimester framework incorporated only one de\u00aeni-tion of viability\u00d0ours\u00d0as we forbade States to decide thata certain objective indicator\u00d0\u00aabe it weeks of gestation orfetal weight or any other single factor\u00ba\u00d0should govern thede\u00aenition of viability. Id., at 389. In that same case, we also invalidated a regulation requiring a physician to use theabortion technique offering the best chance for fetal survivalwhen performing postviability abortions. See id., at 397\u00b1 401; see also Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetri- cians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 768\u00b1769 (invalidating a similar regulation). In Thornburgh, the Court struck down Pennsylvania's requirement that a second physician be pres-ent at postviability abortions to help preserve the health ofthe unborn child, on the ground that it did not incorporatea suf\u00aecient medical emergency exception. Id., at 769\u00b1771. Regulations governing the treatment of aborted fetuses have505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 950 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. met a similar fate. In Akron, we invalidated a provision requiring physicians performing abortions to \u00aainsure thatthe remains of the unborn child are disposed of in a humaneand sanitary manner.\u00ba 462 U. S., at 451 (internal quotationmarks omitted). Dissents in these cases expressed the view that the Court was expanding upon Roe in imposing ever greater restric- tions on the States. See Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (\u00aaThe extent to which the Courthas departed from the limitations expressed in Roe is readily apparent\u00ba); id.,at 814 ( White, J. , dissenting) (\u00aa[T]he major- indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions thatin no way contravene the right recognized in Roe\u00ba). And, when confronted with state regulations of this type in pastyears, the Court has become increasingly more divided: Thethree most recent abortion cases have not commanded aCourt opinion. See Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990); Hodgson v.Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990); Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989). The task of the Court of Appeals in the present cases was obviously complicated by this confusion and uncertainty.Following Marks v.United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977), it concluded that in light of Webster and Hodgson, the strict scrutiny standard enunciated in Roe was no longer applica- ble, and that the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard adopted by Jus- tice O\u0092Connor was the governing principle. This state of confusion and disagreement warrants reexamination of the\u00aafundamental right\u00ba accorded to a woman's decision to aborta fetus in Roe, with its concomitant requirement that any state regulation of abortion survive \u00aastrict scrutiny.\u00ba SeePayne v.Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\u00b1828 (1991) (observing that reexamination of constitutional decisions is appropriatewhen those decisions have generated uncertainty and failedto provide clear guidance, because \u00aacorrection through legis-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 951 Cite as: 505 U.

S. 528, 546\u00b1547, 557 (1985). We have held that a liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will bedeemed fundamental if it is \u00aaimplicit in the concept of or-dered liberty.\u00ba Palko v.Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937). Three years earlier, in Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97 (1934), we referred to a \u00aaprinciple of justice so rootedin the traditions and conscience of our people as to be rankedas fundamental.\u00ba Id.,at 105; see also Michael H. v.Gerald D.,491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion) (citing the lan- guage from Snyder ). These expressions are admittedly not precise, but our decisions implementing this notion of \u00aafunda-mental\u00ba rights do not afford any more elaborate basis onwhich to base such a classi\u00aecation. In construing the phrase \u00aaliberty\u00ba incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have rec-ognized that its meaning extends beyond freedom from phys-ical restraint. In Pierce v.Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), we held that it included a parent's right to send achild to private school; in Meyer v.Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923), we held that it included a right to teach a foreignlanguage in a parochial school. Building on these cases, wehave held that the term \u00aaliberty\u00ba includes a right to marry,Loving v.Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); a right to procreate, Skinner v.Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and a right to use contraceptives, Griswold v.Con- necticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v.Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972). But a reading of these opinions makes clear thatthey do not endorse any all-encompassing \u00aaright of privacy.\u00ba per- privacy\u00ba which \u00aais broad enough to encompass a wom-an's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u00ba410 U. S., at 152\u00b1153. We are now of the view that, in term-ing this right fundamental, the Court in Roe read the earlier505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 952 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. opinions upon which it based its decision much too broadly. Unlike marriage, procreation, and contraception, abortion\u00aainvolves the purposeful termination of a potential life.\u00baHarris v.McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 325 (1980). The abortion decision must therefore \u00aabe recognized as sui generis, differ- ent in kind from the others that the Court has protectedunder the rubric of personal or family privacy and auton-omy.\u00ba Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra, at 792 ( White, J. , dissenting). One cannot ignore the fact that a woman is not isolated inher pregnancy, and that the decision to abort necessarily in- volves the destruction of a fetus. See Michael H. v.Gerald D., supra, at 124, n. 4 (To look \u00aaat the act which is assertedly the subject of a liberty interest in isolation from its effectupon other people [is] like inquiring whether there is a lib-erty interest in \u00aering a gun where the case at hand happensto involve its discharge into another person's body\u00ba). Nor do the historical traditions of the American people support the view that the right to terminate one's pregnancyis \u00aafundamental.\u00ba The common law which we inheritedfrom England made abortion after \u00aaquickening\u00ba an offense.At the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,statutory prohibitions or restrictions on abortion were com-monplace; in 1868, at least 28 of the then-37 States and 8Territories had statutes banning or limiting abortion. J.Mohr, Abortion in America 200 (1978). By the turn of thecentury virtually every State had a law prohibiting or re-stricting abortion on its books. By the middle of the presentcentury, a liberalization trend had set in. But 21 of the re-strictive abortion laws in effect in 1868 were still in effect in1973 when Roe was decided, and an overwhelming majority of the States prohibited abortion unless necessary to pre-serve the life or health of the mother. Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S., at 139\u00b1140; id.,at 176\u00b1177, n. 2 ( Rehnquist, J. , dissent- ing). On this record, it can scarcely be said that any deeplyrooted tradition of relatively unrestricted abortion in our his-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 953 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. tory supported the classi\u00aecation of the right to abortion as \u00aafundamental\u00ba under the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment. We think, therefore, both in view of this history and of our decided cases dealing with substantive liberty under the DueProcess Clause, that the Court was mistaken in Roe when it classi\u00aeed a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy asa \u00aafundamental right\u00ba that could be abridged only in a man-ner which withstood \u00aastrict scrutiny.\u00ba In so concluding, werepeat the observation made in Bowers v.Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986): \u00aaNor are we inclined to take a more expansive view of our authority to discover new fundamental rights im-bedded in the Due Process Clause. The Court is mostvulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when itdeals with judge-made constitutional law having littleor no cognizable roots in the language or design of theConstitution.\u00ba Id.,at 194. We believe that the sort of constitutionally imposed abor- tion code of the type illustrated by our decisions followingRoe is inconsistent \u00aawith the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms, as ours is, and usually speaking in generalprinciples, as ours does.\u00ba Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 518 (plurality opinion). The Court in Roe reached too far when it analogized the right to abort a fetus to the rights involved in Pierce, Meyer, Loving, and Griswold, and thereby deemed the right to abortion fundamental. II The joint opinion of Justices O\u0092Connor, Kennedy , and Souter cannot bring itself to say that Roe was correct as an original matter, but the authors are of the view that \u00aatheimmediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accordedto its holding.\u00ba Ante, at 871. Instead of claiming that Roe505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 954 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. was correct as a matter of original constitutional interpreta- tion, the opinion therefore contains an elaborate discussion ofstare decisis. This discussion of the principle of stare decisis appears to be almost entirely dicta, because the joint opiniondoes not apply that principle in dealing with Roe. Roe de- cided that a woman had a fundamental right to an abortion.The joint opinion rejects that view. Roe decided that abor- tion regulations were to be subjected to \u00aastrict scrutiny\u00ba andcould be justi\u00aeed only in the light of \u00aacompe lling state in- terests.\u00ba The joint opinion rejects that view. Ante, at 872\u00b1873; see Roe v.Wade, supra, at 162\u00b1164. Roe analyzed abortion regulation under a rigid trimester framework, aframework which has guided this Court's decisionmaking for 19 years. The joint opinion rejects that framework. Ante, at 873. Stare decisis is de\u00aened in Black's Law Dictionary as mean- ing \u00aato abide by, or adhere to, decided cases.\u00ba Black's LawDictionary 1406 (6th ed. 1990). Whatever the \u00aacentral hold-ing\u00ba of Roe that is left after the joint opinion \u00aenishes dissect- ing it is surely not the result of that principle. While pur-porting to adhere to precedent, the joint opinion insteadrevises it. Roe continues to exist, but only in the way a storefront on a western movie set exists: a mere facade to give the illusion of reality. Decisions following Roe, such as Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986), are frankly overruled in part under the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standardexpounded in the joint opinion. Ante, at 881\u00b1884. In our view, authentic principles of stare decisis do not require that any portion of the reasoning in Roe be kept in- tact. \u00aa Stare decisis i sn o t...a universal, inexorable com- mand,\u00ba especially in cases involving the interpretation of theFederal Constitution.

It is therefore our duty to reconsider constitutional interpretations that \u00aade-par[t] from a proper understanding\u00ba of the Constitution.Garcia v.San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.

S. 649, 665 (1944). Our constitutional watch does not cease merely because we have spoken beforeon an issue; when it becomes clear that a prior constitutionalinterpretation is unsound we are obliged to reexamine thequestion. See, e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943); Erie R. Co. v.Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 74\u00b178 (1938). The joint opinion discusses several stare decisis factors which, it asserts, point toward retaining a portion of Roe. Two of these factors are that the main \u00aafactual underpin-ning\u00ba of Roe has remained the same, and that its doctrinal foundation is no weaker now than it was in 1973. Ante, at 857\u00b1860. Of course, what might be called the basic factswhich gave rise to Roe have remained the same\u00d0women be- come pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending onmedical technology, where a fetus becomes viable, andwomen give birth to children. But this is only to say that thesame facts which gave rise to Roe will continue to give rise to similar cases. It is not a reason, in and of itself, why thosecases must be decided in the same incorrect manner as was the \u00aerst case to deal with the question. And surely there isno requirement, in considering whether to depart from stare decisis in a constitutional case, that a decision be more wrong now than it was at the time it was rendered. If that weretrue, the most outlandish constitutional decision could sur-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 956 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. vive forever, based simply on the fact that it was no more outlandish later than it was when originally rendered. Nor does the joint opinion faithfully follow this alleged re- quirement. The opinion frankly concludes that Roe and its progeny were wrong in fa iling to recognize that the State's interests in maternal health and in the protection of unbornhuman life exist throughout pregnancy. Ante, at 871\u00b1873. But there is no indication that these components of Roe are any more incorrect at this juncture than they were at itsinception. The joint opinion also points to the reliance interests in- volved in this context in its effort to explain why precedentmust be followed for precedent's sake. Certainly it is truethat where reliance is truly at issue, as in the case of judicialdecisions that have formed the basis for private decisions,\u00aa[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme.\u00ba Payne v.Tennessee, 501 U. S., at 828. But, as the joint opin- ion apparently agrees, ante, at 855\u00b1856, any traditional no- tion of reliance is not applicable here. The Court today cutsback on the protection afforded by Roe, and no one claims that this action defeats any reliance interest in the disa-vowed trimester framework. Similarly, reliance interestswould not be diminished were the Court to go further andacknowledge the full error of Roe, as \u00aareproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of\u00ba this action.Ante, at 856. The joint opinion thus turns to what can only be described as an unconventional\u00d0and unconvincing\u00d0notion of reliance,a view based on the surmise that the availability of abortionsince Roe has led to \u00aatwo decades of economic and social developments\u00ba that would be undercut if the error of Roe were recognized. Ante, at 856. The joint opinion's asser- tion of this fact is undeveloped and totally conclusory. Infact, one cannot be sure to what economic and social develop-ments the opinion is referring. Surely it is dubious to sug-gest that women have reached their \u00aaplaces in society\u00ba in505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 957 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. reliance upon Roe, rather than as a result of their determina- tion to obtain higher education and compete with men in thejob market, and of society's increasing recognition of theirability to \u00aell positions that were previously thought to bereserved only for men. Ante, at 856. In the end, having failed to put forth any evidence to prove any true reliance, the joint opinion's argument is based solelyon generalized assertions about the national psyche, on a be-lief that the people of this country have grown accustomedto the Roe decision over the last 19 years and have \u00aaordered their thinking and living around\u00ba it. Ante, at 856. As an initial matter, one might inquire how the joint opinion canview the \u00aacentral holding\u00ba of Roe as so deeply rooted in our constitutional culture, when it so casually uproots and dis-poses of that same decision's trimester framework. Further-more, at various points in the past, the same could have beensaid about this Court's erroneous decisions that the Constitu-tion allowed \u00aaseparate but equal\u00ba treatment of minorities,seePlessy v.Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), or that \u00aaliberty\u00ba under the Due Process Clause protected \u00aafreedom of con-tract,\u00ba see Adkins v.Children's Hospital of District of Co- lumbia, 261 U. S. 525 (1923); Lochner v.New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The \u00aaseparate but equal\u00ba doctrine lasted 58 yearsafter Plessy, and Lochner 's protection of contractual free- dom lasted 32 years. However, the simple fact that a gener-ation or more had grown used to these major decisions didnot prevent the Court from correcting its errors in thosecases, nor should it prevent us from correctly interpretingthe Constitution here. See Brown v.Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (rejecting the \u00aaseparate but equal\u00ba doc-trine); West Coast Hotel Co. v.Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v.Children's Hospital, supra, in uphold- ing Washington's minimum wage law). Apparently realizing that conventional stare decisis princi- ples do not support its position, the joint opinion advances abelief that retaining a portion of Roe is necessary to protect505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 958 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. the \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba of this Court. Ante, at 861\u00b1869. Because the Court must take care to render decisions \u00aagroundedtruly in principle,\u00ba and not simply as political and social com-promises, ante, at 865, the joint opinion properly declares it to be this Court's duty to ignore the public criticism andprotest that may arise as a result of a decision. Few wouldquarrel with this statement, although it may be doubted thatMembers of this Court, holding their tenure as they do dur-ing constitutional \u00aagood behavior,\u00ba are at all likely to be in-timidated by such public protests. But the joint opinion goes on to state that when the Court \u00aaresolve[s] the sort of intensely divisive controversy re-\u00afected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases,\u00ba its decision is exempt from reconsideration under established principlesofstare decisis in constitutional cases. Ante, at 866. This is so, the joint opinion contends, because in those \u00aaintenselydivisive\u00ba cases the Court has \u00aacall[ed] the contending sidesof a national controversy to end their national division byaccepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\u00baand must therefore take special care not to be perceived as\u00aasurrender[ing] to political pressure\u00ba and continued opposi-tion. Ante, at 866, 867. This is a truly novel principle, one which is contrary to both the Court's historical practice andto the Court's traditional w illing ness to tolerate criticism of its opinions. Under this principle, when the Court has ruledon a divisive issue, it is apparently prevented from overrul-ing that decision for the sole reason that it was incorrect,unless opposition to the original decision has died away. The \u00aerst dif\u00aeculty with this principle lies in its assumption that cases that are \u00aaintensely divisive\u00ba can be readily distin-guished from those that are not. The question of whether aparticular issue is \u00aaintensely divisive\u00ba enough to qualify forspecial protection is entirely subjective and dependent on theindividual assumptions of the Members of this Court. Inaddition, because the Court's duty is to ignore public opinionand criticism on issues that come before it, its Members are505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 959 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. in perhaps the worst position to judge whether a decision divides the Nation deeply enough to justify such uncommonprotection. Although many of the Court's decisions dividethe populace to a large degree, we have not previously onthat account shied away from applying normal rules of stare decisis when urged to reconsider earlier decisions. Over the past 21 years, for example, the Court has overruled inwhole or in part 34 of its previous constitutional decisions.See Payne v.Tennessee, supra, at 828\u00b1830, and n. 1 (listing cases). The joint opinion picks out and discusses two prior Court rulings that it believes are of the \u00aaintensely divisive\u00ba variety,and concludes that they are of comparable dimension to Roe. Ante, at 861\u00b1864 (discussing Lochner v.New York, supra, and Plessy v.Ferguson, supra ). It appears to us very odd indeed that the joint opinion chooses as benchmarks twocases in which the Court chose not to adhere to erroneous constitutional precedent, but instead enhanced its stature byacknowledging and correcting its error, apparently in viola-tion of the joint opinion's \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba principle. See West Coast Co. v.Parrish, supra; Brown v.Board of Educa- tion, supra. One might also wonder how it is that the joint opinion puts these, and not others, in the \u00aaintensely divisive\u00bacategory, and how it assumes that these are the only twolines of cases of comparable dimension to Roe. There is no reason to think that either Plessy orLochner produced the sort of public protest when they were decided that Roe did. There were undoubtedly large segments of the bench andbar who agreed with the dissenting views in those cases, butsurely that cannot be what the Court means when it uses theterm \u00aaintensely divisive,\u00ba or many other cases would haveto be added to the list. In terms of public protest, however,Roe, so far as we know, was unique. But just as the Court should not respond to that sort of protest by retreating fromthe decision simply to allay the concerns of the protesters, itshould likewise not respond by determining to adhere to the505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 960 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. decision at all costs lest it seem to be retreating under \u00aere. Public protests should not alter the normal application ofstare decisis, lest perfectly lawful protest activity be penal- ized by the Court itself. Taking the joint opinion on its own terms, we doubt that its distinction between Roe, on the one hand, and Plessy and Lochner, on the other, withstands analysis. The joint opin- ion acknowledges that the Court improved its stature byoverruling Plessy inBrown on a deeply divisive issue. And our decision in West Coast Hotel, which overruled Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, and Lochner, was rendered at a time when Congress was considering President FranklinRoosevelt's proposal to \u00aareorganize\u00ba this Court and enablehim to name six additional Justices in the event that anyMember of the Court over the age of 70 did not elect toretire. It is dif\u00aecult to imagine a situation in which theCourt would face more intense opposition to a prior rulingthan it did at that time, and, under the general principle pro-claimed in the joint opinion, the Court seemingly should haveresponded to this opposition by stubbornly refusing to re-examine the Lochner rationale, lest it lose legitimacy by appearing to \u00aaoverrule under \u00aere.\u00ba Ante, at 867. The joint opinion agrees that the Court's stature would have been seriously damaged if in Brown and West Coast Hotel it had dug in its heels and refused to apply normal principles of stare decisis to the earlier decisions. But the opinion contends that the Court was entitled to overrulePlessy and Lochner in those cases, despite the existence of opposition to the original decisions, only because both theNation and the Court had learned new lessons in the interim.This is at best a feebly supported, post hoc rationalization for those decisions. For example, the opinion asserts that the Court could jus- ti\u00aeably overrule its decision in Lochner only because the De- pression had convinced \u00aamost people\u00ba that constitutional pro-tection of freedom contributed to an economy505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 961 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. that failed to protect the welfare of all. Ante, at 861. Surely the joint opinion does not mean to suggest that peoplesaw this Court's failure to uphold minimum wage statutes asthe cause of the Great Depression! In any event, the Loch- nerCourt did not base its rule upon the policy judgment that an unregulated market was fundamental to a stable econ-omy; it simple believed, erroneously, that \u00aaliberty\u00ba under theDue Process Clause protected the \u00aaright to make a contract.\u00baLochner v.New York, 198 U. S., at 53. Nor is it the case that the people of this Nation only discovered the dangers ofextreme laissez-faire economics because of the Depression. State laws regulating maximum hours and minimum wageswere in existence well before that time. A Utah statute ofthat sort enacted in 1896 was involved in our decision inHolden v.Hardy, 169 U. S. 366 (1898), and other States fol- lowed suit shortly afterwards, see, e. g., Muller v.Oregon, 208 U. S. 412 (1908); Bunting v.Oregon, 243 U. S. 426 (1917). These statutes were indeed enacted because of a belief onthe part of their sponsors that \u00aafreedom of contract\u00ba did notprotect the welfare of workers, demonstrating that that be-lief manifested itself more than a generation before the GreatDepression. Whether \u00aamost people\u00ba had come to share it inthe hard times of the 1930's is, insofar as anything the jointopinion advances, entirely speculative. The crucial fa iling at that time was not that workers were not paid a fair wage,but that there was no work available at any wage. When the Court \u00aenally recognized its error in West Coast Hotel, it did not engage in the post hoc rationalization that the joint opinion attributes to it today; it did not state thatLochner had been based on an economic view that had fallen into disfavor, and that it therefore should be overruled.Chief Justice Hughes in his opinion for the Court simply rec-ognized what Justice Holmes had previously recognized inhisLochner dissent, that \u00aa[t]he Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.\u00ba West Coast Hotel Co. v.Parrish, 300 U. S., at Lochner 75 (Holmes,505us3u117 07-09-96 OPINPGT 962 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. J., dissenting) (\u00aa[A] constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and theorganic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez faire \u00ba). Although the Court did acknowledge in the last paragraph of its opinion the state of affairs during the then-current Depression, the theme of the opinion is that theCourt had been mistaken as a matter of constitutional lawwhen it embraced \u00aafreedom of contract\u00ba 32 years previously. The joint opinion also agrees that the Court acted properly in rejecting the doctrine of \u00aaseparate but equal\u00ba in Brown. In fact, the opinion lauds Brown in comparing it to Roe. Ante, at 867. This is strange, in that under the opinion's \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba principle the Court would seemingly have beenforced to adhere to its erroneous decision in Plessy because of its \u00aaintensely divisive\u00ba character. To us, adherence toRoe today under the guise of \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba would seem to resemble more closely adherence to Plessy on the same ground. Fortunately, the Court did not choose that optioninBrown, and instead frankly repudiated Plessy. The joint opinion concludes that such repudiation was justi\u00aeed only be-cause of newly discovered evidence that segregation had theeffect of treating one race as inferior to another. But it canhardly be argued that this was not urged upon those whodecided Plessy, as Justice Harlan observed in his dissent that the law at issue \u00aaputs the brand of servitude and degradationupon a large class of our fellow-citizens, our equals beforethe law.\u00ba Plessy v.Ferguson, 163 U. S., at 562. It is clear that the same arguments made before the Court in Brown were made in Plessy as well. The Court in Brown simply recognized, as Justice Harlan had recognized beforehand,that the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit racial seg-regation. The rule of Brown is not tied to popular opinion about the evils of segregation; it is a judgment that theEqual Protection Clause does not permit racial segregation,no matter whether the public might come to believe that itis bene\u00aecial. On that ground it stands, and on that ground505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 963 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. alone the Court was justi\u00aeed in properly concluding that the Plessy Court had erred. There is also a suggestion in the joint opinion that the propriety of overruling a \u00aadivisive\u00ba decision depends in parton whether \u00aamost people\u00ba would now agree that it should beoverruled. Either the demise of opposition or its progres-sion to substantial popular agreement apparently is requiredto allow the Court to reconsider a divisive decision. Howsuch agreement would be ascertained, short of a public opin-ion poll, the joint opinion does not say. But surely even thesuggestion is totally at war with the idea of \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba in whose name it is invoked. The Judicial Branch derives itslegitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from decid-ing by its best lights whether legislative enactments of thepopular branches of Government comport with the Constitu-tion. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opin-ion than is the basic judicial task. There are other reasons why the joint opinion's discussion of legitimacy is unconvincing as well. In assuming that theCourt is perceived as \u00aasurrender[ing] to political pressure\u00bawhen it overrules a controversial decision, ante, at 867, the joint opinion forgets that there are two sides to any contro-versy. The joint opinion asserts that, in order to protect itslegitimacy, the Court must refrain from overruling a contro-versial decision lest it be viewed as favoring those who op-pose the decision. But a decision to adhere to prior prece- dent is subject to the same criticism, for in such a case onecan easily argue that the Court is responding to those whohave demonstrated in favor of the original decision. Thedecision in Roe has engendered large demonstrations, includ- ing repeated marches on this Court and on Congress, bothin opposition to and in support of that opinion. A decisioneither way on Roe can therefore be perceived as favoring one group or the other. But this perceived dilemma arisesonly if one assumes, as the joint opinion does, that the Court505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 964 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. should make its decisions with a view toward speculative public perceptions. If one assumes instead, as the Courtsurely did in both Brown and West Coast Hotel, that the Court's legitimacy is enhanced by faithful interpretation ofthe Constitution irrespective of public opposition, such self-engendered dif\u00aeculties may be put to one side. Roe is not this Court's only decision to generate con\u00afict. Our decisions in some recent capital cases, and in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), have also engendered demon- strations in opposition. The joint opinion's message to suchprotesters appears to be that they must cease their activities in order to serve their cause, because their protests will onlycement in place a decision which by normal standards ofstare decisis should be reconsidered. Nearly a century ago, Justice David J. Brewer of this Court, in an article discussingcriticism of its decisions, observed that \u00aamany criticisms maybe, like their authors, devoid of good taste, but better allsorts of criticism than no criticism at all.\u00ba Justice Breweron \u00aaThe Nation's Anchor,\u00ba 57 Albany L. J. 166, 169 (1898).This was good advice to the Court then, as it is today.Strong and often misguided criticism of a decision should notrender the decision immune from reconsideration, lest a fe-tish for legitimacy penalize freedom of expression. The end result of the joint opinion's paeans of praise for legitimacy is the enunciation of a brand new standard forevaluating state regulation of a woman's right to abortion\u00d0the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard. As indicated above, Roe v. Wade adopted a \u00aafundamental right\u00ba standard under which state regulations could survive only if they met the require-ment of \u00aastrict scrutiny.\u00ba While we disagree with thatstandard, it at least had a recognized basis in constitutionallaw at the time Roe was decided. The same cannot be said for the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard, which is created largelyout of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion. It isa standard which even today does not command the supportof a majority of this Court. And it will not, we believe, re-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 965 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. sult in the sort of \u00aasimple limitation,\u00ba easily applied, which the joint opinion anticipates. Ante, at 855. In sum, it is a standard which is not built to last. In evaluating abortion regulations under that standard, judges will have to decide whether they place a \u00aasubstantialobstacle\u00ba in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Ante, at 877. In that this standard is based even more on a judge'ssubjective determinations than was the trimester frame-work, the standard will do nothing to prevent \u00aajudges fromroaming at large in the constitutional \u00aeeld\u00ba guided only bytheir personal views. Griswold v.Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 502 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). Because the undueburden standard is plucked from nowhere, the question ofwhat is a \u00aasubstantial obstacle\u00ba to abortion will undoubtedlyengender a variety of con\u00aficting views. For example, in thevery matter before us now, the authors of the joint opinionwould uphold Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period, con-cluding that a \u00aaparticular burden\u00ba on some women is not asubstantial obstacle. Ante, at 887. But the authors would at the same time strike down Pennsylvania's spousal noticeprovision, after \u00aending that in a \u00aalarge fraction\u00ba of cases theprovision will be a substantial obstacle. Ante, at 895. And, while the authors conclude that the informed consent provi-sions do not constitute an \u00aaundue burden,\u00ba Justice Stevens would hold that they do. Ante, at 920\u00b1922. Furthermore, while striking down the spousal notice reg- ulation, the joint opinion would uphold a parental consent restriction that certainly places very substantial obstacles inthe path of a minor's abortion choice. The joint opinion isforthright in admitting that it draws this distinction based ona policy judgment that parents will have the best interests oftheir children at heart, while the same is not necessarily trueof husbands as to their wives. Ante, at 895. This may or may not be a correct judgment, but it is quintessentially alegislative one. The \u00aaundue burden\u00ba inquiry does not in anyway supply the distinction between parental consent and505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 966 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. spousal consent which the joint opinion adopts. Despite the efforts of the joint opinion, the undue burden standard pre-sents nothing more workable than the trimester framework which it discards today. Under the guise of the Constitu-tion, this Court will still impart its own preferences on theStates in the form of a complex abortion code. The sum of the joint opinion's labors in the name of stare decisis and \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba is this: Roe v.Wade stands as a sort of judicial Potemkin Village, which may be pointed out topassers-by as a monument to the importance of adhering toprecedent. But behind the facade, an entirely new methodof analysis, without any roots in constitutional law, is im-ported to decide the constitutionality of state laws regulat-ing abortion. Neither stare decisis nor \u00aalegitimacy\u00ba are truly served by such an effort. We have stated above our belief that the Constitution does not subject state abortion regulations to heightened scrutiny.Accordingly, we think that the correct analysis is that setforth by the plurality opinion in Webster. A woman's inter- est in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected bythe Due Process Clause, but States may regulate abortionprocedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate stateinterest. Williamson v.Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. Stanley v.Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651\u00b1653 (1972). With this rule in mind, we examine each ofthe challenged provisions.

Section 3205(a)(2) requires a physi-cian or a nonphysician counselor to inform the woman that(i) the state health department publishes free materials de-scribing the fetus at different stages and listing abortion al-ternatives; (ii) medical assistance bene\u00aets may be availablefor prenatal, childbirth, and neonatal care; and (iii) the child's father is liable for child support. The Act also imposes a24-hour waiting period between the time that the womanreceives the required information and the time that the phy-sician is allowed to perform the abortion. See Appendix to opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ .,ante, at 902\u00b1904. This Court has held that it is certainly within the province of the States to require a woman's voluntary and informedconsent to an abortion. See Thornburgh v.American Col- lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 760. Here, Pennsylvania seeks to further its legitimate interest inobtaining informed consent by ensuring that each woman \u00aaisaware not only of the reasons for having an abortion, butalso of the risks associated with an abortion and the avail-ability of assistance that might make the alternative of nor-mal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise ap-pear.\u00ba Id.,at 798\u00b1799 ( White, J. , dissenting). We conclude that this provision of the statute is rationally related to the State's interest in assuring that a woman'sconsent to an abortion be a fully informed decision. Section 3205(a)(1) requires a physician to disclose certain information about the abortion procedure and its risks andalternatives. This requirement is certainly no large burden,as the Court of Appeals found that \u00aathe record shows thatthe clinics, without exception, insist on providing this infor-mation to women before an abortion is performed.\u00ba 947F. 2d, at 703. We are of the view that this information\u00aaclearly is related to maternal health and to the State's legit-imate purpose in requiring informed consent.\u00ba Akron v.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 968 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S., at 446. An accurate description of the gestational age of thefetus and of the risks involved in carrying a child to termhelps to further both those interests and the State's legiti-mate interest in unborn human life. See id., at 445\u00b1446, n. 37 (required disclosure of gestational age of the fetus \u00aacer-tainly is not objectionable\u00ba). Although petitioners contendthat it is unreasonable for the State to require that a physi-cian, as opposed to a nonphysician counselor, disclose thisinformation, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a State\u00aamay rationally decide that physicians are better quali\u00aeed than counselors to impart this information and answer ques-tions about the medical aspects of the available alternatives.\u00ba947 F. 2d, at 704. Section 3205(a)(2) compels the disclosure, by a physician or a counselor, of information concerning the availability ofpaternal child support and state-funded alternatives if thewoman decides to proceed with her pregnancy. Here again,the Court of Appeals observed that \u00aathe record indicatesthat most clinics already require that a counselor consult inperson with the woman about alternatives to abortion beforethe abortion is performed.\u00ba Id.,at 704\u00b1705. And petition- ers do not claim that the information required to be disclosedby statute is in any way false or inaccurate; indeed, theCourt of Appeals found it to be \u00aarelevant, accurate, and non-in\u00afammatory.\u00ba Id.,at 705. We conclude that this required presentation of \u00aabalanced information\u00ba is rationally relatedto the State's legitimate interest in ensuring that the wom-an's consent is truly informed, Thornburgh v.American Col- lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 830 (O\u0092Connor, J. , dissenting), and in addition furthers the State's interest in preserving unborn life. That the infor-mation might create some uncertainty and persuade somewomen to forgo abortions does not lead to the conclusion thatthe Constitution forbids the provision of such information.Indeed, it only demonstrates that this information might505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 969 Cite as: 505 U.

Cf. id., at 801 ( White, J. , dissenting) (\u00aa[T]he ostensible objective of Roe v.Wade is not maximizing the number of abortions, but maximizingchoice\u00ba). We acknowledge that in Thornburgh this Court struck down informed consent requirements similar to theones at issue here. See id.,at 760\u00b1764. It is clear, how- ever, that while the detailed framework of Roe led to the Court's invalidation of those informational requirements,they \u00aawould have been sustained under any traditionalstandard of judicial review ,...o rf o ra n y other surgical procedure except abortion.\u00ba Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 517 (plurality opinion) (citing Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gyne- cologists, 476 U. 802 ( White, J. , dissenting); id.,at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting)). In light of our rejection of Roe's \u00aafundamental right\u00ba approach to this subject, we do not re-gard Thornburgh as contro lling. For the same reason, we do not feel bound to follow this Court's previous holding that a State's 24-hour mandatorywaiting period is unconstitutional. See Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra, at 449\u00b1451. Petitioners are correct that such a provision will result indelays for some women that might not otherwise exist,therefore placing a burden on their liberty. But the provi-sion in no way prohibits abortions, and the informed consentand waiting period requirements do not apply in the case ofa medical emergency. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a), (b)(1990). We are of the view that, in providing time for re-\u00afection and reconsideration, the waiting period helps ensurethat a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, andreasonably furthers the State's legitimate interest in mater-nal health and in the unborn life of the fetus. It \u00aais surelya small cost to impose to ensure that the woman's decision iswell considered in light of its certain and irreparable conse-505us3117H 05-19-99 10:05:55 PAGES OPINPGT 970 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. quences on fetal life, and the possible effects on her own.\u00ba 462 U. S., at 474 ( O\u0092Connor, J. , dissenting). B In addition to providing her own informed consent, before an unemancipated woman under the age of 18 may obtain anabortion she must either furnish the consent of one of herparents, or must opt for the judicial procedure that allowsher to bypass the consent requirement. Under the judicialbypass option, a minor can obtain an abortion if a state court\u00aends that she is capable of giving her informed consent andhas indeed given such consent, ordetermines that an abor- tion is in her best interests. Records of these court pro-ceedings are kept con\u00aedential. The Act directs the statetrial court to render a decision within three days of thewoman's application, and the entire procedure, includingappeal to Pennsylvania Superior Court, is to last no longerthan eight business days. The parental consent require-ment does not apply in the case of a medical emergency. 18Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3206 (1990). See Appendix to opinion ofO\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ .,ante, at 904\u00b1906. This provision is entirely consistent with this Court's pre- vious decisions involving parental consent requirements.See Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (upholding parental consent requirement with a similar judicial bypass option); Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra, at 439\u00b1 440 (approving of parental consent statutes that include ajudicial bypass option allowing a pregnant minor to \u00aademon-strate that she is suf\u00aeciently mature to make the abortiondecision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortionwould be in her best interests\u00ba); Bellotti v.Baird, 443 U.

A requirement of parental consent to abortion, like myriad other restrictions placed upon minors in other con-texts, is reasonably designed to further this important andlegitimate state interest. In our view, it is entirely \u00aarationaland fair for the State to conclude that, in most instances, thefamily will strive to give a lonely or even terri\u00aeed minor advice that is both compassionate and mature.\u00ba Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S., at 520 (opinion of Kennedy, J. ); see also Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S., at 91 (Stewart, J., concur- ring) (\u00aaThere can be little doubt that the State furthers aconstitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmar-ried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her par-ents in making the very important decision whether or notto bear a child\u00ba). We thus conclude that Pennsylvania's pa-rental consent requirement should be upheld. C Section 3209 of the Act contains the spousal noti\u00aecation provision. It requires that, before a physician may performan abortion on a married woman, the woman must sign astatement indicating that she has noti\u00aeed her husband of herplanned abortion. A woman is not required to notify herhusband if (1) her husband is not the father, (2) her husband,after diligent effort, cannot be located, (3) the pregnancy isthe result of a spousal sexual assault that has been reportedto the authorities, or (4) the woman has reason to believethat notifying her husband is likely to result in the in\u00afictionof bodily injury upon her by him or by another individual.In addition, a woman is exempted from the noti\u00aecation re-quirement in the case of a medical emergency. 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3209 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ .,ante, at 908\u00b1909.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 972 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. We \u00aerst emphasize that Pennsylvania has not imposed a spousal consent requirement of the type the Court struck down in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67\u00b172. Missouri's spousal consent provision wasinvalidated in that case because of the Court's view that itunconstitutionally granted to the husband \u00aaa veto power ex-ercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all.\u00baId., at 71. But the provision here involves a much less in- trusive requirement of spousal noti\u00aecation, not consent. Such a law requiring only notice to the husband \u00aadoes notgive any third party the legal right to make the [woman's] decision for her, or to prevent her from obtaining an abortionshould she choose to have one performed.\u00ba Hodgson v. Minnesota, supra, at 496 ( Kennedy, J. , concurring in judg- ment in part and dissenting in part); see H. L. v.Matheson, 450 U. S., at 411, n. 17. Danforth thus does not control our analysis. Petitioners contend that it should, however; theyargue that the real effect of such a notice requirement is togive the power to husbands to veto a woman's abortionchoice. The District Court indeed found that the noti\u00aeca-tion provision created a risk that some woman who wouldotherwise have an abortion will be prevented from havingone. 947 F. 2d, at 712. For example, petitioners argue,many noti\u00aeed husbands will prevent abortions through phys-ical force, psychological coercion, and other types of threats.But Pennsylvania has incorporated exceptions in the noticeprovision in an attempt to deal with these problems. Forinstance, a woman need not notify her husband if the preg-nancy is the result of a reported sexual assault, or if she hasreason to believe that she would suffer bodily injury as aresult of the noti\u00aecation. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3209(b) (1990).Furthermore, because this is a facial challenge to the Act,it is insuf\u00aecient for petitioners to show that the noti\u00aecationprovision \u00aamight operate unconstitutionally under some con-ceivable set of circumstances.\u00ba United States v.Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). Thus, it is not enough for petition-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 973 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. ers to show that, in some \u00aaworst case\u00ba circumstances, the notice provision will operate as a grant of veto power to hus- bands. Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S., at 514. Because they are making a facial challenge tothe provision, they must \u00aashow that no set of circumstancesexists under which the [provision] would be valid.\u00ba Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This they have failedto do. 2 2The joint opinion of Justices O\u0092Connor, Kennedy , and Souter ap- pears to ignore this point in concluding that the spousal notice provisionimposes an undue burden on the abortion decision. Ante, at 887\u00b1898. In most instances the noti\u00aecation requirement operates without dif\u00aeculty.As the District Court found, the vast majority of wives seeking abortionsnotify and consult with their husbands, and thus suffer no burden as aresult of the provision. 744 F. Supp. 1323, 1360 (ED Pa. 1990). In otherinstances where a woman does not want to notify her husband, the Actprovides exceptions. For example, noti\u00aecation is not required if the hus-band is not the father, if the pregnancy is the result of a reported spousalsexual assault, or if the woman fears bodily injury as a result of notifyingher husband. Thus, in these instances as well, the noti\u00aecation provisionimposes no obstacle to the abortion decision. The joint opinion puts to one side these situations where the regulation imposes no obstacle at all, and instead focuses on the group of marriedwomen who would not otherwise notify their husbands and who do notqualify for one of the exceptions. Having narrowed the focus, the jointopinion concludes that in a \u00aalarge fraction\u00ba of those cases, the noti\u00aecationprovision operates as a substantial obstacle, ante, at 895, and that the provi- sion is therefore invalid. There are certainly instances where a womanwould prefer not to notify her husband, and yet does not qualify for anexception. For example, there are the situations of battered women whofear psychological abuse or injury to their children as a result of noti\u00aeca-tion; because in these situations the women do not fear bodily injury, theydo not qualify for an exception. And there are situations where a womanhas become pregnant as a result of an unreported spousal sexual assault;when such an assault is unreported, no exception is available. But, as theDistrict Court found, there are also instances where the woman prefersnot to notify her husband for a variety of other reasons. See 744 F. Supp.,at 1360. For example, a woman might desire to obtain an abortion with-out her husband's knowledge because of perceived economic constraintsor her husband's previously expressed opposition to abortion. The joint505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 974 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. The question before us is therefore whether the spousal noti\u00aecation requirement rationally furthers any legitimatestate interests. We conclude that it does. First, a hus-band's interests in procreation within marriage and in thepotential life of his unborn child are certainly substantialones. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S., at 69 (\u00aaWe are not unaware of the deep and properconcern and interest that a devoted and protective husbandhas in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and develop-ment of the fetus she is carrying\u00ba); id., at 93 ( White, J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part); Skinner v.Okla- homa ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S., at 541. The State itself has legitimate interests both in protecting these interests ofthe father and in protecting the potential life of the fetus,and the spousal noti\u00aecation requirement is reasonably re-lated to advancing those state interests. By providing thata husband will usually know of his spouse's intent to have anabortion, the provision makes it more likely that the husbandwill participate in deciding the fate of his unborn child, apossibility that might otherwise have been denied him.This participation might in some cases result in a decision toproceed with the pregnancy. As Judge Alito observed inhis dissent below, \u00aa[t]he Pennsylvania legislature could haverationally believed that some married women are initiallyinclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands' knowl-edge because of perceived problems\u00d0such as economic con-straints, future plans, or the husbands' previously expressed opinion concentrates on the situations involving battered women and unre- ported spousal assault, and assumes, without any support in the record,that these instances constitute a \u00aalarge fraction\u00ba of those cases in whichwomen prefer not to notify their husbands (and do not qualify for an excep-tion). Ante, at 895. This assumption is not based on any hard evidence, however. And were it helpful to an attempt to reach a desired result, onecould just as easily assume that the battered women situations form 100percent of the cases where women desire not to notify, or that they consti-tute only 20 percent of those cases. But reliance on such speculation isthe necessary result of adopting the undue burden standard.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 975 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. opposition\u00d0that may be obviated by discussion prior to the abortion.\u00ba 947 F. 2d, at 726 (opinion concurring in part anddissenting in part). The State also has a legitimate interest in promoting \u00aathe integrity of the marital relationship.\u00ba 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.\u00a7 3209(a) (1990). This Court has previously recognized \u00aatheimportance of the marital relationship in our society.\u00baPlanned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, supra, at 69. In our view, the spousal notice requirement is a rationalattempt by the State to improve truthful communication be-tween spouses and encourage collaborative decisionmaking, and thereby fosters marital integrity. See Labine v.Vin- cent, 401 U. S. 532, 538 (1971) (\u00aa[T]he power to make rules to establish, protect, and strengthen family life\u00ba is com-mitted to the state legislatures). Petitioners argue that thenoti\u00aecation requirement does not further any such interest;they assert that the majority of wives already notify theirhusbands of their abortion decisions, and the remainder haveexcellent reasons for keeping their decisions a secret. Inthe \u00aerst case, they argue, the law is unnecessary, and in thesecond case it will only serve to foster marital discord andthreats of harm. Thus, petitioners see the law as a totallyirrational means of furthering whatever legitimate interestthe State might have. But, in our view, it is unrealistic toassume that every husband-wife relationship is either (1) soperfect that this type of truthful and important communica-tion will take place as a matter of course, or (2) so imperfectthat, upon notice, the husband will react sel\u00aeshly, violently,or contrary to the best interests of his wife. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, supra, at 103\u00b1104 (Stevens, J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part) (making a similar point in the context of a parental consentstatute). The spousal notice provision will admittedly beunnecessary in some circumstances, and possibly harmful inothers, but \u00aathe existence of particular cases in which a fea-ture of a statute performs no function (or is even counterpro-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 976 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. ductive) ordinarily does not render the statute unconstitu- tional or even constitutionally suspect.\u00ba Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 800 ( White, J. , dissenting). The Pennsylvania Leg- islature was in a position to weigh the likely bene\u00aets of theprovision against its likely adverse effects, and presumablyconcluded, on balance, that the provision would be bene\u00aecial.Whether this was a wise decision or not, we cannot say thatit was irrational. We therefore conclude that the spousalnotice provision comports with the Constitution. See Har- risv.McRae, 448 U. S., at 325\u00b1326 (\u00aaIt is not the mission of this Court or any other to decide whether the balance ofcompeting interest s...i sw i s e social policy\u00ba). D The Act also imposes various reporting requirements. Section 3214(a) requires that abortion facilities \u00aele a reporton each abortion performed. The reports do not include theidentity of the women on whom abortions are performed, butthey do contain a variety of information about the abortions.For example, each report must include the identities of theperforming and referring physicians, the gestational age ofthe fetus at the time of abortion, and the basis for any medi-cal judgment that a medical emergency existed. See 18 Pa.Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3214(a)(1), (5), (10) (1990). See Appendix toopinion of O\u0092Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ .,ante, at 909\u00b1911. The District Court found that these reports arekept completely con\u00aedential. 947 F. 2d, at 716. We furtherconclude that these reporting requirements rationally fur-ther the State's legitimate interests in advancing the stateof medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prena-tal life, in gathering statistical information with respect topatients, and in ensuring compliance with other provisionsof the Act. Section 3207 of the Act requires each abortion facility to \u00aele a report with its name and address, as well as the names505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:05 PAGES OPINPGT 977 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. and addresses of any parent, subsidiary, or af\u00aeliated organi- zations. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3207(b) (1990). Section 3214(f)further requires each facility to \u00aele quarterly reports statingthe total number of abortions performed, broken down bytrimester. Both of these reports are available to the publiconly if the facility received state funds within the preceding12 months. See Appendix to opinion of O\u0092Connor, Ken- nedy, and Souter, JJ .,ante, at 906, 911. Petitioners do not challenge the requirement that facilities provide this infor-mation. They contend, however, that the forced public dis-closure of the information given by facilities receiving publicfunds serves no legitimate state interest. We disagree. Rec-ords relating to the expenditure of public funds are generallyavailable to the public under Pennsylvania law. See Pa.Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, \u00a7\u00a7 66.1, 66.2 (Purdon 1959 and Supp. 1991\u00b11992). As the Court of Appeals observed, \u00aa[w]hen a stateprovides money to a private commercial enterprise, there isa legitimate public interest in informing taxpayers who thefunds are bene\u00aeting and what services the funds are support-ing.\u00ba 947 F. 2d, at 718. These reporting requirements ra-tionally further this legitimate state interest. E Finally, petitioners challenge the medical emergency ex- ception provided for by the Act. The existence of a medicalemergency exempts compliance with the Act's informed con-sent, parental consent, and spousal notice condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the im-mediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death orfor which a delay will create serious risk of substantial505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 978 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.\u00ba \u00a7 3203. Petitioners argued before the District Court that the stat- utory de\u00aenition was inadequate because it did not coverthree serious conditions that pregnant women can suffer\u00d0preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and prematurely rupturedmembrane. The District Court agreed with petitioners thatthe medical emergency exception was inadequate, but theCourt of Appeals reversed this holding. In construing themedical emergency provision, the Court of Appeals \u00aerst ob-served that all three conditions do indeed present the risk ofserious injury or death when an abortion is not performed,and noted that the medical profession's uniformly prescribedtreatment for each of the three conditions is an immediateabortion. See 947 F. 2d, at 700\u00b1701. Finding that \u00aa[t]hePennsylvania legislature did not choose the wording of itsmedical emergency exception in a vacuum,\u00ba the court readthe exception as intended \u00aato assure that compliance with itsabortion regulations would not in any way pose a signi\u00aecantthreat to the life or health of a woman.\u00ba Id., at 701. It thus concluded that the exception encompassed each of thethree dangerous conditions pointed to by petitioners. We observe that Pennsylvania's present de\u00aenition of medi- cal emergency is almost an exact copy of that State's de\u00aeni-tion at the time of this Court's ruling in Thornburgh, one which the Court made reference to with apparent approval.476 U. S., at 771 (\u00aaIt is clear that the Pennsylvania Legisla-ture knows how to provide a medical-emergency exceptionwhen it chooses to do so\u00ba). 3We \u00aend that the interpretation 3The de\u00aenition in that time provided as follows: \u00aa `Medical emergency.' That condition which, on the basis of the physi- cian's best clinical judgment, so complicates a pregnancy as to necessitatethe immediate abortion of same to avert the death of the mother or forwhich a 24-hour delay will create grave peril of immediate and irreversible loss of major bodily function.\u00ba Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a7 3203 (Purdon1983).505us3u117 07-09-96 PAGES OPINPGT 979 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. of the Court of Appeals in these cases is eminently reason- able, and that the provision thus should be upheld. When awoman is faced with any condition that poses a \u00aasigni\u00aecantthreat to [her] life or health,\u00ba she is exempted from the Act'sconsent and notice requirements and may proceed immedi-ately with her abortion. IV For the reasons stated, we therefore would hold that each of the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute isconsistent with the Constitution. It bears emphasis thatour conclusion in this regard does not carry with it any nec-essary approval of these regulations. Our task is, as always,to decide only whether the challenged provisions of a lawcomport with the United States Constitution. If, as we be-lieve, these do, their wisdom as a matter of public policy isfor the people of Pennsylvania to decide. Justice Scalia , with whom The Chief Justice, Justice White , and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judg- ment in part and dissenting in part. My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinions in Webster v.Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 532 (1989) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and Ohio v.Akron Cen- ter for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 520 (1990) (Akron II)(concurring opinion). The States may, if they wish, per- mit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not re- quire them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most importantquestions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuadeone another and then voting. As the Court acknowledges,\u00aawhere reasonable people disagree the government canadopt one position or the other.\u00ba Ante, at 851. The Court is correct in adding the quali\u00aecation that this \u00aaassumes astate of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon aprotected liberty,\u00ba ibid. \u00d0but the crucial part of that quali-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 980 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Scalia, J. \u00aecation is the penultimate word. A State's choice between two positions on which reasonable people can disagree is con-stitutional even when (as is often the case) it intrudes upona \u00aaliberty\u00ba in the absolute sense. Laws against bigamy, forexample\u00d0with which entire societies of reasonable peopledisagree\u00d0intrude upon men and women's liberty to marryand live with one another. But bigamy happens not to be aliberty specially \u00aaprotected\u00ba by the Constitution. That is, quite simply, the issue in these cases: not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a \u00aaliberty\u00bain the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of greatimportance to many women. Of course it is both. Theissue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitutionof the United States. I am sure it is not. I reach that con-clusion not because of anything so exalted as my views con-cerning the \u00aaconcept of existence, of meaning, of the uni-verse, and of the mystery of human life.\u00ba Ibid. Rather, I reach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that big-amy is not constitutionally protected\u00d0because of two simplefacts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society havepermitted it to be legally proscribed. 1Akron II, ( 1The Court's suggestion, ante, at 847\u00b1848, that adherence to tradition would require us to uphold laws against interracial marriage is entirelywrong. Any tradition in that case was contradicted by a text \u00d0an Equal Protection Clause that explicitly establishes racial equality as a constitu-tional value. See Loving v.Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 9 (1967) (\u00aaIn the case at bar, . . . we deal with statutes containing racial classi\u00aecations, and the fact ofequal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burdenof justi\u00aecation which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally re-quired of state statutes drawn according to race\u00ba); see also id.,at 13 (Stew- art, J., concurring in judgment). The enterprise launched in Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), by contrast, sought to establish \u00d0in the teeth of a clear, contrary tradition\u00d0a value found nowhere in the constitutional text.

For that reason, it does not follow that the Constitution does not505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 981 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. The Court destroys the proposition, evidently meant to represent my position, that \u00aaliberty\u00ba includes \u00aaonly thosepractices, de\u00aened at the most speci\u00aec level, that were pro-tected against government interference by other rules of lawwhen the Fourteenth Amendment was rati\u00aeed,\u00ba ante, at 847 (citing Michael H. v.Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 127, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J. )). That is not, however, what Michael H.says; it merely observes that, in de\u00aening \u00aaliberty,\u00ba we may not disregard a speci\u00aec, \u00aarelevant tradition protecting,or denying protection to, the asserted right,\u00ba ibid. But the Court does not wish to be fettered by any such limitationson its preferences. The Court's statement that it is \u00aatempt-ing\u00ba to acknowledge the authoritativeness of tradition inorder to \u00aacur[b] the discretion of federal judges,\u00ba ante, at 847, is of course rhetoric rather than reality; no governmentof\u00aecial is \u00aatempted\u00ba to place restraints upon his own freedomof action, which is why Lord Acton did not say \u00aaPower tendsto purify.\u00ba The Court's temptation is in the quite oppositeand more natural direction\u00d0towards systematically elimi-nating checks upon its own power; and it succumbs. Beyond that brief summary of the essence of my position, I will not swell the United States Reports with repetition ofwhat I have said before; and applying the rational basis test,I would uphold the Pennsylvania statute in its entirety. Imust, however, respond to a few of the more outrageous ar-guments in today's opinion, which it is beyond human natureto leave unanswered. I shall discuss each of them under aquotation from the Court's opinion to which they pertain. \u00aaThe inescapable fact is that adjudication of sub- stantive due process c laims may call upon the Court protect childbirth simply because it does not protect abortion. The Court's contention, ante, at 859, that the only way to protect childbirth is to protect abortion shows the utter bankruptcy of constitutional analysisdeprived of tradition as a validating factor. It drives one to say that theonly way to protect the right to eat is to acknowledge the constitutionalright to starve oneself to death.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 982 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Scalia, J. in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always haveexercised: reasoned judgment.\u00ba Ante, at 849. Assuming that the question before us is to be resolved at such a level of philosophical abstraction, in such isolationfrom the traditions of American society, as by simply apply-ing \u00aareasoned judgment,\u00ba I do not see how that could possi-bly have produced the answer the Court arrived at in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Today's opinion describes the methodology of Roe, quite accurately, as weighing against the woman's interest the State's \u00aa `important and legitimateinterest in protecting the potentiality of human life.' \u00baAnte, at 871 (quoting Roe, supra, at 162). But \u00aareasoned judgment\u00ba does not begin by begging the question, as Roe and subsequent cases unquestionably did by assuming thatwhat the State is protecting is the mere \u00aapotentiality ofhuman life.\u00ba See, e. g., Roe, supra, at 162; Planned Parent- hood of Central Mo. v.Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976); Col- autti v.Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 386 (1979); Akron v.Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 428 (1983) (Akron I); Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476, 482 (1983). The whole argument of abortion opponents is that what the Court callsthe fetus and what others call the unborn child is a human life. Thus, whatever answer Roe came up with after con- ducting its \u00aabalancing\u00ba is bound to be wrong, unless it iscorrect that the human fetus is in some critical sense merelypotentially human. There is of course no way to determinethat as a legal matter; it is in fact a value judgment. Somesocieties have considered newborn children not yet human,or the incompetent elderly no longer so. The authors of the joint opinion, of course, do not squarely contend that Roe v.Wade was a correct application of \u00aarea- soned judgment\u00ba; merely that it must be followed, becauseofstare decisis.

Roe was plainly wrong\u00d0even on the Court's methodology of \u00aarea-soned judgment,\u00ba and even more so (of course) if the propercriteria of text and tradition are applied. The emptiness of the \u00aareasoned judgment\u00ba that produced Roe is displayed in plain view by the fact that, after more than 19 years of effort by some of the brightest (and mostdetermined) legal minds in the country, after more than 10cases upholding abortion rights in this Court, and after doz-ens upon dozens of amicus briefs submitted in these and other cases, the best the Court can do to explain how it is thatthe word \u00aaliberty\u00ba must be thought to include the right to de- stroy human fetuses is to rattle off a collection of adjectivesthat simply decorate a value judgment and conceal a politicalchoice. The right to abort, we are told, inheres in \u00aaliberty\u00babecause it is among \u00aaa person's most basic decisions,\u00ba ante, at 849; it involves a \u00aamost intimate and personal choic[e],\u00baante, at 851; it is \u00aacentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\u00ba ibid.; it \u00aaoriginate[s] within the zone of conscience and be- lief,\u00ba ante, at 852; it is \u00aatoo intimate and personal\u00ba for state interference, it re\u00afects views\u00ba of involves \u00aaintimate rela- tionships\u00ba and notions of \u00aapersonal autonomy and bodily in-tegrity,\u00ba ante, at 857; and it concerns a particularly \u00aa `impor- tant decisio[n],' \u00ba ante, at 859 (citation omitted). 2But it is 2Justice Blackmun 's parade of adjectives is similarly empty: Abortion is among \u00aa `the most intimate and personal choices,' \u00ba ante, at 923; it is a matter \u00aacentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\u00ba ibid.; and it involves \u00aapersonal decisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity, identity, anddestiny,\u00ba ante, at 927. Justice Stevens is not much less conclusory: The decision to choose abortion is a matter of \u00aathe highest privacy and the505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 984 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Scalia, J. obvious to anyone applying \u00aareasoned judgment\u00ba that the same adjectives can be applied to many forms of conduct thatthis Court (including one of the Justices in today's majority,seeBowers v.Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986)) has held are notentitled to constitutional protection\u00d0because, like abor- tion, they are forms of conduct that have long been criminal-ized in American society. Those adjectives might be ap-plied, for example, to homosexual sodomy, polygamy, adultincest, and suicide, all of which are and\u00aadeep[ly] personal\u00ba decisions involving \u00aapersonal autonomyand bodily integrity,\u00ba and all of which can constitutionallybe proscribed because it is our unquestionable constitutionaltradition that they are proscribable. It is not reasonedjudgment that supports the Court's decision; only personalpredilection. Justice Curtis's warning is as timely today asit was 135 years ago: \u00aa[W]hen a strict interpretation of the Constitution, ac- cording to the \u00aexed rules which govern the interpreta-tion of laws, is abandoned, and the theoretical opinionsof individuals are allowed to control its meaning, wehave no longer a Constitution; we are under the govern-ment of individual men, who for the time being havepower to declare what the Constitution is, according totheir own views of what it ought to mean.\u00ba Dred Scott v.Sandford, 19 How. 393, 621 (1857) (dissenting opinion). \u00aaLiberty \u00aends no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\u00ba Ante, at 844.

S. 132, 147 (1976) (Bellotti I), was not by way of setting forth the standard of unconstitutionality, as Justice O\u0092Connor 's later opinions did, but by way of expressing the conclusion of unconstitutionality. Justice Powell for a time appeared to employ avariant of \u00aaundue burden\u00ba analysis in several nonmajority opinions, see,e. g., Bellotti v.Baird, 443 U. S. 622, (1979) (Bellotti II); v.Popu- lation Services International, 431 U. S. 705 (1977) (opinion concur- ring in part and concurring in judgment), but he too ultimately rejectedthat standard in his opinion for the Court in Akron v.Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 420, n. 1 (1983) (Akron I) . The joint opinion's reliance on Maher v.Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977), and Harris v.McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 314 (1980), is entirely misplaced, since those cases did not involve regulation of abortion, but mere refusal to fundit. In any event, Justice O\u0092Connor 's earlier formulations have appar- ently now proved unsatisfactory to the three Justices, who\u00d0in the nameofstare decisis no less\u00d0today \u00aend it necessary to devise an entirely new version of \u00aaundue burden\u00ba analysis.

The joint opinion explains that a state regulation imposes an \u00aaundue burden\u00ba if it \u00aahas the purpose or effect of placinga substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking anabortion of a nonviable fetus.\u00ba Ante, at 877; see also ante, at 877\u00b1879. An obstacle is \u00aasubstantial,\u00ba we are told, if it is\u00aacalculated[,] [not] to inform the woman's free choice, [butto] hinder it.\u00ba Ante, at 877. 4This latter statement cannot 4The joint opinion further asserts that a law imposing an undue burden on abortion decisions is not a \u00aapermissible\u00ba means of serving \u00aalegitimate\u00bastate interests. Ante, at 877. This description of the undue burden standard in terms more commonly associated with the rational-basis testwill come as a surprise even to those who have followed closely our wan- derings in this forsaken wilderness. See, e. g., Akron I, supra, at the re- quired threshold inquiry that must be conducted before this Court canrequire a State to justify its legislative actions under the exacting `compel-ling state interest' standard\u00ba); see also ( O\u0092Connor, J. concurring in part and in in part); Thornburgh v.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) ( O\u0092Connor, J. , dissenting). This confusing equation of the two standards is apparently designed to explainhow one of the Justices who joined the plurality opinion in Webster v. Reproduc tive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), which adopted the rational-basis test, could join an opinion expressly adopting the undue bur-den test. See id.,at 520 (rejecting the view that abortion is a \u00aafundamen- tal right,\u00ba instead inquiring whether a law regulating the woman's \u00aalib-erty interest\u00ba in abortion is \u00aareasonably designed\u00ba to further \u00aalegitimate\u00bastate ends). The same motive also apparently underlies the joint opin-ion's erroneous citation of the plurality opinion in Ohio v.Akron Center for Reproduc tive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 506 (1990) (Akron II) (opinion of Kennedy, J. ), as applying the undue burden test. See ante, at 876 (using this citation to support the proposition that \u00aatwo of us\u00ba\u00d0 i. e., two of the authors of the joint opinion\u00d0have previously applied this test). In fact,Akron II does not mention the undue burden standard until the conclusion of the opinion, when it states that the statute at issue \u00aadoes not imposean undue, or otherwise unconstitutional, burden.\u00ba 497 U. S., at 519 (em- phasis added). I fail to see how anyone can think that saying a statutedoes not impose an unconstitutional burden under any standard, including505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 987 Cite as: 505 U. S. 833 (1992) Opinion of Scalia, J. possibly mean what it says. Any regulation of abortion that is intended to advance what the joint opinion concedes is theState's \u00aasubstantial\u00ba interest in protecting unborn life willbe \u00aacalculated [to] hinder\u00ba a decision to have an abortion. Itthus seems more accurate to say that the joint opinion woulduphold abortion regulations only if they do not unduly hin- der the woman's decision. That, of course, brings us rightback to square one: De\u00aening an \u00aaundue hardly thetest. Consciously or not, the joint opinion's verbal shellgame will conceal raw judicial policy choices concerning whatis \u00aaappropriate\u00ba abortion legislation. The ultimately standardless nature of the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba inquiry is a re\u00afection of the underlying fact that the concepthas no principled or coherent legal basis. As The Chief Justice points out, Roe's strict-scrutiny standard \u00aaat least had a recognized basis in constitutional law at the time Roe was decided,\u00ba ante, at 964, while \u00aa[t]he same cannot be said for the `undue burden' standard, which is created largely outof whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion,\u00ba ibid. The joint opinion is \u00afatly wrong in asserting that \u00aaour jurispru-dence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has rec- ognized\u00ba the permissibility of laws that do not impose an\u00aaundue burden.\u00ba Ante, at 873. It argues that the abortion right is similar to other rights in that a law \u00aanot designed tostrike at the right itself, [but which] has the incidental effectof making it more dif\u00aecult or more expensive to [exercise theright,]\u00ba is not invalid. Ante, at 874. I agree, indeed I have the undue burden test, amounts to adopting the undue burden test as the exclusive standard. The Court's citation of Hodgson as re\u00afecting Jus- tice Kennedy 's and Justice O\u0092Connor 's \u00aashared premises,\u00ba ante, at 878, is similarly inexplicable, since the word \u00aaundue\u00ba was never even usedin the former's opinion in that case. I joined Justice Kennedy 's opin- ions in both Hodgson and Akron II; I should be grateful, I suppose, that the joint opinion does not claim that I, too, have adopted the undue bur-den test.505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 988 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Scalia, J. forcefully urged, that a law of general applicability which places only an incidental burden on a fundamental right doesnot infringe that right, see R. A. V. v.St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 389\u00b1390 (1992); Employment Div., Dept. of Human Re- sources of Ore. v.Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 878\u00b1882 (1990), but that principle does not establish the quite different (and quitedangerous) proposition that a law which directly regulates a fundamental right will not be found to violate the Consti-tution unless it imposes an \u00aaundue burden.\u00ba It is that, ofcourse, which is at issue here: Pennsylvania has consciously and directly regulated conduct that our cases have held is constitutionally protected. The appropriate analogy, there-fore, is that of a state law requiring purchasers of religiousbooks to endure a 24-hour waiting period, or to pay a nomi-nal additional tax of 1\u00a2. The joint opinion cannot possiblybe correct in suggesting that we would uphold such legis-lation on the ground that it does not impose a \u00aasubstantialobstacle\u00ba to the exercise of First Amendment rights. The\u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard is not at all the generally applicableprinciple the joint opinion pretends it to be; rather, it is aunique concept created specially for these cases, to preservesome judicial foothold in this ill-gotten territory. In claim-ing otherwise, the three Justices show their w illing ness to place all constitutional rights at risk in an effort to preservewhat they deem the \u00aacentral holding in Roe. \u00baAnte, at 873. The rootless nature of the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard, a phrase plucked out of context from our earlier abortion deci-sions, see n. 3, supra, is further re\u00afected in the fact that the joint opinion \u00aends it necessary expressly to repudiate themore narrow formulations used in Justice O\u0092Connor 's ear- lier opinions. Ante, at 876\u00b1877.

Those strong adjectives are conspicuously missing from the joint opinion, whose authors have for someunexplained reason now determined that a burden is \u00aaundue\u00baif it merely imposes a \u00aasubstantial\u00ba obstacle to abortion deci-sions. See, e. g., ante, at 895, 901. Justice O\u0092Connor has also abandoned (again without explanation) the view she ex-pressed in Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v.Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (dissenting opinion), that a medical regulation which imposes an \u00aaundue burden\u00ba couldnevertheless be upheld if it \u00aareasonably relate[s] to and protection of maternal health,\u00ba id.,at 505 (cita- tion and internal quotation marks omitted).

(That had to be done, of course, since designating the interest as \u00aacompel-ling\u00ba throughout pregnancy would have been, shall we say,a \u00aasubstantial obstacle\u00ba to the joint opinion's determined ef-fort to reaf\u00aerm what it views as the \u00aacentral holding\u00ba of Roe.

Because the portion of the joint opinion adopting and de- scribing the undue burden test provides no more useful guid-ance than the empty phrases discussed above, one must turnto the 23 pages applying that standard to the present factsfor further guidance. In evaluating Pennsylvania's abortionlaw, the joint opinion relies extensively on the factual \u00aend-ings of the District Court, and repeatedly quali\u00aees its conclu-sions by noting that they are contingent upon the record de-veloped in these cases. Thus, the joint opinion would upholdthe 24-hour waiting period contained in the Pennsylvaniastatute's informed consent provision, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.\u00a7 3205 (1990), because \u00aathe record evidence shows that in thevast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create anyappreciable health risk,\u00ba ante, at 885.

I do not, of course, have any objection to the notion that, in applying legal principles, one should rely only upon thefacts that are contained in the record or that are properlysubject to judicial notice. 6But what is remarkable about the joint opinion's fact-intensive analysis is that it does notresult in any measurable clari\u00aecation of the \u00aaundue burden\u00bastandard. Rather, the approach of the joint opinion is, forthe most part, simply to highlight certain facts in the recordthat apparently strike the three Justices as particularly sig-ni\u00aecant in establishing (or refuting) the existence of an undueburden; after describing these facts, the opinion then simplyannounces that the provision either does or does not imposea \u00aasubstantial obstacle\u00ba or an \u00aaundue burden.\u00ba See, e. g., ante, at 880, 884\u00b1885, 887, 893\u00b1894, 895, 901.

The inherently standardless nature of this in- quiry invites the district judge to give effect to his personalpreferences about abortion. By \u00aending and relying uponthe right facts, he can invalidate, it would seem, almost anyabortion restriction that strikes him as \u00aaundue\u00ba\u00d0subject, ofcourse, to the possibility of being reversed by a court of ap-peals or Supreme Court that is as unconstrained in review-ing his decision as he was in making it. To the extent I can discern any meaningful content in the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba standard as applied in the joint opinion, itappears to be that a State may not regulate abortion in such a way as to reduce signi\u00aecantly its incidence. The jointopinion repeatedly emphasizes that an important factor inthe \u00aaundue burden\u00ba analysis is whether the regulation \u00aapre-vent[s] a signi\u00aecant number of women from obtaining anabortion,\u00ba ante, a \u00aasigni\u00aecant number of women . . . are likely to be deterred from procuring anabortion,\u00ba ante, at 894; and whether the regulation often \u00aadeters\u00ba women from seeking abortions, ante, at 897. We are not told, however, what forms of \u00aadeterrence\u00ba are imper-missible or what degree of success in deterrence is too muchto be tolerated. If, for example, a State required a womanto read a pamphlet describing, with illustrations, the facts offetal development before she could obtain an abortion, theeffect of such legislation might be to \u00aadeter\u00ba a \u00aasigni\u00aecantnumber of women\u00ba from procuring abortions, thereby seem-ingly allowing a district judge to invalidate it as an undueburden. Thus, despite \u00afowery rhetoric about the State's\u00aasubstantial\u00ba and \u00aaprofound\u00ba interest in \u00aapotential humanlife,\u00ba and criticism of Roe for undervaluing that interest, the joint opinion permits the State to pursue that interest onlyso long as it is not too successful. As Justice Blackmun recognizes (with evident hope), ante, at 926, the \u00aaundue bur- den\u00ba standard may ultimately require the invalidation ofeach provision upheld today if it can be shown, on a betterrecord, that the State is too effectively \u00aaexpress[ing] a pref-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 993 Cite as: 505 U.

Reason \u00aends no refuge in this jurisprudence of confusion. \u00aaWhile we appreciate the weight of the arguments . . . that Roe should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaf\u00aer ming the central hol ding ofRoeare outweighed by the explication of individ- ual liberty we have given combined with the force ofstare decisis. \u00ba Ante, at 853. The Court's reliance upon stare decisis can best be de- scribed as contrived. It insists upon the necessity of adher-ing not to all of Roe, but only to what it calls the \u00aacentral holding.\u00ba It seems to me that stare decisis ought to be ap- plied even to the doctrine of stare decisis, and I confess never to have heard of this new, keep-what-you-want-and-throw-away-the-rest version. I wonder whether, as applied toMarbury v.Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), for example, the new version of stare decisis would be satis\u00aeed if we allowed courts to review the constitutionality of only those statutesthat (like the one in Marbury ) pertain to the jurisdiction of the courts. I am certainly not in a good position to dispute that the Court has saved the \u00aacentral holding\u00ba of Roe, since to do that effectively I would have to know what the Court hassaved, which in turn would require me to understand (as I donot) what the \u00aaundue burden\u00ba test means. I must confess,however, that I have always thought, and I think a lot ofother people have always thought, that the arbitrary trimes-ter framework, which the Court today discards, was quite ascentral to Roe as the arbitrary viability test, which the Court today retains. It seems particularly ungrateful to carve thetrimester framework out of the core of Roe, since its very rigidity (in sharp contrast to the utter indeterminability ofthe \u00aaundue burden\u00ba test) is probably the only reason theCourt is able to say, in urging stare decisis, that Roe \u00aahas in no sense proven `unworkable,' \u00ba ante, at 855.

Court is entitled to call a \u00aacentral holding\u00ba whatever it wants to call a \u00aacentral holding\u00ba\u00d0which is, come to think of it, per-haps one of the dif\u00aeculties with this modi\u00aeed version of stare decisis. I thought I might note, however, that the following portions of Roe have not been saved: xUnder Roe, requiring that a woman seeking an abortion be provided truthful information about abortion before giv-ing informed written consent is unconstitutional, if the infor-mation is designed to in\u00afuence her choice.

The Court's description of the place of Roe in the social history of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only didRoe not, as the Court suggests, resolve the deeply divisive issue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourishit, by elevating it to the national level where it is in\u00aenitelymore dif\u00aecult to resolve. National politics were not plaguedby abortion protests, national abortion lobbying, or abortionmarches on Congress before Roe v.Wade was decided. Pro- found disagreement existed among our citizens over theissue\u00d0as it does over other issues, such as the death pen-alty\u00d0but that disagreement was being worked out at thestate level. As with many other issues, the division of senti-ment within each State was not as closely balanced as it wasamong the population of the Nation as a whole, meaning notonly that more people would be satis\u00aeed with the results ofstate-by-state resolution, but also that those results wouldbe more stable. Pre- Roe, moreover, political compromise was possible. Roe's mandate for abortion on demand destroyed the com- promises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for thefuture, and required the entire issue to be resolved uni-formly, at the national level. At the same time, Roe created a vast new class of abortion consumers and abortion propo-nents by eliminating the moral opprobrium that had attachedto the act. (\u00aaIf the Constitution guarantees abortion, how can it be bad?\u00ba\u00d0not an accurate line of thought, but a natu-ral one.) Many favor all of those developments, and it is notfor me to say that they are wrong. But to portray Roe as the statesmanlike \u00aasettlement\u00ba of a divisive issue, a jurispru-dential Peace of Westphalia that is worth preserving, is noth-ing less than Orwellian. Roe fanned into life an issue that has in\u00afamed our national politics in general, and has ob-scured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 996 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Scalia, J. in particular, ever since.

That is not a principle of law (which is what I thought the Court was talking about), buta principle of Realpolitik \u00d0and a wrong one at that. I cannot agree with, indeed I am appalled by, the Court's suggestion that the decision whether to stand by an errone-ous constitutional decision must be strongly in\u00afuenced\u00d0against overruling, no less\u00d0by the substantial and continu- ing public opposition the decision has generated. TheCourt's judgment that any other course would \u00aasubvert theCourt's legitimacy\u00ba must be another consequence of reading the error-\u00aelled history book that described the deeply di-vided country brought together by Roe. In my history book, the Court was covered with dishonor and deprived oflegitimacy by Dred Scott v.Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), an erroneous (and widely opposed) opinion that it did not aban-don, rather than by West Coast Hotel Co. v.Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), which produced the famous \u00aaswitch in time\u00ba fromthe Court's erroneous (and widely opposed) constitutional op-position to the social measures of the New Deal. (BothDred Scott and one line of the cases resisting the New Deal rested upon the concept of \u00aasubstantive due process\u00ba thatthe Court praises and employs today. Indeed, Dred Scott was \u00aavery possibly the \u00aerst application of substantive dueprocess in the Supreme Court, the original precedent forLochner v.New York and Roe v.Wade. \u00ba D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court 271 (1985) (footnotesomitted).) But whether it would \u00aasubvert the Court's legitimacy\u00ba or not, the notion that we would decide a case differently fromthe way we otherwise would have in order to show that wecan stand \u00aerm against public disapproval is frightening. Itis a bad enough idea, even in the head of someone like me,who believes that the text of the Constitution, and our tradi-tions, say what they say and there is no \u00aeddling with them.But when it is in the mind of a Court that believes the Con-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 999 Cite as: 505 U.

We are offended by these marchers who de-scend upon us, every year on the anniversary of Roe, to pro- test our saying that the Constitution requires what our society has never thought the Constitution requires. Thesepeople who refuse to be \u00aatested by following\u00ba must betaught a lesson. We have no Cossacks, but at least we canstubbornly refuse to abandon an erroneous opinion that wemight otherwise change\u00d0to show how little they intimidateus. Of course, as The Chief Justice points out, we have been subjected to what the Court calls \u00aa `political pressure' \u00ba byboth sides of 963. Maybe today's deci- sion notto overrule Roe will be seen as buckling to pressure from that direction. Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception\u00d0a job not for lawyersbut for political campaign managers\u00d0the Justices should dowhat is legally right by asking two questions: (1) Was Roe correctly decided? (2) Has Roe succeeded in producing a settled body of law? If the answer to both questions is no,Roe should undoubtedly be overruled. In truth, I am as distressed as the Court is\u00d0and ex- pressed my distress several years ago, see Webster, 492 U. S., at 535\u00d0about the \u00aapolitical pressure\u00ba directed to the Court:the marches, the mail, the protests aimed at inducing us tochange our opinions. How upsetting it is, that so many ofour citizens (good people, not lawless ones, on both sides ofthis abortion issue, and on various sides of other issues aswell) think that we Justices should properly take into ac-505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 1000 PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PA. v.CASEY Opinion of Scalia, J. count their views, as though we were engaged not in ascer- taining an objective law but in determining some kind ofsocial consensus. The Court would pro\u00aet, I think, from giv-ing less attention to the fact of this distressing phenomenon, and more attention to the cause of it. That cause permeates today's opinion: a new mode of constitutional adjudicationthat relies not upon text and traditional practice to deter-mine the law, but upon what the Court calls \u00aareasoned judg-ment,\u00ba ante, at 849, which turns out to be nothing but philo- sophical predilection and moral intuition. All manner of\u00aaliberties,\u00ba the Court tells us, inhere in the Constitution and are enforceable by this Court\u00d0not just those mentioned in thetext or established in the traditions of our society.

Why even the Ninth Amendment\u00d0which says onlythat \u00aa[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retainedby the people\u00ba\u00d0is, despite our contrary understanding foralmost 200 years, a literally boundless source of at 848\u00b1849. What makes all this relevant to the bothersome application of \u00aapolitical pressure\u00ba against the Court are the twin factsthat the American people love democracy and the Americanpeople are not fools. As long as this Court thought (andthe people thought) that we Justices were doing essentiallylawyers' work up here\u00d0reading text and discerning oursociety's traditional understanding of that text\u00d0the publicpretty much left us alone. Texts and traditions are facts tostudy, not convictions to demonstrate about. But if in real-ity our process of constitutional adjudication consists primar-ily of making value judgments; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, forexample, \u00aeve days ago in declaring unconstitutional invoca-tions and benedictions at public high school graduation cere-monies, Leev.Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value505us3u117 07-09-96 09:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT 1001 Cite as: 505 U.

The people know that their value judgments are quite asgood as those taught in any law school\u00d0maybe better. If,indeed, the \u00aaliberties\u00ba protected by the Constitution are, asthe Court says, unde\u00aened and unbounded, then the peopleshould demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours. Not only that, but con\u00aermation hearings for new Justices should deteriorate into question- and-answer sessions in which Senators go through a list oftheir constituents' most favored and most disfavored allegedconstitutional rights, and seek the nominee's commitment tosupport or oppose them. Value judgments, after all, shouldbe voted on, not dictated; and if our Constitution has some-how accidently committed them to the Supreme Court, atleast we can have a sort of plebiscite each time a new nomi-nee to that body is put forward. Justice Blackmun not only regards this prospect with equanimity, he solicits it.Ante, at 943. *** There is a poignant aspect to today's opinion.

I expect that two years earlier he, too, had thoughthimself \u00aacall[ing] the contending sides of national contro-versy to end their national division by accepting a commonmandate rooted in the Constitution.\u00ba It is no more realistic for us in this litigation, than it was for him in that, to think that an issue of the sort they bothinvolved\u00d0an issue involving life and death, freedom andsubjugation\u00d0can be \u00aaspeedily and \u00aenally settled\u00ba by the Su-preme Court, as President James Buchanan in his inauguraladdress said the issue of slavery in the territories would be.See Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the UnitedStates, S.

He \u00aeled suit against respondent stateagency, contending that, even though the Act may have been a lawfulexercise of the State's police power, the ban on construction deprivedhim of all \u00aaeconomically viable use\u00ba of his property and therefore ef-fected a \u00aataking\u00ba under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments thatrequired the payment of just compensation. See, e. g., Agins v.City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 261. The state trial court agreed, \u00aending that the ban rendered Lucas's parcels \u00aavalueless,\u00ba and entered an award ex-ceeding $1.2 million. In reversing, the State Supreme Court held itselfbound, in light of Lucas's failure to attack the Act's validity, to acceptthe legislature's \u00aauncontested ...\u00ae n d i ngs\u00ba that new construction in the coastal zone threatened a valuable public resource. The court ruledthat, under the Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, line of cases, when a regulation is designed to prevent \u00aaharmful or noxious uses\u00ba of propertyakin to public nuisances, no compensation is owing under the TakingsClause regardless of the regulation's effect on the property's value. Held: 1. Lucas's takings claim is not rendered unripe by the fact that he may yet be able to secure a special permit to build on his property underan amendment to the Act passed after brie\u00aeng and argument beforethe State Supreme Court, but prior to issuance of that court's opinion.Because it declined to rest its judgment on ripeness grounds, preferringto dispose of the case on the merits, the latter court's decision precludes,both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas'spreamendment deprivation. Lucas has properly alleged injury in factwith respect to this preamendment deprivation, and it would not accordwith sound process in these circumstances to insist that he pursue thelate-created procedure before that component of his takings claim canbe considered ripe.

The State Supreme Court erred in applying the \u00aaharmful or nox- ious uses\u00ba principle to decide this case. Pp. 1014\u00b11032. (a) Regulations that deny the property owner all \u00aaeconomically via- ble use of his land\u00ba constitute one of the discrete categories of regula-tory deprivations that require compensation without the usual case-speci\u00aec inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of therestraint. Although the Court has never set forth the justi\u00aecation forthis categorical rule, the practical\u00d0and economic\u00d0 equivalence of phys-ically appropriating and eliminating all bene\u00aecial use of land counselsits preservation. Pp. 1014\u00b11019. (b) A review of the relevant decisions demonstrates that the \u00aaharm- ful or noxious use\u00ba principle was merely this Court's early formulationof the police power justi\u00aecation necessary to sustain (without compensa-tion) any regulatory diminution in value; that the distinction between regulation that \u00aaprevents harmful use\u00ba and that which \u00aaconfers bene\u00aets\u00bais dif\u00aecult, if not impossible, to discern on an objective, value-free basis;and that, therefore, noxious-use logic cannot be the basis for departingfrom this Court's categorical rule that total regulatory takings must becompensated. Pp. 1020\u00b11026. (c) Rather, the question must turn, in accord with this Court's \u00aatak- ings\u00ba jurisprudence, on citizens' historic understandings regarding thecontent of, and the State's power over, the \u00aabundle of rights\u00ba that theyacquire when they take title to property. Because it is not consistentwith the historical compact embodied in the Takings Clause that title toreal estate is held subject to the State's subsequent decision to eliminateall economically bene\u00aecial use, a regulation having that effect cannot benewly decreed, and sustained, without compensation's being paid theowner. However, no compensation is owed\u00d0in this setting as with alltakings claims\u00d0if the State's af\u00aermative decree simply makes explicitwhat already inheres in the title itself, in the restrictions that back-ground principles of the State's law of property and nuisance alreadyplace upon land ownership. Cf. Scranton v.Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 163. Pp. 1027\u00b11031. (d) Although it seems unlikely that common-law principles would have prevented the erection of any habitable or productive improve-ments on Lucas's land, this state-law question must be dealt with onremand. To win its case, respondent cannot simply proffer the legisla-ture's declaration that the uses Lucas desires are inconsistent with thepublic interest, or the conclusory assertion that they violate a common-law maxim such as sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, but must iden- tify background principles of nuisance and property law that prohibitthe uses Lucas now intends in the property's present circumstances.P. 1031. 304 S.

In the late 1970's, Lucas and others began extensive resi- dential development of the Isle of Palms, a barrier islandsituated eastward of the city of Charleston. Toward theclose of the development cycle for one residential subdivisionknown as \u00aaBeachwood East,\u00ba Lucas in 1986 purchased thetwo lots at issue in this litigation for his own account. Noportion of the lots, which were located approximately 300feet from the beach, quali\u00aeed as a \u00aacritical area\u00ba under the1977 Act; accordingly, at the time Lucas acquired these par-cels, he was not legally obliged to obtain a permit from theCouncil in advance of any development activity. His inten-tion with respect to the lots was to do what the owners of theimmediately adjacent parcels had already done: erect single-family residences. He commissioned architectural drawingsfor this purpose. The Beachfront Management Act brought Lucas's plans to an abrupt end. Under that 1988 legislation, the Council wasdirected to establish a \u00aabaseline\u00ba connecting the landward-most \u00aapoint[s] of . . . during the past forty years\u00ba inthe region of the Isle of Palms that includes Lucas's lots.S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1280(A)(2) (Supp. 1988). 1In action not challenged here, the Council \u00aexed this baseline landwardof Lucas's parcels. That was signi\u00aecant, for under the Act 1This specialized historical method of determining the baseline applied because the Beachwood East subdivision is located adjacent to a so-called\u00aainlet erosion zone\u00ba (de\u00aened in the Act to mean \u00aaa segment of shorelinealong or adjacent to tidal inlets which are directly in\u00afuenced by the inletand its associated shoals,\u00ba S.

For areas other than these unstabilized inlet erosionzones, the statute directs that the baseline be established along \u00aathe crestof an ideal as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Opinion of the Court construction of occupable improvements2was \u00afatly prohib- ited seaward of a line landward of, and parallelto, the baseline. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1290(A). The Act provided noexceptions. B Lucas promptly \u00aeled suit in the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas, contending that the Beachfront ManagementAct's construction bar effected a taking of his property with-out just compensation. Lucas did not take issue with thevalidity of the Act as a lawful exercise of South Carolina'spolice power, but contended that the Act's complete extin-guishment of his property's value entitled him to compensa-tion regardless of whether the legislature had acted in fur-therance of legitimate police power objectives. Following abench trial, the court agreed. Among its factual determina-tions was the \u00aending that \u00aaat the time Lucas purchased thetwo lots, both were zoned for single-family residential con-struction and . . . there were no restrictions imposed uponsuch use of the property by either the State of South Caro-lina, the County of Charleston, or the Town of the Isle ofPalms.\u00ba App. to Pet. for Cert. 36. The trial court furtherfound that the Beachfront Management Act decreed a per-manent ban on construction insofar as Lucas's lots wereconcerned, and that this prohibition \u00aadeprive[d] Lucas ofany reasonable economic use of the lots ,...e l i m i nated the unrestricted right of use, and render[ed] them valueless.\u00baId.,at 37. The court thus concluded that Lucas's properties had been \u00aataken\u00ba by operation of the Act, and it orderedrespondent to pay \u00aajust compensation\u00ba in the amount of$1,232,387.50.

Id.,at 383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. The court ruled that when a regulation respecting the use of property isdesigned \u00aato prevent serious public harm,\u00ba id.,at 383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 899 (citing, inter alia, Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887)), no compensation is owing under the Tak-ings Clause regardless of the regulation's effect on the prop-erty's value. Two justices dissented. They acknowledged that our Mugler line of cases recognizes governmental power to pro- hibit \u00aanoxious\u00ba uses of property\u00d0 i. e., uses of property akin to \u00aapublic nuisances\u00ba\u00d0without having to pay compensation.But they would not have characterized the Beachfront Man-agement Act's \u00aa primary purpose [as] the prevention of a nui- sance.\u00ba 304 S.

Id., at 396, 404 S. E. 2d, at 906. As a consequence, they would have af-\u00aermed the trial court's conclusion that the Act's obliterationof the value of petitioner's lots accomplished a taking.

See S. C.Code Ann. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1290(D)(1) (Supp. 1991). According to theCouncil, this amendment renders Lucas's claim of a perma-nent deprivation unripe, as Lucas may yet be able to securepermission to build on his property. \u00aa[The Court's] cases,\u00bawe are reminded, \u00aauniformly re\u00afect an insistence on knowingthe nature and extent of permitted development before adju-dicating the constitutionality of the regulations that purportto limit it.\u00ba MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v.Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 351 (1986). See also Agins v.City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980). Because petitioner \u00aahas not yetobtained a \u00aenal decision regarding how [he] will be allowedto develop [his] property,\u00ba Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v.Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 190 (1985), the Council argues that he is not yetentitled to de\u00aenitive adjudication of his takings claim inthis Court. We think these considerations would preclude review had the South Carolina Supreme Court rested its judgment onripeness grounds, as it was (essentially) invited to do by theCouncil. See Brief for Respondent 9, n. 3. The South Car-olina Supreme Court shrugged off the possibility of furtheradministrative and trial proceedings, however, preferring todispose of Lucas's takings claim on the merits. Cf., e. g., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v.San Diego, 450 U. S. 621, 631\u00b1632 (1981). This unusual disposition does not preclude Lucasfrom applying for a permit under the 1990 amendment forfuture construction, and challenging, on takings grounds, any denial. But it does preclude, both practically and le-gally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas's past depriva- tion, i. e., for his having been denied construction rights dur- ing the period before the 1990 amendment. See generallyFirst English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304 (1987) (holding that505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:20 PAGES OPINPGT 1012 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court temporary deprivations of use are compensable under the Takings Clause). Without even so much as commentingupon the consequences of the South Carolina SupremeCourt's judgment in this respect, the Council insists that per-mitting Lucas to press his claim of a past deprivation on thisappeal would be improper, since \u00aathe issues of whether andto what extent [Lucas] has incurred a temporary taking . . .have simply never been addressed.\u00ba Brief for Respondent11. Yet Lucas had no reason to proceed on a \u00aatemporarytaking\u00ba theory at trial, or even to seek remand for that pur-pose prior to submission of the case to the South CarolinaSupreme Court, since as the Act then read, the taking wasunconditional and permanent. Moreover, given the breadthof the South Carolina Supreme Court's holding and judg-ment, Lucas would plainly be unable (absent our interventionnow) to obtain further state-court adjudication with respectto the 1988\u00b11990 period. In these circumstances, we think it would not accord with sound process to insist that Lucas pursue the late-created\u00aaspecial permit\u00ba procedure before his takings claim can beconsidered ripe. Lucas has properly alleged Article III in-jury in fact in this case, with respect to both the pre-1990and post-1990 constraints placed on the use of his parcels bythe Beachfront Management Act. 3That there is a discre- 3Justice Blackmun insists that this aspect of Lucas's claim is \u00aanot justiciable,\u00ba post, at 1042, because Lucas never ful\u00aelled his obligation under Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v.Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.

See App. to Pet.for Cert. 154 (complaint); id.,at 156 (asking \u00aadamages for the temporary taking of his property\u00ba from the date of the 1988 Act's passage to \u00aasuchtime as this matter is \u00aenally resolved\u00ba). No more can reasonably be de-manded. Cf. First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 312\u00b1313 (1987). Justice Black- mun \u00aends it \u00aabaf\u00afing,\u00ba post, at 1043, n. 5, that we grant standing here, whereas \u00aajust a few days ago, in Lujan v.Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992),\u00ba we denied standing. He sees in that strong evidence to sup-port his repeated imputations that the Court \u00aapresses\u00ba to take this case,post, at 1036, is \u00aaeager to decide\u00ba it, post, at 1045, and is un willing to \u00aabe denied,\u00ba post, at 1042. He has a point: The decisions are indeed very close in time, yet one grants standing and the other denies it. The distinction,however, rests in law rather than chronology. Lujan, since it involved the establishment of injury in fact at the summary judgment stage, re- quired speci\u00aec facts to be adduced by sworn testimony; had the same chal-lenge to a generalized allegation of injury in fact been made at the plead-ing stage, it would have been unsuccessful. 4In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached the merits of a takings challenge to the 1988 Beachfront Management Actidentical to the one Lucas brings here even though the Act was amended,and the special permit procedure established, while the case was undersubmission. The court observed: \u00aaThe enactment of the 1990 Act during the pendency of this appeal, with its provisions for special permits and other changes that may affect theplaintiffs, does not relieve us of the need to address the plaintiffs' claimsunder the provisions of the 1988 Act. Even if the amended Act cured allof the plaintiffs' concerns, the amendments would not foreclose the possi-bility that a taking had occurred during the years when the 1988 Act wasin effect.\u00ba Esposito v.South Carolina Coastal Council, 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1014 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court Carolina Supreme Court as a consequence of its categorical disposition.5 III A Prior to Justice Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a \u00aadirect appropria-tion\u00ba of property, Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a \u00aapractical ouster of[the owner's] possession,\u00ba Transportation Co. v.Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, 642 (1879). See also Gibson v.United States, 166 U. S. 269, 275\u00b1276 (1897). Justice Holmes recognized inMahon, however, that if the protection against physical appropriations of private property was to be meaningfullyenforced, the government's power to rede\u00aene the range ofinterests included in the ownership of property was neces-sarily constrained by constitutional limits. 260 U. S., at414\u00b1415. If, instead, the uses of private property were sub-ject to unbridled, uncompensated quali\u00aecation under the po-lice power, \u00aathe natural tendency of human nature [wouldbe] to extend the quali\u00aecation more and more until at lastprivate property disappear[ed].\u00ba Id.,at 415. These consid- erations gave birth in that case to the oft-cited maxim that,\u00aawhile property may be regulated to a certain extent, if reg-ulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\u00ba Ibid. 5Justice Blackmun states plight . . . would have been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgmentbelow and remanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amend-ments\u00ba to the Beachfront Management Act. Post, at 1045, n. 7. That is a strange suggestion, given that the South Carolina Supreme Court ren-dered its categorical disposition in this case after the Act had been amended, and after it had been invited to consider the effect of those amendments on Lucas's case. We have no reason to believe that the jus-tices of the South Carolina Supreme Court are any more desirous of usinga narrower ground now than they were then; and neither \u00aaprudence\u00ba norany other principle of judicial restraint requires that we remand to \u00aendout whether they have changed their mind.505us3118M 06-19-96 PAGES OPINPGT 1015 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Opinion of the Court Nevertheless, our decision in Mahon offered little insight into when, and under what circumstances, a given regulationwould be seen as going \u00aatoo far\u00ba for purposes of the FifthAmendment. In 70-odd years of succeeding \u00aaregulatorytakings\u00ba jurisprudence, we have generally eschewed any\u00aa `set formula' \u00ba for determining how far is too far, preferringto \u00aaengag[e] i n... essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.\u00ba Penn Central Transportation Co. v.N e wY o r kC i t y , 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978) (quoting Goldblatt v.Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 594 (1962)). See Epstein, Takings: Descent and Resur-rection, 1987 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 4. We have, however, described at least two discrete categories of regulatory action as com-pensable without case-speci\u00aec inquiry into the public interestadvanced in support of the restraint. The \u00aerst encompassesregulations that compel the property owner to suffer a physi-cal \u00aainvasion\u00ba of his property. In general (at least with re-gard to permanent invasions), no matter how minute the in-trusion, and no matter how weighty the public purposebehind it, we have required compensation. For example, inLoretto v.Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982), we determined that New York's law requiringlandlords to allow television cable companies to emplacecable facilities in their apartment buildings constituted a tak-ing, id., at 435\u00b1440, even though the facilities occupied at most only 1 1/2cubic feet of the landlords' property, see id.,at 438, n. 16. See also United States v.Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 265, and n. 10 (1946) (physical invasions of airspace); cf. Kai- ser Aetna v.United States, 444 U. S. 164 (1979) (imposition of navigational servitude upon private marina). The second situation in which we have found categorical treatment appropriate is where regulation denies all eco-nomically bene\u00aecial or productive use of land. See Agins, 447 U. S., at 260; see also Nollan PAGES OPINPGT 1016 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court U. S. 264, 295\u00b1296 (1981).6As we have said on numerous occasions, the Fifth Amendment is violated when land-useregulation \u00aadoes not substantially advance legitimate stateinterests or denies an owner economically viable use of his land. \u00baAgins, supra, at 260 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). 7 6We will not attempt to respond to all of Justice Blackmun 's mistaken citation of case precedent. Characteristic of its nature is his assertionthat the cases we discuss here stand merely for the proposition \u00aathat proofthat a regulation does notdeny an owner economic use of his property is suf\u00aecient to defeat a facial takings challenge\u00ba and not for the point that\u00aadenial of such use is suf\u00aecient to establish a takings claim regardless of any other consideration.\u00ba Post, at 1050, n. 11. The cases say, repeatedly and unmistakably, that \u00aa `[t]he test to be applied in considering [a] facial[takings] challenge is fairly straightforward. A statute regulating theuses that can be made of property effects a taking if it \u00aadenies an owner economically viable use of his land. \u00ba'\u00ba Keystone, 480 U. S., at 495 (quot- ingHodel, 452 U. S., at 295\u00b1296 (quoting Agins, 447 U. S., at 260)) (empha- sis added). Justice Blackmun describes that rule (which we do not invent but merely apply today) as \u00aaalter[ing] the long-settled rules of review\u00ba byfoisting on the State \u00aathe burden of showing [its] regulation is not ataking.\u00ba Post, at 1045, 1046. This is of course wrong. Lucas had to do more than simply \u00aele a lawsuit to establish his constitutional entitlement;he had to show that the Beachfront Management Act denied him economi-cally bene\u00aecial use of his land. Our analysis presumes the unconstitution-ality of state land-use regulation only in the sense that any rule with exceptions presumes the invalidity of a law that violates it\u00d0for example,the rule generally prohibiting content-based restrictions on speech. See,e. g., Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y . State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 115 (1991) (\u00aaA statute is presumptively inconsistent with theFirst Amendment if it imposes a \u00aenancial burden on speakers because ofthe content of their speech\u00ba). Justice Blackmun 's real quarrel is with the substantive standard of liability we apply in this case, a long-established standard we see no need to repudiate. 7Regrettably, the rhetorical force of our \u00aadeprivation of all economically feasible use\u00ba rule is greater than its precision, since the rule does notmake clear the \u00aaproperty interest\u00ba against which the loss of value is to bemeasured. When, for example, a regulation requires a developer to leave90% of a rural tract in its natural state, it is unclear whether we would505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1017 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Opinion of the Court We have never set forth the justi\u00aecation for this rule. Per- haps it is simply, as Justice Brennan suggested, that totaldeprivation of bene\u00aecial use is, from the landowner's pointof view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation. See San D i e g oG a s&E l e c t r i cC o . v.San Diego, 450 U. S., at 652 (dissenting opinion). \u00aa[F]or what is the land but the pro\u00aets thereof[?]\u00ba 1 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 1, \u00a7 1 (1st Am. ed.1812). Surely, at least, in the extraordinary circumstancewhen noproductive or economically bene\u00aecial use of land is permitted, it is less realistic to indulge our usual assumptionthat the legislature is simply \u00aaadjusting the bene\u00aets and bur-dens of economic life,\u00ba Penn Central Transportation Co., 438 analyze the situation as one in which the owner has been deprived of all economically bene\u00aecial use of the burdened portion of the tract, or as onein which the owner has suffered a mere diminution in value of the tractas a whole. (For an extreme\u00d0and, we think, unsupportable\u00d0view of therelevant calculus, see Penn Central Transportation Co. v.N e wY o r kC i t y , 42 N. Y . 2d 324, 333\u00b1334, 366 N. E. 2d 1271, 1276\u00b11277 (1977), aff'd, 438U. S. 104 (1978), where the state court examined the diminution in a partic-ular parcel's value produced by a municipal ordinance in light of total valueof the takings claimant's other holdings in the vicinity.) Unsurprisingly,this uncertainty regarding the composition of the denominator in our \u00aadep-rivation\u00ba fraction has produced inconsistent pronouncements by the Court.Compare Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.Mahon , 260 U. S. 393, 414 (1922) (law restricting subsurface extraction of coal held to effect a taking), with Key- stone Bituminous Coal Assn. v.DeBene dictis, 480 U. S. 470, 497\u00b1502 (1987) (nearly identical law held not to effect a taking); see also id.,at 515\u00b1520 ( Rehnquist, C. J. , dissenting); Rose, Mahon Reconstructed: Why the Takings Issue is Still a Muddle, 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 561, 566\u00b1569 (1984).The answer to this dif\u00aecult question may lie in how the owner's reasonableexpectations have been shaped by the State's law of property\u00d0 i. e., whether and to what degree the State's law has accorded legal recognitionand protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which thetakings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value. In anyevent, we avoid this dif\u00aeculty in the present case, since the \u00aainterest inland\u00ba that Lucas has pleaded (a fee simple interest) is an estate with arich tradition of protection at common law, and since the South CarolinaCourt of Common Pleas found that the Beachfront Management Act lefteach of Lucas's beachfront lots without economic value.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1018 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court U. S., at 124, in a manner that secures an \u00aaaverage reciproc- ity of advantage\u00ba to everyone concerned, Pennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon, 260 U. S., at 415. And the functional basis for permitting the government, by regulation, to affect propertyvalues without compensation\u00d0that \u00aaGovernment hardlycould go on if to some extent values incident to propertycould not be diminished without paying for every suchchange in the general law,\u00ba id.,at 413\u00d0does not apply to the relatively rare situations where the government has de-prived a landowner of all economically bene\u00aecial uses. On the other side of the balance, af\u00aermatively supporting a compensation requirement, is the fact that regulations thatleave the owner of land without economically bene\u00aecial orproductive options for its use\u00d0typically, as here, by requir-ing land to be left substantially in its natural state\u00d0carrywith them a heightened risk that private property is beingpressed into some form of public service under the guiseof mitigating serious public harm. See, e. g., Annicelli v. South Kings town, 463 A. 2d 133, 140\u00b1141 (R. I. 1983) (prohi- bition on construction adjacent to beach justi\u00aeed on twingrounds of safety and \u00aaconservation of open space\u00ba); Morris County Land Improvement Co. v.Parsippany-Troy Hills Township, 40 N.

As Justice Brennan explained: \u00aaFrom the gov-ernment's point of view, the bene\u00aets \u00afowing to the publicfrom preservation of open space through regulation maybe equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge throughformal condemnation or increasing electricity productionthrough a dam project that \u00afoods private property.\u00ba San Diego Gas & Elec.

We think, in short, that there are good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that when the owner of realproperty has been called upon to sacri\u00aece alleconomically bene\u00aecial uses in the name of the common good, that is, toleave his property economically idle, he has suffered ataking. 8 8Justice Stevens criticizes the \u00aadeprivation of all economically \u00aecial use\u00ba rule as \u00aawholly arbitrary,\u00ba in that \u00aa[the] whose prop-erty is diminished in value 95% recovers nothing,\u00ba while the landownerwho suffers a complete elimination of value \u00aarecovers the land's full value.\u00baPost, at 1064. This analysis errs in its assumption that the landowner whose deprivation is one step short of complete is not entitled to compen-sation. Such an owner might not be able to claim the bene\u00aet of our cate-gorical formulation, but, as we have acknowledged time and again, \u00aa[t]heeconomic impact of the regulation on the claimant and . . . the extentto which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backedexpectations\u00ba are keenly relevant to takings analysis generally. Penn505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1020 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court B The trial court found Lucas's two beachfront lots to have been rendered valueless by respondent's enforcement of thecoastal-zone construction ban. 9Under Lucas's theory of the case, which rested upon our \u00aano economically viable use\u00bastatements, that \u00aending entitled him to compensation. Lucas believed it unnecessary to take issue with either thepurposes behind the Beachfront Management Act, or themeans chosen by the South Carolina Legislature to effectu-ate those purposes. The South Carolina Supreme Court,however, thought otherwise. In its view, the BeachfrontManagement Act was no ordinary enactment, but involvedan exercise of South Carolina's \u00aapolice powers\u00ba to mitigatethe harm to the public interest that petitioner's use of his Central Transportation Co. v.N e wY o r kC i t y , 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978). It is true that in at least some cases the landowner with 95% loss will get nothing, while the landowner with total loss will recover in full. But that occasional result is no more strange than the gross disparity between thelandowner whose premises are taken for a highway (who recovers in f ull) and the landowner whose property is reduced to 5% of its former valueby the highway (who recovers nothing). Takings law is full of these \u00aaall-or-nothing\u00ba situations. Justice Stevens similarly misinterprets our focus on \u00aadevelopmental\u00ba uses of property (the uses proscribed by the Beachfront Management Act)as betraying an \u00aaassumption that the only uses of property cognizableunder the Constitution are developmental uses.\u00ba Post, at 1065, n. 3. We make no such assumption. Though our prior takings cases evince an abid-ing concern for the productive use of, and economic investment in, land,there are plainly a number of noneconomic interests in land whose impair-ment will invite exceedingly close scrutiny under the Takings Clause. See, e. g., Loretto v.Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 436 (1982) (interest in excluding strangers from one's land). 9This \u00aending was the premise of the petition for certiorari, and since it was not challenged in the brief in opposition we decline to entertain theargument in respondent's brief on the merits, see Brief for Respondent45\u00b150, that the \u00aending was erroneous. Instead, we decide the questionpresented under the same factual assumptions as did the Supreme Courtof South Carolina. See Oklahoma City v.Tuttle, U. S. 1003 (1992) Opinion of the Court land might occasion. 304 S. C., at 384, 404 S. E. 2d, at 899. By neglecting to dispute the \u00aendings enumerated in theAct 10or otherwise to challenge Assembly \u00aends that:\u00aa(1) The beach/dune system along the coast of South Carolina is ex- tremely important to the people of this State and serves the followingfunctions: \u00aa(a) protects life and property by serving as a storm barrier which dissi- pates wave energy and contributes to shoreline stability in an economicaland effective manner; \u00aa(b) provides the basis for a tourism industry that generates approxi- mately two-thirds of South Carolina's annual tourism industry revenuewhich constitutes a signi\u00aecant portion of the state's economy. The tour-ists who come to the South Carolina coast to enjoy the ocean and dry sandbeach contribute signi\u00aecantly to state and local tax revenues; \u00aa(c) provides habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of which are threatened or endangered. Waters adjacent to the beach/dune system also provide habitat for many other marine species; \u00aa(d) provides a natural health environment for the citizens of South Car- olina to spend leisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being. \u00aa(2) Beach/dune system vegetation is unique and extremely important to the vitality and preservation of the system. \u00aa(3) Many miles of South Carolina's beaches have been identi\u00aeed as crit- ically eroding. \u00aa(4) ...[ D ] e velopment unwisely has been sited too close to the [beach/ dune] system. This type of development has jeopardized the stability ofthe beach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangered adjacentproperty. It is in both the public and private interests to protect thesystem from this unwise development. \u00aa(5) The use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devices such as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatenedstructures adjacent to the beach has not proven effective. These armor-ing devices have given a false sense of security to beachfront propertyowners. In reality, these hard structures, in many instances, have in-creased the vulnerability of beachfront property to damage from wind andwaves while contributing to the deterioration and loss of the dry sandbeach which is so important to the tourism industry. \u00aa(6) Erosion is a natural process which becomes a signi\u00aecant problem for man only when structures are erected in close proximity to the beach/505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1022 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL Opinion of the Court petitioner \u00aaconcede[d] that the beach/dune area of South Car- olina's shores is an extremely valuable public resource; thatthe erection of new construction, inter alia, contributes to the erosion and destruction of this public resource; and thatdiscouraging new construction in close proximity to thebeach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great publicharm.\u00ba Id.,at 382\u00b1383, 404 S. E. 2d, at 898. In the court's view, these concessions brought petitioner's challenge withina long line of this Court's cases sustaining against Due Proc-ess and Takings Clause challenges the State's use of its \u00aapo-lice powers\u00ba to enjoin a property owner from activities akinto public nuisances. See Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887) (law prohibiting manufacture of alcoholic beverages);Hadacheck v.Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915) (law barring operation of brick mill in residential area); Miller v.Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928) (order to destroy diseased cedar trees toprevent infection of nearby orchards); Goldblatt v.Hemp- stead, 369 U. S. 590 (1962) (law effectively preventing contin- ued operation of quarry in residential area). It is correct that many of our prior opinions have sug- gested that \u00aaharmful or noxious uses\u00ba of property may beproscribed by government regulation without the require-ment of compensation. For a number of reasons, however,we think the South Carolina Supreme Court was too quick toconclude that that principle decides the present case. The\u00aaharmful or noxious uses\u00ba principle was the Court's earlyattempt to describe in theoretical terms why government dune system. It is in both the public and private interests to afford the beach/dune system space to accrete and erode in its natural cycle. Thisspace can be provided only by discouraging new construction in close prox-imity to the beach/dune system and encouraging those who have erectedstructures too close to the system to retreat from it. ..... \u00aa(8) It is in the state's best interest to protect and to promote increased public access to South Carolina's beaches for out-of-state tourists andSouth Carolina residents U. S. 1003 (1992) Opinion of the Court may, consistent with the Takings Clause, affect property val- ues by regulation without incurring an obligation to compen-sate\u00d0a reality we nowadays acknowledge explicitly with re-spect to the full scope of the State's police power. See, e. g., Penn Central Transportation Co., 438 U. S., at 125 (where State \u00aareasonably conclude[s] that `the health, safety, morals,or general welfare' would be promoted by prohibitingparticular contemplated uses of land,\u00ba compensation neednot accompany prohibition); see also Nollan v.California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S., at 834\u00b1835 (\u00aaOur cases have not elaborated on the standards for determining what consti-tutes a `legitimate state interest[,]' [but] [t]hey have madeclear... that a broad range of governmental purposes and regulations satisfy these requirements\u00ba). We made thisvery point in Penn Central Transportation Co., where, in the course of sustaining New York City's landmarks preser-vation program against a takings challenge, we rejected thepetitioner's suggestion that Mugler and the cases following it were premised on, and thus limited by, some objective con-ception of \u00aanoxiousness\u00ba: \u00aa[T]he uses in issue in Hadacheck, Miller, and Goldblatt were perfectly lawful in themselves. They involved no`blameworthiness ,... moral wrongdoing or conscious act of dangerous risk-taking which induce[d society] toshift the cost to a pa[rt]icular individual.' Sax, Takingsand the Police Power, 74 Yale L. J. 36, 50 (1964). Thesecases are better understood as resting not on any sup-posed `noxious' quality of the prohibited uses but ratheron the ground that the restrictions were reasonably re- lated to the implementation of a policy\u00d0not unlike his-toric preservation\u00d0expected to produce a widespreadpublic bene\u00aet and applicable to all similarly situatedproperty.\u00ba 438 U. S., at 133\u00b1134, n. 30. \u00aaHarmful or noxious use\u00ba analysis was, in other words, sim- ply the progenitor of our more contemporary statements that505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1024 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court \u00aaland-use regulation does not effect a taking if it at 260); see Penn Central Transportation Co., supra, at 127; Euclid v.Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 387\u00b1388 (1926). The transition from our early focus on control of \u00aanoxious\u00ba uses to our contemporary understanding of the broad realmwithin which government may regulate without compensa-tion was an easy one, since the distinction between \u00aaharm-preventing\u00ba and \u00aabene\u00aet-conferring\u00ba regulation is often inthe eye of the beholder. It is quite possible, for example, todescribe in either fashion the ecological, economic, and es- thetic concerns that inspired the South Carolina Legislaturein the present case. One could say that imposing a servi-tude on Lucas's land is necessary in order to prevent his useof it from \u00aaharming\u00ba South Carolina's ecological resources;or, instead, in order to achieve the \u00aabene\u00aets\u00ba of an ecologi-cal preserve. 11Compare, e. g., Claridge v.New Hampshire 11In the present case, fact, some of the \u00aa[South Carolina] legislature's `\u00aendings' \u00ba to which the South Carolina Supreme Court purported to deferin characterizing the purpose of the Act as \u00aaharm-preventing,\u00ba 304 S. C.376, 385, 404 S. E. 2d 895, 900 (1991), seem to us phrased in \u00aabene\u00aet-conferring\u00ba language instead. For example, they describe the importanceof a construction ban in enhancing \u00aaSouth Carolina's annual tourism indus-try revenue,\u00ba S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1250(1)(b) (Supp. 1991), in \u00aaprovid-[ing] habitat for numerous species of plants and animals, several of whichare threatened or endangered,\u00ba \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1250(1)(c), and in \u00aaprovid[ing] anatural healthy environment for the citizens of South Carolina to spendleisure time which serves their physical and mental well-being,\u00ba \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1250(1)(d). It would be pointless to make the outcome of this case hangupon this terminology, since the same interests could readily be describedin \u00aaharm-preventing\u00ba fashion. Justice Blackmun , however, apparently insists that we must make the outcome hinge (exclusively) upon the South Carolina Legislature'sother, \u00aaharm-preventing\u00ba characterizations, focusing on the declarationthat \u00aaprohibitions on building in front of the setback line are necessary toprotect people and property from storms, high tides, and beach erosion.\u00baPost, at 1040.

Ifit were, departure would virtually always be allowed. TheSouth Carolina Supreme Court's approach would essentiallynullify Mahon 's af\u00aermation of limits to the noncompensable exercise of the police power. Our cases provide no supportfor this: None of them that employed the logic of \u00aaharmfuluse\u00ba prevention to sustain a regulation involved an allega-tion that the regulation wholly eliminated the value of theclaimant's land. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn., 480 U. S., at 513\u00b1514 ( Rehnquist, C. J. , dissenting). 13 the test for required compensation is whether the legislature has recited a harm-preventing justi\u00aecation for its action. See post, at 1039, 1040\u00b11041, 1047\u00b11051. Since such a justi\u00aecation can be formulated in practicallyevery case, this amounts to a test of whether the legislature has a stupidstaff. We think the Takings Clause requires courts to do more than insistupon artful harm-preventing characterizations. 13E. g., Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U.

There may be some validity to the principle Justice Stevens proposes, but it does not properly apply to the present case. The equiva-lent of a law of general application that inhibits the practice of religionwithout being aimed at religion, see Oregon v.Smith, supra, is a law that destroys the value of land without being aimed at land. Perhaps such alaw\u00d0the generally applicable criminal prohibition on the manufacturingof alcoholic beverages challenged in Mugler comes to mind\u00d0cannot consti- tute a compensable taking. See 123 U. S., at 655\u00b1656. But a regulationspeci\u00aecally directed to land use no more acquires immunity by plundering landowners generally than does a law speci\u00aecally directed at religiouspractice acquire immunity by prohibiting all religions. Justice Ste- vens 's approach renders the Takings Clause little more than a particular- ized restatement of the OPINPGT 1028 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Opinion of the Court der his property economically worthless (at least if the prop- erty's only economically productive use is sale or manufac-ture for sale). See Andrus v.Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 66\u00b167 (1979) (prohibition on sale of eagle feathers). In the case ofland, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow held subject to the \u00aaimplied limitation\u00bathat the State may subsequently eliminate all economicallyvaluable use is inconsistent with the historical compact re-corded in the Takings Clause that has become part of ourconstitutional culture. 15 Where \u00aapermanent physical occupation\u00ba of land is con- cerned, we have refused to allow the government to decreeit anew (without compensation), no matter how weighty theasserted \u00aapublic interests\u00ba involved, Loretto v.Teleprompter Manhattan S., at 426\u00d0though we as- suredly would permit the government to assert a permanent easement that was a pre-existing limitation upon the land- 15After accusing us of \u00aalaunch[ing] a missile to kill a mouse,\u00ba post, at 1036, Justice Blackmun expends a good deal of throw-weight of his own upon a noncombatant, arguing that our description of the \u00aaunderstanding\u00baof land ownership that informs the Takings Clause is not supported byearly American experience. That is largely true, but entirely irrelevant.The practices of the States prior to incorporation of the Takings and Just Compensation Clauses, see Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.Chicago, 166 U.

Justice Blackmun is correct that early constitutional theorists did not believe the Takings Clause embraced regulations of prop-erty at all, see post, at 1057\u00b11058, and n. 23, but even he does not suggest (explicitly, at least) that we renounce the Court's contrary conclusion inMahon. Since the text of the Clause can be read to encompass regulatory as well as physical deprivations (in contrast to the text originally proposedby Madison, see Speech Proposing Bill of Rights (June 8, 1789), in 12J.

We believesimilar treatment must be accorded con\u00aescatory regulations,i. e., regulations that prohibit all economically bene\u00aecial use of land: Any limitation so severe cannot be newly legislated or decreed (without compensation), but must inhere in thetitle itself, in the restrictions that background principles ofthe State's law of property and nuisance already place uponland ownership. A law or decree with such an effect must,in other words, do no more than duplicate the result thatcould have been achieved in the courts\u00d0by adjacent land-owners (or other uniquely affected persons) under the State'slaw of private nuisance, or by the State under its complemen-tary power to abate nuisances that affect the public gener-ally, or otherwise. 16 On this analysis, the owner of a lakebed, for example, would not be entitled to compensation when he is denied therequisite permit to engage in a land \u00aelling operation that would have the effect of \u00afooding others' land. Nor the cor-porate owner of a nuclear generating plant, when it is di-rected to remove all improvements from its land upon discov-ery that the plant sits astride an earthquake fault. Suchregulatory action may well have the effect of eliminating theland's only economically productive use, but it does not pro-scribe a productive use that was previously permissible 16The principal \u00aaotherwise\u00ba that we have in mind is litigation absolving the State (or private parties) of liability for the destruction of \u00aareal andpersonal property, in cases of actual necessity, to prevent the spreading ofa \u00aere\u00ba or to fores tall other grave threats to the lives and property of others.

When, however, aregulation that declares \u00aaoff-limits\u00ba all economically produc-tive or bene\u00aecial uses of land goes beyond what the relevantbackground principles would dictate, compensation must bepaid to sustain it. 17 The \u00aatotal taking\u00ba inquiry we require today will ordinarily entail (as the application of state nuisance law ordinarily en-tails) analysis of, among other things, the degree of harm topublic lands and resources, or adjacent private property, 17Of course, the State may elect to rescind its regulation and thereby avoid having to pay compensation for a permanent deprivation.

Ante, at 1010\u00b11011; post, at 1041 (Blackmun, J. dissenting); post, at 1076\u00b11077 (statement of Souter, J. ). After the suit was initiated but before it reached us, SouthCarolina amended its Beachfront Management Act to author-ize the issuance of special permits at variance with the Act'sgeneral limitations. See S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1290(D)(1)(Supp. 1991). Petitioner has not applied for a special permitbut may still do so. The availability of this alternative, if itcan be invoked, may dispose of petitioner's claim of a perma-nent taking. As I read the Court's opinion, it does not de-cide the permanent taking claim, but neither does it foreclosethe Supreme Court of South Carolina from considering theclaim or requiring petitioner to pursue an administrative al-ternative not previously available. The potential for future relief does not control our disposi- tion, because whatever may occur in the future cannot undo 18Justice Blackmun decries our reliance on background nuisance prin- ciples at least in part because he believes those principles to be as manipu-lable as we \u00aend the \u00aaharm prevention\u00ba/\u00aabene\u00aet conferral\u00ba dichotomy, seepost, at 1054\u00b11055.

We stress that an af\u00aermative decree eliminating all economicallybene\u00aecial uses may be defended only if an objec tively reasonable applica- tion of relevant precedents would exclude those bene\u00aecial uses in the cir- cumstances in which the land presently found.505us3118M 06-19-96 PAGES OPINPGT 1033 Cite as: 505 U.

It may have deprived petitioner of the use of his land in an interim period. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1290(A). If this deprivation amounts to a taking, its limited durationwill not bar constitutional relief. It is well established thattemporary takings are as protected by the Constitution asare permanent ones. First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 318 (1987). The issues presented in the case are ready for our decision. The Supreme Court of South Carolina decided the case onconstitutional grounds, and its rulings are now before us.There exists no jurisdictional bar to our disposition, and pru-dential considerations ought not to militate against it. TheState cannot complain of the manner in which the issuesarose. Any uncertainty in this regard is attributable to theState, as a consequence of its amendment to the BeachfrontManagement Act. If the Takings Clause is to protectagainst temporary deprivations, as well as permanent ones,its enforcement must not be frustrated by a shifting back-ground of state law. Although we establish a framework for remand, moreover, we do not decide the ultimate question whether a temporarytaking has occurred in this case. The facts necessary to thedetermination have not been developed in the record.Among the matters to be considered on remand must bewhether petitioner had the intent and capacity to developthe property and failed to do so in the interim period becausethe State prevented him. Any failure by petitioner to com-ply with relevant administrative requirements will be partof that analysis.

Post, at 1043\u00b11045 ( Blackmun, J. , Stevens, J. , dissenting); post, at 1076 (statement of Souter, J. ). While the Supreme Court of South Carolina on remand need not consider thecase subject to this constraint, we must accept the \u00aending asentered below. See Oklahoma City v.Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985). Accepting the \u00aending as entered, it follows thatpetitioner is entitled to invoke the line of cases discussing regulations that deprive real property of all economic value.See Agins v.City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980). The \u00aending of no value must be considered under the Takings Clause by reference to the owner's reasonable,investment-backed expectations. Kaiser Aetna v.United States, 444 U. S. 164, 175 (1979); Penn Central Transporta- tion Co. v.N e wY o r kC i t y , 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978); see also W . B. Worthen Co. v.Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56 (1935). The Takings Clause, while conferring substantial protection onproperty owners, does not eliminate the police power of theState to enact limitations on the use of their property.Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 669 (1887). The rights con- ferred by the Takings Clause and the police power of theState may coexist without con\u00afict. Property is bought andsold, investments are made, subject to the State's power toregulate. Where a taking is alleged from regulations whichdeprive the property of all value, the test must be whetherthe deprivation is contrary to reasonable, investment-backed expectations. There is an inherent tendency towards circularity in this synthesis, of course; for if the owner's reasonable expecta-tions are shaped by what courts allow as a proper exerciseof governmental authority, property tends to become whatcourts say it is. Some circularity must be tolerated in thesematters, however, as it is in other spheres. E. g., Katz v.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1035 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (Fourth Amendment pro- tections de\u00aened by reasonable expectations of privacy).The de\u00aenition, moreover, is not circular in its entirety. Theexpectations protected by the Constitution are based on ob-jective rules and customs that can be understood as reason-able by all parties involved. In my view, reasonable expectations must be understood in light of the whole of our legal tradition. The common lawof nuisance is too narrow a con\u00aene for the exercise of regula-tory power in a complex and interdependent society. Gold- blatt v.Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 593 (1962). The State should not be prevented from enacting new regulatory initia-tives in response to changing conditions, and courts mustconsider all reasonable expectations whatever their source.The Takings Clause does not require a static body of stateproperty law; it protects private expectations to ensure pri-vate investment. I agree with the Court that nuisance pre-vention accords with the most common expectations of prop-erty owners who face regulation, but I do not believe thiscan be the sole source of state authority to impose severerestrictions. Coastal property may present such uniqueconcerns for a fragile land system that the State can go fur-ther in regulating its development and use than the commonlaw of nuisance might otherwise permit. The Supreme Court of South Carolina erred, in my view, by reciting the general purposes for which the state regula-tions were enacted without a determination that they werein accord with the owner's reasonable expectations andtherefore suf\u00aecient to support a severe restriction on speci\u00aecparcels of property. See 304 S. C. 376, 383, 404 S. E. 2d 895,899 (1991). The promotion of tourism, for instance, oughtnot to suf\u00aece to deprive speci\u00aec property of all value withouta corresponding duty to compensate. Furthermore, themeans, as well as the ends, of regulation must accord withthe owner's reasonable expectations. Here, the State didnot act until after the property had been zoned for individual505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1036 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Blackmun, J., dissenting lot development and most other parcels had been improved, throwing the whole burden of the regulation on the remain-ing lots. This too must be measured in the balance. SeePennsylvania Coal Co. v.Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 416 (1922). With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the Court. Justice Blackmun , dissenting. Today the Court launches a missile to kill a mouse. The State of South Carolina prohibited petitioner Lucas from building a permanent structure on his property from1988 to 1990. Relying on an unreviewed (and implausible)state trial court \u00aending that this restriction left Lucas' prop-erty valueless, this Court granted review to determinewhether compensation must be paid in cases where the State prohibits all economic use of real estate. According to theCourt, such an occasion never has arisen in any of our priorcases, and the Court imagines that it will arise \u00aarelativelyrarely\u00ba or only in \u00aaextraordinary circumstances.\u00ba Almostcertainly it did not happen in this case. Nonetheless, the Court presses on to decide the issue, and as it does, it ignores its jurisdictional limits, remakes its tra-ditional rules of review, and creates simultaneously a newcategorical rule and an exception (neither of which is rootedin our prior case law, common law, or common sense). I pro-test not only the Court's decision, but each step taken toreach it. More fundamentally, I question the Court's wis-dom in issuing sweeping new rules to decide such a narrowcase. Surely, as Justice Kennedy demonstrates, the Court could have reached the result it wanted without in-\u00aficting this damage upon our Takings Clause jurisprudence. My fear is that the Court's new policies will spread beyond the narrow con\u00aenes of the present case. For that reason, I,like the Court, will give far greater attention to this casethan its narrow scope suggests\u00d0not because I can intercept505us3118M 06-19-96 PAGES as: 1003 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting the Court's missile, or save the targeted mouse, but because I hope perhaps to limit the collateral damage.

S. C. \u00a7 1456b(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp. II). South Carolina began implementing the congressional di- rective by enacting the South Carolina Coastal Zone Man-agement Act of 1977. Under the 1977 Act, any constructionactivity in what was designated the \u00aacritical area\u00ba requireda permit from the South Carolina Coastal Council (Council),and the construction of any habitable structure was prohib-ited. The 1977 critical area was relatively narrow. This effort did not stop the loss of shoreline. In October 1986, the Council appointed a \u00aaBlue Ribbon Committee onBeachfront Management\u00ba to investigate beach erosion and 1The country has come to recognize that uncontrolled beachfront devel- opment can cause serious damage to life and property. See Brief for Si-erra Club et al. as Amici Curiae 2\u00b15. Hurricane Hugo's September 1989 attack upon South Carolina's coastline, for example, caused 29 deaths andapproximately $6 billion in property damage, much of it the result of un-controlled beachfront development. See Zalkin, Shifting Sands and Shift-ing Doctrines: The Supreme Court's Changing Takings Doctrine andSouth Carolina's Coastal Zone Statute, 79 Calif. L. Rev. 205, 212\u00b1213(1991).

In December 1986, he purchased twoof the last four pieces of vacant property in the develop-ment. 3The area is notoriously unstable. In roughly half of the last 40 years, all or part of petitioner's property was partof the beach or \u00afooded twice daily by the ebb and \u00afow of thetide. Tr. 84. Between 1957 and 1963, petitioner's propertywas under water. Id.,at 79, 81\u00b182. Between 1963 and 1973 the shoreline was 100 to 150 feet onto petitioner's property.Ibid.

Lot 22 was \u00aerst sold in 1979 for $96,660, sold in1984 for $187,500, then in 1985 for $260,000, and, \u00aenally, to Lucas in 1986for $475,000. He estimated its worth in 1991 at $650,000.

Id.,at 102. C The South Carolina Supreme Court found that the Beach- front Management Act did not take petitioner's propertywithout compensation. The decision rested on two premisesthat until today were unassailable\u00d0that the State has thepower to prevent any use of property it \u00aends to be harmfulto its citizens, and that a state statute is entitled to a pre-sumption of constitutionality. The Beachfront Management Act includes a \u00aending by the South Carolina General Assembly that the beach/dune sys-tem serves the purpose of \u00aaprotect[ing] life and property byserving as a storm barrier which dissipates wave energy andcontributes to shoreline stability in an economical and ef-fective manner.\u00ba S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1250(1)(a) (Supp.1990). The General Assembly also found that \u00aadevelopmentunwisely has been sited too close to the [beach/dune] system.This type of development has jeopardized the stability of thebeach/dune system, accelerated erosion, and endangeredadjacent property.\u00ba \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1250(4); beach/dune system spaceto accrete and erode\u00ba). If the state legislature is correct that the prohibition on building in front of the setback line prevents serious harm,then, under this Court's prior cases, the Act is constitutional.\u00aaLong ago it was recognized that all property in this countryis held under the implied obligation that the owner's use ofit shall not be injurious to the community, and the TakingsClause did not transform that principle to one that requirescompensation whenever the State asserts its power to en-505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1040 LUCAS Coal Assn. v.DeBenedic- U. S. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id.,at 488\u00b1489, and n. 18. The Court con- sistently has upheld regulations imposed to arrest a signi\u00ae-cant threat to the common welfare, whatever their economiceffect on the owner. See, e. g., Goldblatt v.Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 592\u00b1593 (1962); 272 U. S. 274 U. S. 603, S. 623 (1887). Petitioner never challenged the legislature's \u00aendings that a building ban was necessary to protect property and life. Nor did he contend that the threatened harm was not suf\u00ae-ciently serious to make building a house in a particular loca-tion a \u00aaharmful\u00ba use, that the legislature had not made suf\u00ae-cient \u00aendings, or that the legislature was motivated byanything other than a desire to minimize damage to coastalareas. Indeed, petitioner objected at trial that evidence asto the purposes of the setback requirement was irrelevant.Tr. 68. The South Carolina Supreme Court accordingly un-derstood petitioner not to contest the State's position that\u00aadiscouraging new construction in close proximity to thebeach/dune area is necessary to prevent a great publicharm,\u00ba 304 S.

Nothing in the record undermines the General Assembly's assessment that prohibitions on building in front of the set-back line are necessary to protect people and property fromstorms, high tides, and beach erosion. Because that legisla-tive determination cannot be disregarded in the absence ofsuch evidence, see, e. g., Euclid, 272 U. S., at 388; O'Gor- man & Young, Inc. v.Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U.

S. 1003 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting of harm to life and property from building is suf\u00aecient to prohibit that use under this Court's cases, the South CarolinaSupreme Court correctly found no taking. II My disagreement with the Court begins with its decision to review this case. This Court has held consistently that aland-use challenge is not ripe for review until there is a \u00aenaldecision about what uses of the property will be permitted.The ripeness requirement is not simply a gesture of goodwill to land-use planners. In the absence of \u00aaa \u00aenal and au-thoritative determination of the type and intensity of devel-opment legally permitted on the subject property,\u00ba MacDon- ald, Sommer & Frates v.Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 348 (1986), and the ut ilization of state procedures for just com- pensation, there is no \u00aenal judgment, and in the absence of a\u00aenal judgment there is no jurisdiction, see San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v.San Diego, 450 U. S. 621, 633 (1981); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980). This rule is \u00aacompelled by the very nature of the inquiry required by the Just Compensation Clause,\u00ba because the fac-tors applied in deciding a takings claim \u00aasimply cannot beevaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a\u00aenal, de\u00aenitive position regarding how it will apply the regu-lations at issue to the particular land in question.\u00ba William- son County Regional Planning Comm'n v.Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 190, 191 (1985). See also MacDonald, Sommer & Frates, 477 U. S., at 348 (\u00aaA court cannot determine whether a regulation has gone `too far' un-less it knows how far the regulation goes\u00ba) (citation omitted). The Court admits that the 1990 amendments to the Beach- front Management Act allowing special permits precludeLucas from asserting that his property has been perma-nently taken. See ante, at 1011\u00b11012. The Court agrees that such a claim would not be ripe because there has been no\u00aenal decision by respondent on what uses will be permitted.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1042 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Blackmun, J., dissenting The Court, however, will not be denied: It determines that petitioner's \u00aatemporary takings\u00ba claim for the period fromJuly 1, 1988, to June 25, 1990, is ripe. But this claim also isnot justiciable. 4 From the very beginning of this litigation, respondent has argued that the courts \u00aalac[k] jurisdiction in this matter because the Plaintiff has sought no authorization from Council for use of hisproperty, has not challenged the location of the baselineor setback line as alleged in the Complaint and becauseno \u00aenal agency decision has been rendered concerninguse of his property or location of said baseline or setbackline.\u00ba Tr. 10 (answer, as amended). Although the Council's plea has been ignored by every court, it is undoubtedly correct. Under the Beachfront Management Act, petitioner was entitled to challenge the setback line or the baseline or ero-sion rate applied to his property in formal administrative,followed by judicial, proceedings. S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 48\u00b139\u00b1280(E) (Supp. 1991). Because Lucas failed to pursue thisadministrative remedy, the Council never \u00aenally decidedwhether Lucas' particular piece of property was correctlycategorized as a critical area in which building would not bepermitted. This is all the more crucial because Lucas ar-gued strenuously in the trial court that his land was per-fectly safe to build on, and that his company had studies toprove it. Tr. 20, 25, 36. If he was correct, the Council's 4The Court's reliance, ante, at 1013, on Esposito v.South Carolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165, 168 (CA4 1991), cert. denied, post, p. 1219, in support of its decision to consider Lucas' temporary takings claim ripeis misplaced. In Esposito the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge to the mere enactment of the Act. Here, of course, Lucas has brought an as-applied challenge. See Brief for Petitioner 16. Facial challenges are ripewhen the Act is passed; applied challenges require a \u00aenal decision on theAct's application to the property in question.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES 1043 Cite 1003 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting \u00aenal decision would have been to alter the setback line, elim- inating the construction ban on Lucas' property. That petitioner's property fell within the critical area as initially interpreted by the Council does not excuse petition-er's failure to challenge the Act's application to his propertyin the administrative process. The claim is not ripe untilpetitioner seeks a variance from that status. \u00aa[W]e havemade it quite clear that the mere assertion of regulatoryjurisdiction by a governmental body does not constitute aregulatory taking.\u00ba United States v.Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 126 (1985). See also Williamson County, 473 U. S., at 188 (claim not ripe because respondent did not seek variances that would have allowed it to developthe property, notwithstanding the commission's \u00aending thatthe plan did not comply with the zoning ordinance and subdi-vision regulations). 5 Even if I agreed with the Court that there were no juris- dictional barriers to deciding this case, I still would not tryto decide it. The Court creates its new takings jurispru-dence based on the trial court's \u00aending that the property 5Even more baf\u00afing, given its decision, just a few days ago, in Lujan v.

Lucas had a full trial on his claim for \u00aa `damages for the temporarytaking of his property' from the date of the 1988 Act's passage to `suchtime as this matter is \u00aenally resolved,' \u00ba ante, at 1013, n. 3, quoting the complaint, and failed to demonstrate any immediate concrete plans to buildor sell.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1044 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA Blackmun, J., dissenting had lost all economic value.6This \u00aending is almost certainly erroneous. Petitioner still can enjoy other attributes ofownership, such as the right to exclude others, \u00aaone of themost essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are com-monly characterized as property.\u00ba Kaiser Aetna v.United States, 444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979). Petitioner can picnic, swim, camp in a tent, or live on the property in a movable trailer.State courts frequently have recognized that land has eco-nomic value where the only residual economic uses are recre-ation or camping. See, e. g., Turnpike Realty Co. v.Ded- ham, 362 Mass. 221, 284 N. E. 2d 891 (1972); Turner v. County of Del Norte, 24 Cal. App. 3d 311, 101 Cal. Rptr. 93 (1972), cert. denied, 409 U. S. 1108 (1973); Hall v.Board of Environmental Protection, 528 A. 2d 453 (Me. 1987). Peti- tioner also retains the right to alienate the land, which wouldhave value for neighbors and for those prepared to enjoyproximity to the ocean without a house. Yet the trial court, apparently believing that \u00aaless value\u00ba and \u00aavalueless\u00ba could be used interchangeably, found theproperty \u00aavalueless.\u00ba The court accepted no evidence fromthe State on the property's value without a home, and peti-tioner's appraiser testi\u00aeed that he never had consideredwhat the value would be absent a residence. Tr. 54\u00b155.The appraiser's value was based on the fact that the \u00aahighestand best use of these lots . single family de-tached dwe llings.\u00ba Id.,at 48. The trial court appeared to believe that the property could be considered \u00aavalueless\u00ba ifit was not available for its most pro\u00aetable use. Absent thaterroneous assumption, see Goldblatt, 369 U. S., at 592, I \u00aend no evidence in the record supporting the trial court's conclu-sion that the damage to the lots by virtue of the restrictions 6Respondent contested the \u00aendings of fact of the trial court in the South Carolina Supreme Court, but that court did not resolve the issue.

Clearly, the Court was eager to decide this case. 7But eagerness, in the absence of proper jurisdiction, must\u00d0andin this case should have been\u00d0met with restraint. III The Court's w illing ness to dispense with precedent in its haste to reach a result is not limited to its initial jurisdic-tional decision. The Court also alters the long-settled rulesof review. The South Carolina Supreme Court's decision to defer to legislative judgments in the absence of a challenge from peti-tioner comports with one of this Court's oldest maxims:\u00aa[T]he existence of facts supporting the legislative judgmentis to be presumed.\u00ba United States v.Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938). Indeed, we have said the legisla-ture's judgment is \u00aawell-nigh conclusive.\u00ba Berman v.Par- 7The Court overlooks the lack of a ripe and justiciable claim apparently out of concern that in the absence of its intervention Lucas will be unable to obtain further adjudication of his temporary takings claim. The Courtchastises respondent for arguing that Lucas' temporary takings claim ispremature because it failed \u00aaso much as [to] commen[t]\u00ba upon the effect ofthe South Carolina Supreme Court's decision on petitioner's ability to ob-tain relief for the 2-year period, and it frets that Lucas would \u00aabe unable(absent our intervention now) to obtain further state-court adjudicationwith respect to the 1988\u00b11990 period.\u00ba Ante, at 1012. Whatever the ex- planation for the Court's intense interest in Lucas' plight when ordinarilywe are more cautious in granting discretionary review, the concern wouldhave been more prudently expressed by vacating the judgment below andremanding for further consideration in light of the 1990 amendments. Atthat point, petitioner could have brought a temporary takings claim thestate courts.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1046 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Blackmun, J., dissenting ker, 348 U.

S., at 388 (\u00aaIf the validity of the legislative classi\u00aecation for zoning purposes be fairlydebatable, the legislative judgment must be allowed tocontrol\u00ba). Accordingly, this Court always has required plaintiffs chal- lenging the constitutionality of an ordinance to provide\u00aasome factual foundation of record\u00ba that contravenes the leg-islative \u00aendings. O'Gorman & Young , 282 U. S., at 258. In the absence of such proof, \u00aathe presumption of constitution-ality must prevail.\u00ba Id.,at 257. We only recently have re- af\u00aermed that claimants have the burden of showing a statelaw constitutes a taking. See Keystone Bituminous Coal, 480 U. S., at 485. See also Goldblatt, 369 U. S., at 594 (citing \u00aathe usual presumption of constitutionality\u00ba that applies tostatutes attacked as takings). Rather than invoking these traditional rules, the Court de- cides the State has the burden to convince the courts that itslegislative judgments are correct. Despite Lucas' completefailure to contest the legislature's \u00aendings of serious harm tolife and property if a permanent structure is built, the Courtdecides that the legislative \u00aendings are not suf\u00aecient to jus-tify the use prohibition. Instead, the Court \u00aaemphasize[s]\u00bathe State must do more than merely proffer its legislativejudgments to avoid invalidating its law. Ante, at 1031. In this case, apparently, the State now has the burden of show-ing the regulation is not a taking. The Court offers no justi-\u00aecation for its sudden hostility toward state legislators, andI doubt that it could. IV The Court does not reject the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision simply on the basis of its disbelief and dis-trust of the legislature's \u00aendings. It also takes the opportu-nity to create a new scheme for regulations that eliminateall economic value. From now on, there is a categorical rule\u00aending these regulations to be a taking unless the use they505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:21 PAGES OPINPGT 1047 Cite as: 505 U.

If one fact about the Court's takings jurisprudence can bestated without contradiction, it is that \u00aathe particular cir-cumstances of each case\u00ba determine whether a speci\u00aec re-striction will be rendered invalid by the government's failureto pay compensation. United States v.Central Eureka Min- ing Co., 357 U. S. 155, 168 (1958). This is so because al- though we have articulated certain factors to be considered,including the economic impact on the property owner, theultimate conclusion \u00aanecessarily requires a weighing of pri-vate and public interests.\u00ba Agins, 447 U. S., at 261. When the government regulation prevents the owner from any eco-nomically valuable use of his property, the private interestis unquestionably substantial, but we have never before heldthat no public interest can outweigh it. Instead the Court'sprior decisions \u00aauniformly reject the proposition that dimi-nution in property value, standing alone, can establish a `tak-ing.' \u00ba Penn Central Transp. Co. v.New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 131 (1978). This Court repeatedly has recognized the ability of gov- ernment, in certain circumstances, to regulate propertywithout compensation no matter how adverse the \u00aenancialeffect on the owner may be. More than a century ago, theCourt explicitly upheld the right of States to prohibit usesof property injurious to public health, safety, or welfarewithout paying compensation: \u00aaA prohibition simply uponthe use of property for purposes that are declared, by validlegislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety ofthe community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a takingor an appropriation COUNCIL Blackmun, J., dissenting U. S., at 668\u00b1669. On this basis, the Court upheld an ordi- nance effectively prohibiting operation of a previously lawfulbrewery, although the \u00aaestablishments will become of novalue as property.\u00ba Id.,at 664; see also id.,at 668. Mugler was only the beginning in a long line of cases. 8In Powell v.Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678 (1888), the Court up- held legislation prohibiting the manufacture of oleomarga-rine, despite the owner's allegation that \u00aaif prevented fromcontinuing it, the value of his property employed thereinwould be entirely lost and he be deprived of the means of livelihood.\u00ba Id., at 682. In Hadacheck v.Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915), the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting abrickyard, although the owner had made excavations on theland that prevented it from being ut ilized for any purpose but a brickyard. Id.,at 405. In Miller v.Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did notrequire Virginia to pay compensation to the owner of cedartrees ordered destroyed to prevent a disease from spreadingto nearby apple orchards. The \u00aapreferment of [the publicinterest] over the property interest of the individual, to theextent even of its destruction, is one of the distinguishingcharacteristics of every exercise of the police power whichaffects property.\u00ba Id., at 280. Again, in Omnia Commer- cial Co. v.United States, 261 U. S. 502 (1923), the Court stated that \u00aadestruction of, or injury to, property is fre-quently accomplished without a `taking' in the constitutionalsense.\u00ba Id.,at 508. More recently, in Goldblatt, the Court upheld a town regu- lation that barred continued operation of an existing sandand gravel operation in order to protect public safety. 369 8Prior to Mugler, the Court had held that owners whose real property is wholly destroyed to prevent the spread of a \u00aere are not entitled tocompensation.

Even if the Court's factual prem-ise were correct, its understanding of the Court's cases isdistorted. In none of the cases did the Court suggest thatthe right of a State to prohibit certain activities without pay-ing compensation turned on the availability of some residualvaluable use. 12Instead, the cases depended on whether the if total value has been taken. The Court has indicated that proof that a regulation does notdeny an owner economic use of his property is suf\u00ae- cient to defeat a facial takings challenge. See Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 295\u00b1297 (1981). But the conclusion that a regulation is not on its face a taking because it allowsthe landowner some economic use of property is a far cry from the proposi-tion that denial of such use is suf\u00aecient to establish a takings claim regard- less of any other consideration. The Court never has accepted the latterproposition. The Court relies today on dicta in Agins, Hodel, Nollan v.California Coastal Comm'n, Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v.DeBene dictis, 480 U. S. 470 (1987), for its new categorical rule. Ante, at 1015\u00b11016. I prefer to rely on the directly contrary holdings in cases such as Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887), and Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915), not to mention contrary statements in the very cases on which the Court relies. See Agins, 447 U. S., at 260\u00b1262; Keystone Bituminous Coal, 480 U. S., at 489, n. 18, 491\u00b1492. 12Miller v.Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928), is an example. In the course of demonstrating that apple trees are more valuable than red cedar trees,the Court noted that red cedar has \u00aaoccasional use and value as lumber.\u00baId.,at 279. But the Court did not discuss whether the timber owned by the petitioner in that case was commercially salable, and nothing in theopinion suggests that the State's right to require uncompensated fellingof the trees depended on any such salvage value. To the contrary, it isclear from its unanimous opinion that the Schoene Court would have sus- tained a law requiring the burning of cedar trees if that had been neces-sary to protect apple trees in which there was a public interest: The Court505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES U. 1003 (1992) Blackmun, J., dissenting government interest was suf\u00aecient to prohibit the activity, given the signi\u00aecant private cost.13 These cases rest on the principle that the State has full power to prohibit an owner's use of property if it is harmfulto the public. \u00aa[S]ince no individual has a right to use hisproperty so as to create a nuisance or otherwise harm others,the State has not `taken' anything when it asserts its power to enjoin the nuisance-like activity.\u00ba Keystone Bituminous Coal, 480 U. S., at 491, n. 20. It would make no sense under this theory to suggest that an owner has a constitutionallyprotected right to harm others, if only he makes the propershowing of economic loss. 14See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 418 (1922) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (\u00aaRestriction upon [harmful] use does not become inappro-priate as a means, merely because it deprives the owner ofthe only use to which the property can then be pro\u00aetablyput\u00ba). spoke of preferment of the public interest over the property interest of the individual, \u00aato the extent even of its destruction.\u00ba Id.,at 280. 13The Court seeks to disavow the holdings and reasoning of Mugler and subsequent cases by explaining that they were the Court's early efforts tode\u00aene the scope of the police power. There is language in the earliesttakings cases suggesting that the police power was considered to be thepower simply to prevent harms. Subsequently, the Court expanded itsunderstanding of what were government's legitimate interests. But itdoes not follow that the holding of those early cases\u00d0that harmful andnoxious uses of property can be forbidden whatever the harm to the prop-erty owner and without the payment of compensation\u00d0was repudiated.To the contrary, as the Court consciously expanded the scope of the policepower beyond preventing harm, it clari\u00aeed that there was a core of publicinterests that overrode any private interest. See Keystone Bituminous Coal, 480 U. S., at 491, n. 20. 14\u00aaIndeed, it would be extraordinary to construe the Constitution to require a government to compensate private landowners because it deniedthem `the right' to use property which cannot be used without riskinginjury and death.\u00ba First Lutheran Church, 210 Cal.

Instead,the Court decides that it will permit a State to regulate alleconomic value only if the State prohibits uses that wouldnot be permitted under \u00aabackground principles of nuisanceand property law.\u00ba 15Ante, at 1031. Until today, the Court explicitly had rejected the conten- tion that the government's power to act without paying com-pensation turns on whether the prohibited activity is acommon-law nuisance. 16The brewery closed in Mugler it- self was not a common-law nuisance, and the Court speci\u00ae-cally stated that it was the role of the legislature to deter- 15Although it refers to state nuisance and property law, the Court ap- parently does not mean just any state nuisance and property law. Publicnuisance was \u00aerst a common-law creation, see Newark, The Boundaries ofNuisance, 65 L. Q. Rev. 480, 482 (1949) (attributing development of nui-sance to 1535), but by the 1800's in both the United States and England,legislatures had the power to de\u00aene what is a public nuisance, and particu-lar uses often have been selectively targeted. See Prosser, Private Ac-tion for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 999\u00b11000 (1966); J. Stephen,A General View of the Criminal Law of England 105\u00b1107 (2d ed. 1890).The Court's references to \u00aacommon-law\u00ba background legislative determinations do not constitute \u00aastate nuisanceand property law\u00ba for the Court. 16Also, until today the fact that the regulation prohibited uses that were lawful at the time the owner purchased did not determine the constitu-tional question. The brewery, the brickyard, the cedar trees, and thegravel pit were all perfectly legitimate uses prior to the passage of theregulation. See Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S., at 654; Hadacheck v.Sebas- tian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915); Miller, 276 U. S., at 272; Goldblatt v.Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590 (1962). This Court explicitly acknowledged in Hadacheck that \u00aa[a] vested interest cannot be asserted against [the police power] be-cause of conditions once obtaining. To so hold would preclude develop-ment and \u00aex a city forever in its primitive conditions.\u00ba 239 U.

In up-holding the state action in Miller, the Court found it unnec- essary to \u00aaweigh with nicety the question whether the in-fected cedars constitute a nuisance according to common law;or whether they may be so declared by statute.\u00ba 276 U. S.,at 280. See also Goldblatt, 369 U. S., at 593; Hadacheck, 239 U. S., at 411. Instead the Court has relied in the past, asthe South Carolina court has done here, on legislative judg-ments of what constitutes a harm. 17 The Court rejects the notion that the State always can prohibit uses it deems a harm to the public without grant-ing compensation because \u00aathe distinction between `harm-preventing' and `bene\u00aet-conferring' regulation is often in theeye of the beholder.\u00ba Ante, at 1024. Since the character- ization will depend \u00aaprimarily upon one's evaluation of theworth of competing uses of real estate,\u00ba ante, at 1025, the Court decides a legislative judgment of this kind no longercan provide the desired \u00aaobjective, value-free basis\u00ba forupholding a regulation, ante, at 1026. The Court, however, fails to explain how its proposed common-law alternativeescapes the same trap. 17The Court argues that \u00aending no taking when the legislature prohibits a harmful use, such as the Court did in Mugler and the South Carolina Supreme Court did in the instant case, would nullify Pennsylvania Coal. See ante, at 1022\u00b11023. Justice Holmes, the author of Pennsylvania Coal, joined Miller v.Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928), six years later. In Miller, the Court adopted the exact approach of the South Carolina court: It found the cedar trees harmful, and their destruction not a taking,whether or not they were a nuisance. Justice Holmes apparently believedthat such an approach did not repudiate his earlier opinion. Moreover,this Court already has been over this ground \u00aeve years ago, and at thatpoint rejected the assertion that Pennsylvania Coal was inconsistent with Mugler, Hadacheck, Miller, or the others in the string of \u00aanoxious use\u00ba cases, recognizing instead that the nature of the State's action iscritical in takings analysis. Keystone Bituminous Coal, 490.505us3118M 06-19-96 OPINPGT 1054 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Blackmun, J., dissenting The threshold inquiry for imposition of the Court's new rule, \u00aadeprivation of all economically valuable use,\u00ba itselfcannot be determined objectively. As the Court admits,whether the owner has been deprived of all economic valueof his property will depend on how \u00aaproperty\u00ba is de\u00aened.The \u00aacomposition of the denominator in our `deprivation'fraction,\u00ba ante, at 1017, n. 7, is the dispositive inquiry. Yet there is no \u00aaobjective\u00ba way to de\u00aene what that denominatorshould be. \u00aaWe have long understood that any land-use reg-ulation can be characterized as the `total' deprivation of de\u00aened entitlement. . . . Alternatively, the same regula-tion can always be characterized as a mere `partial' with-drawal from full, unencumbered ownership of the landhold-ing affected by the regulation . . . .\u00ba 18Michelman, Takings, 1987, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1600, 1614 (1988). The Court's decision in Keystone Bituminous Coal illus- trates this principle de- termined that the \u00aasupport estate\u00ba was \u00aamerely a part of theentire bundle of rights possessed by the owner.\u00ba 480 U. S.,at 501. Thus, the Court concluded that the support estate'sdestruction merely eliminated one segment of the total prop-erty. Ibid. The dissent, however, characterized the sup- port estate as a distinct property interest that was whollydestroyed. Id., at 519. The Court could agree on no \u00aavalue-free basis\u00ba to resolve this dispute. Even more perplexing, however, is the Court's reliance on common-law principles of nuisance in its quest for a value-free takings jurisprudence. In determining what is a nui-sance at common law, state courts make exactly the decisionthat the Court \u00aends so troubling when made by the SouthCarolina General Assembly today: They determine whetherthe use is harmful.

See Prosser, Private Action for Public Nui-sance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997 (1966) (\u00aa Nuisance is a French word which means nothing more than harm\u00ba). There is nothingmagical in the reasoning of judges long dead. They deter-mined a harm in the same way as state judges and legisla-tures do today. If judges in the 18th and 19th centuries candistinguish a harm from a bene\u00aet, why not judges in the20th century, and if judges can, why not legislators? Theresimply is no reason to believe that new interpretations ofthe hoary common-law nuisance doctrine will be particularly\u00aaobjective\u00ba or \u00aavalue free.\u00ba 19Once one abandons the level of utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, ante, at 1031, one searches in vain, I think, for anything resembling aprinciple in the common law of nuisance. C Finally, the Court justi\u00aees its new rule that the legislature may not deprive a property owner of the only economicallyvaluable use of his land, even if the legislature \u00aends it to be aharmful use, because such action is not part of the \u00aa `long rec-ognized' \u00ba \u00aaunderstandings of our citizens.\u00ba Ante, at These \u00aaunderstandings\u00ba permit such regulation only if the useis a nuisance under the common law. Any other course is\u00aainconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Tak-ings Clause.\u00ba Ante, at 1028. It is not clear from the Court's 19\u00aaThere is perhaps no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the word `nuisance.'

Marsh, 1 Pick. 418, 430 (Mass. 1823). Even when courts began to consider that regulation in some situations could constitute a taking, they continued touphold bans on particular uses without paying compensation,notwithstanding the economic impact, under the rationalethat no one can obtain a vested right to injure or endangerthe public. 24In the Coates cases, for example, the Supreme Court of New York found no taking in New York's ban onthe interment of the dead within the city, although \u00aano otheruse can be made of these lands.\u00ba Coates v.City of New York, 7 Cow. 585, 592 (N.

According to the SouthCarolina court, the power of the legislature to take unim-proved land without providing compensation was sanctionedby \u00aaancient rights and principles.\u00ba Lindsay v.Commission- ers, 2 S. C. L. 38, 57 (1796). \u00aaExcept for Massachusetts, no colony appears to have paid compensation when it built astate-owned road across unimproved land. Legislaturesprovided compensation only for enclosed or improved land.\u00baTreanor, 94 Yale L. J., at 695 (footnotes omitted). This rule was followed by some States into the 1800's. See Horwitz63\u00b165. With similar result, the common agrarian conception of property limited owners to \u00aanatural\u00ba uses of their land priorto and during much of the 18th century. See id., at 32. Thus, for example, the owner could build nothing on his landthat would alter the natural \u00afow of water. See id.,at 44; see also, e. g., Merritt v.Parker, 1 Coxe 460, 463 (N. J. 1795). Some more recent state courts still follow this reasoning.See, e. g., Just v.Marinette County, 56 Wis. 2d 7, 201 N. W. 2d 761, 768 (1972). Nor does history indicate any common-law limit on the State's power to regulate harmful uses even to the point ofdestroying all economic value. Nothing in the discussionsin Congress concerning the Takings Clause indicates that theClause was limited by the common-law nuisance doctrine.Common-law courts themselves rejected such an under-standing.

In short, I \u00aend no clear and accepted \u00aahistorical compact\u00ba or \u00aaunderstanding of our citizens\u00ba justifying the Court's newtakings doctrine. Instead, the Court seems to treat historyas a grab bag of principles, to be adopted where they supportthe Court's theory, and ignored where they do not. If theCourt decided that the early common law provides the back-ground principles for interpreting the Takings Clause, thenregulation, as opposed to physical con\u00aescation, would not becompensable. If the Court decided that the law of a laterperiod provides the background principles, then regulationmight be compensable, but the Court would have to confrontthe fact that legislatures regularly determined which useswere prohibited, independent of the common law, and inde-pendent of whether the uses were lawful when the ownerpurchased. What makes the Court's analysis unworkable isits attempt to package the law of two incompatible eras andpeddle it as historical fact. 26 25More recent state-court decisions agree. See, e. g., Lane v.Mt. Ver- non, 38 N. Y . 2d 344, 348\u00b1349, 342 N. E. 2d 571, 573 (1976); Commonwealth v.Baker, 160 Pa.

S. 1003 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting V The Court makes sweeping and, in my view, misguided and unsupported changes in our takings doctrine. While itlimits these changes to the most narrow subset of govern-ment regulation\u00d0those that eliminate all economic valuefrom land\u00d0these changes go far beyond what is necessaryto secure petitioner Lucas' private bene\u00aet. One hopes theydo not go beyond the narrow con\u00aenes the Court assigns themto today. I dissent. Justice Stevens , dissenting. Today the Court restricts one judge-made rule and ex- pands another. In my opinion it errs on both counts.Proper application of the doctrine of judicial restraint wouldavoid the premature adjudication of an important constitu-tional question. Proper respect for our precedents wouldavoid an illogical expansion of the concept of \u00aaregulatorytakings.\u00ba I As the Court notes, ante, at 1010\u00b11011, South Carolina's Beachfront Management Act has been amended to permitsome construction of residences seaward of the line that frus-trated petitioner's proposed use of his property. Until he ex-hausts his right to apply for a special permit under that amend-ment, petitioner is not entitled to an adjudication by this Courtof the merits of his permanent takings claim. MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v.Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340, 351 (1986). It is also not clear that he has a viable \u00aatemporary tak- ings\u00ba claim. If we assume that petitioner is now able tobuild on the lot, the only injury that he may have suffered is whether or not the prohibition was a common-law nuisance, and whether or not the prohibition occurred subsequent to the purchase. See supra, at 1047\u00b11048, 1052\u00b11053, and n. 16. I cannot imagine where the Court\u00aends its \u00aahistorical compact,\u00ba if not in history.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1062 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Stevens, J., dissenting the delay caused by the temporary existence of the absolute statutory ban on construction. We cannot be sure, however,that that delay caused petitioner any harm because the rec-ord does not tell us whether his building plans were eventemporarily frustrated by the enactment of the statute. 1 Thus, on the present record it is entirely possible that peti-tioner has suffered no injury in fact even if the state statutewas unconstitutional when he \u00aeled this lawsuit. It is true, as the Court notes, that the argument against deciding the constitutional issue in this case rests on pruden-tial considerations rather than a want of jurisdiction. Ithink it equally clear, however, that a Court less eager todecide the merits would follow the wise counsel of JusticeBrandeis in his deservedly famous concurring opinion inAshwander v.TV A, 297 U. S. 288, 341 (1936). As he ex- plained, the Court has developed \u00aafor its own governance inthe cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rulesunder which it has avoided passing upon a large part of allthe constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.\u00baId., at 346. The second of those rules applies directly to this case. \u00aa2. The Court will not `anticipate a question of consti- tutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.'L i v e r p o o l ,N .Y .&P .S .S .C o . v.Emigration Commis- additional cases]. `It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions ofa constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to adecision of the case.'

Cavalierly dismissing the doctrine of judicial restraint, the Court today tersely announces that \u00aawe do not think it pru-dent to apply that prudential requirement here.\u00ba Ante, at 1In this regard, it is noteworthy that petitioner acquired the lot about 18 months before the statute was passed; there is no evidence that he eversought a building permit from the local authorities.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1063 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting 1013. I respectfully disagree and would save consideration of the merits for another day. Since, however, the Courthas reached the merits, I shall do so as well. II In its analysis of the merits, the Court starts from the premise that this Court has adopted a \u00aacategorical rule thattotal regulatory takings must be compensated,\u00ba ante, at 1026, and then sets itself to the task of identifying the ex-ceptional cases in which a State may be relieved of this cate-gorical obligation, ante, at 1027\u00b11029. The test the Court announces is that the regulation must \u00aado no more thanduplicate the result that could have been achieved\u00ba under aState's nuisance law. Ante, at 1029. Under this test the categorical rule will apply unless the regulation merelymakes explicit what was otherwise an implicit limitation onthe owner's property rights. In my opinion, the Court is doubly in error. The categori- cal rule the Court establishes is an unsound and unwise addi-tion to the law and the Court's formulation of the exceptionto that rule is too rigid and too narrow. The Categorical Rule As the Court recognizes, ante, at 1015, Pennsylvania Coal Co.v.Mahon, 260 U. S. 393 (1922), provides no support for its\u00d0or, indeed, any\u00d0categorical rule. To the contrary, Jus-tice Holmes recognized that such absolute rules ill \u00aet theinquiry into \u00aaregulatory takings.\u00ba Thus, in the paragraphthat contains his famous observation that a regulation maygo \u00aatoo far\u00ba and thereby constitute a taking, the Justicewrote: \u00aaAs we already have said, this is a question of de-gree\u00d0and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propo-sitions.\u00ba Id.,at 416. What he had \u00aaalready . . . said\u00ba made perfectly clear that Justice Holmes regarded economic injuryto be merely one factor to be weighed: \u00aaOne fact for consider-ation in determining such limits is the extent of the diminu-505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1064 LUCAS Stevens, J., dissenting tion [of value.] So the question depends upon the particular facts.\u00ba Id.,at 413. Nor does the Court's new categorical rule \u00aend support in decisions following Mahon. Although in dicta we have sometimes recited that a law \u00aaeffects a taking if [it] . . . de-nies an owner economically viable his land,\u00ba Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980), our rulings have rejected such an absolute position. We have frequently\u00d0and recently\u00d0held that, in some circumstances, a law thatrenders property valueless may nonetheless not constitute ataking. See, e. g., First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v.County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S. 304, 313 (1987); Goldblatt v.Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 596 (1962); United States v.Caltex, 344 U. S. 149, 155 (1952); Miller v. Schoene, 276 U. S. 272 (1928); Hadacheck v.Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394, 405 (1915); Mugler 123 U. S. 623, 657 (1887); cf. Ruckelshaus v.Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1011 (1984); Connolly v.Pension Bene\u00aet Guaranty Corporation, 475 U. S. 211, 225 (1986). In short, as we stated in Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v.DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 490 (1987), \u00aa `Although a comparison of values before and after'a regulatory action `is relevant, . . . it is by no meansconclusive.' \u00ba In addition to lacking support in past decisions, the Court's new rule is wholly arbitrary. A landowner whose propertyis diminished in value 95% recovers nothing, while an ownerwhose property is diminished 100% recovers the land's fullvalue. The case at hand illustrates this arbitrariness well.The Beachfront Management Act not only prohibited thebuilding of new dwellings in certain areas, it also prohibitedthe rebuilding of houses that were \u00aadestroyed beyond repairby natural causes or by \u00aere.\u00ba 1988 S. C. Acts 634, \u00a7 3; seealso Esposito v.South Carolina Coastal Council, 939 F. 2d 165, 167 (CA4 1991). 2Thus, if the homes adjacent to Lucas' 2This aspect of the Act was amended in 1990. See S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 U. S. 1003 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting lot were destroyed by a hurricane one day after the Act took effect, the owners would not be able to rebuild, nor wouldthey be assured recovery. Under the Court's categorical ap-proach, Lucas (who has lost the opportunity to build) recov-ers, while his neighbors (who have lost both the opportunity to build and their homes) do not recover. The arbitrariness of such a rule is palpable. Moreover, because of the elastic nature of property rights, the Court's new rule will also prove unsound in practice. Inresponse to the rule, courts may de\u00aene \u00aaproperty\u00ba broadlyand only rarely \u00aend regulations to effect total takings. Thisis the approach the Court itself adopts in its revisionist read-ing of venerable precedents. We are told that\u00d0notwith-standing the Court's \u00aendings to the contrary in each case\u00d0the brewery in Mugler, the brickyard in Hadacheck, and the gravel pit in Goldblatt all could be put to \u00aaother uses\u00ba and that, therefore, those cases did not involve total regulatory takings. 3Ante, at 1026, n. 13. On the other hand, developers and investors may market specialized estates to take advantage of the Court's new rule.The smaller the estate, the more likely that a regulatorychange will effect a total taking. Thus, an investor may, forexample, purchase the right to build a multifamily home ona speci\u00aec lot, with the result that a zoning regulation that 3Of course, the same could easily be said in this case: Lucas may put his land to \u00aaother uses\u00ba\u00d0\u00aeshing or camping, for example\u00d0or may sell hisland to his neighbors as a buffer. In either event, his land is far from\u00aavalueless.\u00ba This highlights a fundamental weakness in the Court's analysis: its fail- ure to explain why only the impairment of \u00aa economically bene\u00aecial or productive use,\u00ba ante, at 1015 (emphasis added), of property is relevant in takings analysis. I should think that a regulation arbitrarily prohibitingan owner from continuing to use her property for bird watching or sun-bathing might constitute a taking under some circumstances; and, con-versely, that such uses are of value to the owner. Yet the Court offers nobasis for its assumption that the only uses of property cognizable underthe Constitution are developmental uses.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1066 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Stevens, J., dissenting allows only single-family homes would render the investor's property interest \u00aavalueless.\u00ba4In short, the categorical rule will likely have one of two effects: Either courts willalter the de\u00aenition of the \u00aadenominator\u00ba in the takings \u00aafrac-tion,\u00ba rendering the Court's categorical rule meaningless, orinvestors will manipulate the relevant property interests,giving the Court's rule sweeping effect. To my mind, nei-ther of these results is desirable or appropriate, and both aredistortions of our takings jurisprudence. Finally, the Court's justi\u00aecation for its new categorical rule is remarkably thin. The Court mentions in passingthree arguments in support of its rule; none is convincing.First, the Court suggests that \u00aatotal deprivation of feasibleuse is, from the landowner's point of view, the equivalent ofa physical appropriation.\u00ba Ante, at 1017. This argument proves too much. From the \u00aalandowner's point of view,\u00ba aregulation that diminishes a lot's value by 50% is as well \u00aatheequivalent\u00ba of the condemnation of half of the lot. Yet, it iswell established that a 50% diminution in value does not byitself constitute a taking. See Euclid v.Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 384 (1926) (75% diminution in value). Thus,the landowner's perception of the regulation cannot justify the Court's new rule. Second, the Court emphasizes that because total takings are \u00aarelatively rare\u00ba its new rule will not adversely affectthe government's ability to \u00aago on.\u00ba Ante, at 1018. This argument proves too little. Certainly it is true that de\u00aeninga small class of regulations that are per se takings will not 4This unfortunate possibility is created by the Court's subtle revision of the \u00aatotal regulatory takings\u00ba dicta. In past decisions, we have statedthat a regulation effects a taking if it \u00aadenies an owner economically viableuse of his land, \u00baAgins v.City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980) (em- phasis added), indicating that this \u00aatotal takings\u00ba test did not apply toother estates. Today, however, the Court suggests that a regulation mayeffect a total taking of any real property interest. See ante, at 1016\u00b1 1017, n. 7.505us3118M 06-19-96 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting greatly hinder important governmental functions\u00d0but this is true of any small class of regulations. The Court's sug- gestion only begs the question of why regulations of this particular class should always be found to effect takings. Finally, the Court suggests that \u00aaregulations that leave the owner . . .carry with them a heightened risk that private property isbeing pressed into some form of public service.\u00ba Ibid. As discussed more fully below, see Part III, infra, I agree that the risks of such singling out are of central concern intakings law. However, such risks do not justify a per se rule for total regulatory takings. There is no necessary correla-tion between \u00aasingling out\u00ba and total takings: A regulationmay single out a property owner without depriving him ofall of his property, see, e. g., Nollan v.California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 837 (1987); J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 432 A. 2d 12 (1981); and it may deprive him of all of his property without singling him out,see, e. g., Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887); Hadacheck v.Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394 (1915). What matters in such cases is not the degree of diminution of value, but ratherthe speci\u00aecity of the expropriating act. For this reason, theCourt's third justi\u00aecation for its new rule also fails. In short, the Court's new rule is unsupported by prior de- cisions, arbitrary and unsound in practice, and theoreticallyunjusti\u00aeed. In my opinion, a categorical rule as importantas the one established by the Court today should be sup-ported by more history or more reason than has yet beenprovided. The Nuisance Exception Like many bright-line rules, the categorical rule estab- lished in this case is only \u00aacategorical\u00ba for a page or two inthe U. S. Reports. No sooner does the Court state that \u00aatotal regulatory takings must be compensated,\u00ba ante, at 1026, than it quickly establishes an exception to that rule.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1068 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Stevens, J., dissenting The exception provides that a regulation that renders property valueless is not a taking if it prohibits uses of prop-erty that were not \u00aapreviously permissible under relevantproperty and nuisance principles.\u00ba Ante, at 1029\u00b11030. The Court thus rejects the basic holding in Mugler v.Kan- sas, 123 U. S. 623 (1887). There we held that a statewide statute that prohibited the owner of a brewery from makingalcoholic beverages did not effect a taking, even though theuse of the property had been perfectly lawful and caused nopublic harm before the statute was enacted. We squarelyrejected the rule the Court adopts today: \u00aaIt is true, that, when the defendants . . . erected their breweries, the laws of the State did not forbid the manu-facture of intoxicating liquors. But the State did notthereby give any assurance, or come under an obliga-tion, that its legislation upon that subject would remainunchanged. [T]he supervision of the public health andthe public morals is a governmental power, `continuingin its nature,' and `to be dealt with as the special exigen-cies of the moment may require;' . . . `for this purpose,the largest legislative discretion is allowed, and the dis-cretion cannot be parted with any more than the poweritself.' \u00ba Id.,at 669. Under our reasoning in Mugler, a State's decision to pro- hibit or to regulate certain uses of property is not a compen-sable taking just because the particular uses were previouslylawful. Under the Court's opinion today, however, if a Stateshould decide to prohibit the manufacture of asbestos, ciga-rettes, or concealable \u00aerearms, for example, it must be pre- pared to pay for the adverse economic consequences of itsdecision. One must wonder if government will be able to\u00aago on\u00ba effectively if it must risk compensation \u00aafor everysuch change in the general law.\u00ba Mahon, 260 U. S., at 413. The Court's holding today effectively freezes the State's common law, denying the legislature much of its traditional505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1069 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting power to revise the law governing the rights and uses of property. Until today, I had thought that we had long aban-doned this approach to constitutional law. More than a cen-tury ago we recognized that \u00aathe great of\u00aece of statutes isto remedy defects in the common law as they are developed,and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances.\u00baMunn v.Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134 (1877). As Justice Mar- shall observed about a position similar to that adopted bythe Court today: \u00aaIf accepted, that claim would represent a return to the era of Lochner v.New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), when common-law rights were also found immune from revi-sion by State or Federal Government. Such an ap-proach would freeze the common law as it has been con-structed by the courts, perhaps at its 19th-century stateof development. It would allow no room for change inresponse to changes in circumstance. The Due ProcessClause does not require such a result.\u00ba PruneYard Shopping Center v.Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 93 (1980) (con- curring opinion). Arresting the development of the common law is not only a departure from our prior decisions; it is also profoundlyunwise. The human condition is one of constant learningand evolution\u00d0both moral and practical. Legislatures im-plement that new learning; in doing so they must often re-vise the de\u00aenition of property and the rights of propertyowners. Thus, when the Nation came to understand thatslavery was morally wrong and mandated the emancipationof all slaves, it, in effect, rede\u00aened \u00aaproperty.\u00ba On a lesser scale, our ongoing self-education produces similar changesin the rights of property owners: New appreciation of thesigni\u00aecance of endangered species, see, e. g., Andrus v.Al- lard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979); the importance of wetlands, see, e. g., 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 3801 et seq.; and the PAGES OPINPGT 1070 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Stevens, J., dissenting lands, see, e. g., 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 1451 et seq., shapes our evolving understandings of property rights. Of course, some legislative rede\u00aenitions of property will effect a taking and must be compensated\u00d0but it certainlycannot be the case that every movement away from commonlaw does so. There is no reason, and less sense, in such anabsolute rule. We live in a world in which changes in theeconomy and the environment occur with increasing fre-quency and importance. If it was wise a century ago toallow government \u00aa `the Mugler, 123 U. S., at 669, it is imperative to do so today. The rulethat should govern a decision in a case of this kind shouldfocus on the future, not the past. 5 The Court's categorical approach rule will, I fear, greatly hamper the efforts of local of\u00aecials and planners who mustdeal with increasingly complex problems in land-use and en-vironmental regulation. As this case\u00d0in which the claimsof an individual property owner exceed $1 m illion\u00d0well demonstrates, these of\u00aecials face both substantial uncer-tainty because of the ad hoc nature of takings law and unac-ceptable penalties if they guess incorrectly about that law. 6 5Even measured in terms of ef\u00aeciency, the Court's rule is unsound. The Court today effectively establishes a form of insurance against certainchanges in land-use regulations. Like other forms of insurance, theCourt's rule creates a \u00aamoral hazard\u00ba and inef\u00aeciencies: In the face ofuncertainty about changes in the law, developers will overinvest, safe in the knowledge that if the law changes adversely, they will be entitled to compensation. See generally Farber, Economic Analysis and Just Com-pensation, 12 Int'l Rev. of Law & Econ. 125 (1992). 6As the Court correctly notes, in regulatory takings, unlike physical takings, courts have a choice of remedies. See ante, at 1030, n. 17.

In either event, however, the costs to the government are likely to be substantial and are therefore likely toimpede the development of sound land-use policy.505us3118M 06-19-96 1071 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting Viewed more broadly, the Court's new rule and exception con\u00afict with the very character of our takings jurisprudence.We have frequently and consistently recognized that thede\u00aenition of a taking cannot be reduced to a \u00aaset formula\u00baand that determining whether a regulation is a taking is\u00aaessentially [an] ad hoc, factual inquir[y].\u00ba Penn Central Transportation Co. v.New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124 (1978) (quoting Goldblatt v.Hempstead, 369 U. S., at 594). This is unavoidable, for the determination whether a law ef-fects a taking is ultimately a matter of \u00aafairness and justice,\u00baArmstrong v.United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960), and \u00aanec- essarily requires a weighing of private and public interests,\u00baAgins, 447 U. S., at 261. The rigid rules \u00aexed by the Court today clash with this enterprise: \u00aafairness and justice\u00ba areoften disserved by categorical rules. III It is well established that a takings case \u00aaentails inquiry into [several factors:] the character of the governmentalaction, its economic impact, and its interference with rea-sonable investment-backed expectations.\u00ba PruneYard, 447 U. S., at 83. The Court's analysis today focuses on the lasttwo of these three factors: The categorical rule addresses a regulation's \u00aaeconomic impact,\u00ba while the nuisance exceptionrecognizes that ownership brings with it only certain \u00aaexpec-tations.\u00ba Neglected by the Court today is the \u00aerst and, insome ways, the most important factor in takings analysis:the character of the regulatory action.

S. 312, 325 (1893). We have, therefore, in our takings law frequently looked to the generality of a regula- tion of property.7 For example, in the case of so-called \u00aadevelopmental exac- tions,\u00ba we have paid special attention to the risk that partic-ular landowners might \u00aab[e] singled out to bear the burden\u00baof a broader problem not of his own making.

Similarly, in distinguishing between the KohlerAct (at issue in Mahon ) and the Subsidence Act (at issue in Keystone ), we found signi\u00aecant that the regulatory function of the latter was substantially broader. Unlike the Kohler 7This principle of generality is well rooted in our broader understand- ings of the Constitution as designed in part to control the \u00aamischiefs offaction.\u00ba See The Federalist No. 10, p. 43 (G.

S. 252, 263, n. 3 (1982) ( Stevens, J. , concurring in judgment). . . . In Prince v.Massachus etts, 321 U. S. 158 (1944), we held that a mother could be prosecuted under the child labor laws for usingher children to dispense literature in the streets, her religious motivationnotwithstanding. We found no constitutional in\u00aermity in `excluding[these children] from doing there what no other children may do.' Id.,at 171. In Braunfeld v.Brown, 366 U. S. 599 (1961) (plurality opinion), we upheld Sunday-closing laws against the claim that they burdened the reli-gious practices of persons whose religions compelled them to refrain fromwork on other days. In Gillette v.United States, 401 U. S. 437, 461 (1971), we sustained the military Selective Service System against the claim thatit violated free exercise by conscripting persons who opposed a particularwar on religious grounds.\u00ba If such a neutral law of general applicability may severely burden consti- tutionally protected interests in liberty, a comparable burden on propertyowners should not be considered unreasonably onerous.505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1073 Cite as: 505 U.

See Keystone, 480 U. S., at 486. Perhaps the most familiar application of this princi-ple of generality arises in zoning cases. A diminution invalue caused by a zoning regulation is far less likely to con-stitute a taking if it is part of a general and comprehensiveland-use plan, see Euclid v.Amber Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926); conversely, \u00aaspot zoning\u00ba is far more likely to consti-tute a taking, see Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 132, and n. 28. The presumption that a permanent physical occupation, no matter how slight, effects a taking is wholly consistent withthis principle. A physical taking entails a certain amountof \u00aasingling out.\u00ba 8Consistent with this principle, physical occupations by third parties are more likely to effect takingsthan other physical occupations. Thus, a regulation requir-ing the installation of a junction box owned by a third party,Loretto v.Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419 (1982), is more troubling than a regulation requiring theinstallation of sprinklers or smoke detectors; just as an ordergranting third parties access to a marina, Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164 (1979), is more troubling than an order requiring the placement of safety buoys in the marina. In analyzing takings claims, courts have long recognized the difference between a regulation that targets one or twoparcels of land and a regulation that enforces a statewidepolicy. See, e. g., A. A. Pro\u00aeles, F. 2d (CA5 1981); Trustees Will of 357 1304 (La. App. also Burrows v.Keene, 121 N. H. 590, 596, 432 A. 2d 15, 21 (1981); Herman Glick Realty Co. v.St. Louis County, 545 S.

Pursuant to the federal Act, every coastal State has implemented coastline regulations. 9 Moreover, the Act did not single out owners of undevelopedland.

Admittedly, the economic impact of this regulation is dra- matic and petitioner's investment-backed expectations aresubstantial. Yet, if anything, the costs to and expectationsof the owners of developed land are even greater: I doubt,however, that the cost to owners of developed land of renour-ishing the beach and allowing their seawalls to deteriorateeffects a taking. The costs imposed on the owners of unde-veloped land, such as petitioner, differ from these costs onlyin degree, not in kind. The impact of the ban on developmental uses must also be viewed in light of the purposes of the Act. The legislaturestated the purposes of the Act as \u00aaprotect[ing], preserv[ing],restor[ing] and enhanc[ing] the beach/dune system\u00ba of theState not only for recreational and ecological purposes, butalso to \u00aaprotec[t] life and property.\u00ba S.

Carolina Legislature persuade me that the Act did not effect a taking of petitioner's property. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. Statement of Justice Souter . I would dismiss the writ of certiorari in this case as having been granted improvidently. After brie\u00aeng and argumentit is abundantly clear that an unreviewable assumption onwhich this case comes to us is both questionable as a conclu-sion of Fifth Amendment law and suf\u00aecient to frustrate theCourt's ability to render certain the legal premises on whichits holding rests. The petition for review was granted on the assumption that the State by regulation had deprived the owner of hisentire economic interest in the subject property. Such was the state trial court's conclusion, which the State SupremeCourt did not review. It is apparent now that in light of ourprior cases, see, e. g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. 480 U. S. 470, Andrus v.Al- lard, U. Central Transporta- tion Corp. v.N e wY o r kC i t y , 438 U. S. 104, 130\u00b1131 (1978), the trial court's conclusion is highly questionable. Whilethe respondent now wishes to contest the point, see Brief forRespondent 45\u00b150, the Court is certainly right to refuse totake up the issue, which is not fairly included within thequestion presented, and has received only the most super\u00ae-cial and one-sided treatment before us. Because the questionable conclusion of total deprivation cannot be reviewed, the Court is precluded from attemptingto clarify the concept of total (and, in the Court's view, cate-gorically compensable) taking on which it rests, a conceptwhich the Court describes, see ante, at 1016\u00b11017, n. 6, as so uncertain under existing law as to have fostered inconsistentpronouncements by the Court itself. Because that concept isleft uncertain, so is the signi\u00aecance of the exceptions to thecompensation requirement that the Court proceeds to recog-505us3118M 06-19-96 18:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT 1077 Cite as: 505 U. S. 1003 (1992) Statement of Souter, J. nize. This alone is enough to show that there is little utility in attempting to deal with this case on the merits. The imprudence of proceeding to the merits in spite of these unpromising circumstances is underscored by the factthat, in doing so, the Court cannot help but assume some-thing about the scope of the uncertain concept of total depri-vation, even when it is barred from explicating total dep-rivation directly. Thus, when the Court concludes that theapplication of nuisance law provides an exception to the gen-eral rule that complete denial of economically bene\u00aecial useof property amounts to a compensable taking, the Court will be understood to suggest (if it does not assume) that thereare in fact circumstances in which state-law nuisance abate-ment may amount to a denial of all bene\u00aecial land use as thatconcept is to be employed in our takings jurisprudence underthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The nature of nui-sance law, however, indicates that application of a regulationdefensible on grounds of nuisance prevention or abatementwill quite probably not amount to a complete deprivation infact. The nuisance enquiry focuses on conduct, not on thecharacter of the property on which that conduct is per-formed, see 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 821B (1979)(public nuisance); id.,\u00a7 822 (private nuisance), and the reme- dies for such conduct usually leave the property owner withother reasonable uses of his property, see W. Keeton, D.Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Lawof Torts \u00a7 90 (5th ed. 1984) (public nuisances usually reme-died by criminal prosecution or abatement), id.,\u00a7 89 (private nuisances usually remedied by damages, injunction, or abate-ment); see also, e. g., Mugler v.Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 668\u00b1 669 (1887) (prohibition on use of property to manufactureintoxicating beverages \u00aadoes not disturb the owner in thecontrol or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor re-strict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration bythe State that its use . . . for certain 1078 LUCAS v.SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL Statement of Souter, J. 239 U. S. 394, 412 (1915) (prohibition on operation of brick- yard did not prohibit extraction of clay from which brickswere produced). Indeed, it is dif\u00aecult to imagine propertythat can be used only to create a nuisance, such that its soleeconomic value must presuppose the right to occupy it forsuch seriously noxious activity. The upshot is that the issue of what constitutes a total deprivation is being addressed by indirection, and with un-certain results, in the Court's treatment of defenses to com-pensation claims. While the issue of what constitutes totaldeprivation deserves the Court's attention, as does the rela-tionship between nuisance abatement and such total depri-vation, the Court should confront these matters directly. Be-cause it can neither do so in this case, nor skip over thosepreliminary issues and deal independently with defenses tothe Court's categorical compensation rule, the Court shoulddismiss the instant writ and await an opportunity to face thetotal deprivation question squarely. Under these circum-stances, I believe it proper for me to vote to dismiss the writ,despite the Court's contrary preference. See, e. g., Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 755 (1984) (Burger, C. J.); United States v.Shannon, 342 U. S. 288, 294 (1952) (Frankfurter, J.).505us3119Z 06-17-96 PAGES OPINPGT 1079 OCTOBER TERM, ESPINOSA v.FLORIDA on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of florida No. 91\u00b17390. Decided June 29, 1992 During the penalty phase of a capital murder trial in Florida, a jury is asked to recommend whether a defendant should be sentenced to deathor life imprisonment in a verdict that does not include speci\u00aec \u00aendings ofaggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court itself must thenweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine whatthe sentence will be, and it must issue a written statement of the circum- stances found and weighed if the sentence is death. In petitioner Es-pinosa's case, the jury was instructed, inter alia, that it could \u00aend as an aggravating factor that the murder was \u00aaespecially wicked, evil, atro-cious or cruel.\u00ba It recommended that the trial court impose death, and\u00aending four aggravating and two mitigating factors, the court did so.On appeal, the State Supreme Court af\u00aermed, rejecting Espinosa's ar-gument that the instruction in question was vague and left the jurywith insuf\u00aecient guidance when to \u00aend the existence of the aggravat-ing factor. Held: If a weighing State requires a trial court to pay deference to a jury's sentencing recommendation in determining the appropriate sentence,the jury's consideration of an invalid aggravating circumstance unconsti-tutionally infects the court's sentencing determination. Instructionsmore speci\u00aec and elaborate than the one given in the instant case havebeen found unconstitutionally vague, and the weighing of an invalid ag-gravating circumstance violates the Eighth Amendment. The State in-correctly argues that there was no need to instruct the jury with thespeci\u00aecity required by this Court's cases because Florida juries are notthe sentencers. While a trial court in Florida is not bound by a jury's recommendation, it is required to give \u00aagreat weight\u00ba to it. It must bepresumed that the jury in this case weighed the invalid instruction inmaking its recommendation and that the trial court followed state lawand gave deference to that recommendation. Thus, the trial court indi-rectly weighed the invalid aggravating factor itself, creating the samepotential for arbitrariness as the direct weighing of such a factor. Certiorari granted; 589 So. 2d 887, Curiam . Under Florida law, after a defendant is found guilty of a capital felony, a separate sentencing proceeding is conductedto determine whether the sentence should be life imprison-ment or death. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.141(1) (1991). At the closeof a hearing at which the prosecution and the defense maypresent evidence and argument in favor of and against thedeath penalty, ibid., the trial judge charges the jurors to con- sider \u00aa[w]hether suf\u00aecient aggravating circumstances exist,\u00ba\u00aa[w]hether suf\u00aecient mitigating circumstances exist whichoutweigh the aggravating circumstances,\u00ba and \u00aa[b]ased onthese considerations, whether the defendant should be sen-tenced to life imprisonment or death.\u00ba \u00a7 921.141(2). Theverdict does not include speci\u00aec \u00aendings circumstances, but states only the jury's sentenc-ing recommendation. \u00aaNotwithstanding the recommenda-tion of a majority of the jury,\u00ba the trial court itself must then\u00aaweig[h] the aggravating and mitigating circumstances\u00ba todetermine \u00aenally whether the sentence will be life or death.\u00a7 921.141(3). If the trial court \u00aexes punishment at death, thecourt must issue a written statement of the circumstances found and weighed. Ibid. A Florida jury found petitioner Henry Jose Espinosa guilty of \u00aerst-degree murder. At the close of the evidencein the penalty hearing, the trial court instructed the jury onaggravating factors. One of the instructions informed thejury that it was entitled to \u00aend as an aggravating factor thatthe murder of which it had found Espinosa guilty was \u00aaespe-cially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel.\u00ba See \u00a7 921.141(h).The jury recommended that the trial court impose death, andthe court, \u00aending four aggravating and two mitigating fac-tors, did so. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida,petitioner argued that the \u00aawicked, evil, atrocious or cruel\u00bainstruction was vague and therefore left the jury with insuf-\u00aecient guidance when to \u00aend the existence of the aggravatingfactor. The court rejected this argument and af\u00aermed, say-505us3119Z 06-17-96 PAGES OPINPGT Per Curiam ing: \u00aaWe reject Espinosa's complaint with respect to the text of the jury instruction on the heinous, atrocious, or cruelaggravating factor upon the rationale of Smalley v.State, 546 So. 2d 720 (Fla. 1989).\u00ba 589 So. 2d 887, 894 (1991). Our cases establish that, in a State where the sentencer weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, theweighing of an invalid aggravating circumstance violates theEighth Amendment. See Sochor v.Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 532 (1992); Stringer v.Black, 503 U. S. 222, 232 (1992); Our cases further estab- lish that an aggravating circumstance is invalid in this senseif its description is so vague as to leave the sentencer with-out suf\u00aecient guidance for determining the presence or ab-sence of the factor. See Stringer, supra, at 235. We have held instructions more speci\u00aec and elaborate than the onegiven in the instant case unconstitutionally vague. SeeShell v.Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1 (1990); Maynard v.Cart- wright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988); Godfrey v.Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980). The State here does not argue that the \u00aaespecially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel\u00ba instruction given in this case wasany less vague than the instructions we found lacking inShell, Cartwright, orGodfrey. Instead, echoing the State Supreme Court's reasoning in Smalley v.State, 546 So. 2d, at 722, the State argues that there was no need to instructthe jury with the speci\u00aecity our cases have required wherethe jury was the \u00aenal sentencing authority, because, in theFlorida scheme, the jury is not \u00aathe sentencer\u00ba for EighthAmendment purposes. This is true, the State argues, be-cause the trial court is not bound by the jury's sentencingrecommendation; rather, the court must independently de-termine which aggravating and mitigating circumstancesexist, and, after weighing the circumstances, enter a sen-tence \u00aa[n]otwithstanding the recommendation of a majorityof Our examination of Florida case law indicates, however, that a Florida trial court is required to pay deference to ajury's sentencing recommendation, in that the trial courtmust give \u00aagreat weight\u00ba to the jury's recommendation,whether that recommendation life, see Tedder v.State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975), or death, see Smith v.State, 515 So. 2d 182, 185 (Fla. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 971(1988); Grossman v.State, 525 So. 2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071 (1989). Thus, Florida has essen-tially split the weighing process in two. Initially, the juryweighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the result of that weighing process is then in turn weighedwithin the trial court's process of weighing aggravating andmitigating circumstances. It is true that, in this case, the trial court did not directly weigh any invalid aggravating circumstances. But, we mustpresume that the jury did so, see Mills v.Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, 376\u00b1377 (1988), just as we must further presumethat the trial court followed Florida law, cf. Walton v.Ari- zona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990), and gave to the resultant recommendation. By giving \u00aagreat weight\u00ba tothe jury recommendation, the trial court indirectly weighedthe invalid aggravating factor that we must presume thejury found. This kind of indirect weighing of an invalid ag-gravating factor creates the same potential for arbitrarinessas the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor, cf.Baldwin v.Alabama, 472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985), and the re- sult, therefore, was error. We have often recognized that there are many constitu- tionally permissible ways in which States may choose to allo-cate capital sentencing authority. See id.,at 389; Spaziano v.Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 464 (1984). Today's decision in no way signals a retreat from that position. We merely holdthat, if a weighing State decides to place capital sentencingauthority in two actors rather than one, neither actor mustbe permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances.505us3119Z 06-17-96 23:05:25 PAGES OPINPGT 1083 Cite as: 505 U.

Decided July 17, 1992 Respondent federal of\u00aecials con\u00aescated applicant Benten's supply of RU\u00b1 486, a drug not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),at airport customs as she tried to import a single dosage in order toinduce a nonsurgical abortion. The District Court entered a prelimi-nary injunction compelling the drug's immediate return to Benten,which the Court of Appeals stayed pending an appeal. Held: The application to vacate the stay is denied. Applicants have failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of theirclaim that Benten is entitled to the drug's return on the ground thatthe administrative document instructing of\u00aecials to seize the drug waspromulgated without notice-and-comment procedures assertedly re-quired by both the Administrative Procedure Act and FDA regulations.The Court expresses no opinion on the merits of the claim that holdingthe drug would constitute an undue burden upon Benten's constitution-ally protected abortion rights, since that claim was addressed neitherby the courts below nor by applicants' \u00aelings in this Court. Application denied. Per Curiam . Petitioner Leona Benten wants to use RU\u00b1486, a drug not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), inorder to induce a nonsurgical abortion. She tried to importa single dosage of the drug for that purpose, but respondentfederal of\u00aecials con\u00aescated her supply at airport customs.Petitioners \u00aeled suit in the District Court for the EasternDistrict of New York in order to compel the immediate re-turn of the drug to Benten. The District Court entered apreliminary injunction granting this remedy. Respondentsappealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitstayed the injunction pending the appeal. Petitioners have\u00aeled an application to vacate the Court of the application.505us3120Z 10-24-95 U. 1084 (1992) Stevens, J., dissenting Petitioners contend that Benten is entitled to the return of her RU\u00b1486 because an administrative document instructingenforcement of\u00aecials to seize that drug was promulgatedwithout notice-and-comment procedures assertedly requiredunder both the Administrative Procedure Act and FDA reg- ulations. We conclude that petitioners have failed to dem-onstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits ofthese claims. Justice Stevens contends that the Govern- ment's holding the drug would constitute an undue burdenupon Benten's constitutionally protected abortion rights.See post this page and 1086. We express no view on the merits of this assertion. The claim under which Justice Stevens would grant relief was addressed neither by the District Court nor by the Court of Appeals nor by petition-ers' \u00aelings in this Court. Accordingly, we conclude that it is not properly before us. Petitioners' application to vacate the Court of Appeals' July 15, 1992, stay pending respondents' appeal, presentedtoJustice Thomas and by him referred to the Court, is denied. It is so ordered. Justice Blackmun dissents and would grant the applica- tion to vacate the stay. Justice Stevens , dissenting. Whether an undue burden has been imposed on the exer- cise of a constitutional right depends on the relative signi\u00ae-cance of the burden, on the one hand, and the governmentalinterest at stake, on the other. In this case, applicant Benten's constitutionally protected interest in liberty has two components\u00d0her decision to ter-minate the pregnancy and her decision concerning themethod of doing so.

There is no evi-dence in this record that Benten faces any such risk; indeed,on the speci\u00aec facts of this case, the Government's purportedinterest actually supports her position. In all events, I ampersuaded that the relevant legitimate federal interest is notsuf\u00aecient to justify the burdensome consequence of thisseizure. Accordingly, I would grant the application. *The Regulatory Procedures Manual provides in pertinent part as follows: \u00aaIn deciding whether to exercise discretion to allow personal shipments of drugs or devices, FDA personnel should consider a more permissive policyin the following situations: \u00aawhen the intended use is appropriately identi\u00aeed, such use is not for treatment of a serious condition, and the product is not known to representa signi\u00aecant health risk.\u00ba Ch. 9\u00b171\u00b130(C).05-08-96 17:43:49 505ordnote PART Note The next page is purposely numbered 1201.

Application for stay, presented to Jus- tice Thomas, and by him referred to the Court, granted, and it is ordered that the judgment of the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Second Circuit, case No. 92\u00b16144, \u00aeled July 29, 1992,and the subsequent July 29, 1992, order of the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York, case No.92 CV 1258, are stayed pending the \u00aeling of a petition for writ of certiorari on or before August 24, 1992.

An applicant for a stay pending the disposition of a petition for certiorari faces a heavy burden. The applicant must demonstrate(1) a likelihood of irreparable harm if the judgment below is notstayed; (2) a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted;(3) a signi\u00aecant possibility that the judgment below will be re-versed; and (4) that the balance of the equities tilts clearly inits favor. I do not think the Government has met the lattertwo conditions. Eight federal judges have now considered the territorial reach of 8 U. S. C. \u00a71253(h). Four have concluded that the statute doesnot apply in international waters, and four have concluded that itdoes. Given the thorough and careful reasoning of the majorityand concurring opinions below, I do not see how the Court canconclude at this stage that the Government's likelihood of successon the merits is any better than even. That is not fatal to theGovernment's application, for if each party's chance of succeed-ing is equal, a strong showing on the equities can still carry theday for the Government. But no such showing has been made.While the Government has offered a vague invocation of harm toforeign policy, immigration policy, and the federal treasury, theplaintiffs in this case face the real and immediate prospect ofpersecution, terror, and possibly even death at the hands of thoseto whom they are being forcibly returned. So determined theDistrict Court, to whose \u00aendings we should defer where the bal-ance of equities is highly factual in nature. Block v.North Side Lumber Co., 473 U. S. 1307 (1985) ( Rehnquist , Circuit Justice). I would deny the application for a stay. August 4, 1992 Dismissal Under Rule 46 No. 91\u00b11700. Checkett, Trustee in Bankruptcy v.Vick- ers et ux. C.

Justice O\u0092Connor would grant the motion in its entirety. Justice Stevens , with whom Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting. In a statutory construction case that is important enough to merit reargument, the Court should err on the side of allowingfull discussion of the entire statute at issue. Without having ex-amined the supplemental brief attached to respondents' motion,and noting the absence of any objection from petitioners, I wouldtherefore allow it to be \u00aeled as a matter of course. Because Iintend to read the entire supplemental brief in preparation forthe reargument\u00d0despite the Court's peculiar order\u00d0I would wel-come comment by petitioners on all issues discussed therein.

Decided June 20, 1992 The request of applicant Reynolds is granted to stay a Court of Appeals' order staying a preliminary injunction which barred The Athletic Con-gress of the U. S. A., Inc., and the International Amateur Athletic Fed-eration from impeding or interfering with Reynolds' ability to competein the 1992 United States Olympic Trials. The District Court's opinionon the issue whether Reynolds has established a probability of successon the merits is persuasive. With respect to whether the availabilityof a damages remedy precludes a \u00aending of irreparable harm, a decentrespect for the incomparable importance of winning an Olympic goldmedal demonstrates that a pecuniary award is not an adequate substi-tute for the intangible values for which the world's greatest athletescompete. Justice Stevens , Circuit Justice. On June 19, 1992, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered a preliminary injunctionbarring The Athletic Congress of the U. S. A., Inc., and theInternational Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) from im-peding or interfering with Harry L. Reynolds, Jr.'s, abilityto compete in the 1992 United States Olympic Trials. Laterthat day, the United States Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit issued an order staying the preliminary injunction.Mr. Reynolds has applied to me in my capacity as a CircuitJustice for a stay of the order of the Court of Appeals. In my opinion, the IAAF's threatened harm to third par- ties cannot dictate the proper disposition of applicant's claim.The dispositive questions for me are, 08:33:54 PAGES IC13BXPGT n 1302 REYNOLDS v.INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR ATHLETIC FEDERATION Opinion in Chambers has established a probability of success on the merits, and second, whether the availability of a damages remedy pre-cludes a \u00aending of irreparable harm. With respect to the\u00aerst, I \u00aend the District Court's opinion persuasive. Withrespect to the second, a decent respect for the incomparableimportance of winning a gold medal in the Olympic Gamesconvinces me that a pecuniary award is not an adequate sub-stitute for the intangible values for which the world's great-est athletes compete. Of course, I recognize that this ruling may not establish applicant's right to compete in the Olympics at Barcelona,but that opportunity will presumably be foreclosed if he isnot allowed to participate in the Olympic Trials. On theother hand, the harm, if any, to the IAAF can be fully curedby a fair and objective determination of the merits of thecontroversy. Indeed, applicant may fail to qualify, thusmooting the entire matter; if he does qualify, his eligibilitycan be reviewed before the \u00aenal event in Barcelona. The IAAF's threat to enforce its eligibility decision\u00d0no matter how arbitrary or erroneous it may be\u00d0by punishinginnocent third parties cannot be permitted to in\u00afuence a fairand impartial adjudication of the merits of applicant's claims. The application for a stay is granted.505bv$1303 08-19-96 14:35:59 STATEMENT SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CASES FILED, DISPOSED OF AND REMAINING ON DOCKETS AT CONCLUSION OF OCTOBER TERMS, 1989, 1990 AND 1991 ORIGINAL PAID IN FORMA PAUPERIS TOTALS 1989 1990 1991 1989 1990 1991 1989 1990 1991 1989 1990 1991 Number of cases on dockets 11 365 365 379 437 528 552 814 904 942 TERMS 1989 1990 1991 Cases argued during term ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 146 125 127 Number disposed of by full opinions ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 143 121 120 Number disposed of by per curiam opinions ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 343 Number set for reargument --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 004 Cases granted review this term ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 123 141 120 Cases reviewed and decided without oral argument ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 79 109 75 Total cases to be available for argument at outset of following term --------------------------------------------------------- 57 70 66 June 28, 1992 1303505ind$$bv 07-16-96 17:00:54 PGT\u00b7INDBV (Bound Volume) INDEX ABORTIONS.
