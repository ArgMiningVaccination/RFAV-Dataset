Despite the great success in the field of vaccinology, there is a need to not only develop safe and ideal vaccines to fight deadly infections but also improve the quality of existing vaccines in terms of partial or inconsistent protection. Generally, subunit vaccines are known to be safe in nature, but they are mostly found to be incapable of generating the optimum immune response. Hence, there is a great possibility of improving the potential of a vaccine in formulation with novel adjuvants, which can effectively impart superior immunity. The vaccine(s) in formulation with novel adjuvants may also be helpful in fighting pathogens of high antigenic diversity. However, due to the limitations of safety and toxicity, very few human-compatible adjuvants have been approved. In this review, we mainly focus on the need for new and improved vaccines; the definition of and the need for adjuvants; the characteristics and mechanisms of human-compatible adjuvants; the current status of vaccine adjuvants, mucosal vaccine adjuvants, and adjuvants in clinical Gupta, Aggarwal, Rappuoli and Johri.
