These doctors said that many patients suffering from recurrent fever, and common cold despite taking antiviral and antibiotic medications are getting satisfactory results from ayurvedic recipes and homeopathic doses. Dr Sumeeta Jain, professor and head, department of community medicine in ayurveda, Government College of Ayurveda, said people must prefer the traditional healing methods over other pathy. \"Many patients, suffering from dry cough, persistent fever, and fatigue, are coming to us. Some of them haven't got relief despite completing their antibiotic course. 'Sanshamni vati' and 'saada sutshekar' tablets are giving excellent results in such patients. Once fever subsides, it is not recurring. I would say people must increase liquid intake. [Ginger](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ginger) and jaggery, 5 gram each, too are helpful in this phase. 'Gond ki raab' is a traditional recipe that has antioxidants and reduces dry cough,\" she said. Dr Gopal Bhutada, homeopathic professor, said, \"Viral flu epidemics go on round the year. Patients and their relatives know the instant, fast, safe, and harmless benefits of homoeopathy. \"You can see the happy faces of parents after a fluhit child recovers within a few hours under homoeopathic care. Basically, homoeopathy never targets the virus or bacteria unlike allopathy, but just raises the natural immunity to combat the acute illness. Homeopathy is the world's most preferred pathy for treatment of viral illnesses,\" he said. Dr Vivek Chandnani, a homeopath practicing in Kamptee, said he is treating both types of patients \u2014those who didn't get respite from allopathy as well as the regular ones. \"This adenovirus infection requires 7 to 10 days for recovery. Those not having robust immunity can have recurrent fever. \"We also had some patients who opted for other pathy as they become restless. Fear of Covid is also playing on their minds. When they are not recovering early, patients begin to fear that they are infected with Covid,\" he said. Dr Kiran Tawalare, assistant professor at an ayurveda college, said kada and churna tablets are in high demand. \"We are also holding camps for vaman (vomiting) - a karma of panchkarma - and virechana (purgation). These are helping people a lot. We have seen that those having routine asthma attacks and common cold during seasonal change benefit a lot from these,\" he said. "}
