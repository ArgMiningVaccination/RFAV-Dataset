Two of the most come models of health and healing are Western Medicine and Eastern Medicine. These two approaches are vastly This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. Prior to doing the readings and watching the in-class videos, my general stance on hallucinogens was that they should definitely be legally prohibited. My stance on this issue was formed out of my own perceptions on what I thought of them and not really based on any real reasonable information on the subject. However, after the readings and watching the videos I find myself more educated on the subject, I now find myself questioning my previous position. My understanding of what I thought of hallucinogens was based on highly subjective views, on being stereotypical, and like the Spanish, I viewed them as evil drugs in way. However, now that I've been exposed to the religious and exploratory side I find myself with mix feeling and on board with both views. I can no longer solely base my opinion knowing my viewpoints and facts that were misleading. Over the past 10 years, the pharmaceutical formulary for licensed Naturopathic Physicians has absolutely expanded. In many states where Naturopathic Physicians have licensure, they also have the ability to prescribe pharmaceutical drugs to help their patients. While the Physicians may not always choose to go with pharmaceuticals as a treatment choice, they have the option if that is what they and their patients think is best. The state that has experienced the most expansion has been Oregon, but each state has its own formulary which Naturopaths can work from. If I end up working in a licensure state, it will be important to have pharmaceuticals as an option to treat my patients. My main goal as a Naturopathic Physician is to help my patients Complementary therapies are treatments that make up a range of services provided by the NHS. Treatments that are available are acupuncture, aromatherapy, art therapy, chiropractic, herbal medicine and homeopathy. These treatments are offered to patients who may have cancer or other illnesses. These treatments are also used to help maintain one's health, improving the immune system, sleeping patterns, increasing energy levels and help to depose of toxins. Complementary therapies are not clinically tested but have been used for many years and also most therapists are self employed. Technology has helped with many aspects of our lives but healthcare is one that touches every single one of us at every corner of the world. There has been many advancements made to the way physicians treat patient and how they interact with one another. Technology has made it possible to share medical records with physicians all over the world. This has been archived by Electronic Medical Records. Google has made it possible to track out brakes and help physician prepare themselves for these kind of issues. Alternative health approaches to health care are analysed using a broad range of of research to get various concepts and understanding of the CAM therapies. In 1986 Aakster did a research on how CAM therapies varied fro the traditional biomedical treatments. In his conclusion he found three models that suited medical perspective as listed below; Most of us probably cannot recall a world without internet, cellphones, and laptops. Technology has transformed the world we live in today. Undoubtedly, technology has changed the way health care is delivered. Electronic prescribing allows prescribers to send prescriptions electronically and directly to the pharmacy. E-prescribing has been demonstrated to reduce prescribing errors in outpatient settings. Which Beatles song has the lyrics \"How could she say to me, love will find a way\"? Stress comes from overpressures in daily life, lack of sleep and emotional burdens. A Massage Therapist's use of healing touch affects not only the musculoskeletal structures, but also the nervous system, which in effect causes changes in the systemic reactions of the entire body. According to Marc White, the executive director of the Canadian Institute for the Relief of Pain and Disability, \"Research shows that massage therapy including remedial exercise can reduce pain, anxiety and stress, improve joint movement, sleep and ones quality of life.\" (https://www.rmtbc.ca/sites/default/files/files/ImprovingBCHealth_Dv(1).pdf). The sympathetic nervous system causes the body to react in a stressful or \"fight or flight\" response, slowing digestion and quickening the heart and respiratory rates. When the body remains in this state, as today's lifestyle often requires, the body becomes worn down and less able to recover. Receiving a massage can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, aiding to slow the heart rate, and increasing digestion and rest. This also initiates a more active immune system. Blood vessels dilate and circulate more red blood cells, bringing oxygen to tissues, and white blood cells, circulating immune response. Emotional stress can be stored inside muscle tissue and last for years. Massage Recently, due to an increasing trend in the use of natural products and services, Herbal Therapist demands have sky rocketed. Below are written the top 5 ways to become an herbal therapist. This week I focused my research on obstacles present, in our current healthcare system, which may inhibit the implementation of holistic care practices. Unfortunately, I believe in order to effectively incorporate holistic practices understanding of their importance, in caring for the whole individual, will require a new mind-set from the \"top down\" within medical facilities. If these practices are to flourish, and be utilized alongside traditional medical practices, education regarding their importance in gaining patient compliance and in their uses in augmenting treatment protocols must be stressed among practitioners and administrators. \"The approach is described as \"integrative\" when different art techniques are intentionally used in combination with traditional medicines to promote improved health.\" Today, the medical world recognizes two tips of medicine, the conventional medicine known as Western and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Although, they are by logic completely opposites in practice the have some similarities. The first one, is accepted in most of the advance countries. Though, the second one is having a lot of attention not just from de common people but from the biomedical system as part of their usual treatments. That is why the differences and similarities between Chiropractic as part of the CAM world and the Biomedical Model are getting smaller and closer together. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities.
