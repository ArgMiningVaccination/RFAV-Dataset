This therapy was originally developed by the late Dr. Tinus Smits of Holland. It uses a combination of classical homeopathy, homeopathic detox therapy, and nutritional supplements. She has studied CEASE Therapy with Kim Kalina and Homeopathic Detox Therapy with Ton Jansen of Holland. According to Dr. Smits, most children with autism are curable since their brains are not damaged, but blocked. Dr. Smits felt that autism resulted from an accumulation of different toxins and traumas in the body. Some of the causes contributing to autism may be due to the toxic chemical substances found in conventional medicines and vaccines. Vaccine ingredients include heavy metals and animal by-products toxic to the body. The United States vaccine schedule is the most aggressive in the world. By the age of eighteen years, a child will have received 69 doses of vaccines, according to the CDC schedule. Even OTC medicines, used repeatedly, may be toxic. All of these medicines have side effects and may impact the child negatively. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control's Autism Developmental Disabilities Monitoring reported that approximately 1 in 68 children in the United States has been identified with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the 1980s, autism prevalence was reported at 1 in 10,000. In the nineties, it was reported at 1 in 2500. ASD continues to be more prevalent among boys (1 in 42) than girls. It is clear that all the statistics point to an epidemic rise in autism. CEASE therapy uses homeopathic preparations of the same toxic substances found in vaccines and conventional medicines. When these remedies are given to an autistic child, the toxic effect of these medicines and vaccines can be reversed. The child is also supported with classical homeopathic remedies, which strengthen and support the child overall. One-third of her practice is devoted to children who are identified with ASD. "}
