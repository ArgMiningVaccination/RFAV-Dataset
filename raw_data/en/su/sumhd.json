It also provides a strong foundation for cutting-edge careers in a range of fields, from biotech and pharmaceuticals to laboratory and academic research. As biomedical science becomes more sophisticated, there is a growing demand for professionals who have a background in the biological sciences and experience in laboratory operations, clinical research and diagnostic testing. Our program prepares you for advanced study or career success through hands-on experience in our state-of-the-art labs, along with opportunities to be involved in research and projects across a range of health science fields that will help build your knowledge and resume. Graduates of the program are prepared to immediately join the workforce and pursue careers in the pharmaceutical industry or as clinical researchers for biotech companies, for example, or as analysts in hospital labs, among other settings. Students planning on medical school, a doctoral program or other advanced degree are well positioned through our program to showcase their ability to tackle complex study and sophisticated laboratory research. Depending on your professional goals, you'll have the option of choosing a thesis or non-thesis plan of study, both of which take one and a half to two years to complete. For students planning to continue their studies in medical school or another health-professional school, we offer pre-med and pre-health advising to help guide you toward the best course offerings, along with guidance and insights into the medical school or professional school application process. As the industry expands, so do the opportunities for our graduates. "}
