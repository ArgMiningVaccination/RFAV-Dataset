Plato was the first to relate their shape and energetic power to both the four elements of Earth, Water, Air and Fire and to the Spirit. Their crystal clarity astonishes us, and their regularity reminds us of ancient laws working in nature since the beginning of time. Crystals and stones will show us the Platonic Solids in most varying design. We shall approach their power and dynamics by modelling them in Clay. The Platonic Solids will come into being through our hands, allowing us to experience their forming forces within ourselves.
