This centuries-old medicine has a rich and interesting history, and many are discovering the oil's powerful benefits for hair, skin, and more. This extract comes from the castor bean, which grows on tall, beautifully red-leaved plant, Ricinus communis, that can reach up to 30 or 40 feet in tropical climates. The plant is native to India, and it's a relative to exotics like rubber trees and poinsettias. Castor Oil Throughout History Castor oil has been a staple item for at least 4,000 years. The ancient Egyptians (and many other cultures since that time) used it as lamp oil. In ancient Greece, it was used as a laxative, and Pliny the Elder said it was \"a strong purgative.\" People during the Middle Ages found even more uses for this oil, using it to treat skin conditions like rashes, ringworm, and warts. Interestingly, while the beans are filled with rich medicinal oil, their skins contain a deadly toxin that can be used to make ricin (Breaking Bad fans may remember this). In fact, castor beans are known as one of the most toxic seeds in the world and they're restricted by law in many areas, and critical processing steps are in a place where the oil is manufactured. Modern Uses For a while, medicinal castor oil faded from the public's attention. These days, most people don't use it internally because of its very strong laxative effect, and there are many better, safer over-the-counter alternatives.
