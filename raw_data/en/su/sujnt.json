Add this experience to a Reiki or Reflexology Session. What is it? Aroma Acupoint Therapy system was developed by Chinese medical doctors and remains a widely practiced modality for healing. A combination of aromatherapy and Chinese medicine, the approach taps into the power of essential oils to complement an AcuPoint treatment. The placement of the oils is guided by the AcuPoints, or body zones, which brings about a wide range of potential shifts in the body, mind and spirit. Essential oils are carefully selected to correspond with specific actions associated with the AcuPoints to maximize the healing benefits of the treatment. The power of the medicinal plants found in these healing oils include the effects of their fragrance. The basic framework for the use of oils in Aroma Acupoint Therapy is an empirical model of the energetic properties of the essential oils based on their aromatic or fragrance qualities. The oils are broadly divided into high, middle and base tones, corresponding to their rising, circulating and sinking energetic movements, respectively. Within these lie the specific categories of their aroma qualities, such as Pungent-Fresh, Pungent-Spicy, Green-Sweet, and so on. Every aroma category has specific energetic and functional properties. For example, Fresh-Pungent oils are generally stimulating, energizing, uplifting, awakening and warming. They are used in weak, cold and damp conditions with their typical symptoms of fatigue, cold extremities, etc. Within an oil's group function then lies its own separate functions, which span specific physiological actions, psychological functions through to spiritual functions. Any of these may be engaged during treatment.
